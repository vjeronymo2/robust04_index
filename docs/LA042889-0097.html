			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHAKING YOUR FAMILY TREE!: TRACING RECORDS OF ORPHANED ANCESTOR  </P> <P> Question: My ancestor was born after the death of his father in 1813 in  Pennsylvania. His mother died when he was 10 days old and he was reared by a  paternal aunt. If his parents did not own any property, would he have had a  guardian named, or could just anyone have taken him to raise without creating  any records?  </P> <P> Answer: If his parents owned real property, there would have been a guardian  appointed for your ancestor. However, you probably will find some court records  about a guardian for your ancestor, even if his parents were poor. Consult  county records pertaining to probate and Orphans' Court that may contain a  great deal of information. Never assume anything in genealogy: Check the  records.  </P> <P> Q: Where can I write to obtain the passenger lists of those arriving by ship  from Oslo, Norway, to New York from 1906 to 1909?  </P> <P> A: There were about two ships per month arriving in New York from Scandinavian  ports during this four-year period. Fortunately for you, the New York passenger  lists are indexed from 1897 to 1943 and the National Archives will check these  indexes for you.  </P> <P> Write to National Archives, 8th and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.  20408 and request several copies of NATF Form 81 (if you are researching more  than one family who came during this time, you will need separate forms for  each person). When these forms arrive, fill them out and return as instructed.  You need the full name of the passenger, port of entry and approximate date of  arrival.  </P> <P> After your order is searched, photocopies will be made of records that relate  to your request and National Archives will inform you of the cost to obtain  these copies -- normally less than $5.  </P> <P> Q: Does the term heirs at law always mean the wife and children, and would this  have applied in Warren County, Ky., in 1809?  </P> <P> A: Heirs at law simply means the persons who inherit or have a right of  inheritance in the real property of one who has died without leaving a valid  will. However, while the term generally refers to cases of intestacy, it is  frequently used in a popular sense to designate any successor to property  either by will or by law.  </P> <P> The term does not necessarily mean the wife and children, although in most  cases this would be true. In the example you sent from a book of abstracts of  deeds, you will note that all the "heirs at law" have the same surname and that  Elizabeth Key is designated as the widow of Simon Key. However, the interesting  one is Elizabeth Hinton Key. Is she a Key by marriage or by blood? Possibly,  Hinton is her middle name and was a way to distinguish her from her mother,  Elizabeth. But in genealogy we cannot guess, we must try to prove each  connection.  </P> <P> Since your source is secondary, obtain copies of the actual deeds and read it  for yourself. Fortunately Warren County, Ky., has numerous records dating back  to 1796.  </P></p>

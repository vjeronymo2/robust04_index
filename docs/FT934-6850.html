			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Arts: Terence Trent D'Arby - Pop Pop history is littered with the corpses of talented artists who promised much with their first albums only to falter when asked to repeat the trick. The unspoken question dogging Terence Trent D'Arby's current tour is whether the American singer has managed to recapture the touch which made his 1987 debut, The Hardline according to Terence Trent D'Arby, an award winning million seller. On the evidence at the Brixton Academy the jury is still out. Although he has matured as a songwriter, the quality of the material remains uneven. His best new songs are slow and reflective, and his current single, 'Let me down easy', is as nice a piece of piano balladry as the charts have seen all year. In performance D'Arby saves this gem for the encore, seated, solo and centre stage, at the key boards, yet elsewhere his image as a soft and sensitive artist is undermined by an arrogant and self-important personality. He passed most of the early part of the evening draped in a shiny cloak, dramatically peeled away to reveal white Lycra tights and a naked torso studded with pectorals worthy of Chris Eubank. Like Eubank, D'Arby shares a weakness to project himself as 'simply the best'. He seemed unwilling to endear himself to the audience, staying tight lipped between songs and disdainful of the need to please. To make things tougher for himself his new up tempo numbers sounded surprisingly limp, and owing much to rival Lenny Kravitz, who has exploited the black pop rock market which 'Hardline' helped to open up. Incidentally, the tribe of pop sociologists might like to speculate why D'Arby, like Kravitz, appeals mainly to a white audience. Brixton was attracting an away crowd on Friday. It is too soon to say whether D'Arby has secured his reputation on this trip. He still has to decide whether to continue to play out his unconvincing stereotype as the street punk, or settle instead for the more restful role of the serious singer songwriter.</p>

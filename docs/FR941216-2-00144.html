The license provides, among other things, that the facility is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) now or hereafter in effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The facility consists of a pressurized water reactor located on TVA's Sequoyah site in Soddy Daisy, Hamilton County, Tennessee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> II <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III.D.3 of Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50 requires that Type C local leak rate tests (LLRTs) be performed during reactor shutdown for refueling, or other convenient intervals, but in no case at intervals greater than 2 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On March 2, 1993, SQN Unit 1 entered a forced outage and started the Cycle 6 refueling outage. All Type B and Type C LLRTs were preformed during the outage, which ended in December 1993. The unit returned to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  service on April 20, 1994. Due to the length of the outage, a number of LLRTs that were performed early in the outage were reperformed prior to conducting the containment integrated leak rate test (CILRT) in December 1993. LLRTs of values that were initially tested between April 3 and July 19, 1993, however, were not retested because of schedule restraints associated with the CILRT. Since the 2-year time interval for the Type C value pentrations that were not retested will expire starting in April 1995, Unit 1 would be forced to shut down at that time to perform the tests unless a schedular exemption is granted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The next Unit 1 refueling outage is scheduled to start in September 1995. Therefore, the licensee has proposed an exemption to allow a one-time deferment of the Appendix J interval requirement for the affected Type C valve penetration tests from April 3, 1995, until October 1, 1995, a total of approximately 181 days for the first valve tested during the Cycle 6 outage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The extension would affect 126 isolation valves of 242 valves in the leak rate test program and are listed in the submittal. They are considered by the licensee to be leak tight and in good condition, which was verified by the leak rate tests performed during the Cycle 5 refueling outage. Based on the present total integrated containment leak rate that accounts for less than 93 percent of the 0.75 La limit, the licensee believes that the remaining margin is sufficient to ensure that any incremental increase in leakage because of the extension, will not result in unacceptable as-found test results. Also, based on historical data, the licensee believes that any incremental increase in leakage from these valves because of the extension would be small. In addition, the valves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  were included in the boundary for the Last Type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A test that was performed in December 1993, and have been subjected to improved maintenance practices that provide increased assurance that they will be capable of performing their intended safety function.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, the Commission may, upon application by any interested person or upon its own initiative, grant exemptions from the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50 when (1) the exemptions are authorized by law, will not present an undue risk to public health or safety, and are consistent with the common defense and security; and (2) when special circumstances are present. Special circumstances are present whenever, according to 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), ``Application of the regulation in the particular circumstances would not serve the underlying purpose of the rule or is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule.&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The underlying purpose of the requirement to perform Type C containment leak rate tests at intervals not to exceed 2 years, is to ensure that any potential leakage pathways through the containment boundary are identified within a time span that prevents significant degradation from continuing or being unknown, and long enough to allow the tests to be conducted during scheduled refueling outages. This interval was originally published in Appendix J when refueling cycles were conducted at approximately annual intervals and has not been changed to reflect 18-month or 2-year operating cycles. It is not the intent of the regulation to require a plant shutdown solely for the purpose of conducting the periodic leak rate tests. Based on historical data at SQN, any incremental increase in leakage because of the extension would be small. Improved maintenance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  practices implemented during the Unit 1 Cycle 5 outage, and continued in the Unit 1 Cycle 6 outage, provide increased assurance that these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components will perform their safety function. Therefore, since the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum extension is relatively short (approximately 181 days for the first valve tested during the Cycle 6 outage) compared to the 2-year test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interval requirement, it is unlikely that substantial degradation of the valves leading to the failure of the containment to perform its safety function would occur. As a result, the application of the regulation in the particular circumstances is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

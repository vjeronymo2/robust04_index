			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Dollar support credited for intraday recovery CONCERTED support for the dollar was one reason why bourses recorded an intraday recovery yesterday, but not all dealers were convinced by this argument, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT closed at new 1992 lows but well above its worst, the DAX index ending 17.95, or 1.1 per cent lower after a drop of 14.02, or 2.2 per cent to 614.07 in the FAZ at midsession. Turnover rose from DM4.2bn to DM6.1bn. Ms Barbara Altmann at B Metzler in Frankfurt attributed the turnround to a little foreign buying as the DAX approached its support level of 1,550 - its intraday low was 1,551.39 - and some subsequent short covering. The market gave its worst treatment to retailers and construction groups which, until recently, still seemed to have stories to tell in higher consumption prospects, and the rebuilding of east Germany. Yesterday Karstadt and Bilfinger &amp; Berger, both high quality stocks, led their sectors down with falls of DM18 to DM579.50, and DM33 to DM837. Both are now approaching their lows for the year. PARIS fell for the fourth consecutive day as the CAC 40 index gave up 17.42 to 1,737.80 in turnover of some FFr1.38bn. Alcatel Alsthom was the most active stock and fell in line with the market to close down FFr8 at FFr622. The computer services group, Cap Gemini, was affected by a revision of an analyst's 1992 EPS forecast, falling FFr14.30 or 6.8 per cent to FFr194.00. Moulinex was also hit by a downgrade and closed FFr4 lower at FFr120. A 5 per cent rise in first half turnover at Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez helped it close unchanged at FFr493.30. However, a 20 per cent increase in turnover did not help the insurer, UAP, down FFr11.20 at FFr388.50. MILAN reported very thin trade as the Comit index fell 5.27 to 401.49. Fiat closed 1.6 per cent lower at L4,310 and fell to L4,225 after hours. On the screen market, the telecoms company Sip was the most heavily traded stock, and closed unchanged at L1,145. At the other end of the spectrum, Mr Carlo De Benedetti's industrial holding company, Cir, fell L83 to L1,250 ZURICH extended its showing of relative strength, the SMI index posting a rise of 0.3 to 1,800.3. Interest focused on selected chemicals in low overall volume, Roche certificates topping the active list as they rose SFr50 to SFr3,430. AMSTERDAM was depressed by a batch of gloomy results which dissipated any relief in satisfactory half year figures from Polygram. The music and film group was one of the few stocks to buck the trend, closing up Fl 1.00 at Fl 45.50 while the CBS Tendency index closed down 1.0 at 113.0. Hoogovens fell 60 cents to Fl 38.30 on disappointing results while KLM lost 50 cents to Fl 30.10 on losses at Northwest Airlines; DAF continued to weaken, down Fl 1.20 at Fl 17.50. Fokker eased Fl 1.10 to Fl 22.60, reporting worse-than-expected interim profits after the close. BRUSSELS suffered from a further setback in Petrofina which closed down BFr320, or 3.1 per cent at BFr9,930. Some analysts said that the oil group remains depressed after last week's disappointing first half results. The Bel-20 index lost 10.66 to 1,114.76. MADRID's general index fell 4.29 to 209.57 in low turnover of Pta7bn. Banks were weak with Santander losing Pta110 to Pta3,340. VIENNA reacted to declines elsewhere on the continent and fell to another all time low. The ATX index closed down 16.28 at 683.45. ISTANBUL rose on pleasing first half results. The 75-share index advanced 72.73 or 1.85 per cent to 4,012.51.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - AUG 11  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Hourly changes   Open     10.30am  11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close  1047.60  1044.60  1040.76  1041.82  1042.94  1046.56  1046.88  1044.92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------        Day's High  1047.63           Day's Low  1040.76  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   Aug 10        Aug 7        Aug 6        Aug 5        Aug 4  1049.68       1067.01      1078.71      1081.21      1076.44  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

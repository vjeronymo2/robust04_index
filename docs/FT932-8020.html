			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts strengthen after a stream of favourable data A confluence of favourable factors drove up the UK government bond market, with gilts in the next auction area performing particularly strongly. The welcome given to Tuesday's Bank of England announcement on the Pounds 3bn auction carried over into yesterday morning's trade. Then weak retail sales figures for April, a monthly PSBR total at the low end of expectations and the strengthening pound all fuelled further advances. More bullish factors for the market are expected in today's labour market data - a resumed rise in unemployment is forecast - and in tomorrow's release of the retail prices index. The consensus forecasts on the RPI are for an historically low 'headline' rate of 1.5 per cent and just over 3 per cent for underlying annual growth. This chimes with sanguine comments on inflation in the Bank of England's quarterly survey. Gilts responded with a half-point rise at the longer end, notably the 8 1/2 per cent due 2007. The 'when issued' price of the auction stock - 7 3/4 per cent due 2006  - gained just over  3/8 of a point to close at 30 3/16 partly paid (95 3/16 all in). BY contrast, it was a bad day for the German government bond market. The Yes vote in the Danish referendum set the background for further weakening of Germany's safe-haven image and continued outflows of cash to the high yielders. However, the body blow to bunds came with the April M3 money supply figures, which leapt 7.3 per cent - well beyond expectations and the Bundesbank's 6.5 per cent target ceiling. After this shock, a little comfort was drawn from the central bank's decision not to lower either of its key interest rates. This was seen as giving some support for the sagging D-Mark. Another problem was the string of recent issues in the 10-year area. The latest, this week's ERP, was reported to be difficult to sell. One economist commented that investors were waiting for the yield on 10-year stock to rise to 7 per cent. NOT surprisingly, one of the main beneficiaries of bund weakness was Denmark, where there was also a 1 point cut in the discount and repo rates to 8.25 per cent and 8.75 per cent respectively. The uplift in government bonds saw the yield spread of Danish 10-year bonds over bunds fall to 61 basis points. It has come down from 85 basis points little more than a fortnight ago. The Italian market made further gains, still buoyed by news of rapid withholding tax rebates and budget deficit cuts. With the yield spread over bunds still higher than at the time of the Danish No vote last June, further gains were seen as a possibility. US Treasury prices rallied strongly at the long end of the market yesterday In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  17/32 at 101 7/8 , yielding 6.971 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was up  3/32 at 99 25/32 , to yield 3.975 per cent. After two days of yields holding steady at the short end but rising significantly at the long end, the strong performance of the long bond yesterday reversed the steepening in the yield curve. Initially, prices at the long end eased slightly, primarily in reaction to an unexpected jump in imports revealed in the March merchandise trade report. The rise in imports raised fears that domestic demand might be rising sharply although analysts later attributed much of the rise to stronger demand for petroleum products. Later in the day, a sudden drop in gold prices cheered bond investors, as did the absence of any sign from the Federal Reserve of a shift in the emphasis of monetary policy. AFTER Tuesday's torrid selling of Japanese government bonds, the market had a much calmer day. However, buyers continued to sit on their hands in Tokyo trading, leaving the September futures contract to weaken to 106.08 from 106.24 and giving little support to the No 145 10-year cash benchmark, which closed at 4.665 per cent. In London trading there was some recovery as the yen strengthened against the dollar.</p>

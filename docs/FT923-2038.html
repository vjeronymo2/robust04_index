			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Treaty 'could help combat crime' EC interior and justice ministers yesterday emphasised that the Maastricht Treaty could help them beat organised crime in Europe and agreed to step up joint efforts to tackle international criminal organisations such as the Mafia, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. Interior ministers also agreed to meet again - possibly before their scheduled November meeting - to discuss the problem of refugees from the former Yugoslav republics, as soon as officials have completed studies of possible solutions. The public relations value of yesterday's meeting was seized on by the French government delegation, two days ahead of the French vote on the Maastricht accord. Fears that organised crime might spread across open EC borders has been played up by French opponents of Maastricht, but in an EC presidency statement after the meeting, ministers welcomed the impulse that the Maastricht Treaty would give to closer co-operation on police and judicial matters. Security at the Brussels headquarters of the council of ministers was tightened up for the meeting, which was held at the request of Italian and French justice ministers following the assassinations of anti-Mafia judges Mr Giovanni Falcone and Mr Paolo Borsellino in Sicily. The Italian delegation included Mrs Liliana Ferraro, Mr Falcone's successor as director of penal affairs at the Ministry of Justice and a possible Mafia target. Mr Kenneth Clarke, Britain's home secretary and chairman of the meeting, conceded afterwards that intergovernmental action on immigration and police issues would continue even if the Maastricht Treaty was rejected.</p>

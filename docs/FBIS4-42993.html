			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Major Loses Hold of Middle Ground"] </F>   [Text] This is the week when Conservative Party woes will  again take centre stage. John Smith's death briefly shifted  attention away from the Government's unpopularity. But that  tragedy has now ceased to be a distraction. John Major awaits a  defeat at the polls on Thursday at least as bad as, and probably  worse than, the local election debacle a month ago.    The Prime Minister may be confident that, having weathered  that result, he will also survive humiliation in the European  elections. He can take credit for the public unity his party has  recently strained to demonstrate. The Tory party has proved  that it can sing from the same hymn sheet when the need is  desperate. Mr Major may also feel less threatened by Michael  Heseltine, his most menacing potential usurper. His  challenger's history of coronary heart disease has become a  political liability.    Yet these comforts are small beside the problems faced by  the  Conservatives. The odds on their retaining control of 10  Downing Street have lengthened considerably even since the local  elections. In the process of holding his party together, Mr  Major has adopted an increasingly right-wing agenda and left the  middle ground of politics vulnerable to take-over by other  parties.    Mr Smith had begun to attract more centrist voters. Tony  Blair, his likely successor, is proving even more seductive.  His speech in Eastleigh last week declared Labour "the party of  one nation." It was designed unashamedly to lure those Tories  who long for a revival of values associated with Disraeli,  Macleod and Heath.    If Mr Major is not alarmed by Mr Blair, then he should be by  his own failure to regain some of the political high ground as  the economy slowly improves. The Tories have felt quietly  confident that a return to prosperity would reverse the opinion  polls by the time of the next election. Yet a study published  last week by the analysts Kleinwort Benson tells a different  story. Using econometric models, it finds that the pound's  withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday  in September 1992 cost the Government 16 points in popular  support which it has failed to regain.    "Despite the recession, before September 1992, the  Conservatives had a clear lead over Labour," the study finds.  "But after Black Wednesday the two parties swapped places; ever  since then Labour have been as much ahead of the Conservatives  as they were previously behind." In other words, the sterling  crisis triggered a political collapse that has proved far more  difficult to repair than was ever expected at the time.    Mr Major faces a heavy responsibility: to hold his party  together, while reclaiming the affections of ordinary,  middle-of- the-road voters who trusted his common sense style in  1992. Before Tory critics bay for his blood again when the  election results are announced they should be aware how enormous  that task is. They would be wise to avoid making their leader's  life any harder than it is already bound to be.</p>

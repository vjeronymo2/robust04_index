			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Bat men master sales drive - Club cricket starts today. Clive Fewins visits a company that supplies the 'thwack' The sound of nearly 300 summers is upon us. Today will bring the traditional thwack of leather against willow on 1,000 cricket grounds and village greens up and down the country. Britain's amateur cricketers are about to start their season and, judging from the sales figures at one of Britain's 10 or so small batmakers a high proportion is buying new bats. 'There seems to be an definite upturn. We have sold 40 per cent more bats than at this time last year,' said Tony Byers, of Newbery Cricket Bats of Robertsbridge. 'The factory is nearly empty; all the bats are in the shops, which is exactly the way it should be at this time of year.' Byers describes himself as the 'general factotum' of the company, which employs three full-timers and three part-timers in a cramped but rambling 1,200 sq ft first floor workshop in a former flour mill in East Sussex. Byers, 29, came to the company four years ago, straight from graduating at Leicester University, where he captained the cricket first eleven. He arrived at a two-man enterprise in a town famous for its hand-made bats. The Newbery workshop is dwarfed by the neighbouring buildings of Gray-Nicholls, one of the UK's largest batmakers. In 1990, Newbery batmakers Tim Keeley and Kevin Woodgate were turning out 1,900 bats a year and just breaking even. But they had lost their mentor, ex-Sussex cricketer and doyen of batmakers, John Newbery, who died of cancer at 52. Keeley and Woodgate decided to carry on in the old wooden building, but they had no business plan and no marketing. Most of the sales were by word of mouth, to passers-by and in large contract batches at low prices to sports sales companies who added their own labels and a large mark-up. They were skilled batmakers, but not salesmen. To survive they had to sell to a cricketing world that was rapidly embracing commercial razzmatazz and corporate sponsorship. The first thing Byers did was to set up a limited company, with accountant Mike Norman, the executor of Newbery's estate, as a director. Woodgate, a family man, continued to draw a salary, but Byers and Keeley decided to defer the majority of their salaries, paying it instead into a loan account to help the company grow. They negotiated a Pounds 15,000 overdraft with the National Westminster bank, and formulated a marketing strategy, with a strong emphasis on a new corporate style, with the company name emblazoned on its first own-brand bats. Byers travelled to India where he negotiated terms for Indian-made pads, batting gloves and protection equipment, which the company now sells to shops alongside Newbery bats. Then Byers began touring sports shops across the UK in his capacity as salesman. He is also company book-keeper, credit controller, marketing supremo, receptionist, typist and office boy. Keeley, 34, and Woodgate, 38, worked long hours to increase production and Keeley continued selecting the timber from bat willow specialists, controlling an annual expenditure of about Pounds 50,000. The policy seems to be working. Six months through the company's accounting year they have sold 1,700 out of a target of 3,500 bats, 200 remain unsold in stock. 'If we sell 3,500 we stand to make a net profit of around Pounds 15,000. Not brilliant, but we have put a lot of money into updating the company, and on new developments such as our new multi-balance bat handle,' said Byers. At busy times Keeley and Woodgate are helped by Keeley's brother, Nick. The other two part-timers work mainly on repairs and the checking and packing of protective equipment, which accounts for 15 per cent of this year's expected Pounds 230,000 to Pounds 250,000 turnover. Keeley and Woodgate concentrate on the skill of hand-shaping and balancing the blades; the sprung handles are bought in. The pair learnt their skill from John Newbery. Both worked under him at Gray Nicholls before he left in 1981 to form his own company. They stayed with him and watched his enterprise, at Northiam, 10 miles from Robertsbridge, go into liquidation. By the time the company reformed in the present building in 1986, Keeley and Woodgate were highly experienced batmakers. Many top professionals now use the company's bats. 'I can't say which, if any, of the England team that has just played in the West Indies, use our bats because of commercial agreements,' Byers said. 'However we have several international cricketers among our private clients.' (It is not unknown for cricketers to accept a sponsorship deal from a company whose bats they do not use and stick the sponsor's logo over the existing brand name.) 'We also have a policy of sponsoring a dozen professionals who use our equipment. It costs us about Pounds 350 to support a player for a season in this way. This represents a fair slice of our profits, but they are a delightful bunch and we think it well worthwhile.' Among the 12 are Kent captain and former England opening bat Mark Benson and Sussex opener Neil Lenham. Lenham's association with Newbery also spawned one of two new developments, a built-in shatterproof nylon handshield. 'Neil had broken his right index finger so many times that between us we managed to design and produce this hand guard,' Byers said. 'Development costs plus a little advertising cost us about Pounds 4,000. Hand guards are not permitted in the first class game and the project is sleeping at present but it opened an awful lot of doors.' If the three achieve a net profit of Pounds 15,000 at the end of this year they will be well satisfied. 'We are on target and we have just negotiated a Pounds 50,000 five-year loan at 2 1/2 per cent above base rate under the government's small business loan guarantee scheme that will replace our overdraft and help to smooth out seasonal variations and build up stocks,' Byers said. 'We have also just won a Pounds 30,000 contract to supply bats to a wholesaler in South Africa. Who knows, we might even be able to pay ourselves back some of the money we have lent to the company.'

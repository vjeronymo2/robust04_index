			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Portuguese bugging row grows The discovery of a hidden microphone in the Portuguese attorney general's office and allegations that other leading officials are subject to electronic surveillance are producing a climate of intense suspicion in the country, with parliamentary deputies, political parties, trade unions and other bodies calling for police to search their premises for bugging devices. Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the prime minister, has ordered an investigation to find out who placed the miniature microphone under floorboards directly beneath the chair of attorney general Jose Cunha Rodrigues. Suspicion fell on the government intelligence service, SIS, after Mr Joao Maria Marques de Freitas, attorney general on the Portuguese island of Madeira, accused SIS agents of placing an electronic bug in his office. Press reports that the telephones of at least five cabinet ministers were also being tapped has led to suggestions that commercial espionage might be involved. Some of the ministers have been engaged in the adjudication of important government contracts.</p>

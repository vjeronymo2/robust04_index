			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: Competition's cold draught - Anheuser-Busch's defection looks set to shake up Japan's beer market JAPAN'S brewers are starting to be hit by the cold draught of competition. A number of shifts are taking place in the beer market, none of which look likely to favour the big four domestic producers. Poor weather, along with the economic downturn, was blamed for a 1.1 per cent fall in volume shipments for the first six months of this year, and the summer is forecast to be short. Price discounting by larger retailers is taking hold, and may force down margins. Hefty marketing outlays are required to woo increasingly fickle consumer tastes. After a capital spending binge, the brewers' international credit standing is being questioned. On top of that, there is Budweiser, America's biggest-selling beer. Anheuser-Busch has sold its beer in Japan for more than a decade, and has brewed and bottled it under licence since 1984 in an arrangement with Suntory, a privately-owned spirits distiller which is also the smallest of the four brewers. The US giant is now defecting to Kirin, Japan's biggest brewer, leaving Suntory as the first casualty of the changing trading climate. Sales of Budweiser, although only some 1.2 per cent of the overall market, account for the vast majority of foreign beer sales in Japan and nearly one-sixth of Suntory's 7.4 per cent share. Most industry watchers, however, see the benefits as more apparent for the US partner. It will have 90 per cent of the venture, called Budweiser Japan, with the remainder held by Kirin, whose earlier expectations of a 49 per cent stake were scuppered by the Fair Trade Commission, Japan's monopolies watchdog. Kirin officials spoke this week of 'both material and less tangible merits' from an association with the world leader. But in spite of slow demand and a new plant which came on stream in May, they say their company does not need Budweiser to mop up excess capacity. They acknowledge that Budweiser is a potential rival to Kirin. The relationship, contracted to last 10 years, will give Busch access to Kirin's bigger and more cohesive distribution network - for the most part, its wholesalers deal exclusively in products sanctioned by Kirin. At the same time, Budweiser Japan will apparently be free to use other channels. Busch says it is not ready to discuss strategy. But it is believed to be seeking a significantly larger share of the Japanese market - figures of 5 per cent or even 10 per cent are being suggested. Kirin says: 'We don't know how much Budweiser we are to produce.' In order to attain that sort of penetration, Busch is thought to be prepared to price Budweiser very aggressively. Its strong majority position in the joint venture will mean that it can do as it wishes. Either the market share of Kirin's own brands - which has already fallen from 60 per cent to below 50 per cent over the past five years - or its profitability, as it adjusts pricing to match, may be another casualty of the Busch push. Moody's Japan, in a report on the industry, argues that the US beer giant's different cost structure from the domestic companies means that they 'may find it difficult to predict Anheuser-Busch's pricing strategy in Japan'. Pricing structures and the distribution system for beer in Japan are both under pressure. According to Moody's, the ability of Kirin, Asahi, Sapporo and Suntory to co-ordinate price increases is on the wane. Regulatory scrutiny may be tightened, the credit rating agency says, but changes to the liquor tax law have already allowed in supermarkets and other store chains, which have greater muscle to demand discounts. The brewers' networks have traditionally supplied small family-run outlets, and commonly undertake home delivery. The recent arrivals, by one estimate, now account for more than 10 per cent of all beer sales. Also, they offer a wide variety, 'resulting in increased opportunities to switch brands'. Moody's urges the development of a broad portfolio of brands - rather than reliance on a single flagship label which may go out of fashion - in order to adjust to a maturing market which is also opening up. At the same time, it warns that the aggressive capital outlays of recent years have weakened their financial strength and says their credit quality will remain under pressure. Anheuser-Busch has put Y8.1bn (Dollars 76.4m) into the Kirin venture and, with its financial muscle, come September it could force the domestic brewers to put their past cosy relationship on ice.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 11 SAPA -- Seven prominent  international mediators are due to arrive in South Africa on  Tuesday [12 April] and mediation between the Inkatha Freedom  Party [IFP] and the African National Congress will begin on  Wednesday, according to the Consultative Business Movement [CBM].    In a statement on Monday, the CBM said all outstanding  matters regarding international mediation had been successfully  resolved at an IFP/ANC joint working group meeting on Sunday.  "It is possible therefore now to announce and confirm that  seven prominent... international mediators will arrive in South  Africa tomorrow Tuesday 12 April to mediate between the African  National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party on outstanding  constitutional matters," it said.    The venue for the mediation was not disclosed. The  mediation team is:     -  Mr Justice H. K. Bhagwati, India;    -  Lord David Carrington, United Kingdom;    -  Mr Justice A. Leon Higginbotham, United States of America;    -  Prof Paul Kevenhorster, Germany;    -  Dr Henry Kissinger, U.S.;    -  Mr Justice Antonio la Pergola, Italy; and,    -  Prof Jean Antonie Laponce, Canada.       Three special advisors to the mediators and two  constitutional advisors to both parties will also be present,  said the CBM, which has been appointed secretariat to the  mediation.    Some analysts have said that before the mediation gets to  "outstanding constitutional matters" the mediation will first  have to address the deadlock between the two parties on the  election date. The ANC has said the April 27 deadline is  "sacrosanct"; the IFP has said constitutional compromises mean  little if it has no time to prepare itself for an election  focused on those compromises.</p>

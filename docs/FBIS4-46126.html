			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin with </F> domestic correspondents at the Dan Hotel in Tel Aviv -- live]    [Excerpts] Rabin: [passage omitted] Last night,  the IDF carried out an operation -- an operation which the IDF,  the State of Israel, and lovers of freedom and the fight against  terror can be proud of. The operation was unanimously approved  by all the members of the inner cabinet in a meeting on 19 May.  Its purpose was to bring here the man who today heads a  terrorist organization operating against us in the security zone  -- the Believers Resistance -- and who held Ron Arad for at  least two years and who, I hope, will definitely be able to give  us information about the period during which he held him and  perhaps about his condition later on.    The operation was conducted on the basis of our  responsibility for the MIA's and the POW's. This time, the  reasons I had for submitting my recommendation to the inner  cabinet were not the same as those I had at the time when I  recommended to the inner cabinet to bring Shaykh 'Ubayd to  Israel. At that time, I had hoped that Shaykh 'Ubayd would  serve as a bargaining chip in the negotiations. I no longer have  any illusions that anybody can be used as a bargaining chip in  the negotiations -- certainly not Mustafa al- Dirani. Our goal  was to further exhaust the chances of obtaining information  about what happened in the past and the current fate of Ron  Arad. This operation was also part of our fight against  Lebanese terrorism directed at the security zone. [passage  omitted]    Israel Television Channel 1's political correspondent  Gadi Sukenik: Mr. Rabin, with all due respect to those who  executed the operation, of course, could not such an operation  have been carried out during the seven years that Ron Arad has  been in captivity and to this day in order to extract  information from people such as al-Dirani? To this day, is  there any certainty that Ron Arad is alive?    Rabin: [passage omitted] This operation could have  been carried out a few months ago, but it was put off because of  intelligence considerations and chances of obtaining  information. It was designed to be carried out in a specific  area -- in that area where the operation took place. Therefore,  the timing chosen was the first possible time after another  channel and hope of obtaining information through other means  were blocked.    Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television's Dov Gilhar:  Mr. Rabin, what is the next stage? Assuming that Mustafa  al-Dirani confirms that he handed Ron Arad over to the Iranians,  is it now a question of international pressure on Tehran? What  are the next moves?    Rabin: At the moment, I do not want to say what  we will find out in the course of his interrogation.  Furthermore, I should say that the unit, which carried out the  operation admirably -- I would like to congratulate the chief of  staff, the General Staff, the chief of intelligence, the Air  Force commander, and particularly the soldiers who carried out  the mission and the pilots who flew them -- also brought with it  a considerable amount of written material which will certainly  throw light on some points. When I presented my recommendation  to the inner cabinet two days ago and asked it to approve the  operation, I said that we must exhaust any lead and any way that  will offer us more information. I cannot assure you that we  will get conclusive information about the whereabouts and  condition of Ron Arad today. I can assure you that such  operations will also be carried out in the future, if they are  necessary and if possible, because we bear responsibility for  all the MIA's and POW's whose fate has not yet been conclusively  determined by Israel and the IDF.

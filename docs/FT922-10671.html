			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Business Law: Long arm of US antitrust law On April 3, the US Justice Department issued the following policy statement on the extension of US antitrust enforcement policy to non-US markets: "The Department of Justice will, in appropriate cases, take antitrust enforcement action against conduct occurring overseas that restrains US exports, whether or not there is direct harm to US consumers, where it is clear that: 1) the conduct has a direct, substantial and reasonably foreseeable effect on exports of goods or services from the US; (2) the conduct involves anti-competitive activities which violate the US antitrust laws - in most cases, group boycotts, collusive pricing and other exclusionary activities; and (3) US courts have jurisdiction over foreign persons or corporations engaged in such conduct. This policy statement in no way affects existing laws or established principles of personal jurisdiction.' This statement was not innovative. It merely revoked a decision, expressed in a footnote to a 1988 policy statement, to reserve such action for cases where US consumers were harmed. The decision is nevertheless disheartening. World trade is in a delicate state, poised between free trade and managed trade between blocs: it is not a good time to make assertive noises. Nor is the move likely to be to the taste of other governments which take a more modest view of their right to interfere in business conduct beyond national frontiers. On the positive side, the US policy signalled that it will be confined to cases of deliberate and obvious anti-competitive conduct: the examples given are among those which US law treats as anti-competitive as such ('per se'), and it is made clear that the words 'other exclusionary activities' will be taken to mean only those of a similar type (for example, market-sharing and bid-rigging). The enigmatic statement about 'personal jurisdiction' also provides some comfort to foreign companies. It dispels an early anxiety that companies with a US subsidiary would be subject to US jurisdiction for that reason alone, or that the US subsidiary would be answerable for its foreign parent's conduct abroad. The Justice Department will stick to the normal rules, though these are not altogether comforting. The responsibility of a US subsidiary for its parent's behaviour will depend on how independent the subsidiary is. Foreign parent companies would be wise to secure as much autonomy for their subsidiaries as is commercially feasible. The courts' treatment of a foreign subsidiary virtually as an arm of the US parent, for example, in obeying a US political boycott, is not promising. For the purposes of US domestic liability, the mere import of a foreign company's products into the US is not regarded as enough to establish jurisdiction over the foreign producer. But the level of contact with the US market needed to bring a foreign company within the US courts' jurisdiction can seem minimal, according to Mr Mark Cymrot of Baker &amp; Hostetler in Washington DC. Owning property, providing an after-sales service or negotiating with a customer in the US may be sufficient. It might be argued that the US courts would be less willing to try foreign subjects' liability where the issue arose abroad. The Justice Department says that it 'will continue its longstanding policy of considering principles of international comity' (comity means respect for the other country's way of doing things). It will also notify and consult with foreign governments before taking action (for example, under the 1991 EC-US antitrust co-operation agreement). But the US courts are the final arbiter of this question. Enforcing antitrust law is not the sole prerogative of the Department: about 90 per cent of all antitrust lawsuits are brought by private parties, who can claim treble damages. The new policy makes no change to this situation, but the Department's renewed determination to act may encourage private lawsuits. Problems also arise out of the differences between US and other competition laws. US law may be good, but it is not universal. Other societies endorse the rules which they find most effective and best suited to their needs. Some rules may be looser, others tighter. Few other countries endorse enforcement through US treble-damages private lawsuits. The Justice Department dilutes its reassurance about 'comity' when it goes on to say: 'If the conduct is also unlawful under the importing country's antitrust laws, the Department of Justice is prepared to work with that country if that country is better situated to remedy the conduct and is prepared to take action against such conduct pursuant to its antitrust laws.' This sounds rather decent - letting another country enforce its own competition policy on its own market - but it also warns that the Department may not be 'prepared' to leave it to that country if local action fails to protect US interests as well as US law would. Most countries would draw a line between protecting the domestic market from foreign-source abuse and enforcing the domestic rights of citizens abroad from abuse on the foreign market. The US does not. An explanation may lie in the legal differences. US law treats as one what many laws treat as two distinct issues: competition law and unfair competition. Unfair competition is largely unknown to the English common law, which was the grandfather of US law. When the US Congress passed the Sherman Act in 1890, it created a single protection of 'trade and commerce' which combined both the protection of competition on the market and the private protection of competitors. It gives rise to public and private rights of action, both on behalf of the market and of competing suppliers. This was not entirely followed by competition laws elsewhere. Competition law aims to secure free competition between suppliers on a given market; where the product or service comes from is largely irrelevant. It may give rise to private rights, but incidentally rather than as its purpose. Unfair competition law gives a supplier a private right of action for compensation against someone who damages his capacity to compete. As far as competition law jurisdiction is concerned, there is an analogy with the traditional criminal jurisdiction over conspiracy, which is to be tried where it takes effect on the victims: the illegality of the conspiracy should be judged by the standards of the place where the harm is suffered. Injury to competition would normally be tried in the market where it occurred. But, if treated as conspiracy, it can logically be extended to cartels agreed abroad but taking effect on the domestic market - a principle accepted in the European Community as well as in the US. The situation covered by the US policy is not the same. If US companies are excluded from a foreign market by a conspiracy, the competition loss is on that market. It would also be normal to sue for unfair competition in the place where the harm was done or where the defendants (parties to the cartel) were resident, that is, the foreign market. However, if the cartel were treated as a conspiracy to cause harm to US exporters, it could be said that the effect on the victims - the US companies' lost export profits - took place in the US. In that event, the narrower rules of criminal jurisdiction over foreigners should apply. Many US lawyers are dismayed by the reinstatement of the Justice Department's policy. Not everyone shares Assistant Attorney General James F Rill's faith in US antitrust law: 'Some observers have gone as far as describing the American belief in competition principles, embodied in our antitrust laws, as having almost a religious aspect. I readily admit to being a disciple of the faith in competition' (Paris, 1989). Few would disavow competition as a worthy object of devotion, but a great many do not believe that it is exclusively embodied in US antitrust law - and certainly not in US enforcement of it.

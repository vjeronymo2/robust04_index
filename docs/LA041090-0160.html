			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: OF HURT'S BABY, 'BATMAN II' AND ELEPHANT SAVIOR  </P> <P> THE TRAUMA of William Hurt's "palimony" trial last year and the possibility of  a second go-round in court hasn't hurt the actor's marriage to Heidi Henderson.  Bill and Heidi, who live in the East, are expecting their second child. This  time they hope for a girl to go with their Sam, age 7 months. But neither  parent believes in finding out a baby's sex in advance, so they just have to  wait and see what happens in August. And so do we.  </P> <P> AS IF THERE isn't enough turbulence in Great Britain these days, now the movie  industry of Blighty is up in arms over news that the "Batman" sequel will be  shot in Mexico instead of in England. The fantastic, $5-million "Gotham City"  set has been kept intact at Pinewood Studios for more than a year, at a cost of  $100,000-a-month storage. And that, of course, is in anticipation of Michael  Keaton's "doing it again." But perhaps Warner Bros. doesn't feel obligated to  honor commitments made by their ex-Batmoguls, Jon Peters and Peter Guber, who  now do their stuff for Columbia Pictures.  </P> <P> MARLENE SANDERS was the first woman to cover the Vietnam War close up, so she  is no stranger to the vicissitudes of foreign travel. And it's a good thing,  too, because her recent trip to Nepal, for the Discovery Channel's "Profiles in  Progress" series, had Marlene traveling both by Land Rover and by elephant.  </P> <P> The elephants were just wonderful, Marlene says, but the Rover got stuck in the  middle of a raging river, and the plucky correspondent had to be rescued by  canoe. The Land Rover was then brought out by elephant.  </P> <P> ON MONDAY Sotheby's in New York will be the site for the Manhattan Center for  Living's gala benefit "Fantasy Auction." (The MCL helps people with  life-threatening diseases.) Mike Nichols and Steve Sondheim of the Broadway  theater are co-chairing this event, which offers about 40 fantasies donated by  stars of entertainment, music, fashion and sport.  </P> <P> You'll be able to bid for tickets to see the great Maggie Smith in "Lettuce and  Lovage," then meet and sip Champagne with her backstage, and go on to dine with  "L&amp;L" playwright Peter Shaffer at Orso's. (I have dined myself with this  writing giant who created "Amadeus," and whoever wins him will be in for a  treat.)  </P> <P> The sports-minded might land the right to go with Susan Sarandon, her "Bull  Durham" cutie, Tim Robbins, and TV sports commentator Tim McCarver to lunch at  the Regency, take in a New York Mets game, and meet the team. (We are not  talking cheesy little fantasies here!)  </P> <P> Sotheby's expects bidding to go through the roof for one particular fantasy  Breakfast at Tiffany's with Audrey Hepburn. The highest bidder, plus a guest,  will enjoy a private fast-breaking with the star in the executive offices of  the jewelry emporium. So two lucky people get to discover whether food ever  passes those elegant Hepburn lips.  </P></p>

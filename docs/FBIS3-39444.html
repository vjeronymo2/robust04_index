The CBI added that the recovery in manufacturing industry  had  spread to all mainland regions of the UK.    The CBI's upbeat analysis of the economy was tempered by a  warning from Mr Davies that the economy might not grow as  rapidly as it had been as a result of the tax rises that are due  to come into force in April. The CBI leader said that a study  of past large tax rises did not suggest that a slowing down in  consumer spending was inevitable, if the savings ratio fell.    Giving the biennial Bridge Lecture in the City, Mr Davies  said the Government would be advised to reduce interest rates "a  little further" this year, especially if the exchange rate  strengthened or there was some adverse effect on confidence from  the tax rises.    Mr Davies's remarks came after the CBI's latest regional  breakdown of its authoritative industrial trends survey  indicated that the recovery in manufacturers' orders has now  spread to all mainland regions of the United Kingdom for the  first time since the recession began.    Apart from Northern Ireland, the CBI's survey showed that  total orders rose in all regions, with the largest increases in  Yorkshire, the South East, Scotland and Wales. Business  optimism is also up in all regions, while output has risen in  eight areas of the UK. Overall demand and output are also  expected to rise further in all mainland regions over the next  four months. But the survey shows that manufacturing employment  is still falling in all regions, except Scotland, although the  rate of job losses has eased.    Job losses are forecast to be acute in the South East, where  the CBI estimates that 16,000 more jobs will be lost alone in  manufacturing industry in the first quarter of this year.  However, despite the still gloomy job prospects, the survey's  findings prompted optimistic views of the economy.</p>

			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE CORNER BAR  </P> <P> Henry N' Harry's Goat Hill Tavern, 1830 Newport Blvd., Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> Open daily from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. (714) 548-8428. This place serves no fewer  than 96 brands of tap beer; the keg room looks like Jerry Lee Lewis' idea of a  well-stocked bomb shelter. The tavern proper consists of several rooms, packed  with games and decorated with everything from buffalo heads to Elvis dolls.  Best of all, there are, to quote a regular, "people from all over the world  here, all kinds, slobs and business people, and they let it all down." JIM  WASHBURN  </P></p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Management: A voice for volunteers - A training resource for large employers that also helps unemployed young people One passage in last week's 400-page report of the Labour party's Social Justice Commission was studied with particular care by Elizabeth Crowther-Hunt. It described the eye-catching if ambitious proposal for Citizens' Service, a potentially 'big' political idea for tackling unemployment through the mobilisation of young people in nationwide community project teams. Crowther-Hunt's interest stems from the fact that the Prince's Trust Volunteers, a royal charity backed by 100 large UK employers of which she is full-time director, already adopts a strikingly similar approach. Indeed, she and her patron will no doubt have been pleased that in several places the Commission cites the PTV as a possible model for its own scheme. Labour's implicit endorsement of PTV - party leader Tony Blair gave Citizens' Service a warm welcome even though it is not official party policy  -comes with the Prince's charity poised for a substantial expansion over the next few years. Current capacity is likely to be doubled to about 4,000 places per annum by next March, but prime minister John Major has pledged the government's support to achieve a target of 25,000 volunteers a year by the end of the century - 'a figure which would certainly make a difference,' suggests PTV chairman Mike Woodhouse of Bowater. Under the Volunteers programme, a mixture of young people in jobs and the young unemployed join 15-strong teams, which undertake an intensive 60-day programme (normally full-time, although it can be spread over 6 months). Of the 60 days, 20 are spent on classic 'team building' activities and 40 on community projects and placements (for example, working with the old and disabled, in schools, hospitals or on environmental projects). Government and royal patronage aside, PTV's growth plans will depend on the organisation's ability to persuade large employers that the scheme is a valuable and cost-effective staff training resource, and that they should therefore release more of their young employees to participate in programmes. The magic ingredient, according to enthusiasts, comes from the mix of employed and jobless. 'Like most companies we are trying to break down hierarchies and introduce team working,' says Mike Riley, chief executive of LLanelli Radiators in Wales, part of the Japanese Calsonic Corporation. 'We find that sending people on PTV programmes offers young graduates or those who have come to us from less academic backgrounds the chance to work with others, often under pressure, and to develop their leadership skills. I'm a big supporter.' KPMG, J. Sainsbury, Marks and Spencer and National Westminster Bank - and the Benefits Agency, Royal Mail and the Inland Revenue in the public sector  -are among organisations that support Volunteering. Employers pay Pounds 1,200 per place as well as their secondees' wages; the unemployed continue to receive social security benefit. PTV claims that the results since it started in 1990 have been positive for everyone. It quotes a recent survey in which 70 per cent of employers saw a significant change in their participants in at least one skill area; 50 per cent in two or more areas, and almost 30 per cent in three or more areas. Improvements in team working, communication and problem-solving were also noted. Routine surveys of unemployed Volunteers taken three months after programmes had ended show that 70 per cent have either found a job or are in further education or training, while around half continue to volunteer in a significant way after leaving the course.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Dismissed Hoover chief raps media ONE of the Hoover executives dismissed over the company's controversial free flights offer last night laid part of the blame for the marketing fiasco on the media. Mr Brian Webb, former vice-president of UK marketing, said: 'The offer was absolutely genuine, and had we been left alone to sort out the few problems we encountered everything would have been all right. 'But the public was being bombarded with so many doubts and incorrect facts. The media got hold of a few minor problems and advertised them. They raised doubts in the public's minds and as a result we were inundated with thousands of phone calls we just couldn't handle.' About 200,000 people are estimated to have bought a Hoover product worth at least Pounds 100 to qualify for two free air tickets to Europe or the US. Last night Mr Steve Delahaye, Mid Glamorgan deputy trading standards officer, said there was no evidence that Hoover had broken the law. 'This type of promotion would be covered by the Trades Description Act, but there is no offence unless people have actually been refused a flight.' Meanwhile, it has emerged that the two travel agents handling Hoover's free flights offer increased their Association of British Travel Agents bonding at the turn of the year to enable them to boost sales of associated services such as accommodation and car hire. Free Flights Europe of Watford and Your Leisure of Warwick are members of Abta, which sets bonding levels to ensure that customers' money can be refunded if the company collapses. The free flights are not guaranteed by Abta because holidaymakers' contracts are with Hoover, but Abta would be responsible for services bought directly from travel agents. Mr William Brenchley, managing director of Brevis Marketing Services, Free Flights Europe's parent company, said he arranged a new bond to cover additional business generated by the Hoover offer after discussions with Abta. Mr Michael Dunkley, a director of Your Leisure, said his company also increased its bond. Mr Brenchley said he would investigate any specific allegations that his company gave preference to Hoover applicants who agreed to spend money on extra services, but if any such incidents did occur 'it was not the result of management instructions'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Wang Wencheng (3769 2429 2052)] </F>   [Text] Abidjan, 4 Mar (XINHUA) -- Today Ivorian President  Henri Konan Bedie hailed Ivorian-Chinese relations as  "developing with remarkable results."    Bedie made the above statement when accepting credentials  from new Chinese Ambassador to Ivory Coast Liu Lide [0491 4539  1795].    Bedie said: "When reviewing the past decade since Ivory  Coast and China established diplomatic relations, we can only  feel happy and cannot ignore the fact that diplomatic relations  between the two countries have been developing remarkably."  President Yang Shangkun's visit to Ivory Coast in July 1992 has  broadened bilateral exchanges. Because of these contacts and  the thorough understanding of each other's wishes and interests,  the Ivorian and Chinese Governments have signed agreements to  broaden cooperation in various fields.    Bedie also highly commended Chinese-aided projects in Ivory  Coast. He expressed the hope that Ivory Coast and China will  "expand and consolidate bilateral cooperation." When commenting  on Ivorian-Chinese trade issues, he said he hoped that Ivory  Coast and China will strengthen trade relations and gradually  attain a balanced foreign trade account between the two  countries.</p>

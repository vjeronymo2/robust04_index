			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Quito, 19 Feb (DPA) -- While the opposition  strongly criticizes the government's plans to call a plebiscite  on constitutional reforms, President Sixto Duran-Ballen has  severely chided his political adversaries and charged they are  obstructing changes "out of pure hatred." "Without any support,  my government is changing this country and giving it an  efficient and productive economic structure," said the  72-year-old president, who described his rivals as "the crazy  opposition." However, Duran-Ballen did not confirm the  plebiscite, suggested by Vice President Alberto Dahik the  previous evening, to solve the problems of governability caused  by a political structure that furthers conflict between  government branches.    The suggestion made by Dahik, who is considered to be the  liberal government's ideologue, unleashed a wave of criticism  and charges that the government is trying to alter the ongoing  electoral process and avoid a defeat which, according to the  polls, will be overwhelming. The government's acceptance rating  is under 10 percent, thus, it can be anticipated that the  opposition will obtain a large majority of the 65 deputy  positions -- in the 77-member Congress -- to be renewed on 1 May.    The opposition-controlled Congress has halted the bills  presented by the government to change the economic structure,  which is very centralized presently. "They are damaging the  country, not me. They, however, care nothing for the country,"  Duran-Ballen stated when he commented on the "perverse  obstructionism."    Despite the blocking of the bills, the government has  announced it will start to privatize some of the 167 public  firms this year. This action is part of the "Modernize the  Government" program which will also reduce the number of  bureaucrats and fiscal expenses. "We will continue the program  until 1996" (when his term ends), reiterated Duran-Ballen today.  "The crazy opposition will not stop us," he added.</p>

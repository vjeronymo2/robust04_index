			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Vance's peace role offered to Norwegian MR Thorvald Stoltenberg, the Norwegian foreign minister, is expected to take over from Mr Cyrus Vance, the veteran former US secretary of state, as one of the two international peace negotiators on the former Yugoslavia, though he has yet to make a final decision whether to accept the post. It has come as no surprise that Mr Vance, 76, is stepping down. He made it clear at the beginning of the year that he would soon give up the arduous task of mediator, which has required constant travel between Geneva, New York and the former Yugoslavia and the chairing of lengthy negotiating sessions. Though robust in appearance, Mr Vance has been troubled by ill health and has frequently said that he wanted to devote more time to his New York law practice and his family. Most observers, however, expected him to wait until a peace agreement in Bosnia was signed and sealed. That could still happen, since Mr Stoltenberg is not due to take over from him until next month. If he accepts the appointment, following consultations with his prime minister, Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, he will be joining Lord David Owen, the European Community's representative on the two-man mediators' team. The 61-year-old Mr Stoltenberg has been offered the job as co-chairman of the conference on the former Yugoslavia by Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the United Nations secretary-general. A Balkans expert, Mr Stoltenberg worked as a diplomat in Belgrade from 1961 to 1964, speaks Serbo-Croat and briefly held the posts of Norway's UN representative and UN High Commissioner for Refugees. A Norwegian foreign ministry spokesman said that Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali had the backing of the five permanent members of the security council in offering Mr Stoltenberg the post. Though Mr Stoltenberg, coming from a small country, is not widely known as an international statesman, the UN secretary-general clearly considers that his considerable experience of Yugoslav problems and his familiarity with the UN are good qualifications for the job. Mr Vance, who has long had a close working and personal friendship with Lord Owen, began his association with the UN at the end of 1989 and was appointed the UN's special envoy to Yugoslavia in 1991. One of his main achievements was to have negotiated a ceasefire in January 1992 ending six months of bitter fighting between Croats and Serbs living in the newly created republic of Croatia. Subsequently, he represented the UN on fact-finding missions to South Africa and inquiries into the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia before being appointed co-chairman of the conference on the former Yugoslavia.</p>

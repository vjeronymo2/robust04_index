			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXCERPTS: TOLD AIDES TO ACT 'WITHIN LAW,' REAGAN SAYS  </P> <P> Here are excerpts from former President Ronald Reagan's testimony as a defense  witness in the Iran-Contra trial of his former national security adviser, John  M. Poindexter. Richard W. Beckler, Poindexter's lead attorney, questioned  Reagan about internal Administration meetings on the "Iran initiative":  </P> <P> Question: Maybe you could tell the jury a little bit about what you recall  about those meetings and the fact that there was disagreement and so on?  </P> <P> Answer: Yes. I do recall that word had come back from our people dealing with  the Iranians that they wanted something, some evidence, that would make them  confident that they were meeting with people who had access to the top levels  of government in our country.  </P> <P> And the thing that the Iranian representative had suggested was a single  shipment of TOW anti-tank missiles to be sold to them, not given . . . .  </P> <P> And my word back to our people was that we had a policy that we did not do  business with a government that supported terrorism.  </P> <P> The answer that came back was that these individuals did not support terrorism,  and there was some documentation to the effect that they had shown an  opposition to terrorism wherever they had an opportunity . . . .  </P> <P> And I made the decision that there was one thing upon which we could base  selling them this single order of TOW missiles that could be transported in a  single -- in one airplane, and that was that we had some nine hostages being  held by the Hezbollah, which had a kind of philosophical relationship with  Iran, and that, if they would use their efforts to get our hostages freed, yes,  we would make this sale.  </P> <P> They agreed that they would do that. And so the shipment was sent. And I can't  place the timing, but very shortly thereafter, we had received two of the  hostages, not together -- one at a time -- and were told that two more would be  available within probably 48 hours.  </P> <P> And it was at about this time that the little weekly newspaper in Beirut  printed an erroneous story that we were doing business directly with the  Khomeini and trading arms for hostages.  </P> <P> If you want the disagreement that occurred between our people, some of the  people said that this would -- they didn't say that it was trading (arms) for  hostages 'cause it wasn't. My answer -- they said it would be made to appear  that way if it ever came to light. My answer to that was that, if I had a child  kidnaped and held for ransom, and if I knew of someone who had perhaps the  ability to get that child back, it wouldn't be dealing with the kidnapers to  ask that individual to do that. And it would be perfectly legitimate for me to  reward that individual for doing this.  </P> <P> Q: Mr. President, perhaps you could explain to the members of the jury whether  the Contra support, the freedom fighter support, was one of -- was a very  important issue that concerned you during your tenure as President?  </P> <P> A: Yes, it was very important. Here was one of the countries in the Americas  that had evidently been picked for becoming a Soviet satellite. The  Sandinistas, the revolution to overthrow the dictator, the Sandinistas were a  part of the revolutionary group. The revolution was also made up of other  people and citizens of Nicaragua.  </P> <P> And the Sandinistas and the revolution sent to the Organization of American  States a request that they urge Somoza, the dictator, to step down and end the  killing in that revolution. And the Organization of American States asked for a  report as to what were the aims of the revolutionaries who were making this  request. And they gave those aims, and it was multiple parties. It was freedom  of choice. It was freedom of press. It was all the things we believe are pure  democracy.  </P> <P> And so the organization asked Somoza, and he said: "If it will save killing  more people, I will step down." And he did.  </P> <P> Then the Sandinistas were the only organized group in the revolution. They  seized power. They even exiled some of the leaders of the revolution, jailed  some of them, and they took over the government. They announced that the  revolution would not stop at their borders, that they were going to carry it on  to other countries. They made it very plain that they were going to create what  they had created, a communist government.  </P> <P> And the people of Nicaragua began trying to revolt, but they would wind up  herded into jail. I was visited in Washington by two clergymen, neither one of  whom had any ears. The Sandinistas had cut his ears off. And not a word of that  had ever appeared in our public press, even though I introduced one man to a  great group of the press in the East Room of the White House.  </P> <P> And they had a great disinformation campaign, which divided the people outside  Nicaragua as to who should get support -- the Sandinista government, or the  group that had seized the government, or the Contras, who were freedom  fighters, who wanted to have what we have in our own country and that the  result of the revolution would be a democracy.  </P> <P> Q: Now, did there come a time, Mr. President, in 1984 -- early 1984 -- when it  looked like funds that Congress had provided for Contra support were running  out? Do you recall that time frame?  </P> <P> A: Yes.  </P> <P> Q: Do you recall what your instructions were to your top people at that time as  to what ought to be done about this?  </P> <P> A: Yes. My instructions were that whatever we did in trying to maintain the  existence of the Contras should be done within the law. I emphasized that at  every time.  </P> <P> Q: Mr. President, you said before that getting funds for the Contras was an  important item for your Administration. Is that correct?  </P> <P> A: Yes.  </P> <P> Q: And --  </P> <P> A: May I explain? Would this be helpful or would this be appropriate if I  explained why I feel so strongly about this?  </P> <P> Q: Yes.  </P> <P> A: We know that there were guerrilla groups all over Latin America, all of them  being supplied with their military power by Castro in Cuba, and which -- and he  in turn was supplied by the Soviet Union. We only had to heed the words of  Lenin, which was guiding them, when Lenin said that the Soviet Union would take  Eastern Europe. It would organize the hordes of Asia, and then it would move on  to Latin America. And once having taken that, it wouldn't have to take the last  bastion of capitalism, the United States. The United States would fall into  their outstretched hand like overripe fruit.  </P> <P> Well, history reveals that the Soviet Union followed that policy and almost up  to the present head man there. And so, when this was taking place down there,  when we knew that the Nicaraguan government -- the Sandinista government -- was  determined that it was going to join the spreading of communism to other  American countries, there was no way we could sit by in our position here and  let that happen without giving those freedom fighters the opportunity to fight  for their freedom. And I saw nothing wrong with that.  </P> <P> Q: Now, Mr. President, in addition to this phone call, as I mentioned a little  while ago, you also had a meeting on May 21 with President Suazo (then the  president of Honduras) . . . . Once again, this meeting with President Suazo,  do you recall where it took place?  </P> <P> A: Well, I have to recall. I see right here. Took place in the Cabinet room,  which was usually the meeting place for such things.  </P> <P> Q: Can you tell the members of the jury what the purpose of this meeting was  with President Suazo, as best as you can recall?  </P> <P> A: Well, I think the description down here of it is pretty accurate. It was to  provide a public demonstration of the close relationship between our two  countries and our commitment to their sovereignty and territorial integrity in  the event that the Nicaraguan government should -- should threaten them with  any action. And that we were going to continue our support for the -- for the  freedom fighters.  </P> <P> Q: Mr. President, during some of these meetings, were you given something like  a 3-by-5 card you would perhaps refer to from time to time to guide you in your  meetings? I mean, you had so many meetings, I am sure that you would be given  something.  </P> <P> A: Yes. And it was simply to outline the subjects of things that I was to see  if they didn't bring up that we brought up, that we should talk to together . .  . .  </P> <P> Q: Looking at that first paragraph on that page, and I refer you to the  statement where it says: "Without making the linkage too explicit, it would be  useful to remind Suazo that in return for our help in the form of security  assurances as well as aid, we do expect cooperation in pursuit of our mutual  objectives."  </P> <P> A: Uh-huh, uh-huh.  </P> <P> Q: Perhaps you could explain basically what that refers to?  </P> <P> A: Well, again, I think it is the same tone. That we don't want to press them  to go too far that they challenge the Sandinista government and wind up in open  hostilities with them. And the -- it would be useful however to remind them for  our help in the form of security assurances as well as aid that we do expect  cooperation. That we feel that there is an obligation on their part too.  </P> <P> Q: In 1985 and 1986, did you know -- just tell the jury generally about what  you knew about what Oliver North was doing with regard to helping the situation  in Central America vis-a-vis the freedom fighters.  </P> <P> A: Well, you have to have people who can be available to make contact with the  leaders of the Contras and so forth, sometimes closer than just writing a  letter. And it was my feeling and my understanding -- I did not meet  individually with him to any extent at all. But it was my understanding,  because his name would crop up in memos and so forth, that that's what he was  doing.  </P> <P> And I am trying to think what the other angle (was). I know that there was  another area too in which he participated. Well, for example, in the meeting  with the Iranians, he was involved in that, and I think was actually there in  the meetings with them. Whether all of the time or not, I am not familiar.  </P> <P>  Prosecutor Dan K. Webb, cross-examining Reagan about a letter Poindexter sent  Congress on July 21, 1986, about National Security Council involvement in  aiding the Contras.  </P> <P> Q: Let me ask you this question based on your role as chief executive of this  nation. If the information that Robert McFarlane provided to you in 1985 is  false, contained lies and deceived and obstructed Congress, would it still be  your belief that John Poindexter should readopt those false statements in  responding to Congress on July 21, 1986? . . .  </P> <P> A: Well, I simply -- no, I did not have this information, but I have a great  deal of confidence in the man who was quoted as sending those letters,  McFarlane. And I have never . . . caught him or seen him doing anything that  was in any way out of line or dishonest. And so I was perfectly willing to  accept his defense.  </P> <P> Q: I understand. But I am just asking you, as I understand it -- am I correct,  Mr. President, that the letter that you were looking at there from John  Poindexter dated July 21, 1986, you, yourself, actually did not approve and  authorize those letters at the time they were sent? Is that correct?  </P> <P> A: I have no recollection of doing so. But that could be my memory. I don't  remember.  </P> <P> Q: I take it as the chief executive and as President of the United States, you  did not want or did you authorize your top officials of your Administration to  provide false information to Congress? Is that a fair statement?  </P> <P> A: That is a fair statement.  </P> <P> Q: Let me call your attention to one specific thing that I think you testified  to on direct.  </P> <P> As I understand, on direct examination, you related to some extent that your  attorney general, Ed Meese, on or about Nov. 24, 1986, after making some type  of evaluation and inquiry into the Iranian arms sale initiative advised you  that he had discovered that there was some Swiss bank accounts involved, and  that money out of the Iranian arms sales appeared to have gone in some way to  assist the Contras. Do you recall that?  </P> <P> A: What I testified is that that's what was being published and carried on by  the press. But to this day, all I know is that some sum of money over and above  the $12.2-million purchase price appeared in a Swiss bank account in which it  was said that account had been used on other occasions to provide help to the  Contras. And to this day, I still with all the investigations that have been  made, I still have never been given one iota of evidence as to who collected  the price, who delivered the final delivery of the weapons, or what was --  whether there was ever more money in that Swiss account that had been diverted  someplace else. I am still waiting to find those things out and have never  found them out.  </P> <P> Q: . . . My question only to you, sir, is: To the extent that there was in fact  a diversion of proceeds, did you in any way approve or authorize that while you  were President of the United States?  </P> <P> A: For heaven's sake, no. And when I was once asked about that extra money and  said if it was an added sum to the purchase price, what would I do, I said I  would have given it back.  </P> <P> Q: Mr. President, when your Tower Commission reported back to you in March of  1987, did the Tower Commission not tell you, Mr. President, Oliver North and  your National Security Council were involved in 1985 and 1986 in assisting the  Contras militarily and paramilitarily? Do you recall that being told to you by  your Tower Commission?  </P> <P> A: I don't recall that, and I can only tell you that my interest in that  commission was to find out the thing that I still do not know, and that was how  did there turn out to be more money than the 12 million two for the TOW  anti-tank missiles, who delivered and who -- obviously, it seemed to me that  someone must have raised the price for those, but that was never found out. I  still do not know.  </P></p>

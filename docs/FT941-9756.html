			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Global markets and the investor, where next? - In the wake of the Fed's interest rate increase, which caused stocks to plunge, Michael Morgan and John Pitt find strategists split High-riding investors could be forgiven for feeling giddy when stocks on Wall Street fell almost 100 points at the end of last week, their biggest drop since November 1991. The cause was the decision by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, to raise interest rates. And although the increase was only fractional, it was enough to unsettle Asian and European equity markets thoroughly from the beginning of this week, giving professional and private investors plenty of cause to reconsider their positions. Even before the Federal Reserve's move, global equity market strategists agreed that higher US rates were imminent. But their views differ sharply on how investors should respond. On the one hand, Albert Edwards, of Kleinwort Benson, believes the markets are decidedly 'iffy'. He says investors should hold cash, the idea being to bank some of their recent profits so that they can rebuild their holdings when prices turn lower. On the other, Sushil Wadhwani, of Goldman Sachs, issued a strategy note headlined 'Cash remains trash'. He argued that any equity price weakness in response to the monetary changes would be relatively temporary. He remains optimistic about the outlook for equities in the coming year and says any fall in prices will represent an excellent medium-term buying opportunity. Moreover, Wadhwani points out that individual investors were notoriously slow to react to changes in interest rates. He said: 'Looking at the last three troughs in US rates, individual ownership of equities continued to rise even after interest rates had started to rise . . . 'Historically, individuals typically will have made only 10 per cent of the total eventual adjustment to a given change in interest rates after six months.' He claimed that because individual investors reacted so gradually, they still had not adjusted their portfolios fully to the dec-line in rates that had already occurred. Consequently, he argued, even if rates began to rise, it was likely that individual ownership of equities would continue to increase over the next year. 'The accepted wisdom is that cash is trash. It will surely take more than a  1/4 percentage point rise in interest rates before cash is king again,' he added. What, then, is the private investor to make of such divergent signals and how are fund managers choosing to react? Colin McLean, of Scottish Value Management, is encouraged that the Fed acted when it did. Otherwise, he said, there could have been a nasty shock later. He added: 'At least it has made some people aware of the risks in the equity markets and that it is not all a one-way trip.' McLean does not believe that the change in interest rates has changed the basic outlook for the UK or Europe. He feels that stock market prices in Japan may recover later as its economy improves. This, however, could have a depressing effect on other Far East markets which, he suggested, had been supported in the recent rally by a flow of funds from Japan as well as from the US. David Rosier (Mercury Asset Management) says it has been clear for some time that world interest rates could not decline much further. Consequently, not much more in capital gains could be expected from the bond markets. Rosier thinks the rise in US rates can be viewed positively as indicating the Fed's view that the recovery of the US economy is now robust. He adds: 'We are seeing a sort of decoupling. The fact that interest rates have moved in different directions in the US and the UK underlines that the US economy is ahead of Britain's in the economic cycle. 'Over the past year or two, we have seen stock markets driven by liquidity and falling interest rates. People have been looking for a home for their cash and it has gone into stock markets.' Investors would look now for convincing evidence that companies were increasing their profits. Rosier believes the performance of the UK market will be restrained in the short term until earnings' figures for 1993 provide evidence of corporate recovery. He recommends that investors should continue to hold relatively fewer stocks in the US relative to other markets. While he has become slightly more optimistic about prospects in Japan, he still does not expect much of a recovery in corporate profits this year. But he feels the Pacific Basin region continues to offer some interesting long-term opportunities. He warns, however, that the markets there are volatile and subject to the risk of profit-taking after last year's phenomenal performance - especially if US funds decide to repatriate their holdings. Rosier thinks there is scope for further interest rate cuts in continental Europe. But while the area remains attractive, he says investors should take some profits while valuations remain high. Nick Train (GT Unit Managers) believes a further  1/4 percentage point rise in US interest rates is likely in the short term. He says: 'After a period of unsurprising volatility, we would encourage investors to think favourably about the US bond market and the US dollar, and not to re-adjust their thoughts too readily on returns from financial markets elsewhere.' He also sees potential problems in Asia and believes that, during the next nine to 12 months, signs that stock prices have become excessive will emerge in some Far Eastern markets such as Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. The chart compares the relative performance of four markets: Hong Kong, Tokyo, London and Europe (excluding the UK). It shows how the Hang Seng has outperformed Europe and the UK while Japan has lagged behind. Andrew Bell (BZW) also believes the emerging markets of the Far East and elsewhere have become overheated because of the great demand for stocks in these relatively illiquid centres. He cautions that although emerging markets are a good long term prospect, this is not the best time to begin investing in them. 'There is always the danger of trying to be too clever,' Bell says. 'But our feeling is that, in the next six months, institutions might start taking out their money.' This would lead to falls in these markets which might temporarily be greater  -because they are relatively illiquid - than could be justified from the fundamental value of the stocks. Mike Lenhoff (Capel Cure Myers) suggests the global bull market has not ended just because of the Federal Reserve's move. Instead, he feels some of the froth has been blown off the top, prompting investors to ask basic questions about where they had been putting their money. For instance, asks Lenhoff, do investors want to be paying 20-30 times earnings for German stocks when the recovery is unlikely to be coming through until 1995 at the earliest? He thinks it likely, however, that US interest rates will rise later in the year. And, in Europe, he feels it remains right to focus on 'peripheral' markets such as Scandinavia, Italy and Spain rather than those tied to the D-Mark. 'Over the past two years, the countries which devalued have moved ahead and secured a definite corporate advantage in the export sector,' he notes. Michael Hart (Foreign and Colonial) believes private investors should remain cautious in present conditions and that interest rates on both sides of the Atlantic will continue to hold the key to the performance of the equity markets in the coming year. He says: 'In the US, the tide of interest rates has turned and we can see them going on up. The real question now is how far they will move - and that depends on how the economic data come out week by week. 'The other important influence is Germany, where the economy is still very depressed and where further interest rate cuts can be expected. The UK will certainly derive some benefit from further German rate cuts. But if US rates have to go up faster than expected, then Wall Street could cause some further vibrations. 'The chances are that UK rates will come down further. But bearing in mind that the market has had such a tremendous run, investors should not expect too much, even though the outlook for earnings is quite reasonable.' Hart believes the safest approach for private investors is to use the savings schemes run by investment trusts, which spread investments over time and over a large number of stocks.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Business and the Law: Advantages of the City - Robert Rice investigates London's competitive edge in legal services As London's commercial law firms climb slowly out of recession, they appear to be facing a period of great uncertainty and change. A spate of aggressive hiring of English lawyers by large US law firms has left many wondering whether they are facing increased competition in the commercial legal market from a new breed of multinational partnerships. Others are concerned by the interest being shown by the six large accountancy firms in legal services. Many medium-sized commercial firms, in particular, are left wondering where precisely, if anywhere, they fit into this brave new world. A report*, on the competitive advantage of law and accountancy in the City, should provide them with some comfort. The report, by Professor John Kay, chairman of economic consultants London Economics, was published on Friday as part of the three-year City Research Project. The project, set up last November by the Corporation of London, the local authority for the City of London, and managed by the London Business School, is designed to look into London's competitive position in international financial services. Prof Kay concludes that the future structure of the commercial legal services market will not change greatly. The competitive advantage enjoyed by City law firms is based on factors which will be sustained and are sustainable, says the report. Prof Kay's starting point was to ask whether the structure of the legal services industry is different from other professional services industries, such as accountancy. A quick comparison between law and accountancy shows the markets are different. Accountancy is dominated by the Big Six partnerships and produces an international product similar to manufactured products such as cars. The legal market is fragmented and the product is basically national in character. City law firms derive almost 50 per cent of their turnover from non-UK clients, but the product they export is English law. Turnover figures for the top 20 accountancy firms and law firms in the UK in 1993 illustrate the point. The Big Six accountants had a combined turnover of about of Pounds 2.5bn - or a market share of 80 per cent - and the 14 second-tier firms a turnover of just Pounds 511m. In law, the top six firms had a turnover of Pounds 844m, only slightly more than the second-tier firms' Pounds 756m. The City's law and accountancy firms are pre-eminent internationally. But their approaches to delivering international services differ. There are basically three models of internationalisation, according to Prof Kay. The first is epitomised by aircraft maker Boeing, which, from a large domestic production base in Seattle, exports its products around the world. The second model is represented by General Motors, which operates and sells in different places around the the world - a model based on global production and local sales. The third model is typified by Hertz car rental, where the product is global but mainly produced and sold locally. Accountancy, he says follows the Hertz model - international firms attach their names to local products and local producers, with most of the benefits going to the local partner. Probably less than 25 per cent of the revenues of City accountancy firms originates overseas. Legal services are closer to the Boeing model. City law firms export legal services from London, with most of the benefits returning to the UK and the firms based there. The reason for the difference in the structure of the two industries lies in the nature of their products: in particular, legal services and audits. Audits are unusual, he says, because regulations force companies to have them. The incentives of the purchaser are not the same, therefore, as in legal services. In legal services, the purchaser is looking for the best product in the marketplace or the best product for its current needs. Quality and expertise are the most important factors for clients. In accountancy, adequacy not excellence is the priority, he says. Accountants provide services that meet the standards required at local levels and make no differentiation between products. The reasons for buying legal services are more diverse and more related to local need. That does not mean clients are not concerned with value for money. But they do not buy legal services because regulations force them to. They buy because they need them. Given that the legal services industry has a different structure from other professional industries, does it need to change to succeed in the 1990s? Prof Kay says not. In spite of the increasing internationalisation of many professional activities, the majority of legal advice is still provided by law firms which concentrate on their domestic jurisdiction. The demand for legal advice in relation to international financial market transactions is mostly directed to English and US law firms, whose common law systems are best suited to the purpose. English and US firms also have substantial experience of international transactions and are big enough to cope with complex deals. Since law firms operate in a transaction-based market, the strength of City law firms in respect of international financial deals lies in the competitive environment they can offer to clients around the world. This is provided by the English legal system, the pre-eminence of London as a financial centre, and their reputation for efficiency in handling documentation. The competitive advantages enjoyed by the large City law firms - a de facto monopoly on English law and their location in London, where a large number of primary international financial institutions are based - are unlikely to vanish overnight, says Prof Kay. There is therefore unlikely to be any significant change in the structure of the legal services market in the near future. There may be some further moves towards internationalisation, but if firms do open overseas offices it will generally only be where their expertise and reputation acquired in London offer a unique selling point. Prof Kay says there may be further concentration of law firms, but this will not be rapid as the base is too fragmented and there is little demand for larger law firms. The threat from US firms is overstated, he says. In the short term, there is little prospect of US firms hiring lawyers of sufficient standing to pose a threat to the practice of English law by English firms. The future of large City law firms, therefore, seems secure - at least while London maintains its prominence as an international financial and commercial centre. *The Competitive Advantage of Law and Accountancy in the City of London, from Corporation of London, Guildhall, or London Business School, Sussex Place, London NW1</p>

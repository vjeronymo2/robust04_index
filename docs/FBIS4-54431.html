			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, April 26 -- The Cabinet meeting on Monday  accepted the programme for commercialising state enterprises  prepared by the Privatisation Ministry. "In two to three weeks  the ministry intends to prepare draft bills connected with the  programme, the implementation of which should begin at the start  of 1995," Privatisation Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek said. He  added that he was referring among other things to a new version  of a law on privatisation which would take commercialisation  into account.    The commercialisation programme aims to gradually convert  state firms into treasury owned companies. The first firms to  be involved in the programme would be those which were in a good  financial state (some 2,000 of Polands 5,300 state firms).    Overall the programme is aimed at state enterprises which it  is impossible to privatise quickly due to their legal or  financial situation. The Central Statistical Office (GUS) has  announced its plans to draw up a map grading all the state  enterprises in Poland.    The programme intends to regulate the legal status of the  enterprises to take into account questions of ownership. It  also seeks to improve supervision over the enterprises,  including health and safety supervision, allow for more  efficient debt repayment, help to actively fight unemployment  and allow the transfer of state enterprise recreation assets to  trade unions, says the government communique issued after the  meeting.    In addition the programme is to make enterprises maintain  the  parts of their property which are not directly involved in  production and allow the unions to manage the welfare funds.    The Cabinet amended the ordinance of April 19, 1993  concerning those enterprises which were to be treated as special  cases in the privatisation programme. The proposed amendments  want to add enterprises in the defence industry to the list.  The amendment should speed up the conversion of the defence  industry enterprises into treasury owned companies.</p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / IRA thought to be behind Ireland's biggest bank raid THE Provisional IRA is suspected of carrying out the biggest bank raid in Ireland's history, in which five armed robbers made off with cash estimated at almost IPounds 2.5m (Pounds 2.3m). The raid on Monday was at a cash-holding centre run by Allied Irish Banks at Waterford in the Irish Republic. The republic's Central Bank holds cash reserves there to provide liquidity to regional banks or to absorb their surpluses on a day-to-day basis. The centre is one of five in the Republic operated either by Allied Irish Banks or Bank of Ireland as agents of the Central Bank. Police said the raid was carried out with military precision by five men armed with an automatic rifle and handguns. They spent only five minutes in forcing staff to open a vault, loading the cash into a stolen van and making their getaway. They had apparently earlier broken through the cement roof of the building. Shots were fired, but no-one was injured. The getaway van was found abandoned yesterday in a lane a few miles north of Waterford, where it is thought the robbers transferred to another car with a Northern Ireland number plate. The police said the IRA was the main suspect, although there was 'no hard proof'. The IRA usually keeps a low profile in the republic, and does not claim responsibility for its actions as it does in Northern Ireland. The IRA is not thought to have been active in armed robberies in the republic since 1990. But a security crackdown on its racketeering in Northern Ireland over the past year is believed to have helped cut the estimated Pounds 6m raised each year to finance IRA operations. Irish police and banking chiefs met yesterday to review security procedures at other cash-holding centres in the republic. Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday met unionist leaders who called for troop reinforcements for the province. Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley described the meeting at the Stormont parliament building as 'meaningful and constructive'.</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Deadlock in Danube hydro talks HUNGARY yesterday attacked a Slovak plan to divert the Danube river, accusing it of breaking international law, after talks about the controversial hydro-electric project broke up in disagreement, writes Nicholas Denton in Budapest. Slovakia appeared determined to continue with the Bos-Nagymaros project, despite Hungary's opposition. Mr Vladimir Meciar, the Slovakian prime minister, even made a veiled threat to complete construction within Slovakia's own territory, according to Hungarian officials. 'It would infringe the integrity of Hungarian territory,' an official said of a Slovak scheme to divert the Danube. Mr Meciar refused to rule it out as one way of circumventing Hungarian opposition. 'Slovakia will not give up its intention to continue construction,' he said.</p>

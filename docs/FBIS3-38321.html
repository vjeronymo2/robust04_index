He stated that the importance of Turkey's constructive  role in the region was once more confirmed at the Davos meeting.    Demirel was received at Ankara's Esenboga Airport by  Husamettin Cindoruk, speaker of the Turkish Grand National  Assembly; General Dogan Gures, chief of the General Staff; Murat  Karayalcin, state minister and deputy prime minister; State  Minister Necmettin Cevheri; Interior Minister Nahit Mentese;  Presidential Secretary Necdet Seckinoz and other officials.    In an airport statement, Demirel said that world economic  and  political problems were discussed at the Davos meeting, adding  that within this framework he found the opportunity to explain  Turkey's approach to international problems. Demirel noted that  the Economic Cooperation Organization, the developments in the  Central Asian republics, and Turkey's relations with the  European Union were discussed in detail at the Davos meeting.  He stated that Turkey is a very important country in its region  and continued:    [Begin Demirel recording] Turkey, actually, is a singularly  significant country as a result of its relations with Central  Asia, Russia, Ukraine, the Caucasus, the Balkans, and the  Arabian peninsula following the positive results of the Middle  East peace conference. Turkey, in other words, is a very  significant bridge in a region extending from west to east, that  is from Europe to China. I found the opportunity to explain this  view. I hope that in the near future Turkey will become a  significant energy terminal by transporting and selling the gas  and oil reserves of Central Asia, namely Turkmenistan,  Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, to the world. This is one of the  most significant issues on the world's agenda. [end recording]    Demirel stated that there is interest in Turkey's  constructive role in the region as well as in the bilateral and  multilateral relations it is cultivating.    Demirel said that he will find the opportunity to discuss  the  Middle East peace process and possibilities for regional  cooperation with Egyptian President Husni Mubarak who will be  arriving on an official visit in Turkey tomorrow. Noting that  the Bulgarian president will also be visiting Turkey in the  coming months, Demirel said that steps to be taken to realize  the East-West highway that will transit through Bulgaria,  Macedonia, and Albania will be discussed during this visit.</p>

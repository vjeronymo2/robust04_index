			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Yeltsin signs oil privatisation decree RUSSIAN PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin has finally signed a decree spelling out limited privatisation plans for the country's lucrative oil industry, giving foreigners the right to acquire up to 15 per cent of oil companies. The decree on transforming oil enterprises into joint stock companies preserves a controlling stake for the government and entitles workers primarily to non-voting shares. The decree creates a trust called Rosneft to manage the state's stakes in most oil enterprises. It in turn enables Rosneft to delegate management responsibilities to unspecified commercial structures, presumably be run by the enterprises' existing managers. Three vertically-integrated holding companies, whose operations will range from oil wells to petrol pumps, will absorb the rest of the enterprises. The three are Lukoil, the country's first vertically-integrated company, Surgut and Yukos. Shares will begin to be sold off both in enterprises within the Rosneft orbit and the three holding companies to outside investors next year. Details of these sales however have yet to be finalised. Meanwhile, Mr Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister, announced that the government would soon lower export tariffs for oil from Ecu30 (Pounds 24.20) to 22 a tonne, while his colleague, Mr Peter Aven, the foreign economic relations minister, said it would press ahead with plans to recentralise exports to get a better grip on hard currency revenues.</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Money market deals push Kredietbank ahead 14% KREDIETBANK, Belgium's third-largest bank, has boosted consolidated net profits by 14.3 per cent for the nine months to the end of December 1992. The growth in earnings was bolstered by a 41 per cent increase in money market activity, notably currency swaps and options. A net dividend of BFr185 for ordinary shares and BFr233.58 for the AFV special shares is to be considered at a general meeting on April 29, as compared with BFr183 and BFr231.45 respectively in 1991-1992. The bank's financial year was shortened to nine months in line with the move to achieve a single balance sheet for the Almanij-Kredietbank group, and was marked by a weak economy at home and abroad. On an annualised basis, consolidated net profits of BFr7.3bn (Dollars 214m) would rise to BFr8.5bn, an increase of 14.3 per cent. Earnings per share amounted to BFr515 (BFr525) over the nine months. In spite of narrower margins, brought about by the inverted interest rate structure and fierce competition, Kredietbank group increased its gross income by 7.7 per cent and lifted its return on shareholders' capital to 12.3 per cent. Costs rose 5.1 per cent, while depreciation and write-downs amounted to BFr11.8bn. The bank described the provision as a modest 4.4 per cent rise, but said it had made a 'substantial' allocation to internal reserves to cover latent risks.</p>

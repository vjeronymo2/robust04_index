			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / NTT in row over use of network A private Japanese telecommunications carrier has asked the country's regulatory authorities to intervene in what has become an unusually public row with NTT, the former public utility, over use of its local network. Japan Telecom, the country's third largest long-distance carrier, yesterday asked the minister of posts and telecommunications to order NTT to make its local network available for high-speed data services Japan Telecom is seeking to offer. The appeal, which highlights the increasingly competitive market environment in Japan, could strengthen the argument for breaking up NTT (last week listed on the London Stock Exchange) into separate long-distance and local operations. NTT has been accused by critics of using its local network monopoly to impede competition in the long-distance network. Japan Telecom said it had been in talks with NTT for two years in an attempt to link its long-distance network with NTT's local network, to provide frame relay services letting users cut the cost of sending data down phone lines. As a long-distance carrier, Japan Telecom must use the local network dominated by NTT to provide such services. While talks between the two companies failed to bear fruit for Japan Telecom, NTT applied in July this year to offer frame relay services of its own. NTT, which on privatisation was allowed to retain both long-distance and local networks, faces a decision next year on whether it should be broken up or allowed to operate intact. If the minister decides to order NTT to make its local network available to competitors, it will be the first time the authorities will have done so. NTT has two weeks to bring its case to the authorities. NTT said it was ready to continue talks.</p>

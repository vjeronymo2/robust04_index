			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 261.58&blank;Occupancy and Use <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (m) allows for the issuance of an order to prohibit the ``discharge of a firearm, air rifle, or gas gun.'' Under the proposed rule, this paragraph would be revised to read ``discharging or possessing a firearm, air rifle, gas gun, or other device capable of causing injury to persons or wildlife or capable of causing property damage.'' For example, the addition of the prohibition against ``possessing'' is necessary for wildlife protection at certain times of the year on different national forest units and for public safety in areas of higher visitor use or when property would be easily damaged by firearms and other devices shooting projectiles. The addition of ``or other device'' is necessary to support the inclusion of devices, such as starter pistols and crossbows, which can cause serious bodily harm or death if used. And finally, the addition of ``capable of causing injury to persons or wildlife or capable of causing property damage'' is necessary to specify more precisely the type of device to which the prohibition would apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (bb) would be revised to adopt the new definition of ``alcoholic beverage'' proposed at 36 CFR 261.2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A new paragraph (dd) would be added to prohibit the storage of personal property in any area outside of a national forest developed recreation site when prohibited by an order. Similar to the problem within developed recreation sites addressed by proposed &sect;261.14(r), is the ``staking out'' of popular sites by users several weeks in advance of when they are to be occupied for hunting or other activities. Often, other users desiring to camp in the same area are unable to do so because of this activity. This rule is proposed for Subpart B, because of the site-specific nature of the problem and the need for flexibility to prescribe different lengths of time for each area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A new paragraph (ee) would be added to enable a Regional Forester or Forest Supervisor to issue an order prohibiting the possession, storage, or use of glass food or beverage containers. The rule is proposed in light of serious safety hazards presented by broken glass in heavily used beaches and swimming areas and the need to prevent injuries from cuts to persons recreating in these areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No other revisions are proposed to this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Part 262_Law Enforcement Support Activities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This part provides administrative rules pertaining to certain operational matters affecting Forest Service law enforcement programs and activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 262.1&blank;Definitions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A new definition section would be added to provide for definitions of ``Law Enforcement Officer'' and ``Special Agent.'' The definitions are needed in the regulation to support the section on purchase of evidence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Existing &sect;262.1 would be redesignated as &sect;262.2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Existing &sect;262.2, which governs the purchase of information in furtherance of investigations, would be revised and combined with &sect;262.3, which governs the purchase of evidence. This revision is proposed in response to requests of several Forest Service regions for a payment scale for purchase of information and evidence that reflects the gravity of the offenses investigated, such as violations of the National Forest System Drug Control Act of 1986, as amended. For example, amounts that Special Agents could be authorized to pay for information or evidence would be raised from $200 and $400 respectively, to $500 for a single transaction, with other increases or changes proposed for the employees so listed. Existing paragraph (b) in both sections, which states that payments cannot be made for the investigation of petty offenses, would be removed. The agency's authority to make payments for evidence and information was affirmed in a decision of the Comptroller General dated April 29, 1971 (CG&hyph;B&hyph;172259) and allows for payment to further any criminal investigation, otwithstanding the classification of the offense. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

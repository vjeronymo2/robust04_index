Gorbachev was wrapping up a personally  victorious 28th party congress with adoption of new party rules and the  election of new members of the Central Committee.  </P> <P> Delegates today, the last day of the congress, voted by secret ballot on the  approximately 420 nominees for the Central Committee. Gorbachev was scheduled  to deliver a report on the congress after the votes were tallied.  </P></p>

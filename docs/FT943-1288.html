			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Books: Muddles and moral certainties - Two curiously complementary views of Russia INSIDE YELTSIN'S RUSSIA by John Kampfner Cassell Pounds 17.99, 288 pages ZHIRINOVSKY: THE LITTLE BLACK BOOK edited by Graham Fraser and George Lancelle Penguin Pounds 5.99, 173 pages Here we have two books. In one, a Daily Telegraph journalist describes three years spent in Moscow, reporting on corruption and economic decay; in the other, a would-be fascist propounds a narrow vision of Russian economic and military superiority, making liberal use of aphorism and epigram. An odd pair, but together, John Kampfner's Inside Yeltsin's Russia and Vladimir Zhirinovsky' s Little Black Book shed light on one another in a curious and unexpected fashion. Inside Yeltsin's Russia is typical of its genre, opening with Kampfner's memory of student days in Russia, and concluding with a forecast of Russia's future. In between, Inside Yeltsin's Russia is sometimes muddled, occasionally switching too quickly from businessmen to politicians and then back again. But it may be that the book's structure reflects the confusing nature of its subject with deadly accuracy. Yeltsin's Russia was and still is a Russia in which nothing is quite as it seems. A business is not necessarily business, but might be a mafia front; a bank is not always a bank, but a means to launder money. Businessmen are not necessarily businessmen, and politicians are not necessarily politicians. Kampfner writes that 'ideological differences played a part, but not the most significant part, in the power struggle that dominated Yeltsin's first years in power. Politics was largely a means to an end, and that end was economic control.' Economic control is a polite way to say that politicians were primarily interested in self-enrichment, that politics were largely about money, and that most of what looked like political debate was, in fact, carefully controlled stealing. Take, for example, Kampfner's convincing explanation of the power struggle between president Yeltsin and vice-president Alexander Rutskoy. Although this struggle began in the autumn of 1992 and culminated in the storming of the Russian parliament a year later, its origins lay not in a political difference, but in a bitter disagreement over whose aides and followers were stealing the most. Rutskoy's Kremlin office was frequented by businessmen who 'would barge in unannounced, calling him 'Sasha' and giving him orders'; yet Rutskoy had a habit of summoning his political adversaries to meetings, claiming to possess compromising material about their own business deals, and demanding favours in exchange for keeping quiet. If Rutskoy really was ever interested in constitutional issues - in, say, upholding the principle legislative rule in the battle against executive power - he did an excellent job of concealing it. Yet put down Kampfner's book and pick up Zhirinovsky: The Little Black Book, and all of the confusion melts effortlessly away. True, The Little Black Book is not quite what it appears to be either. Although it also looks, on the surface, like a classic of its genre, sharing its epigrammatic format with Mao's Little Red Book and Nietzsche's collected works, it is only a compilation of Zhirinovsky's sayings, put together by Graham Fraser and George Lancelle, two non-Russians who are (not surprisingly) unsympathetic to the man and his ambitions. But although in translation and surrounded by critical editorial comment, Zhirinovsky's actual sayings are concise, and his ideas are clear. Are both Yeltsin and Rutskoy corrupt? Well, says Zhirinovsky, 'the only party with clean hands and a clear conscience - we are unsullied and unmarked by a single drop of blood - is the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia,' the party led by Zhirinovsky himself. Do people feel economically insecure? Under a Zhirinovsky government 'some of the population will live very well because people will have the opportunity to work honestly and, after that, to enjoy a secure old age.' Foreign policy is simple too: 'Why should we inflict suffering on ourselves? Let others suffer.' In Zhirinovsky's speeches all of the muddle and moral uncertainty which are so evident in Kampfner's account of life in modern Russia are swept away - and that, of course, is precisely Zhirinovsky's appeal to the 'lumpenized masses', in whose name he claims to speak. His star may already be fading, as even the 'lumpenized masses' learn to see through him, but Zhirinovsky will undoubtedly be followed by others who see the value of clear speech and ideas. While Yeltsin dithers, hiring more old apparatchiks to work for him, others with better intuitions about what Russians want to hear will, for better or for worse, capture the public's attention. Having read these two books, no one would find it difficult to understand why.</p>

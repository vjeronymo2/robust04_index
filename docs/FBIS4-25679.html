			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Beijing Vice Mayor Zhang Baifa by </F> staff reporter Ma Ling (7456 3781), in Beiing; date not given:  "Zhang Baifa -- Commoner Turned a Mayor of Beijing"]    [Text] Zhang Baifa has been serving as vice mayor of  Beijing for 14 years, under four different superiors; he is the  eldest in terms of seniority and can be regarded as the most  well-known. Owing to his background and character, some people  call him the "commoner mayor," and because of his "rise" and  merits, some people call him the "construction worker turned  mayor." In any case, no matter how you address him, his unique  character and characteristics as a mayor have been recognized  unanimously.    When people mention Zhang Baifa, their thoughts turn to a  series of buildings put up in Beijing after the nation's  founding because his name can be linked to many large and small  construction projects in Beijing: From the eight major  colleges, the Friendship Guest House, the Great Hall of the  People, and the Museum of History in the 1950's, to the Asian  Games Village, the project of transforming the second and third  loops, the capital's airport expressway, the Beijing West  Passenger Station, and the Healthy Housing Project in the  1990's. Zhang Baifa, who has been serving as vice mayor of  Beijing since 1981 and thus has become an "elder having served  four superiors," is in charge of urban construction. Along with  the emergence of the magnificent breadth of spirit of the  ancient capital -- Beijing -- and the successful organization of  the 11th Asian Games in Beijing and Beijing's vigorous bid to  host the 2000 Olympic Games in the international community,  Zhang Baifa's reputation and influence are no longer linked only  to buildings in Beijing, but have followed the outward extension  and expansion of construction projects to places outside the  country, like China's sports undertakings -- flying across the  ocean to places outside the mainland.  <H5>  "Think a Little -- In Fact, the Souvenirs Left by Life That </H5> Make People Feel Most Solid To See Are the Construction Workers"    When the conversation came to Zhang Baifa's most favored old  trade -- construction, he could not help being exultant, and his  eyes, which have their own characteristics, became narrow lines,  as he said happily: "I feel it is very meaningful to have a  career in construction, I am really delighted to see the  buildings of various styles in Beijing. Think a little -- in  fact, the souvenirs left by life that make people feel most  solid to see are the construction workers."    In the West, people call architecture solidified music.  However, whether in the West or in the East, architecture is a  sign of human life.    In October 1934, Zhang Baifa was born in a peasant household  in Hebei's Xianghe County. He was a little kid, but he had to  help his family make a living by cutting wood and weaving. He  did not go to a primary school until he was 10 years old, and he  stayed there for a year. In that time, his hometown was a  guerrilla zone, so when he was in school, he and his family had  to hide here and there because of the war against the Japanese.  Later, Japan surrendered and the northeast was liberated, and  they kept celebrating. Indeed, he did received very little  education.    He said when recalling the events in that period: "When I  was in the school, my deepest impression was the liberation of  Jinzhou. The first song we sang in school was `Without the  Communist Party There Would Be No New China.' In this way, we  cultivated our plain feeling."    In 1948, he was 14 years old, and he walked with his father  from his hometown to Beiping [old name of Beijing], where they  became individual operators engaged in the weaving business.  Every day, day after day, when he opened his eyes, he would  begin weaving, until he was very tired, then he would collapse  onto the weaving machine and sleep; life became boring. He  sighed and said: "In that time, the small business indeed could  not earn any money, unlike today's individuals who can get rich  very quickly; the phenomenon we see now is abnormal, and it  shows that the government has many loopholes for them to get  through." However, reflecting on the life which tempered him in  that time, he said humorously: "In that time, I learned some  technique, and that is, no interference could disrupt my sleep;  therefore, now, no matter how noisy, I can sleep."    In 1949, he returned to his hometown to see his mother, at a  time when the CPC and the Kuomintang were fighting for control  of Beiping. When he returned to the capital in 1950, Beijing  was already controlled by the CPC. He lived in the Gongyuan  area in the eastern part of Beijing. In those years, untidy  earth mounds and rubbish heaps could be seen everywhere over  there, and it was a neighborhood where poor people lived.  Opposite the big complex where he lived, there was a big  building under construction, to usher in the three-year period  of revitalization and construction in Beijing. He was attracted  by the flames and activities in the construction site, and  whenever he finished the weaving job, he would try to enter the  site to play. By coincidence, the workers specializing in  reinforcing bars in the construction site lived in the complex  where he lived, so he also learned how to tie up reinforcing  bars.    In 1951, he left the weaving machine and joined the  construction trade, working as a reinforcing bar worker, and the  first project he participated in was the three-storey People's  Bank of China building. Entering the trade, he felt broad and  independent. In those years, he received no wages, and he  worked the whole day for eight jin of rice, but he was very  content. Afterward, he moved to the huts inside construction  sites, and there he lived for 16 years.    He said: "In that time, we basically did not work in the  winter, during which period we claimed 70 percent of our wages,  and every day we were organized for studies -- to learn  politics, `On Contradictions,' and so on. Some well-known  professors from Beijing University came to give us lectures, and  we really learned a lot of things." These studies also  theoretically armed his work in the years to come.    Thereafter, he joined the Communist Youth League, and became  the leader of a small team. Soon after, a banner reading "Zhang  Baifa's Young Reinforcing-Bar Commandos" was hoisted, and they  fought here and there in the capital, winning great merits.  Zhang Baifa and his commandos were commended as model workers  for 11 consecutive years. He himself was elected a national  advanced producer in 1956; in 1958 he was elected a deputy to  the National People's Congress; and in 1959 he was granted a  meeting with party and state leaders at a get- together party  for national heroes. His name has been well-known since the  1950's.    In 1965, Zhang Baifa officially took a leading post, serving  as the deputy manager of the No. 3 Construction Company. He  moved into his own office. Thereafter, he took the post of  deputy party secretary of the company. During the Cultural  Revolution, like other model workers, Zhang Baifa was brought  down. He was transferred downward to the No. 2 Automobile  Company in Hubei Province, where he still took charge of housing  construction. In January 1973, he returned to Beijing.  Thereafter, he served as the vice minister of the State  Construction Commission. In 1981, he took the post of vice  mayor of Beijing, and he has been serving in the post until now.    At the request of this reporter, Zhang Baifa talked about  the  extraordinary relations he has with several senior leaders.    Zhang Baifa's relations with Wan Li were established when  the  former was a model worker. He said: "In 1958, Wan Li was  minister of the State Commission for Urban Construction, and on  a certain occasion, he granted us a meeting, and I sat just next  to him. He talked and we took down notes. He turned his head  to look at my notes, which were written with untidy strokes, so  he asked me what was my educational attainment, and I said I was  a boor and illiterate. He criticized me: `Boor, no way! In  the past you might say you were a boor and be proud of it;  nowadays it is nothing of which to be proud. Lenin once said  similar words that boors cannot construct socialism.'"    Thereafter, in less than a year, Wan Li took office as vice  mayor of Beijing, overseeing urban construction. Every year, he  would send for the representatives of model workers like him for  conversations. After Zhang Baifa became a cadre, Wan Li said to  him: "You now have become an official, but if you have the  thinking of an official then you are wrong. Only a bureaucrat  will sit in the office, you must act like you did in the past,  and go often to the grass-roots levels."    During the Cultural Revolution, Wan Li was toppled, and Li  Ruihuan, Zhang Baifa, and Shi Chuanxiang -- the three model  workers who were much favored by Wan Li -- also were toppled.  On the eve of 1967, the Beijing Workers Stadium was scheduled  for a 10,000-person meeting to denounce Wan Li, and Li Ruihuan,  Zhang Baifa, and Shi Chuanxiang were summoned to the meeting.    Zhang Baifa disclosed that afterward, Wan Li still "proudly"  said: In so many meetings for criticisms and denouncements, I  am the most honored, for I am accompanied by three worker  friends, and this shows that I still have the mass. During the  meeting, Li Ruihuan wrote a couplet to denounce Wan Li: "In the  past, scent wafted 10,000 miles; at present, stink is left for  10,000 years." Zhang Baifa added a horizontal scroll: "Starting  from zero." After the meeting, Wan Li changed Zhang Baifa's  scroll into "Staging a comeback," to explicitly encourage them  not to become dejected, but to stage a comeback. Thereafter,  they really staged a comeback. Unfortunately, one of their  brothers, Shi Chuanxiang, who was a dung-collecter, passed away  during the Cultural Revolution.    According to information, even now, he and Li Ruihuan will  go  to see Wan Li together; and every New Year's Day they will  jointly visit Shi Chuanxiang's family.  <H5>  "Even the Best National Banquet Cannot Match a Bowl of Hot </H5> Noodle Soup. Sometimes, You Must Spend Three Hours at a  Banquet, and That Is Not Far From a Slow Suicide."    Zhang Baifa, a mayor at the vice minister level, is  naturally  listed as a senior cadre, though he is different in many ways  from a senior cadre as envisaged by the people. You can  perceive this clearly from his body language and from his way of  talking. The impression he gives people is: Easy-going,  humorous, frank, and natural, like a commoner who is sincere and  unrestrained.    When this reporter entered his small and simple office, he  asked his secretary to move a chair to a place in front of his  desk, and said: "Do not sit on the sofa, sit here, so we are  equal." Then, he asked in a straightforward manner: "What do  you want to ask? What do you want to talk about?"    Zhang Baifa is capable -- no doubt about it. His energy and  hard work can be seen from the rapidly developing urban  construction in Beijing during the years. In those eye-catching  major projects and the busy construction sites where whole  stretches of land are under development, one can see his  silhouette here and there. In addition, on many public  occasions, one often can see Zhang Baifa playing a special role.  Being a vice mayor, he can have only a secretary, but because  his work is really busy, he has been given one more secretary to  help him. Even so, he is still very busy. During the interview,  this reporter saw his secretary busily answer a series of phone  calls, and a queue of people who came to the office. Zhang  Baifa frankly said that in fact, the job he is doing should be  done by a younger person because it requires a lot of energy and  strength.    Zhang Baifa can "speak with fervor and assurance," and  this is known to all. When he starts to speak eloquently, with  the Beijing accent, he can change the extremely serious and  official "bureaucratic tone" into an extremely relaxed and  humorous "people's saying," which can get at things very  precisely, and is particularly acceptable to the common flock.  Zhang Baifa dares to "talk freely," and always to let the  common flock feel as comfortable as if they had spoken the words  in their hearts. Speaking ideas frankly already has become a  very peculiar characteristic of this charismatic official.  Zhang Baifa also admitted that he likes to speak frankly and  make jokes with various people.    The saying goes: It is difficult to serve as an official in  the capital. How would Zhang Baifa, who has already served as a  people's official for more than a decade under the watchful eyes  of the "court," sum up his way of running the government? He  said frankly: I have reached this age, I can understand things,  and I do not have any ambitions. In short, I do not struggle  for dominance and benefits, I am not scared about being honored  or insulted, and I do things for the people regardless of praise  or criticism. To put it more straightforward: Accusations,  complaints, and praises -- I listen to them all; good things,  difficult things, and stupid things -- I do them all.    Zhang Baifa has to attend many social functions, and he has  had the experience of going to three banquets in one evening.  It really is too much for him. He said: "Even the best  national banquet cannot match a bowl of hot noodle soup.  Sometimes, you must spend three hours at a banquet, and that is  not far from a slow suicide. No matter what kind of banquet I  eat, when I return home I must eat some rice or a bowl of  noodles." Under the current situation, it is not something new  for officials to attend banquets and "sacrifice." Zhang Baifa  often eats lunch in his office; he has a pan in his office, and  a bowl of "Master Fu Quick Noodles" plus some processing can  easily become a gourmet's meal.    Zhang Baifa, who turns 60 this year, said sentimentally when  talking about the future: "I know every tree and blade of grass  in Beijing, as well as every nook and cranny; I have feelings  for them. I have traveled to almost every major city in the  world to learn their architectural features, but eventually I  still feel nowhere is better than China. I should have retired  by now; I will be 63 when I complete this term of office. My  goals during this term are: Thoroughly improve the environment  along Changan Avenue, thoroughly improve the environment along  the second loop, improve the environment along a section of the  third loop, and solve problems for the 200,000 households whose  average living space is four square meters. The construction of  the Beijing International Airport; the Beijing West Passenger  Station, which has an investment of 4.2 billion yuan; and the  project of channeling natural gas from the northwest to Beijing  have to be completed. Regrettably, the project of diverting  water from the south to the north cannot be completed during my  term of office, for it can only be completed by 2000, but I  still will be able to see it. If all these things can be done,  I will die content."</p>

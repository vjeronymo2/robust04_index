			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Slower retail sales highlight patchy recovery: July high street spending eases The patchy nature of the pick-up in UK consumer spending is underlined today in a business survey showing that the rate of growth in high street sales slowed in July. With the level of sales lower than businesses had expected, the results suggest that retailers are seeing a steady, rather than a sharp, recovery in the aftermath of April's tax increases. The Confederation of British Industry's survey of distributive trades showed that 40 per cent of UK retailers reported sales had increased in the year to July. This result was less upbeat than in June, when 48 per cent of retailers reported growth in sales volumes, and was also below retailers' previous predictions. However the CBI yesterday played down the figures and pointed out that the underlying trend in retail sales remained upward. The monthly survey data had been uneven since April's tax rises, and most sectors had reported a growth in annual sales volumes, the CBI added. Nevertheless, retailers had now scaled back down their expectations, the survey suggested. The proportion of retailers expecting sales to pick up this month fell in July, after the optimism seen in June. The level of orders placed with suppliers remained broadly flat last month, and the majority of retailers reported that their stocks remained adequate for the levels of business expected in the coming months. This pattern was reflected among the wholesalers. Although sales volumes grew sharply in the year to July, the growth was slower than in June and below expectations. Wholesalers significantly scaled back their business expectations in July with around three-quarters expecting no growth next month. Sales levels among motor traders continued to fall for the fourth month in a row, with sales at the lowest level since last December, the survey said.

			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAN B: ANOTHER VARIATION ON A FREEWAY THEME;  </P> <P> 29-YEAR CONTINUING BATTLE OVER ROUTE OF LONG BEACH EXTENSION BECOMES HEATED AS  DECISION TIME NEARS  </P> <P> James Woollacott , mayor of South Pasadena, leans against the railing of the  York Boulevard Bridge, on the city's boundary with Los Angeles, and lets his  eyes sweep across the scene. A segment of the Pasadena Freeway, buzzing with  morning traffic, bends away to the east. Water trickles down a flood-control  ditch.  </P> <P> Extending north of the freeway, a narrow swath of greenery -- bushes and grass  littered with a few rusty automobile parts -- stretches up the Arroyo Seco.  </P> <P> "A piece of dirt," says Woollacott wryly, dismissing the undeveloped green  strip. Here's where the South Pasadena would like to see the long-planned  missing link of the Long Beach Freeway merge with the Pasadena Freeway. Put it  here, Woollacott and his fellow council members fervently argue, not where the  California Department of Transportation wants to build it, along Meridian  Avenue, a block or so from the commercial center of the city.  </P> <P> "What's more important?" muses the 71-year-old mayor, a slim, dapper man with a  neat white mustache. "Putting a piece of useless land to productive use or  putting 500 families out on the street just to save that piece of dirt?"  </P> <P> The cluttered strip of urban back yard below the bridge, seemingly far from  South Pasadena's quaint mansions and tightknit suburban neighborhoods,  represents the last battleground in a war that has consumed the city for more  than a quarter of a century.  </P> <P> As Caltrans moves quickly toward completion of environmental studies for the  proposed freeway extension, which will ultimately link the 10, 110 and 210  freeways, Woollacott and the City Council are making a last-ditch stand on a  proposal that would encroach on the Arroyo Seco.  </P> <P> "Plan B," as they call the proposal, to distinguish it from a dozen or so other  plans considered since 1960 by Caltrans, would not only take the freeway out of  the middle of town but reduce the number of homes that would have to be  demolished by about 500, Woollacott says.  </P> <P> As drawn by freeway consultant Jess Reynolds in 1973, the Plan B route slants  across the southwest corner of the city and follows South Pasadena's boundary  with Los Angeles to the Arroyo Seco, the dry riverbed that runs south of the  Rose Bowl. Then it would "co-mingle" with the Pasadena Freeway, either running  side by side with the older freeway or joining it as a second deck.  </P> <P> It would require using a half-mile-long corridor in the Arroyo Seco.  </P> <P> The plan is a variation of the option known as the "Westerly Route," rejected  by Caltrans as too costly and destructive. Plan B veers from the Westerly Route  north Avenue 60 and rejoins the Westerly Route about 1 1/2 miles to the north  at Orange Grove Avenue. As plotted by Caltrans, the Westerly Route would also  swing away from the center of South Pasadena to the city line. It would have  knocked out dozens of homes along Monterey Road and Pasadena Avenue, crossing  the Pasadena Freeway near Orange Grove Avenue.  </P> <P> But Plan B is beginning to look more and more like a long shot, some state  officials and residents say. Just to get it on the Caltrans table may require  action by both the state Legislature and the U. S. Congress, bypassing the  green patch's designation as protected "parkland," to say nothing of overcoming  a burgeoning resistance movement from the west side of town.  </P> <P> In the meantime, the Long Beach Freeway continues to abruptly drop off the map  at Valley Boulevard in Alhambra. With no link to the freeways to the north,  complain residents of neighboring cities, north-south traffic has been  hemorrhaging into local streets in Alhambra, Pasadena and South Pasadena.  </P> <P> The pressure is on Caltrans to close the gap. "It's probably the most  outstanding example of a freeway gap in the Los Angeles region," says Jack  Hallin, Caltrans' chief of project development for the region. "It's indicative  of the problems of building in a built-up area. Everyone wants the freeway --  'but not in my back yard.' "  </P> <P> As the 29-year-old debate moves toward its fateful conclusion, the strategy  sessions and behind-the-scenes maneuvering are picking up markedly in  intensity, all parties concede. In the past month, city officials have held a  series of meetings with Caltrans officials, and they have huddled regularly  with their Sacramento-based lobbyist and their special legal representative.  </P> <P> "No big deal," cracks City Manager John Bernardi, who has been in the thick of  it. "We just have to extend our days to 26 hours."  </P> <P> Among the hurdles the city faces:  </P> <P> Caltrans is an eyelash away from putting its money on the so-called "Meridian  Variation," a route that would complete the freeway by plowing straight through  the middle of town, roughly along Meridian Avenue. A final environmental impact  study on the "Meridian Variation" was submitted more than three months ago to  the Federal Highway Administration, which would provide most of the funds for  it. Final approval could come as soon as May, Caltrans officials say.  </P> <P> Plan B must overcome state law, which specifically prohibits the use of Arroyo  Seco land for building a freeway, and federal law, which prohibits any federal  project on previously designated parkland.  </P> <P> Recent arrivals to South Pasadena's west side have provided new energy in  building resistance to what some refer to as the "Eastern Establishment," the  city's elected officials, and their determination to shunt the freeway  westward. Organized as South Pasadenans Against the Westerly Route, they have  begun forging alliances with residents groups in adjoining cities.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, city officials are optimistic that they can wrest major  concessions from the state.  </P> <P> "South Pasadena is not a freeway obstructionist," Woollacott said. "Everywhere  we go, we get the response, 'Oh, you guys are the freeway fighters.' But we've  been trying to get this thing built since way back in the late 1960s. It's just  that we thought that there was a better way to do it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Door-to-Door Campaign  </P> <P> Feisty residents in the western part of the city, who would be most affected by  Plan B, have no such qualms. South Pasadenans Against the Westerly Route  (S.P.A.R.) has appointed block captains to carry the message door-to-door that  the city has been "unfair" to their community.  </P> <P> "We're saying to the mayor, 'We don't think you should save the city by  sacrificing the west,' " said Mavis Minjares, a member of the group. "We're a  part of the city, too."  </P> <P> The choices are clear cut, city officials insist: Caltrans can split the city  in half and demolish 1,267 homes in South Pasadena and neighboring El Sereno to  build the Meridian Variation. Or it can skirt the center of town and demolish  only 762 homes in the two communities under Plan B.  </P> <P> The Meridian Variation would be 6.2 miles long and cost about $425 million to  complete. The Westerly Route studied by Caltrans, somewhat similar in  configuration to Plan B, would be 7.1 miles long, and cost $476 million. No one  knows how much Plan B would cost.  </P> <P> Caltrans officials say they're open to city suggestions. "We're talking to  them," says Jack Hallin, Caltrans' chief of project development for the area.  "We're listening to what they have to say."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Two Problems'  </P> <P> Caltrans is in the midst of a preliminary feasibility study of Plan B, to  determine approximate costs and consequences to neighborhoods in its path.  Pressed, however, Hallin expressed doubt. "There are two problems with that  alignment," he said, "state law and federal law."  </P> <P> The city has appealed to state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) to help overcome  a 1975 state law prohibiting further encroachments of freeways into the Arroyo  Seco. According to city officials, Torres, who represents South Pasadena, is  preparing a bill to permit a freeway corridor of about half a mile, where the  Long Beach and Pasadena freeways would merge.  </P> <P> But a spokeswoman for Torres would not confirm that the senator was committed  to such a course. "We're still looking at a variety of options and trying to  gather all viewpoints," said Torres' aide Beth Bonbright. "It's a very  difficult, emotional issue."  </P> <P> She noted that Torres has until March 10 to "drop something into the hopper"  during the current legislative session.  </P> <P> Assuming state restrictions are eased, Hallin said, federal constraints may be  even more resistant. The crucial federal law is a section of the Transportation  Act of 1966, prohibiting the construction of federal projects on parkland  unless "there is no feasible and prudent alternative to the use of such land."  </P> <P> "Congress has not been disposed to waiving environmental law," Hallin said.  </P> <P> The city has adopted a we'll-cross-that-bridge-when-we-come-to-it stance on the  federal question. "Somewhere in the great United States there must be a freeway  that runs through a park," says Woollacott. "Where there's one, there can be  two."  </P> <P> "All we can do is take care of the local (or state) level first," adds  Bernardi. "Then we can move to the federal level."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Federal Injunction  </P> <P> The Long Beach Freeway's missing link has been debated, railed against and  fought in South Pasadena ever since Caltrans first adopted the Meridian Route  in 1964. In 1973, South Pasadena, which has always prided itself on its  small-town atmosphere, joined with environmental groups to successfully sue for  a federal injunction on the project. The plaintiffs argued that the state's  environmental review procedures were inadequate.  </P> <P> The injunction still stands. Even if the Federal Highway Administration (FHA)  approves the project in May, state attorneys acknowledge, Caltrans must go to  Los Angeles Federal Court to ask that the injunction be lifted. The city has  already stated its intention to challenge that request, should Caltrans proceed  with the Meridian Variation.  </P> <P> In 1984, a federal advisory committee on historic preservation dropped another  major roadblock in front of the project, recommending to the FHA that the  project be rejected because the original Meridian Route took out too many of  the city's historic homes. Hence, Caltrans created the Meridian Variation,  which swung around the city's historic district on Mission Street and avoided  the distinctive homes on Monterey Road and on the small, tree-lined lanes north  of Mission.  </P> <P> In 1986, voters were asked in a city-sponsored advisory referendum whether the  city should continue to fight against a Meridian route for the freeway. The  voters voted overwhelmingly in the affirmative. Ever since, the city has used  the 71% "yes" vote on Proposition GG, as it was titled, as a rationale for  continuing its efforts to shunt the freeway link to the west side of town.  </P> <P> It's a sore point for S.P.A.R. members. "A lot of people who voted for GG  weren't for a westerly route at all," said Minjares "They were for a 'no-build'  option."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Less Expensive  </P> <P> The west-side residents argue that a Meridian route would be less expensive and  have less of an environmental impact than Plan B, because of the two plans'  contrasting requirements. "The Westerly route would have to be elevated, while  the Meridian route would be submerged," noted Minjares. "Noise and pollution  will be much more difficult to control on the west side of town."  </P> <P> Council members express dismay that they appear to be working to protect one  part of the city while sacrificing another. "It's not an easy thing to think  that you may be part of a decision to take anybody's house," said Woollacott.  "That bothers me a lot. But I was elected to represent a city."  </P> <P> City officials, depicting the Meridian Variation as the would-be "destruction  of South Pasadena," have said that the city will fight to the end to prevent  Caltrans from building along that route.  </P> <P> In December, the council voted to retain San Francisco attorney Antonio  Cosby-Rossman to represent the city in a possible court challenge to the  Caltrans plan. Council members also voted to use Community Redevelopment Agency  funds to pay for the litigation, which they estimated could cost as much as  $200,000.  </P> <P> Old-timers in South Pasadena are sticking to their guns in the face of  adversity. But most have learned to be blase about the freeway issue even while  they rush to shore up their positions.  </P> <P> "It's our main concern," says Bernardi. "It's always been our main concern. But  it's been on our minds for so long, it's almost second nature now."  </P></p>

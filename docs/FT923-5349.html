			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Business and the Environment: Alternatives under scrutiny User industries may be responding slowly to the phase-out of CFCs, but the chemical manufacturers are rapidly expanding their range of substitute materials. The two largest manufacturers, Du Pont of the US and ICI of the UK, say they have already invested around Dollars 900m (Pounds 452m) on research into alternatives and plants to produce them. By the end of 1992 Du Pont will be producing 13 alternative refrigerants to replace CFCs. Four of the products are pure hydrofluorocarbons which have zero ozone depletion potential (known as ODP): HFCs 134a, 125, 152a and 32. The remainder of Du Pont's products contain hydrofluorochlorocarbons, used either pure or in blends. These HCFCs do some damage to the ozone layer though their ODP is at most 5 per cent of CFCs. Although Greenpeace says Du Pont should not be developing HCFCs, the company says they are essential 'bridging products'. Both Du Pont and ICI are concentrating on HFC 134a for large-scale manufacturing. Du Pont has two 134a plants in the US (at Ponca City, Oklahoma, and Corpus Christi, Texas) and one opening in Chiba, Japan, later this year. ICI's original 134a plant at Runcorn in the UK will be supplemented by 134a facilities due to open in the US and Japan over the next year. The UK company will close its large CFC plant at Runcorn in 1993 and take supplies from Akzo, the Dutch company. Du Pont and ICI will stop producing CFCs for sale in developed countries by the end of 1995, though Du Pont says it 'may produce in developing countries until year end 1999 to meet domestic needs if deemed necessary under Montreal Protocol obligations'.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The chief of general staff, Lieutenant General  Oladipo Diya, has called for the support of Nigerians toward the  ongoing democratization program. Gen. Diya made the call in  Benin while speaking at a meeting with traditional rulers and  elders from Edo and Delta States. He expressed concern at some  media organizations which have been feeding the public with  false information about the arrest of some eminent Nigerians.    Gen. Diya said only the inspector general of police is  authorized to arrest people who have committed offenses, and  such people will be made to face the proper charges. He stated  that the present administration is committed to the rule of law  and assured that those who have been arrested without concrete  charges will eventually be released.    The chief of general staff also spoke of attempts to spoil  the name of the traditional rulers. He warned that those  engaged in spreading rumors to cause confusion will be made to  face the law.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister, Paul Keating, has left  Australia for Laos to start his Southeast Asian tour. The  eight-day visit to Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam is aimed at  improving Australia's trade relationship and developing the  vision that Mr. Keating sees of Australia forging closer ties  with Asia.    Mr. Keating says human rights issues will be raised during  his visit to Vietnam, but they will be within a set framework.  He says, as a democracy, Australia will put its views clearly  and forthrightly, but in the interests of maintaining  relationship with Asian countries; therefore, the situation had  to be seen from an overall point of view.    One of the high points of Mr. Keating's visit will be to  hand  over the Australian-constructed and funded Friendship Bridge  linking Laos and Thailand over the Mekong River.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Ferranti Those Ferranti shareholders who thought Mr Eugene Anderson was bluffing now know differently. The company's chief executive warned that Ferranti would go down if GEC's bid failed. Now GEC has pulled out, presumably because the due diligence process found something nasty in the woodshed. GEC investors who thought the bid more than reflected Ferranti's value may well be relieved. Lord Weinstock can now pick up interesting pieces at a one-man auction. And potential defence entrepreneurs might ponder Ferranti's folly of paying good money for hush-hush businesses when asking hard questions is considered bad manners.</p>

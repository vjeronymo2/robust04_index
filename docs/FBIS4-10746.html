			<p>BFN     [Text] General Nicolas Hermoza Rios, the Armed Forces Joint  Commander and Army Commander, has said that more than 100 Army  personnel have been sentenced so far for their involvement in  drug trafficking.    Gen. Hermoza said Army personnel who commit crimes while on  duty and who allegedly protect traffickers are immediately  discharged and brought before a military court.    He said: "I believe the military court can best investigate  these cases. If suspects were brought before a civilian court  today, I am sure many guilty criminals would be released  tomorrow."    Hermoza Rios said that only when an Army member is caught  red-handed with irrefutable evidence and witnesses to link him  to this kind of crime is he then taken to a civilian court.    Following an operation in the Satipo military base, Gen.  Hermoza spoke on the program "Dialogue" broadcast by Channel  Two. He said that in the past few weeks traffickers had  suffered harsh blows.    "We are all witnesses to the accomplishments of the forces  of  order during operations in Madre de Dios, Inapari, Manu, and now  in Satipo, in which important trafficking networks were  dismantled," he said.    He said the operations carried out in these remote parts of  the country follow a strategy ordered by President Alberto  Fujimori to eradicate drug trafficking.    He added that terrorism is about to disappear in the  Huallaga  Valley. It is expected that the military front in the zone will  eradicate the Shining Path at the same time it ends trafficking.    "These actions have forced the traffickers to move to other  drug production and storage centers, like Madre de Dios and  Satipo, where clandestine airstrips for the departure of  airplanes that carry drugs have been found," he said.    Gen. Hermoza said he is not worried by the investigations  and  criticisms of some journalists about the struggle against  traffickers.    He said there is a campaign to discredit "the Armed Forces"  through unfounded attacks.    "These attacks are not isolated but are made within the  framework of a campaign to discredit our Armed Forces and to  destabilize the democratic process in Peru," he said.    Gen. Hermoza said the media will never be censored because  freedom of press and expression are the main bastions of  democracy.    Gen. Hermoza likewise ruled out disagreements between the  Armed Forces and the National Police, saying that their drug  enforcement task is being carried out in total harmony and  coordination.    He said that at every military intervention against  traffickers a prosecutor and a police representative are  present, adding that the drugs confiscated during the operation  are handed to them.    "There is close cooperation at all levels. It is good to see  that unity and discipline are being maintained despite the  difficult conditions in which we are carrying out this  struggle," he added.    He added that the successful anti-trafficking policy in Peru  is not based on support provided by the DEA but to an  appropriate strategy developed by the government through the  national Armed Forces.    "Nowhere in the world has a problem like trafficking and  terrorism been combated with so much success as is currently  being done in Peru," he said.    He recalled that in November last year the Armed Forces  Joint  Command correctly evaluated the government provisions to  eradicate terrorism from the country and to consolidate national  pacification according to the law.    He denied that these actions seek to improve the Armed  Forces  image in face of the serious charges against some of its members  for being involved with drug trafficking. He said the Armed  Forces began to participate in the struggle against trafficking  and terrorism when the work exceeded the capability of the  police force.    "These social scourges represented at a given moment an  imminent risk and danger to national security and the survival  of our nation, which is why urgent measures had to be adopted,"  he said.    Gen. Hermoza said the legal framework established by the  current regime has allowed the Armed Forces and the National  Police to carry out their task appropriately in the most  troubled zones of the country.</p>

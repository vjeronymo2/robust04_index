			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Surge in growth rate seen for India The reform process in India, begun in 1991, could enable growth rates to surge to levels experienced by its East Asian neighbours, the World Bank said yesterday. In a report before the June 30 meeting of the Paris Club Aid India Consortium, , the bank praised the 'remarkable' success at improving current and capital external accounts. Growth rose from 2 per cent in 1991-92 to about 4 per cent in the last two years and manufacturing, which initially dipped, has recovered to a modest growth of 2 per cent. Foreign investment has soared to an unprecedented Dollars 4.7bn (Pounds 3.1bn). But inflation, after declining to about 7 per cent in mid-1993, has been rising again, the report said. For India to fulfil its growth potential, however, it must strengthen public finances and improve infrastructure. 'Reform should be broadened to include sectoral ministries, public enterprises and state government while at the same time intensifying efforts to strengthen social safety nets.' The Bank warns that India must improve its fiscal performance. 'At 66 per cent of GDP by the end of 1993-94, the central government debt (90 per cent of the consolidated central and state governments debts) is relatively high. Interest payments already claim over half of central government fiscal revenues,' it said. Improvement must be made in the finances of public enterprises and the states. The bank said it was 'essential' India accelerate reform of public enterprises, which generate one-fourth of the country's non-agricultural GDP. 'Where restructuring exercises must precede large scale disinvestment, public enterprises' managers need to be given the authority to mobilise the resources necessary for financial restructuring, undertake large scale retrenchment and associate interested private parties where possible.'</p>

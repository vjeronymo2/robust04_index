			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh, June 20 (XINHUA) -- All Democratic  Cambodia Party (DKP) staff flew out of Puchentong Airport today  for a DKP controlled area, following an order by Cambodia's  Ministry of Interior Affairs last Friday [17 June].    According to observers this indicates that the Cambodian  Government has effectively severed all contact with the DKP and  closed the door on peace talks and national reconciliation.    Before leaving, Tap Kunnal, the DKP's representative,  released a message thanking people at all levels who have, in  various ways, shown their support.    The message also expressed the DKP's "regret at having to  leave Phnom Penh...for a while."    Tap Kunnal's message said that the DKP had come to work in  Phnom Penh in compliance with the 4-party Paris Agreement and  with the approval of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk. This  was to facilitate and maintain communication between the two  groups with the aim of fostering mutual understanding until full  national reconciliation.    Following last Friday's official instruction DKP staff were  given a deadline of June 19 for departure from Phnom Penh.    However, as visas could not be obtained from the embassy  during the weekend holiday, the government had agreed to a  one-day delay for their departure.    The DKP's message stressed that this was only a temporary  situation and that they sincerely hoped could return one day.  [sentence as received]    It added that they would pray for the quickest possible  realization of national reconciliation and unity in a united,  independent and peaceful Cambodia.</p>

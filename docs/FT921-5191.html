			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ecuador shells out on shrimp farming - The consequences of declining fish stocks and over-investment Ecuador's shrimp farming business had another record year in 1991 as the gap with other fishing exports widened. Groups within the industry, unwilling to acknowledge over-fishing, accuse each other of irrational practices or blame dwindling catches on climate and ocean currents. 'We've seen this happen in other countries - with herring in the North Sea, and anchovy in Peru,' said Mr Ian Scott, the economist in charge of Britain's technical assistance programme for the fishing sector. 'There's been over-investment. If the Ecuadorian fleet fishes for 150 days a year at 50 per cent efficiency, it can catch 3m tonnes - but the sustainable stock of pelagic fish is only 500,000 to 1m tonnes.' In the last few years fishermen supplying the fishmeal and canning industries have seen a drastic drop in the harvest of sardines, mackerel, thread herring and anchovies: the catch fell from 1,970,000 tonnes in 1985 to 233,000 tonnes in 1990, leaving many processing plants working at less than 20 per cent of capacity. Mr Scott said that although the warm southward-flowing El Nino current was responsible for two bad years, the general decline was due to over-fishing and licences and quota systems were needed to help stocks recover. The tuna industry, centred in Manta, is also overblown, but the catch has remained stable at 50,000 to 55,000 tonnes a year. Both Ecuadorian and foreign boats fish for tuna. Local fishermen criticise the fact that boats registered in the US, Japan and other countries are contracted by Manta processing companies. However, it is argued that only some of the vessels in the national fleet can freeze tuna to -40C, the temperature necessary for good quality exports. The under-secretary for fishing, Mr Max Aguirre, is proud of Ecuador's record on the dolphin-tuna issue. 'The Ecuadorian law is strict. Ecuadorian and foreign boats have their licences taken away if they fish on dolphins. I report with satisfaction that in 43 trips with observers on board there were zero dolphin deaths.' Mr Aguirre admits that research studies warned of sardine fishing problems, and says regional controls, including Peru and Chile, should be enforced. 'Licences should regulate the catch with reference to the resource.' However, the private sector has been too powerful and the government too timid to allow any quota-based management of stocks. The fish sector earned about USDollars 570m in 1991, with shrimps contributing more than 85 per cent. There are more than 125,000 hectares of shrimp ponds along the tidal flats of the Ecuadorian coastline, mainly in the southern provinces. Most shrimp farms are less than 50 hectares, though the largest - up to as much as 2,000 hectares  - tend to be the most sophisticated. Some use small aircraft to drop feed over the surface of the ponds. Shrimp farms produce all year round so close to the equator and two to three harvests can be taken. With an ideal climate, plentiful larvae and low-labour costs, Ecuador is the leading Latin American shrimp exporter. 'Our problem at the moment is the big jump in the cost of inputs. The dollar price of shrimps has dropped and so has profitability,' said Mr Renato del Campo of the Chamber of Shrimp Producers in Guayaquil. 'But there are markets - the US is still attractive and we are diversifying into Europe, especially Spain.' Exports have risen from 10,000 tonnes in 1980 to more than 78,000 tonnes in 1991, and the need for more space and more larvae has led to conflict with environmental groups, particularly over the clearing of mangroves. Most shrimps are bred from wild larvae caught by thousands of seasonal fishermen, but more than 100 laboratories have been started up in recent years, with some exporting larvae to Colombia. Although the shrimp fishing industry is small, accounting for less than 10 per cent of production, wild shrimp provide important breeding stocks for the laboratories. The sector expanded dangerously fast - from about 2,000 to 9,000 boats  - in the 1980s and over-fishing is becoming a serious problem within a few miles of the coast. Many of the boats are dug-out canoes based in small communities. 'We need to teach people to take better care of the fish, then they'll also improve their income. There should be ice available, and we need to encourage marketing co-operatives,' said Mr Aguirre. The British aid project, which is now ending after 12 years, has helped the National Fisheries Institute to build up data on biology, product development, marketing and management. Ecuador has a stronger basis for planning resource use than many other countries. 'There isn't any room for growth in the existing industry - it needs reducing and consolidating,' said Mr. Scott.</p>

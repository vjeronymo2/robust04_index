			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Liverpool backs Tory homes plan TENANTS of 67 council-owned tower blocks in Liverpool voted overwhelmingly yesterday for their homes to be transferred to independent management under a Housing Action Trust (HAT) for a Pounds 100m-plus improvement programme. The vote represents a breakthrough for government plans to reform local-authority housing. Two other projects have been agreed - but the one in Liverpool is the biggest so far in terms of homes affected. HATs, introduced in 1988, were slow to get off the ground. Several proposals were rejected in ballots of tenants. Tenants' fears have been allayed by concessions, including the right to return to local-authority control after the completion of improvements. A significant factor in yesterday's 82 per cent vote for the Liverpool HAT was the support of Mr Harry Rimmer, Labour leader of Liverpool City Council  -Labour councils have generally been hostile to HATs, fearing loss of control. Mr Rimmer said yesterday: 'It is a departure from what had become established thinking by Labour authorities. But we could not afford to improve people's quality of life without trying something different. We just did not have enough resources to afford it.' The vote allows more than Pounds 100m of government funds to be spent on the 67 blocks over the next 10 years. Only four of the city's 71 blocks voted to stay with the council, which will be responsible for funding any refurbishment and improvements. The new HAT will cover 5,700 homes. The other HATs are a Pounds 55m, 2,100-home programme in Hull and a Pounds 170m, 2,837-home programme covering four council estates in Waltham Forest, London. Several Labour-controlled London boroughs are now expected to ballot tenants on HATs. The government says HATs are a means of targeting spending, rather than putting it into a pool. After the HAT programme is completed, tenants are asked to choose who they want their landlord to be. They can opt to return to local-authority control if they wish, or choose a housing association or private landlord. The Liverpool HAT will cover only 8 per cent of the city's council housing stock of 60,000 homes, 40,000 of which are officially rated as sub-standard. In the ballot, conducted by the Electoral Reform Society, turnout was 78.7 per cent.</p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / International Company News: Goodyear sees return to the black GOODYEAR Tire &amp; Rubber, the last surviving big US-owned tyres group, expects to post profit of Dollars 96m for 1991, compared with a loss of Dollars 38.3m a year earlier. The news bolstered Goodyear's share price, which rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 58 5/8 . The company forecasts operating income of Dollars 783m on sales of Dollars 10.9m for the year. Mr Stanley Gault, chairman, said the company expected to report fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 105m, including an after-tax gain of Dollars 43m from the sale of its Scottsboro Alabama tyre yarn plant. Proceeds of that sale, with a Dollars 600m public stock offering, have helped Goodyear cut debt by Dollars 1bn to about Dollars 2.6bn. Since Mr Gault took the helm at Goodyear last summer, shortly after he retired as Rubbermaid's chairman, the company has announced several new tyres for the North American market. 'Our initiatives should lead to the achievement of our goal of tyre unit growth in excess of the 2 to 3 per cent annual growth expected in the tyre industry as a whole,' he said.</p>

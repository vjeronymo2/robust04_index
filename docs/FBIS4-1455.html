			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Chris Lewis] </F>   [Excerpts] You're listening to Swiss Radio International.  This is Red Cross Review. [passage omitted]. We begin this  month's program with Rwanda where the death of President Juvenal  Habyarimana in a suspicious plane crash has plunged the country  into an inferno of ethnic and political violence. Aid workers  say several hundred thousand people have been killed. Hospital  patients have been murdered en masse and more than a million  people have been driven from their homes. [passage omitted]    Since then things have if anything got worse. Attempts to  organize a cease-fire have collapsed. The slaughter of  civilians has continued unabated and aid workers, including the  ICRC have been forced to withdraw from much of the country. The  ICRC continues to operate in Kigali but at a reduced level and  is taking steps to launch cross border relief operations from  Uganda and Tanzania. Aid convoys continue to reach Kigali but  officials say they are now very limited in the extent to which  they can help the victims of the violence. [passage omitted]    Under the current circumstances there is only so much the  ICRC can do. It has set up its own medical facilities and some  700 patients are now being treated there and at Kigali central  hospital. But armed militia men have not hesitated to stop  delegates taking people to hospital. In fact delegates were  forced to stop doing so after six wounded were dragged from an  ICRC vehicle and shot in front of their eyes. Others have been  murdered within minutes of leaving hospital. Even encouraging  people to gather together for treatment or shelter in itself  exposes them to the risk of wholesale massacre.    And delegates themselves are unlikely to feel any safer  since  the UN's decision to withdraw peacekeeping troops earlier this  month. [Passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / UK Company News: TI TI Group, the specialist engineering and aerospace company, yesterday said that Mr Werner Dieter, the out-going chief executive of Mannesmann, the German engineering group, had decide to postpone joining the board as a non-executive director. He is understood to have delayed joining until an investigation has been completed by the Dusseldorf state prosecutor into allegations that Mr Dieter forced Rexroth, a Mannesmann subsidiary, to buy products at inflated prices from Hydac, a company largely owned by Mr Dieter's family.</p>

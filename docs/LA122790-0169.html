			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NRBQ: NO ROAD MAP REQUIRED;  </P> <P> HERE COMES TERRY, HERE COMES TOM, HERE COMES JOEY, HERE COMES AL  </P> <P> Just a bunch of guys gettin' in the  </P> <P> car,  </P> <P> No matter who's drivin' or for how  </P> <P>  far.  </P> <P> Feels so good, feels so alive.  </P> <P> No fancy drivers tell us how to  </P> <P>  drive.  </P> <P> Me and the boys, just me and the  </P> <P>  boys.  </P> <P> </P> <P> In a more just world, "Me and the Boys" would have been a big hit for NRBQ. For  that matter, the band's just-released retrospective CD, "Peek-A-Boo," would  have been subtitled "Greatest Hits, 1969-1989" instead of "The Best of NRBQ,  1969-1989."  </P> <P> But Joey Spampinato, the singer-bassist who has been in the band since its  start in 1967, isn't about to let the wide gulf between a "hits" collection and  a "best of" collection get him down. After all, hits or not, how many bands  survive long enough to compile a double-decade retrospective?  </P> <P> "Every band wants to have a hit record. If they say they don't, they're lying,"  Spampinato said during a recent interview from his Nashville home. "You always  shoot for that. But we've been around for how many years? And we're still  going."  </P> <P> "Me and the Boys," which dates back to 1980, is one of several terrific songs  about cars -- and various things that people do in cars -- that crop up on  "Peek-A-Boo." Never a band given to deep Angst or weighty social statements,  NRBQ is more inclined to capture simple emotional moments. "Me and the Boys"  could be about the band's own freewheeling approach to rock 'n' roll: Few bands  could trace the zigzagging stylistic road map that NRBQ traverses in a typical  show.  </P> <P> "Peek-A-Boo" and last year's fetching "Wild Weekend" album showcase a band that  can dig up rock's roots with the loose assurance of The Band, or dab charming,  inventive colors on a pure-pop canvas in a way that recalls Brian Wilson's  method with the Beach Boys. NRBQ also has a pronounced zany streak, both  musically and in its stage presence.  </P> <P> The shaggy-haired, sweet-voiced Spampinato is probably the most solid and  straightforward of the bunch (maybe that's why Keith Richards drafted him into  the backing band for his Chuck Berry tribute film; in February, Spampinato will  back Eric Clapton in a special series of blues shows in London). Drummer Tom  Ardolino has been known to croon ditties to a miniature doll that's a spitting  image of himself. Singer-guitarist Al Anderson cuts a huge but humorous figure  with his grumpy scowls, and hyperactive keyboardist Terry Adams can spend hours  on stage looking as blissfully in his own world as a tot in a sandbox.  </P> <P> "There's no set thing of what this band is supposed to be," Spampinato said.  "We like to be multifaceted and encompass all the things we like."  </P> <P> In fact, Spampinato said, when NRBQ goes on stage it throws out the usual road  map that most bands use: a pre-planned list of songs to play.  </P> <P> "It seems to work better to play a song at the spur of the moment, so we let  Terry do that," Spampinato said. "He's most affected by what he would like to  play at a given moment, so we give him the job."  </P> <P> Who  </P> <P> NRBQ.  </P> <P> When  </P> <P> Thursday, Dec. 27, at 8 p.m. and Friday, Dec. 28, at 9 p.m.  </P> <P> Where  </P> <P> The Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> Whereabouts  </P> <P> Take Interstate 5 to the San Juan Creek Road exit.

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: TUC challenges claim of losses at 10 pits THE TRADES UNION Congress yesterday challenged the government's claim that the 10 pits chosen for closure were loss-making. Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, wrote to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, saying figures obtained from British Coal suggested that only four of the 10 pits made a loss in the financial year 1991-92. In at least one case, it was the result of investment expenditure. Overall, the 10 pits made an operating profit of Pounds 3.3m for the year. He said the cost of closing the pits was estimated at Pounds 394m. The figures gave 'sufficient evidence that parliament should not accept Mr Heseltine's statement at face value'. Mr Willis has sent copies of his letter to all MPs urging them to examine the figures, and his '10 important questions' about the pit closures, before the Commons vote today. British Coal said it did not publish profit-and-loss figures for individual mines and did not know where the TUC had obtained its numbers. It said it could not provide a figure for the performance of the 10 pits in 1991-92. The corporation reiterated that the 10 pits had made a loss of more than Pounds 31m in the financial year since April, and that none was viable according to any economic scenario. It refused to give a pit-by-pit breakdown of performance. British Coal added that while economic factors determined how much coal production had to be lost overall, it had not used solely economic criteria to determine which individual pits should be closed or kept open. The corporation said it examined a range of factors. They had included: mining conditions and the geology of each pit; the quality of seams and the ease of opening new faces; the age of mines and equipment; how long output could be sustained at certain levels; the quality and chemical composition of the coal; the geographical position of a mine in relation to customers; and the size of its reserves. Having assessed the pits in that way, it then made a list of the 31 pits most suitable for closure to achieve the necessary reduction in production. They fell into three categories. Ten pits - those due to close after the 90-day consultation period - were felt not to have a role to play under any economic scenario, because they were making a loss before the drop in total revenue that British Coal will suffer when new power contracts come into force next year. The remaining 21 fell into two categories: those that were profit-able to some degree - based on the revenue British Coal was presently receiving - but that would not be profitable after next year's drop in revenues; and those that would still be theoretically profitable, even after the drop in revenues, but which simply did not have a market for their coal. The corporation would not disclose which pits fell into the second and third categories - probably to avoid giving any hint of which might be next in the 'phased' closures that are likely at the end of the moratorium in the new year. For the 10 pits, there seems little chance of a reprieve. British Coal emphasised that it was merely fulfilling its obligations under the 1975 Employment Protection Act to give 90 days' notice of redundancies. Mr John Major, the prime minister, offered a glimmer of hope for the remaining 21 pits, with his suggestions in the Commons that the pit review would be more wide-ranging that first thought. He said that he would give the 'fullest co-operation' for any inquiry launched by the Commons trade and industry committee, and views 'on all matters' would be taken into consideration. Observers suggest that that means power generators and other industries may be involved. Mr Major added that Mr Heseltine would also be taking further evidence into consideration alongside the information already collected. He said a full report would be submitted to the Commons before any debate. After last night's defeat in the Lords, Mr Willis said: 'There must be an official, preferably written, statement now. There will be no stability until Mr Major announces a full independent review of all the pits and the whole range of energy policy. 'The moratorium must include all the pits. We still have 10 of them that appear to be being sacrificed to save face when what we want to do is to save the pits and get common sense back on the rails. 'This defeat does give him an opportunity to make a clear statement and a fresh start.'</p>

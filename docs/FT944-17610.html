			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Businesses giving delegates the Tory treatment - Exhibition space for the 1995 Brighton conference is almost sold out, says Roland Rudd, with companies flocking to woo Labour supporters If you are a company director sufficiently impressed by Mr Tony Blair's new modern Labour party to want to take an exhibition stall at next year's Labour conference you had better hurry. Most of the stands for 1995 are sold out. More businesses advertised at this year's Labour conference in Blackpool than ever before. So the party's corporate affairs team raised the minimum price from Pounds 2,500 to almost Pounds 3,000 and by Tuesday morning had sold more than 90 per cent of available space for next year's conference in Brighton. Business is taking Labour seriously. And Labour is taking the business of making money equally seriously. Never mind that Mr Frank Dobson, transport spokesman, when speaking to the conference likened Mr Bob Horton, chairman of Railtrack, to the fat controller in Thomas the Tank Engine and said he was not up to his job. That was just politics - Mr Dobson was telling the delegates what they wanted to hear. Neither side took offence. Railtrack has just booked one of the biggest exhibition stands for next year. The company, which wants to be privatised quickly, is keen to get its message over to as many Labour people as possible. Ms Lorraine Satchell, Labour's exhibitions organiser, is delighted to take its money. Most delegates taking part in the party's transport debate spoke out against the break-up and privatisation of British Rail. That did not deter Regional Railways, created as a prelude to privatisation, from taking an exhibition stand at Labour's conference. Mr Steve Hutchinson, the company's advertising account manager, said: 'Irrespective of people's views of privatisation we wanted to position ourselves as a well-run company.' The same is true of Nuclear Electric, which took a double stand. Its management has publicly asked to be privatised but decided to advertise at the conference in spite of Labour hostility to privatisation. Even the management of National Power and PowerGen, the electricity generators criticised by Labour for directors' big salaries and share options, were discretely wining and dining selected MPs in Blackpool hotels. Some big companies have decided to advertise their businesses at a Labour conference for the first time. Sainsbury and Tesco, the food retailers, took prime stands and have already booked stalls for next year. Mr Nigel Matthew, Sainsbury's group secretary, said the company had become more aware of the importance of communicating to the big political parties. 'With Labour controlling so many more local authorities we have to be more accessible to the party,' he said. Mr Bernard Hughes, Tesco's corporate affairs manager, said his company wanted to start a dialogue with Labour councillors. The food retailers are particularly critical of the Department of the Environment's decision to withhold future planning permission for out-of-town supermarkets and are keen to tell Labour how many jobs will be created from their continued expansion into the green belt. As one food retailing manager said: 'Let's face it, with Labour likely to form the next government its become more important than ever to talk to Labour politicians.' British Airways has long booked space at Labour conferences. This year it took to advertising its club-class seats. 'This is a party full of aspiration, so why shouldn't we be telling them about our new club-class seats?' asked a BA spokesman. If wanting to be treated the same as a well-heeled Tory counts as aspiration then BA has a point. Mr David Clark, the party's defence spokesman, last year led a revolt against BA serving ordinary white wine at its Labour conference reception when he discovered that the airline was offering champagne to the Tories. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, quickly got the point, and this year made sure Labour MPs were offered the company's own blend of Piper Heidsieck champagne reserved for first-class passengers.</p>

			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Angola hovers between recovery and the abyss IT HAS the makings of a nightmare, concluded a senior western diplomat in Luanda after reviewing obstacles in the way of multi-party elections in Angola on September 29-30. One year after President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Mr Jonas Savimbi, the Unita rebel leader, agreed to end a 16-year civil war, the military disengagement programme is in trouble, election preparations are inadequate and the UN monitoring team is overstretched. The stakes are high. A successful poll would be a milestone in southern Africa's peace process; failure to hold free and fair elections will dash hopes of a regional recovery in which oil-rich Angola could play an important role. The past year has left Angola poised between recovery and fresh disaster. In many respects, a remarkable transformation has taken place in a country which has been at war since independence in 1975. The ceasefire has held, roads once too dangerous to travel have opened up, and the ruling MPLA has completed an ideological somersault, abandoning Marxism and moving towards a market-driven economy. Old allies have been abandoned and former enmities put aside. The 50,000 Cuban soldiers who fought alongside the MPLA in the battle against Unita and South Africa have long gone, seemingly forgotten, and a Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.6bn) arms debt to the former Soviet Union has been repudiated. Pragmatism has turned Pretoria from adversary to trading partner, and visiting South African businessmen wax enthusiastic about a market funded by diamond receipts and oil exports of more than 500,000 barrels a day and rising. But the peace agreement which underpins a fragile recovery is under severe strain. The pact called on soldiers and guerrillas from the rival armies to report to 50 assembly points, to be monitored by UN forces, before being demobilised or entering an integrated national army. Implementation of the accord is deeply flawed, UN officers concede privately. Both sides, they suspect, have prepared arms caches while the demobilisation exercise itself is well behind schedule. The creation of an integrated national force has hardly begun, although August was the completion date. The prospect of an election taking place before the disengagement of two bitter foes is complete is, in itself, the stuff of nightmares. But difficulties are being compounded by the weak bureaucracy's delay in establishing the administrative framework for what will be the first multi-party poll since independence. Despite repeated urging by western diplomats and UN officials, it was not until the weekend that the government appointed an electoral commission. It has not yet begun the registration of voters among a population of some 10m, in a country five times the size of Great Britain. The over-riding problem, say local diplomats, is the fact that the MPLA, acutely short of skilled personnel, is using the little it has to perform the rudimentary functions of government and conduct the party's fight for its political survival. It cannot run the election as well. Many diplomats conclude that unless there is additional external help, the poll will either have to be delayed or would be so poorly organised as to lack credibility. Part of the answer, they believe, is to boost the strength and extend the role of the existing UN presence in Angola, operating under the mandate of last year's Security Council Resolution 747. A UN team, expected to total 600 by polling day, is monitoring the transition and preparing to observe the election. No fewer than 10 times that number supervised neighbouring Namibia's transition to independence in 1989. Ms Margaret Anstee, the official in charge of the UN operation in Angola, has no illusions about the task ahead. 'I have to fly a 747 with only enough fuel for a DC3,' she says. It is tempting to add that, without more fuel, Angola's transition to democracy could be heading for a crash landing.</p>

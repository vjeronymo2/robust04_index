			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Final act looms as theatre row moves to Austrian political stage A BITTER controversy surrounding the Vienna Burgtheater, Austria's leading theatre, has pitted the country's cultural establishment against the chancellor and one of his ministers. The leaders of the actors' council at the theatre resigned this week to protest against the decision by Mr Rudolf Scholten, the minister of education and cultural affairs, to renew the contract of Mr Claus Peymann, the theatre's controversial director. The actors, including Klaus Maria Brandauer, accused Mr Peymann of mismanagement, falling attendance, cost overruns and general neglect of the actors' interests. 'This enterprise is not being managed,' said Mr Franz Morak, the chairman of the actors' council. 'The situation at the Burg is one big scandal.' Mr Peymann's foes are backed by most of the country's conservative newspapers and the OVP Christian Democratic party, junior partner in the governing coalition. The row has added to the tensions in the fragile coalition. Leading OVP politicians immediately denounced Mr Scholten's decision, while Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, a Social Democrat, is backing his former personal assistant. Clashes over cultural issues in Austria serve as surrogate battle for deep-seated political conflicts. The criticism against Peymann is filled with anti-German and wider xenophobic sentiments, echoing the emotions that helped elect Mr Kurt Waldheim as president in 1986 despite damaging revelations about his war record. Not surprisingly, Mr Peymann has been in the forefront of the anti-Waldheim movement, staging a number of plays critical of Austrians' role during the Nazi period. The 55-year-old Mr Peymann has been at the centre of controversy since moving from the German town of Bochum to Vienna to assume his prestigious post in 1986. Theatre critics praise him for his innovative style which has helped to turn the venerable and often stodgy theatre into the most creative stage in the German-speaking world. But Viennese audiences have been less excited about Peymann's ideas  - especially the actors he brought with him from Germany and who have driven away many of the local favourites of the stage. The attacks against Peymann reached a climax in recent weeks as his contract came up for renewal. While Peymann seems set to win the latest clash with his actors and stay on as director, he is on the losing end on a more symbolic issue. Unable to block Peymann's reappointment, the OVP has been holding up his application for Austrian citizenship.</p>

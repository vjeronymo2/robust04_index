			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / UK Company News In Brief: Dassault order book gives chairman hope MR SERGE Dassault, the chairman of French aircraft manufacturer Dassault Aviation, said the company was experiencing a difficult period, but that recent restructuring measures and an order book equivalent to three years' revenue made him hopeful for the future. 'We can manage until the first orders come in for the Rafale and the Falcon 2000, around 1995,' Mr Dassault said. 'The situation would have been catastrophic had we been indebted - which isn't the case - and if we hadn't anticipated workload problems,' he added. Last year, the state-controlled aerospace group saw net profit drop to FFr263.9m (Dollars 55.20m) from FFr374.2m a year before. Last June, Dassault said 1992 revenue was likely to be little changed from the FFr14.35bn posted for 1991. He dismissed rumours of an eventual rapprochement with state-owned Aerospatiale, another aircraft producer. ***** Wagons-Lits, Franco-Belgian subsidiary of Accor, has formed a joint venture with the Italian state railroad to operate night trains, AP-DJ reports from Paris. The joint-venture, to be called Treni Notturni (Treno), will begin operating in January 1993 and will operate and market the existing overnight train service in Italy in addition to future hotel-trains. The companies will create an investment company to which both parties will contribute their own rolling stock. The new venture is expected to carry 11m passengers on 1,600 cars in the first year of operation. Estimated revenues will be L750bn (Dollars 6.7bn). The move will help the Italian railroads rationalise their night train service, cutting costs significantly. ***** Mr Hans Rausing, a member of the family which founded and owns Tetra Pak, Sweden's large packaging company, will step down as chief executive when the company joins operations with Alfa-Laval on January 1 1993, Reuter reports from Stockholm. He will remain chairman of the group. Mr Lars Hallden, president of the Alfa-Laval group, is appointed new chief executive to the group, named Tetra Laval Group. The group will have a combined turnover of Dollars 8.5bn in 1992. Tetra Pak bought dairy and food processing group Alfa-Laval in 1991 for Dollars 2.5bn. The two have been operating separately pending a decision to merge operations.</p>

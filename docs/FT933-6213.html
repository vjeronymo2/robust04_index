			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Arts: An Inspector Calls - Aldwych Theatre Fog everywhere. The bleak house of Birling floats above the dank Yorkshire mists until An Inspector Calls at the Aldwych Theatre. Stephen Daldry's fine, dark production has transferred from the National Theatre. The superb design by Ian MacNeil makes JB Priestley's play into a nightmare of shadowy rain drizzling around the bright bourgeois home of the Birling family, northern manufacturers. The theatre-noir opens with the score from Hitchcock's Vertigo. Priestley's 1944 vision of social conscience gradually works its end on the characters, exposing their shame and guilt in the suicide of a girl they all know. The Inspector's calling card carries the message: 'We don't live alone. We are members of one society. We are responsible for each other.' There are excellent strong performances from Julian Glover as Birling, the family patriarch, and Kenneth Cranham as Inspector Goole his implacable opposite. Sylvestra le Touzel plays Birling's daughter and Judy Parfitt his wife, a horror in red taffeta. This is first-rate Priestley played with atmosphere, purpose, style, and wit: Priestley's original setting was 'an evening in spring' - more like a season in hell.

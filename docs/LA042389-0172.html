			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MORE PEOPLE ARE PAYING TO JUMP INTO HOT WATER BUT ARE SPAS WORTH IT?  </P> <P> Bobbing in the big, old-fashioned tub, toes hooked over a water spout to keep  from capsizing as tiny bubbles effervesce up the length of a sore spine, it's  hard to worry whether this is just what the doctor ordered.  </P> <P> "If you don't have anything wrong with you, if you lead a strenuous life, it's  just for relaxation," said bathhouse attendant Gertrude Zorn.  </P> <P> Otherwise, said Zorn, who for 15 years has been drawing the water for the tub  and returning to wrap the client in a hot sheet when it's time to get out, the  bubbly float on naturally carbonated water is good for arthritis, rheumatism  and bad backs.  </P> <P> The bathhouses -- with their white tile walls, ceiling fans and small  individual suites with giant tubs -- look as though they haven't changed from  the 1930s, when the state decided the area's carbonated waters were a natural  resource.  </P> <P> Nothing trendy here, especially the price: $8.75 for the soak, room and  attention.  </P> <P> But elsewhere, spas are an old-fashioned idea gone yuppie -- and a  multimillion-dollar business. For many, the spa is the chrome-and-glass spot  where you ride exercise machines in a fuchsia leotard. It can mean being  floated in a seawater tub or swathed in an herbal wrap.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bookings Triple  </P> <P> Jeffrey Joseph, a New York entrepreneur who jumped in just as the water was  heating up, said his travel agency has tripled in both staff and bookings since  he began specializing in spa vacations a year and a half ago.  </P> <P> Joseph, owner of Spa-Finders Travel Arrangements Ltd., estimates that in five  years, the number of spas in this country has increased from 30 to 150 and is  still growing.  </P> <P> About 1.2 million Americans spend $700 million to $800 million annually going  to spas, Joseph estimated. The majority of his clients, who spend about $1,000  for a week's retreat, are low-level female executives in their 30s.  </P> <P> Is the new emphasis on physical conditioning simply a fad, or is it really good  for one's health?  </P> <P> Are you ready for this? Spending $1,000 to $3,500 week at a spa can be as  healthful as sitting at home in your rocker or taking a hot shower, according  to both a cardiologist and a sports psychologist.  </P> <P> "Does it feel good to go sit in a whirlpool or a hot mineral bath? Of course it  feels good," said psychologist Eric Margenau of New York City.  </P> <P> "Does it serve a medicinal purpose? I haven't seen any evidence of that."  </P> <P> What about stress management? That's the new buzz word, Joseph said.  </P> <P> The experts say any form of relaxation and exercise will do if you plan for it  and do it regularly. If you go off once a year, expecting an expensive vacation  to be your lifeline for the next 12 months, you're in trouble.  </P> <P> "I like spas, they're great. But I've been to great dude ranches that I've come  back from just as refreshed," said Margenau, author of a new book called  "Sports Without Pressure."  </P> <P> Dr. James M. Rippe, the cardiologist who heads the Exercise Physiology  Laboratory at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester,  echoed that. He said people must not delude themselves that "they can go twice  a year and make up for the excesses of the rest of the year."  </P> <P> Joseph, whose agency has sent nearly 4,000 clients to spas around the world  since March 1987, said the better resorts work on behavior modification. In  other words, they don't just put a client in an aerobics class or on a diet,  "they have a whole program on stress management and healthy living, things to  take home with you."  </P> <P> Spas as places to take mineral waters go back at least as far as the Romans.  </P> <P> In Europe and Japan, people have been spa-minded for centuries. One town in  Japan -- Beppu, known for boiling ponds that shoot mud into the air -- gets 12  million visitors each year, Joseph said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Granddaddy of Spas  </P> <P> In this country, traditional spas with a chic clientele were booming before the  turn of the century, places like Mineral Wells, Tex.; Hot Springs, Ark.; White  Sulphur Springs, W. Va., and Calistoga, Calif.  </P> <P> Saratoga, the granddaddy of American spas whose medicinal springs were  discovered in the late 18th Century, was long a social hot spot with its added  cache of a thoroughbred racing season.  </P> <P> Nowadays, Margenau sees the proliferation of spas as part of a burgeoning  "stress industry."  </P> <P> "The whole business is blown up way out of proportion. There is a whole economy  built up around stress reduction, the new American fads: spas, contraptions, a  $1,000 worth of vitamins."  </P> <P> Instead of those remedies, he recommends altering day-to-day patterns to defuse  pressure. Slow down, he said, take a longer lunch, schedule exercise.  </P> <P> "Yes, stress exists. It always has. But most of the stresses are very easily  remedied."  </P> <P> "Every man's spa is his shower," said Rippe, the author of many medical and  fitness books.  </P> <P> The medical school professor cites his own studies and those of colleagues that  indicate that showers and sitting in a recliner can reduce tension and anxiety  and that blood pressure is reduced by regular programs of walking.  </P> <P> Barbara Sloan, a confirmed spa-goer, isn't interested in hearing that she could  have stayed home and taken a shower.  </P> <P> "It was wonderful," she said of a posh Florida spa. "A massage was part of  every day. The food, absolutely out of this world."  </P> <P> Joseph's catalogue says a week at the resort Sloan visited also included greens  fees, herbal wrap, salt-glo loofa scrub, hairdo, makeup, manicure, pedicure and  lectures -- all for $1,970.  </P> <P> "A spa," said Sloan, president of a New Jersey public relations firm, "means  attention and luxury.  </P> <P> "Plush towels, beautiful locker rooms, pampering. If you have to wait for a  massage appointment, they give you a cup of bouillon," she said.  </P> <P> "I can't imagine it was not good for you."  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLANS UNVEILED FOR 450-ACRE DEVELOPMENT IN MONTEBELLO HILLS;  </P> <P> PLANNING: CITY COUNCIL GETS ITS FIRST LOOK AT CHEVRON'S PROPOSAL FOR AN 'URBAN  VILLAGE' TO REPLACE FADING HILLSIDE OIL FIELD.  </P> <P> A developer has unveiled plans to replace the scrub brush and oil wells of  Montebello Hills -- one of the last major chunks of undeveloped terrain in  southeast Los Angeles County -- with an "urban village" of houses, townhouses  and condominiums.  </P> <P> A neighborhood shopping center, parks, a school, fire station and senior  housing also would be included in the 450-acre project planned by Chevron Land  &amp; Development Co.  </P> <P> "We hope we will be able to bring to Montebello a new and exciting community,"  said Gary Weaver, project manager for Chevron, which owns the site.  </P> <P> City Council members, who viewed the plans for the first time last week, said  development of the hills is probably the most important issue they will address  this decade, because it will forever change the face of the city.  </P> <P> "This is probably the last time we will have such an opportunity," Councilman  Art Payan said. "It will have a major impact on the quality of life in  Montebello, whether we put in more commercial projects, more housing, more open  space. All the possibilities will impact this city and the people who live  here."  </P> <P> The site is in a redevelopment area created by the city in 1976, which allows  the city to participate in the planning, said Linda Payan, economic development  director.  </P> <P> Chevron's initial plans -- which were designed by J. L. Webb Planning Inc., a  Costa Mesa-based planning firm specializing in hillside development -- call for  building a $600-million village of homes, townhouses and condominiums, with  prices starting at $200,000.  </P> <P> The residences are to be within easy reach of a neighborhood shopping center,  three parks, an elementary school, a senior citizen housing complex and a fire  station.  </P> <P> According to the plans, the Montebello Hills would be reshaped so that the  village rises above the rest of the community, offering scenic views in every  direction. Only Montebello and Paramount boulevards would run through the  project, keeping traffic in the nearby La Merced area at a minimum and giving  the village exclusive isolation.  </P> <P> Weaver said Chevron, which is responsible for financing the project, has been  working on the plans for about a year. "These are very preliminary plans," he  said. "At this point, we're basically trying to feel our way through."  </P> <P> Weaver said a residential development was selected because it fits best with  the city's zoning laws and General Plan.  </P> <P> He said Chevron plans to develop the site in stages, as oil wells dry out. The  first portion, along the northeastern slope of hills bordered by San Gabriel  Boulevard, is scheduled to be graded in 1992. The second portion, on  northwestern slopes south of Montebello Boulevard, is scheduled for 1995. The  third portion, in the center, is scheduled for grading in 1998.  </P> <P> Mark Rogers, vice president of J. L. Webb, told council members that if the  development were built without any changes, about 6,000 more people would be  living in Montebello.  </P> <P> Council members said they are excited and impressed by the initial plans but  expressed some reservations.  </P> <P> "It's a good first offer, but I think we will hold out for more," Mayor Ed  Pizzorno said.  </P> <P> Pizzorno and council members Kathy Salazar, Payan and William Molinari said  they are concerned that the plans would increase the population density of the  city too much. According to the Los Angeles County Department of Regional  Planning, as of January, 1989, Montebello was the 39th most crowded city in the  county, with 6,800 people per square mile. The town's population is about  57,000. Recently, the council passed a moratorium on construction in  high-density areas to control development.  </P> <P> Molinari and Pizzorno said they believe that Rogers' estimate that about 6,000  people would move to the area, based on a calculation of 3.2 people per home,  is too low for the Southeast area.  </P> <P> "The demographics in this area don't support only 3.2 people per home,"  Molinari said. "What they've got planned up there gives us a density factor  that is totally excessive. They are trying to squeeze too many homes up there."  </P> <P> Council members said they want to be sure that the city's police, parks and  recreation and other services would not be overburdened. Economic development  chief Payan said the city is hiring a financial consultant to determine what  additional city services would be needed with such a development.  </P> <P> Council members said they are also concerned that the land set aside for  commercial development and open space may be inadequate.  </P> <P> According to the plans, about 15 of the 450 acres have been set aside for  parks. Each park averages about five acres, but one is on the elementary school  property, so students can use the park during the day, and another holds a city  water tank.  </P> <P> "That's a minimal amount of open space," Molinari said. "It would be a tragedy  if we didn't provide more. Even if they double it, I don't think it would be  enough."  </P> <P> The plans also call for one 15-acre neighborhood shopping center at the  southwest corner of Montebello and Paramount boulevards, which council members  said is not enough shopping.  </P> <P> "I favor as much commercial as possible," Payan said.  </P></p>

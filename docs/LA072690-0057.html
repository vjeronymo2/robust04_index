			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DANCING AROUND A CONCERT PROBLEM  </P> <P> Lo-Tec concerts can make for strange bedfellows. This weekend at Three's  Company's Hillcrest studio is a case in point.  </P> <P> Improvisation Inc. was scheduled to share the program with San Diego-based  Pamela Turner at 8:30 p.m. Saturday and Sunday evening. Pairing Turner's  powerful dance drama with some improvised kinetics imported from Santa Barbara  was not exactly a marriage made in heaven. But it was a practical solution for  Lo-Tec organizer, Jean Isaacs, who hoped to flesh out the evening's  entertainment by adding Turner's 45-minute piece (which played to sold-out  houses at Sushi last year) with another work.  </P> <P> The improv troupe said it didn't have enough dancers and pulled out of the  commitment earlier this month, leaving the Lo-Tec series holding the bag.  Fortunately, Three's Company's resident choreographers and a few of its company  dancers came to the rescue with a mini-concert to balance Turner's portion of  the program.  </P> <P> This weekend's surprise appearance comes as a windfall for Three's Company fans  because the troupe was not scheduled for any Lo-Tec appearances this summer. In  fact, the city's leading modern dance troupe had no plans to dance on home turf  until next January.  </P> <P> The most exciting contribution from the Three's Company camp promises to be  Isaacs' "Red Dress, White Dress," which features a pair of solos never  performed in San Diego. Featuring Terry Wilson and Faith Jensen-Ismay, the  dance made its debut during the troupe's recent  </P> <P> Switzerland tour, and Isaacs believes it reflects her foreign experience.  </P> <P> "We're pleased it worked out this way," she said in a break from rehearsals,  "because we want to show what we're doing. I choreographed the piece in Europe  to the German expressionist music of Kurt Weill, and it's very affected by my  being in Europe."  </P> <P> A reprise of Nancy McCaleb's twosome, "Aelia Laelia Crispis," with Kim Chidley  and Denise Dabrowski doing the dancing, is also on the bill.  </P> <P> In sharp contrast to the two offerings by Three's Company, the flip side of the  concert -- Turner's "Choices" -- pits a pair of actors (Rick Meads and Veronica  Murphy-Smith) against dancers Tonnie Haig and Greg Adams.  </P> <P> "That's the challenge I put before myself," said Turner. The San Diego dance  maker moves freely between the world of theater (she's resident choreographer  for the Lamb's Players) and concert dance. This work combines the two sides of  her dance persona.  </P> <P> "I find it intriguing to mix the two mediums and somehow get a cohesive blend  that doesn't make either one incomplete. I enjoy working with actors and  dancers They surprise me."  </P> <P> By coincidence, Turner's theater designs for "The Wind in the Willows" will be  playing concurrently at the Lamb's National City playhouse, while Turner's  modern dance drama plays out in the Hillcrest studio.  </P> <P> But as the dance maker acknowledged, creating concert dance is still a "driving  need, and I feel privileged that my work is good enough to team up with Three's  Company's."  </P></p>

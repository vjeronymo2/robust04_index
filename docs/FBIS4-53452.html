			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- An abrupt government  decision Wednesday [18 May] to freeze hikes of public service  charges until the year-end came as a surprise to Nippon  Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) and other enterprises  concerned, industry sources said.    Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata ordered the freeze and the  government will ask local authorities to follow suit, Chief  Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said.    NTT, which plans to raise basic telephone charges by an  average 18 percent, said the company will follow decisions by  public hearings and an advisory panel at the Posts and  Telecommunications Ministry.    Company officials, however, said they were upset by the  government's decision, which will have an impact on the  company's business performance.    The nonlife insurance industry also said it was surprised by  the decision. Takashi Onoda, head of the Marine and Fire  Insurance Association of Japan, told reporters the industry was  considerably upset by it.    The decision came as nonlife insurers applied to the Finance  Ministry for approval of their plans to raise fire insurance  rates, effective July 1.    Major nonlife insurance companies said they did not know  immediately what impact the decision would have on their  business.    Kohei Abe, president of the Federation of Electric Power  Companies, said member companies will decide whether to revise  utility charges at their own discretion.    The power companies will keep lower rates until September to  return foreign exchange gains to consumers.</p>

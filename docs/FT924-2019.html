			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Richards lapses into the red RICHARDS, the Aberdeen-based textile group which is trying to restructure its way out of recession, turned a Pounds 434,000 pre-tax profit into a Pounds 125,000 deficit in the 12 months to September 30. Although turnover was held at Pounds 72m, operating profit fell from Pounds 1.26m to Pounds 125,000. The group spent Pounds 250,000, taken an an exceptional charge, in repositioning its shirt brands upwards, out of the more competitive middle market. The Pounds 1.28m cost of the disposal of the Irish-based linen manufacturing operation was taken below the line. Mr Brian Gilbert, chairman, said the collapse in consumer confidence and home spending on furnishings since April made for the worst trading period so far encountered in the recession. The proposed final dividend is held at 2.93p to maintain the total for the year at 4p, again uncovered by earnings of 0.15p (2.25p) per share.</p>

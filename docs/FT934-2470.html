			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Technology: A revolutionary ticket to ride - Claire Gooding looks at London Underground's new system for the management of fares in a series on getting the most out of software / Software at Work You can lie,' say the Underground posters, 'but your ticket can't'. The magnetic strip on the back of the Tube ticket holds a wealth of information used in Automatic Fare Collection (AFC). Often crumpled to the point of extinction, the card is actually a vital engineering component in London Underground's efforts to protect its revenue. Fraud on the Tube is estimated at Pounds 30m annually. The ticket is not just proof of a contract to travel: it can prove where and when in the system you travelled. Already, it is used to claim refunds on delayed journeys. In the future it could provide discounts and 'stored value' credit. Like the rest of the Underground, ticket technology is straitjacketed by the legacy of the past, and every investment has to be viewed with an eye to the future. This month, a new system goes into full operation which puts into place the basis for future management of fares. Called Divorced (mostly because the old system it replaces is known as Romance), it speeds up financial reporting and provides the vital ticket-derived information used in fraud detection. During tests it helped to estimate lost revenue during the recent power cuts, including refunded fares for 20,000 delayed travellers. David Field, the AFC engineer for London Underground enjoys a challenge, which is just as well. Keeping the Tube running on its worn-out tracks with ancient trains and a dodgy power supply might be thought challenging enough. 'We have this undying belief that you can keep things working for 60 years and more. And you can, if you spend money at the right time.' Field specialises in introducing new technology into this scenario at minimum cost and disruption. He is responsible for both the 'heavy metal' end of AFC, the automatic ticket-vending machines, the gates themselves (once dubbed 'Rottweilers'), and the hardware and software underpinning them. He sums up AFC's role succinctly. 'Reducing costs while improving service is what we do - freeing money for other things.' In information technology, he looks to spend the absolute minimum, and he wants 'building blocks' that will contribute to future plans. Field's customers are not those careless commuters who jam crumpled tickets in his high-technology gates, but the accountants in the London Underground revenue office. Automation started in 1964, with the first machine at Acton, west London. Much of the equipment replaced by the gates originated in the 1920s, and it took until 1987 to complete the process. When Field came to London Underground in 1985, the ticketing system was already specified and he had to implement it. Stations built in the last century cannot always be adapted for automatic gating, but they can all be connected to a central computer, and most can benefit from passenger-operated ticket issuing machines. These, and the Ticket Office Machines (Toms) behind the counter are linked to a central system which feeds real-time operational and maintenance systems as well as revenue-tracking. Field takes a global view of what is possible in public transport, fuelled by his seven years' experience in the Hong Kong Mass Transit system, which was built from scratch and completed in 1979. One of his dream tickets is the idea of 'stored value' already used in Washington DC. A re-usable smart card, resembling a credit card, could be recharged with cash, and automatically debited on buses and taxis as well as the Tube. Field is only too aware of the practical implications of extending such a system to the entire transport network. The project is currently out to tender and would need an investment of tens of millions of pounds. Every station would need validation, and tickets would need a machine-readable unique identifier, technically quite easy to add to the current numbering system. Most of the information is already there, partly because of information systems that have paved the way to future developments. 'I managed to convince the management that a holistic approach was essential,' says Field. 'It became obvious that, like everything else, the computer system was wearing out.' The target was to show revenue within 24 hours. But, as Field explains: 'Under the old system, if you buy your ticket at 9am on Monday, that doesn't show on the revenue system until Wednesday morning. It concerned our financial director that he couldn't reconcile what was banked with the figures from the computer. And when we explained the security risks they were taking, they were aghast.' New computers installed for data collection provided some extra capacity. This gave the AFC department a chance to put together software which would not only upgrade the old revenue system with 24-hour reporting, but do some 'contingency planning'. This included catering for penalty fares - the on-the-spot Pounds 10 fine planned for April 1994 - and line target monitoring, which allows operational assessment of the ticket machines. 'We know penalty fares are coming along. We realised that much of the management reporting, from both the engineering and operating viewpoint, was not as efficient as it might be. People were using the PC route to get around that, and transposing data, which is clumsy. The Divorced software will eventually give us a seamless system.' Currently, the control centre - into which the ticket-issuing machines report several times a minute - uses an array of screens, and the controller has to retype log information from one to another. There were other considerations besides the revenue backlog. New requests were becoming common, as Peter Cruickshank, the AFC software manager, explains. 'There was a continuous flow of requests from the network planning office about the types of ticket sold, and so on. The Romance system would have needed major updates to cater for them.' Cruickshank's previous experience with fourth-generation languages (4GL) suggested that a 4GL might provide a low-cost solution. This would allow flexibility for end users, and provide a platform for future developments. Performance as well as ease of use was important. After rigorous benchmarking, the AFC department selected PowerHouse, from Cognos. As ever, the specification did not stand still: 'standard' reports mushroomed from 20 to 69, and new ideas were adopted during development. A daily user of the system, and now manager of Divorced, end-user Mike Dennis of the revenue office worked closely with the developers. His swift demonstration shows how the system can now track the 700,000 daily ticket sales, showing everything from the throughput of particular gates, to excess fares, car-park takings and a detailed report on a ticket issued the day before. 'It took six months to get to what we have now, and it does far more than we originally specified.' That flexibility has been the main benefit of using a 4GL,' says Dennis. Apart from penalties and refunds, existing complex fares will become more innovative, using timings and zonings for discounts. In effect, London Underground has all the information in place for a revolutionary approach to fares. BUZZWORDS PUBLIC OPERATED MACHINES (Poms) are automatic ticket-issuing machines which include Few Fare Machines and Multi-Fare Machines. The Poms report automatically to a control centre, which is monitored 24 hours a day. TICKET OFFICE MACHINES (Toms) are operated by the clerk. COMPANY SNAPSHOT Nature of business: London Underground serves the London region with a network of 273 stations, 10 lines and 254 miles of track, providing 2.5m passenger journeys daily. Investment in new projects such as the Jubilee Line extension to Docklands (Pounds 1.8bn) takes place against a struggle to maintain an ageing infrastructure. Employees: 17,000 Turnover: During 1992-93, income was Pounds 642m, with operating costs of Pounds 621m. It has a lower investment by government than any other underground railway in the world: Pounds 373m this year for the entire London transport network including buses and Tube. Key personnel: Dennis Tunnicliffe, managing director; Alan Watkins, chairman; Nick Agnew, revenue support manager; David Field, AFC engineer; Peter Cruickshank, AFC software manager. TECHNOLOGY FILE Software: The Divorced System was written in six months using the Cognos fourth-generation language PowerHouse and Digital's Rdb database.  Explained as Diverse Integration and Verification of Revenue Collection Electronic Data, its name really derives from the Romance revenue system it replaces: an application written in Pick Basic and running on two Fujitsu minicomputers.  Rdb is used for the 'base data' on fares. Hardware: The Fujitsus are being replaced by a two-node cluster of Digital Equipment 4000/300 Vax minicomputers under the VMS operating system version 5.5. These were installed in July 1992 to upgrade the Data Gathering Centre, which collects real-time data from stations. Supplier:  Cognos, a US software house with a UK office in Bracknell won the business on the basis of a benchmark race that included databases from Oracle, Ingres and Digital, administered by an independent consultant, Wokingham-based LSI. Other Systems: Existing operational systems use a mixture of hardware including old Digital PDP-11s, used for station simulation.  There is a PDP-11 at most Tube stations: 274 installed at 248 stations, supporting 2,500 devices such as Poms and Toms (see Buzzwords), and the gates themselves. Cost: For the software alone the cost was Pounds 115,000 (with extra hardware accounting for Pounds 75,000), the cheapest of all possible solutions by about 30 per cent. Development was done in-house by Peter Cruickshank's team.  Total project cost is estimated at Pounds 360,000.</p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRELIMINARY HEARINGS RISK FAIRNESS FOR JUSTICE  </P> <P> It surely is no consolation to movie mogul Robert Evans -- named in court this  week as having ordered the 1983 murder of producer Roy Radin -- but defense  lawyers ardently support the California criminal procedure known as the  preliminary hearing.  </P> <P> It was during such a pretrial proceeding that a witness named William Rider  testified Tuesday that he had heard a defendant in the "Cotton Club" murder  case mention Evans' name in connection with Radin's killing.  </P> <P> While defense attorneys approve of the preliminary hearing system because it  gives them a chance to review prosecutors' cases, prosecutors often complain  that defense lawyers use them to endlessly drag on criminal cases. And for  those like Evans, accused of a murder during the proceeding without ever having  been formally charged, there is little legal recourse.  </P> <P> "What is said in a legal proceeding has absolute privilege," Los Angeles County  Public Defender Wilbur Littlefield said. "You can't file a defamation action.  You just have to take it. There's no question that it's unfair."  </P> <P> A preliminary hearing is a pretrial criminal procedure intended to satisfy a  judge that the government has sufficient evidence -- or probable cause -- to  prosecute a person. Thirty-two states, including California, require such  hearings, and 25 use them instead of grand juries.  </P> <P> In the "Cotton Club" case, four defendants are being charged with murdering  Radin, a New York theatrical producer. Although the former Paramount Pictures  production chief has not been charged in the case, prosecutors have pointedly  refused to rule him out as a murder suspect.  </P> <P> As a result, when Evans was called as the first witness in the preliminary  hearing, he declined to answer any questions on the advice of his attorney,  invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.  </P> <P> California's municipal courts conduct about 100,000 felony preliminary hearings  annually, at a cost of about $65 million. Most of them last less than half an  hour, although a few can drag on for many months, such as in the McMartin child  molestation case and the Night Stalker case here in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Supreme Court Ruling  </P> <P> In California, a 1978 state Supreme Court ruling granted criminal defendants  the right to have preliminary hearings even after an indictment by a grand  jury, whose proceedings take place behind closed doors. As a result of that  ruling, the use of grand juries to indict criminal suspects has become  practically a thing of the past.  </P> <P> Prosecutors generally are not critical of preliminary hearings per se, although  they often complain of their length, blaming defense lawyers.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Assistant Dist. Atty. Curt Livesay said he and many other  prosecutors throughout the state would like to go back to the option of using  either a grand jury indictment or a preliminary hearing, thus taking away a  defendant's right to preliminary hearing even after a grand jury indictment.  </P> <P> Had this option been available, Livesay said, a grand jury proceeding might  have prevented Evans' name from surfacing publicly as a possible murder  suspect.  </P> <P> In rare instances -- although not in the "Cotton Club" hearing -- a judge can  close a preliminary hearing to the public and the press. It can be done, for  instance, if a judge believes that a defendant's right to a fair and impartial  trial may be jeopardized by undue publicity resulting from the proceeding.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sufficient Suspicion  </P> <P> In preliminary hearings, the same rules of evidence generally apply as in  trials. At the end of the hearing, the presiding judge -- Municipal Judge Patti  Jo McKay in the "Cotton Club" case -- must decide whether a crime has been  committed and, if so, whether there is sufficient suspicion that a defendant  committed that crime.  </P> <P> If so, the judge will order the case transferred to Superior Court for  arraignment and trial. Otherwise, the case is dismissed.  </P> <P> Criminal defense lawyers tend to prefer preliminary hearings to grand jury  proceedings because, they say, it gives them a chance to preview the  prosecution's case, typically through extensive questioning of witnesses and a  thorough examination of documents.  </P> <P> "In preliminary hearings, you get a look at what you're up against. It's a very  fair system," said F. Lee Bailey, the Boston-based defense lawyer who  frequently appears in California courts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Expedite Proceedings  </P> <P> Preliminary hearings can also serve to expedite proceedings by prompting some  defendants to plea bargain, having been convinced of the strength of the  prosecution's case, said Charles Sevilla, a prominent San Diego criminal  defense lawyer.  </P> <P> Sevilla, Bailey and most defense lawyers are vigorous supporters of preliminary  hearings.  </P> <P> "I favor them," Bailey said. "They are terribly important. And yet, the  consequences can be very severe -- even if a person is eventually acquitted at  trial, especially if you are a businessman."  </P></p>

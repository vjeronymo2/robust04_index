			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Bustamante quits as Peru premier Mr Alfonso Bustamante, Peru's premier and trade and industry minister, has resigned in the wake of last week's controversial move by parliament and the executive against the autonomy of the Supreme Court. Mr Efrain Goldenberg, a businessman who has headed the foreign ministry for rather less than six months, replaces Mr Bustamante as premier. Mr Goldenberg joined the cabinet last September with no previous political background and no experience of diplomacy. Mr Bustamante also headed Promperu, the government body charged with improving Peru's tarnished image abroad and promoting exports. His resignation is linked to the passage of a law last week, under pressure from the military, switching jurisdiction over a case involving the killingof nine students and a professor from civilian courts to a secret military tribunal. President Alberto Fujimori promulgated the law, but Mr Bustamante refused to put his signature to it.</p>

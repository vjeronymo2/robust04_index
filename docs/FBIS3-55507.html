			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Spain's royal court has emphatically denied the  reports in some of the mass media that King Juan Carlos invited  Zhirinovskiy, the leader of Russia's Liberal Democratic Party,  to visit Spain. These reports are totally devoid of any  meaning, journalists were told by an official spokesman of the  royal court.    According to Spain's EFE agency, Zhirinovskiy had himself  spoken of the existence of the invitation to visit Spain, and  his close associate Aleksandr Vengerovskiy claimed that the  invitation had come through diplomatic channels.    Official circles in France recently reacted negatively to  the  intention of the Liberal Democratic Party leader to visit Paris  in February. Earlier he was asked to leave Bulgaria and not  allowed into Germany.</p>

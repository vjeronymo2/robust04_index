			<p>BFN     [Text] In the view of Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel,  Turkey must be openly reminded to keep human rights --  "especially because we have had friendly relations with Turkey  for decades, because it is our partner in NATO and has an  important bridging function." In an interview with BILD AM  SONNTAG, Kinkel said: "Yes, there are human rights violations  in Turkey."    Kinkel once again said that delinquent Kurds should only be  deported in absolutely exceptional cases. Anyone who commits a  crime belongs before a court and in prison. The government is  currently examining whether it is safeguarded that those that  are deported will not face torture, death penalties, or  anti-constitutional treatment.</p>

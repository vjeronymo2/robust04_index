			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OMAN PLANNING DEMOCRATIC STEP, WILL FORM CONSULTATIVE ASSEMBLY  </P> <P> The ruler of Oman, a key state in the international alliance against Iraq, took  a major step toward political reform Sunday by announcing plans for a  consultative assembly.  </P> <P> Sultan Kaboos ibn Said, who made the announcement in a speech marking the 20th  anniversary of his reign, said the assembly will be formed within a year.  </P> <P> "We have decided upon the formation of a consultative assembly in which all the  counties of the sultanate are to be represented," he said. The country has 42  counties.  </P> <P> The only other popular assembly among the rich Persian Gulf Arab states  disappeared in Kuwait under the tracks of Iraq's invading tanks on Aug. 2.  </P> <P> Omani officials said the means of choosing members of the assembly had not yet  been decided.  </P> <P> One official said it would be an elected legislature, unlike the existing State  Consultative Council, which has 52 appointed members from the central  government, the counties and the private sector. But others said it was not yet  clear if assembly members would be elected or appointed.  </P> <P> The assembly would "provide more opportunities for Omani citizens' wider  participation in the responsibilities and tasks in the construction of the  fatherland," the sultan said.  </P> <P> Officials and Western diplomatic analysts said the establishment of the  assembly would be a significant step for Oman, a member of the Gulf Cooperation  Council.  </P> <P> Oman is currently the head of the council, which also includes Bahrain, Qatar,  Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.  </P></p>

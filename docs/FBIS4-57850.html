			<p>BFN     [Text] A new branch of the Justicialist Party in the  Federal Capital and Buenos Aires province was launched yesterday  [24 May] by ultra-Menemists with deputy Erman Gonzalez and  Restaurant Workers Union leader Luis Barrionuevo at the helm.  The new faction, called Encuentro Peronista Bonaerense [Buenos  Aires Peronist Movement], was the idea of some 30 Peronist  political leaders and trade unionists. Barrionuevo told  reporters in a press conference that the main platform for the  new group would emphasize "getting back to Peronist basics such  as health, education and unemployment." Later, Gonzalez said  the group "will work in conjunction with the public and not via  the media, which only seems to cater to other interests."</p>

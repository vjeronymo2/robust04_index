			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Who is Deregulation For?"] </F>   [Text] Perhaps, Government Regulation No. 20/1994 was the  most controversial of a series of deregulation packages. The  regulation on foreign investment continues to generate different  opinions even six days after it was announced. Some believe  that the regulation has openly "sold out" Indonesia to foreign  investors. "We are not yet ready to accept foreign investment  to such an extent," they said.    The government has stated that the open doors for foreign  investment are meant neither to sell out the country nor to  serve the interests of a certain group. Nevertheless, the  general public is already "scared." This is normal because  sectors accessible by foreign investors are vital. They are  ports, power production, transmission, and distribution,  telecommunications, shipping, aviation, waterworks, railway,  atomic energy generation, and even the mass media.    On the one hand, this deregulation package is  understandable.  The government seems to be all out in harnessing the available  domestic potential to attract foreign investment. It is hoped  that the deregulation package will enable Indonesia to compete  with other countries which have opened their doors wider. In  this context, Government Regulation No. 20/1994 may also serve  as an indicator that the government has begun to feel the  constraints of shouldering development expenses by solely  relying on domestic funds.    On the other hand, however, the deregulation package has led  to a very basic question. Is our domestic condition ready for  it? First of all, let us see several outstanding domestic  economic problems! First, economic sectors are confined to a  certain business group. Second, domestic economic players lack  competitiveness and the spirit of entrepreneurship. Third, the  bureaucracy has yet to set regulations consistently. Fourth,  small-scale economic players remain in the backseat. Fifth, the  infrastructure is weak.    Thus, there are five problems. However, let us discuss just  two problems. Economic sectors are confined to a certain  business group and small-scale economic players remain in the  backseat. Is the domestic economy ready for the influx of  foreign investors? Won't there be an economic liberalization  that will eventually sacrifice small-scale economic players?    One thing is sure. The deregulation (liberalization) package  will lead to stronger competition among economic players in the  country, and we know that the weak, in this case small-scale  economic players, will surely become the victims under a very  liberal system. In the meantime, we have yet to enact an  anti-monopoly law although such a proposal has been made for  several times. In that case, how should we protect our  small-scale economic players who are already staggering?</p>

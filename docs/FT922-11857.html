			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: Present negatives and past positives equal uncertainty - Pakistani stocks are slipping, says Farhan Bokhari Pakistani stocks have entered an uncertain period, after a spectacular rise of 160 per cent in dollar terms last year. A series of negative factors at home and political uncertainty in neighbouring Afghanistan have prompted a fall of just over 20 per cent on the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) so far this year. For some brokers, a technical correction in the market was necessary after its rise to what they saw as unrealistically high levels last December. 'We consider this to be a temporary phase, not a crash at all, and we are looking for signs of recovery,' says one leading broker in Karachi. Earlier this year, the KSE was harmed by investigations by the Corporate Law Authority, the government's regulatory body, against at least 21 brokers for speculative buying. Since the investigations are continuing, other brokers have been deterred from the speculative activity which had fuelled the share price rises last year. The KSE's rally in 1991 was also helped by the launching of Pakistani country funds by Citicorp and Credit Lyonnais - these gave fresh international exposure to the market. However, there are few indications that any more foreign funds will be issued this year. A worldwide decline in cotton prices has also weighed on the stock market, since textile shares account for approximately one third of the 542 companies listed on the KSE. Pakistan's privatisation programme has fallen behind schedule and some investors are worried that plans for opening up the economy may not meet the government's targets. Compared with an initial goal of privatising 115 companies by the end of 1991, deals for roughly one third were finalised within that period, and the government is now trying to privatise the rest. Brokers say that investors are unwilling to enter the stock market for the time being, since their funds have been earmarked for further privatisation issues. Investors are waiting to see how the stock market will react to Pakistan's annual budget, which is due to be announced in the middle of May. Many businessmen expect the government to introduce new taxes in order to narrow its budget deficit. Another factor keeping investors on the sidelines is the possibility that Pakistani banks and other financial institutions may have to stop interest-based activities from June 30, if a federal Islamic court's ruling comes into effect. The ruling, handed down last December, requires all banks to eliminate pre-determined interest or usury, known as 'Riba', which is considered to be unlawful under Islamic codes. Banks have appealed to Pakistan's supreme court, and the government's lawyers are examining the case to see if there are grounds for an appeal, which would give it more time to make the necessary changes. On the political front, the KSE was unsettled by instability in Sindh province, of which Karachi is the capital. Reports that Mr Jam Sadiq Ali, the chief minister of Sindh, was suffering from a chronic illness and was not expected to live for long, discouraged some investors. Mr Ali subsequently died in March and a change of government in the province briefly re-established some confidence in the market. But investors are now monitoring events in Afghanistan, as the future of that country will determine Pakistan's success in establishing a land route for the exchange of goods with the newly independent central Asian republics. Mr Arif Habib, the president of the KSE, remains optimistic about the market. He says it should be buoyed by new listings since January worth Rs3.7bn (Pounds 85.7m). 'New issues meant that money moved from the secondary to the primary market. Now it is gradually moving back to the second market again,' he adds.</p>

A spokesman of the UN  Assistance Mission in Rwanda had indicated late this morning  that the installation of the transitional institutions was still  scheduled despite the assassination of Mr. Gatabazi, who was  shot dead close to his house. The installation of these  institutions should have taken place in early January, under the  terms of the peace accord signed last August after three years  of civil war.</p>

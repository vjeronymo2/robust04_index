			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BALLOT MEASURES  </P> <P> I just read my sample ballot. It indicates there is no money for schools, no  money for prisons, no money for roads, no money for the infrastructure, no  money for pollution control and no money for the homeless.  </P> <P> Billions are paid in taxes. Where is the money going? Certainly not to solve  these problems.  </P> <P> LAWRENCE KLEIN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

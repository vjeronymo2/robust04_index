			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Germany's economy heads out of recession: Bundesbank report praises Bonn finance policy but warns on borrowing The German government's finance policy is on the right path and there are increasing signs that the recession is over, a confident Bundesbank reported yesterday. The bank's rare praise for Bonn's policies was accompanied, however, by strict instructions to reduce spending and borrowing. 'The growth rate in public spending should be kept substantially below the nominal rate of growth in gross national product for an extended period,' it said. The warning came as the Bundesbank acknowledged that the economy had moved out of recession. 'The recessionary tendencies in the west German economy appear to have been overcome,' it says in its monthly report, adding a strong hint that further interest rate cuts are unlikely in the short term. The comments helped the D-Mark to rise against the US dollar, Japanese yen and British pound yesterday. Further evidence of German economic recovery came from Mr Karl Heinrich Oppenlander, president of the Munich-based Ifo economics institute. At his institute's annual meeting yesterday, he said the west German economy had finally turned the corner, and growth was was accelerating in the east. He said the institute now expected pan-German growth this year to be 1.5-2 per cent, and higher in 1995. In a review of recent developments, the Bundesbank report says state borrowing is still driving M3 growth, while growth in consumer credit has slowed to an annual rate of 5 per cent. Significantly, though, lending to companies is lower, but borrowing by manufacturing industry has increased for the first time for a year. Capacity utilisation has also risen, further supporting the view that the recession has been overcome. The Bundesbank report, repeating a recent statement by its president, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, noted that the 'rather strong' cut in the discount rate in mid May (a 0.5 point reduction to 4.5 per cent) has cleared the interest rate horizon for some time. The bank now has to wait to see how investors react to the new interest rate environment. Fears about the course of long-term European rates have been blamed for the recent turbulence in international bond markets. The Bundesbank also said that economic growth and rising tax revenues next year might help to cut the public-sector deficit by up to DM60bn (Pounds 24bn) - equivalent to 2 per cent of gross domestic product. For this year, the deficit is expected to be unchanged from 1993, a result only a little above the key Maastricht economic convergence criterion. The government was reminded that its aim should be to reduce 'extraordinarily high' taxes and welfare contributions, which will equal 45 per cent of GDP in 1995. The so-called solidarity tax surcharge, to be reintroduced next year, will yield an estimated DM26bn. In spite of the stick-and-carrot tone, the bank was markedly more optimistic than in the past year on most fiscal, economic and financial prospects, except for short-term interest rates. Its rate policy is in a 'particularly strained' situation, the report says. According to the bank, it is important that funds now parked in short-term instruments, which is seen as distorting money supply data, should be invested in long-term deposits, outside the scope of the M3 supply measure, which is the bank's main indicator of potential inflation.

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Porth losses rise slightly to Pounds 1.89m PORTH Group, the USM-quoted maker of Christmas decorations, packaging and framing products, announced slightly increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.89m for the half year to June 30. Losses last time were Pounds 1.84m. Mr John Miller, chief executive, said the results reflected the seasonality of the group's main subsidiary, Porth Decorative Products, where orders were ahead of last year and savings were being made following the consolidation of operations on one site. At its Framemaker subsidiary sales had fallen, he said, but management had been changed and policies reviewed. Goodmark, the aerosol products maker, continued to improve, he said. The directors, 'with a degree of caution', looked forward to a profitable year. Turnover fell from Pounds 2.76m to Pounds 2.2m. Losses per share amounted to 9.8p (9.6p).</p>

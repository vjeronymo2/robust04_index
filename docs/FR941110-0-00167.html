			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Many commenters believed that facilities should have recourse to HCFA or the State to express concerns regarding the administrative competency of the temporary manager. One commenter was worried that providers would not have the opportunity to lodge a complaint about the temporary manager before his or her services ended. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certain commenters proposed that HCFA and the State monitor the performance of the temporary manager and replace any manager whose performance is unsatisfactory. Another commenter asked that a provider be able to replace the temporary manager if the provider can demonstrate that the manager is incapable of correcting deficiencies or is jeopardizing or impairing the facility's continued operation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  HCFA and the State survey agency will monitor the actions of the temporary manager, and we expect the facility to do the same. We encourage an open dialogue with providers and invite them to communicate to HCFA or the State on an ongoing basis any concerns that they have with the decisions of the temporary manager. If HCFA or the State is dissatisfied with the performance of the temporary manager, we may respond by providing the temporary manager with remedial guidance or by replacing him or her with an alternate. However, if these actions are not possible or prove unsuccessful, we will have no choice but to remove the temporary manager and proceed with termination of the facility's provider agreement. The most appropriate and practical response will vary, and it will depend upon factors such as the availability of an alternate or the amount of time remaining in the 23 days after the last day of the survey allotted for removal of the immediate jeopardy when the temporary manager is imposed in an immediate jeopardy situation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter asked that providers be allowed a time period to demonstrate an ability to correct deficiencies if, because of a temporary manager's incompetence, deficiencies have not been corrected timely. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A temporary manager's failure to correct facility deficiencies does not absolve a facility of its responsibility for generating corrections to those deficiencies, and if deficiencies are not corrected or the immediate jeopardy is not removed timely, the facility will be terminated. HCFA and the State are not required to provide facilities with additional time to come back into substantial compliance, but we are obligated to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients receive the quality care to which they are entitled. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Many commenters requested that we clarify the fiduciary responsibility of the temporary manager. One commenter asked that we designate the temporary manager as a fiduciary of the facility, and stated that by doing so we would empower the facility to protect its interests through established legal principles governing the relationship of fiduciaries to their charges. Other commenters believed we should stipulate that the temporary manager has a responsibility to maintain confidentiality of facility information, and obligations to act in the facility's best interests and ensure that the facility's financial resources are properly managed while he or she works to bring the facility into compliance. Additional commenters asked that we require the temporary manager to conduct himself or herself in a professional manner and to act in a manner reasonably calculated to correct deficiencies and protect the facility's residents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The temporary manager has a responsibility to further the enforcement efforts of HCFA or the State in an effort to protect the facility's residents, and not a duty to serve the facility. HCFA or the State commissions the temporary manager to correct deficiencies identified in the facility's operation, and we expect the temporary manager to exercise sound financial judgment and discretion while executing his or her duty. Likewise, we assume that the temporary manager will conduct himself or herself in a professional manner and act in the facility's best interests. However, we will not explicitly require these standards in the regulation. These terms could not be meaningfully defined because appropriate definitions for them would vary with the circumstances of each temporary management assignment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>   [Text] Russia continues to put pressure on Estonia over  the retired military tying this issue to the resumption of  inter-state negotiations, became evident from an interview given  to ETA by the head of the Russian negotiating team, Vasiliy  Svirin.    "We cannot understand why Estonia has adopted such an  inhuman  attitude towards the retired military," Svirin said. "If Estonia  abandoned that position we could solve many problems we face,"  he said while adding that Russia does not intend to postpone  inter- state negotiations.    Russia's position is that recent rounds have ended without  results and have become negotiations for the sake of  negotiations, Svirin said adding that no agreements have been  initialed.    Therefore, Russia has proposed that all four working groups  meet in Moscow and draw up proposals in order to come out of the  deadlock.    "When those proposals are ready, we will together with  Ambassador Vaino Reinart decide when the next round of  negotiations will take place and the Ambassador has agreed,"  Svirin said.    Estonia's position is that the retired Russian military  should leave the country.    Latvia recently went to a compromise with Russia allowing  some 20,000 Russian ex-officers to stay in Latvia.</p>

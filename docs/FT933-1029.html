			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Beat the rush, pick your Pep early - Philip Coggan asks the experts to recommend the best schemes for growth, income and total return THE EXISTENCE of a deadline often creates the tendency to leave decisions to the last minute. So it is with Personal Equity Plans. Although there is no logical reason to wait until February and March before investing for tax free income and capital gains, Britons seem to need the spur of the end of the tax year to take action. In 1992, September was probably the best time to invest in a Pep since those who did so caught the post-Black Wednesday rally in share prices. This year might be different, but investors should still consider investing in a Pep before the end of the tax year rush. A couple of caveats. In the early years, the label tax-free on a Pep does not mean much. If a Pep yields 4 per cent, then a basic rate taxpayer who invests the full Pounds 6,000 will save just Pounds 48 in tax. That can be wiped out in a day's trading, so remember, a Pep is only for long term investment. Secondly, charges can outweigh the tax benefits in the early years. Watch this carefully, therefore; for small investors, basic rate taxpayer, unit trusts, which do not normally impose any additional charges for Peps, may be the best bet. Bethan Hutton's piece below explains the various types of Peps on offer. Since there are so many to choose from, the Weekend FT asked three financial advisers to pick three Peps, one for income, one for capital growth, and one for total return. John Cole, group managing director of Berry, Birch &amp; Noble selects the Fidelity High Income Pep for income. 'We prefer to keep the income requirement in perspective and would encourage going for a reasonable yield with insuring protection of capital,' he says. 'We favour the Fidelity Pep after taking into account charges, yield and record. It has an estimated yield of 5.9 per cent per annum which can be paid monthly. Up to half the portfolio can be invested in fixed interest stocks to provide greater security.' 'Although only launched in February, it has made an impressive start showing a total return, including income and charges, of more than 11 per cent during a six month period. The yield is not over-ambitious bearing in mind the mix of investments and should avoid sacrificing capital growth.' Even when investing for capital growth, Cole says there is little point in going for a fund without a reasonable yield, because the main benefit of a Pep is the income tax exemption. 'We feel smaller companies offer the most attractive growth prospects at this stage but must be viewed as higher risk.' 'We recommend the Amicable Smaller Enterprises Trust, an investment trust managed by Scottish Amicable Investment Managers, which has an estimated gross yield of 3.8 per cent and a discount to net asset value of 8 per cent. It aims to provide growth of capital and income through UK smaller companies, particularly the lowest 10 per cent by market capitalisation. The fund is Pepable through a self-select plan, such as that offered by brokers Allied Provincial. Although it is too early to speak of track record, the managers have a tremendous pedigree and are investing in one of our favoured sectors.' 'For total return, we would recommend the Perpetual High Income fund. Its record is exceptional, with growth of 174.2 per cent since its launch in 1989, well ahead of the sector average. It has an estimated yield of 4.27 per cent. In looking at total return, we believe the great attraction of Peps is income accumulation and this fund balances a good yield with capital growth.' Clive Scott-Hopkins, marketing director of Towry Law, says: 'For income, it has to be Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial which, earlier this year, set up their cleverly structured High Income Plan. This invests in FT-SE 100 shares and high yielding debenture stock, with put and call option trading to give up most of the potential growth for a higher immediate return. 'The fund is a case of 'jam today rather than cream tomorrow' with a current income yield of 10 per cent, payable monthly. HF&amp;C uses hedging techniques to guard against a severe market fall and we feel this fund is very suitable for the retired investor who needs an immediate boost to spendable income. 'For growth, we favour Perpetual's Growth Fund which takes full advantage of the Pep rules which allow up to 50 per cent to be invested outside the EC. Currently, nearly 20 per cent is in the US and almost 25 per cent in the Far East, including Japan. Since launch in September 1989, the fund has grown by almost 125 per cent (offer-to-offer including reinvested income) and has been a top quartile performer most of the time. 'With Perpetual's outstanding success in world markets, we believe it should continue to achieve above average results (and this fund would lend itself to monthly savings). 'For total return, we like Perpetual's Income fund, which we believe has the right balance for growth of both capital and income. The yield is 4 per cent and it is almost entirely invested in UK equities. 'Since launch in February 1988, it has achieved over 150 per cent growth (offer-to-offer including reinvested income) and is first in the income sector. With Perpetual's known skills at stock selection, we believe it should continue to achieve an above average overall return.' Graham Spinks of Murray Noble says: 'Our view is that clients would be better off investing in a self-select Pep rather than the ready made plans, since charges can be lower (if commission is rebated) and the client has control over asset allocation.' Spinks favours self-select plans from broker Charles Stanley, with an annual 0.75 per cent charge and an initial charge of Pounds 29, or from Pilling, which has no initial or annual charge, but levies Pounds 6.75 per dividend payment. For income Spinks says: 'Half the Pep should be invested in the high yielding shares of a split capital investment trust, such as River &amp; Mercantile or New Throgmorton, which can yield around 9 per cent. Further, we would suggest that clients use the non-qualifying element of a Pep (Pounds 1,500) by investing in an international fixed interest unit trust, such as Commercial Union's Global Bond Fund. The latter may also produce capital gains for the investor, given international reductions in interest rates. The final quarter of the Pep would be invested in high yielding utility stock, such as British Gas.' For capital growth, Spinks says: 'We are keen to stress the need to have exposure to emerging markets because of the tremendous growth prospects that these areas of the world offer. These can be incorporated within the Pounds 1,500 non-qualifying limit; we would opt for a trust such as Templeton. To balance the volatility of emerging markets, we would recommend zero coupon preference shares of investment trusts, such as St David's. These are slightly more risky than gilts and typically yield just under 8 per cent. 'We feel that such an arrangement, perhaps with the inclusion of a smaller companies fund such as TR Smaller Companies IT, will serve investors better than the typical Pep allocation of 60 per cent UK equities. We believe the latter is unsound, given the political uncertainty and structural weakness attaching to the UK market.' For total return, Spinks again suggest incorporating a combination of emerging markets and zeros for capital growth. 'The income portion of the Pep would then be the high yielding income shares of a split capital investment trust.'</p>

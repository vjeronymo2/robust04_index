			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Survey of World Automotive Suppliers (9): The tide has turned - As business has melted away in the home market, British component groups are increasingly active on the international front, and have demonstrated a willingness to take a long-term view of prospects / European vehicle producers look more favourably to the UK UK COMPONENT producers have implemented radical measures to restructure their operations over the past 20 years in response to the serious erosion of domestic vehicle production. Output of cars and commercial vehicles in the UK during 1992 amounted to little more than 1.5m units, compared with just over 2.3m in 1972. Nevertheless, production last year was noticeably ahead of the depressed levels seen in the mid-1980s when annual output typically hovered around the 1.2m level. Adding to the woe has been a trend whereby the responsibility for purchasing decisions at Ford and General Motors (Vauxhall) has been removed from the UK and relocated into Germany although this is being reversed in the case of Ford. This occurred largely as a consequence of the UK component industry's uncompetitiveness throughout much of the 1980s. It follows that many of the parts for Ford's and General Motors' British plants which were traditionally sourced from UK companies have been sourced from Germany instead. At the same time as they have seen business melt away in their home market, UK component producers have had to respond to the gradual but inexorable evolvement of a global motor industry, which in turn is being accompanied by the development of an increasingly international components sector. This has intensified still further competition in the domestic market and necessitated heavy investment in overseas production facilities in order to secure the economies of scale in manufacturing required to sustain increasingly expensive and vital research and development programmes. Leading executives in the components industry believe that the process of globalisation will result in worldwide parts supply being concentrated into as few as 100 world-class companies, each a technological leader, resting on sound financial foundations and backed by an international spread of production facilities. The interesting question is how many of them, if any, will be British owned and controlled? At present it is possible to identify only a limited number of candidates - obvious ones being BBA, GKN, Lucas and T&amp;N. It is by no means certain, though, that all will maintain their independence in the global restructuring process. Lucas, in particular, has been widely mooted as a takeover target. All four are noticeably different in size and structure compared with just a few years ago. Recessionary conditions have forced them to adopt a variety of moves. Workforces have been reduced, plants closed, fringe activities divested, resources focussed on to areas of technological excellence and international expansion pursued. A good example of what has happened is seen with Automotive Products, which has undergone extensive restructuring since being acquired by BBA in 1986. The aim has been to reduce dramatically the cost base, thereby achieving a substantial improvement in competitiveness. To this end the workforce has fallen from about 8,000 to 4,500 worldwide, stockholding reduced massively and a highly centralised management structure replaced by autonomous operating units, each with responsibility for profit. There has been heavy spending on manufacturing technology and a high priority placed on what may best be termed commercially appropriate technological development. Moreover, the company's philosophy now emphasises the need to be customer-oriented. The effectiveness of these changes may be judged from the increasing level of new business which is being won - running at Pounds 70m on an annual basis, much of it from continental competitors - as well as the latest financial figures which show that pre-tax profits in 1992 amounted to Pounds 16.2m compared with a loss of Pounds 1.1m in 1991 when operating profits of almost Pounds 9m were completely eroded by exceptional items and interest charges. And these encouraging trends are evident in other groups throughout the UK components sector, both large and small. British component groups are increasingly active on the international front, and have demonstrated a willingness to take a long-term view of business prospects. The faltering state of the German motor industry, for example, has not deterred T&amp;N from acquiring the German piston ring producer Goetze, thereby consolidating its position as one of the world leaders in engine parts. There have been important expansion moves in North America, too. Looking ahead, UK component groups have two golden opportunities to boost their standing in the world league. These arise from: first, a boost to exports as a result of the competitive edge afforded by sterling's departure from the ERM; and secondly, the prospect of growing business as Japanese assembly plants build up their activity in the UK. Both factors are also significant in making the country an attractive location for investment by foreign component groups. Export potential in the short term will undoubtedly be limited by dull economic conditions in continental Europe, but sterling's devaluation has added considerably to the attractiveness of the UK as a source of component supply. This is especially true for German vehicle producers, not least as they seek to reduce costs through more effective sourcing policies. Recently the Volkswagen group - comprising the Audi, Seat, Skoda and Volkswagen marques - declared its intention to double purchases of components from UK companies to DM1bn (Pounds 400m) by the end of 1993. Further rises to DM2.5bn (Pounds 1bn) are anticipated in the period to 1995, representing around 5 per cent of the group's total component purchases. This move has been prompted mainly by the realisation that savings of up to 40 per cent are achievable through sourcing from the UK. European vehicle producers generally are looking more favourably towards the UK as a potential source of components. In addition to cost considerations, there is a growing appreciation of the sector's technological capability and capacity for original thought, which is increasingly important in the context of vehicle manufacturers' greater dependence on their suppliers to arrive at technical solutions. Credentials have been furthered by the extensive network of production facilities operated by UK companies in Europe. For all the talk of a single market, having a local presence when pitching for new business remains important. However, it is the arrival of the Japanese car assembly plants in Britain that provides the UK components industry with the greatest promise of future prosperity. Where local (European) sources are used, UK component producers are set to enjoy by far the largest slice. Indeed, the combined annual purchase of components in the UK by Honda, Nissan and Toyota is expected to total close to Pounds 1.3bn in 1995, and there may be more to come. After so much gloom and doom, it appears the tide has turned. The hard work and difficult decisions of recent years are about to be rewarded.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    WEST EUROPEAN CAR PRODUCTION*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MANUFACTURER           1992     % share         1991    % share   % chg  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total            12,936,974      100.0    12,662,557     100.0    +2.2 Volkswagen**      2,595,353       20.1     2,440,740      19.3    +6.3 Peugeot**         1,821,397       14.1     1,835,987      14.5    -0.8 General Motors**  1,816,373       14.0     1,684,602      13.3    +7.8 Renault           1,749,621       13.5     1,546,637      12.2   +13.1 Ford**            1,480,864       11.4     1,590,294      12.6    -6.9 Fiat**            1,474,821       11.4     1,631,631      12.9    -9.6 BMW                 580,295        4.5       536,003       4.2    +8.3 Mercedes-Benz       531,457        4.1       575,547       4.5    -7.7 Rover***            380,840        2.9       395,624       3.1    -3.7 Volvo               302,949        2.3       273,573       2.2   +10.7 Nissan              178,978        1.4       124,666       1.0   +43.6 Honda****             1,001        0.0             -         -       - Porsche              16,559        0.1        20,952       0.2   -21.0 Others                6,466        0.0         6,301       0.0       -  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COUNTRY                1992     % share         1991    % share   % chg  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Germany           4,863,802       37.6     4,659,480      36.8    +4.4 France            3,325,508       25.7     3,187,634      25.2    +4.3 Italy             1,476,627       11.4     1,632,904      12.9    -9.6 Spain             1,450,523       11.2     1,426,168      11.3    +1.7 UK                1,208,905        9.3     1,148,941       9.1    +5.2 Sweden              293,499        2.3       269,431       2.1    +8.9 Belgium             224,091        1.7       253,491       2.0   -11.6 Netherlands          94,019        0.7        84,508       0.7   +11.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MODEL                     1992  % share         1991    % share   % chg  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- VW Golf/Jetta/Vento  1,019,888     7.9       826,802       6.5   +23.4 Opel/Vauxhall Astra    771,304     6.0       559,063       4.4   +38.0 Renault Clio           632,469     4.9       543,905       4.3   +16.3 Ford Escort/Orion      611,795     4.7       634,266       5.0    -3.5 Ford Fiesta            566,817     4.4       624,025       4.9    -9.2 Fiat Uno               530,357     4.1       524,458       4.1    +1.1 Renault R19            489,966     3.8       406,085       3.2   +20.7 OpelVectra/Cavalier    413,368     3.2       469,219       3.7   -11.9 BMW 3-Series           375,294     2.9       310,879       2.5   +20.7 Opel Corsa/Nova        340,557     2.6       362,052       2.9    -5.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Excludes double-counting, which largely affects Belgium, UK and Spain.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- **Volkswagen includes Audi and SEAT; Peugeot includes Citroen; GM (Opel/Vauxhall) includes Saab and Lotus; Fiat includes Alfa Romeo, Lancia, Innocenti, Maserati and Ferrari and excludes production in Poland and Yugoslavia; Ford includes Jaguar and Aston Martin.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ***Includes Honda Concerto made under licence by Rover, 32,444 in 1992, 35,952 in 1991.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ****Excludes Rover-built Concertos.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Automotive Industry Data.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

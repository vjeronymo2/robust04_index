			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS ARE PURSUING RIGHETTI  </P> <P> Despite their vow to avoid plunging into the free agent market, the Angels  could become serious suitors for the services of left-handed reliever Dave  Righetti, who has spent all of his nine-plus major league seasons with the New  York Yankees.  </P> <P> Whether the Angels pursue the San Jose native apparently hinges on his desire  for a five-year contract. The Angels have said in the past they are reluctant  to sign pitchers for more than three years, a sentiment that has also been  expressed by the Dodgers.  </P> <P> Righetti's agent, Bill Goodstein, said Wednesday he has had "continuing" talks  in recent weeks with Angel General Manager Mike Port and senior vice president  Dan O'Brien, who handles the club's contract negotiations. According to  Goodstein, the Angels' intentions are earnest.  </P> <P> "There's no question they have an abiding interest in Righetti for several  reasons," Goodstein said by phone from his New York City office. "They know  Righetti to have had an immensely successful career as a left-handed reliever,  a position they're interested in filling, and in addition, I know the Angels  like Righetti because of his conduct and (good) reputation off the field.  </P> <P> "It's very hard to assess degrees of interest since you have lots of  conversations with lots of teams. But I would say the Angels clearly have  reasonable interest. His wife, Kandice, is from Orange County and he's from  California. We think the Angels have a very good team and will be a contending  team and that's a factor I know interests David."  </P> <P> However, Righetti and Goodstein's desire for a long-term contract is a  complicating factor. Goodstein said he would prefer a five-year deal but would  settle for a "solid" four-year contract, which may still be longer than the  Angels are willing to offer despite their pressing need for a left-handed  closer. Righetti's 1990 salary was $1,550,000.  </P> <P> "I've heard he's looking for five years and I don't think we'd be interested in  doing something like that," O'Brien said. But when asked if he'd change his  mind should Righetti be willing to accept a shorter contract, O'Brien replied,  "Anybody can make something interesting . . . The door is ajar." Asked whether  Righetti was worth pursuing, O'Brien said, "At a very slow and well-informed  pace."  </P> <P> Righetti, who turned 32 on Wednesday, had 36 saves in 39 opportunities last  season. His 224 career saves is the most by a left-hander and seventh on the  all-time list. He is one of only five pitchers in major league history who have  earned 20 saves in seven consecutive seasons, sharing that distinction with  Bruce Sutter, Jeff Reardon, Lee Smith and Goose Gossage. He holds the Yankee  record for games appeared in, with 522 appearances as a starter and reliever.  </P> <P> It's believed the Chicago Cubs, Boston Red Sox, Chicago White Sox and Minnesota  Twins have made offers to Righetti.  </P> <P> O'Brien also said the Angels are unlikely to acquire Steve Sax from the Yankees  to fill their need at second base. "I think that's a dead issue because the  Yankees are going to keep him," O'Brien said.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> The Angels hired former major league outfielder Gene Richards to join the  coaching staff of their double-A Midland farm club. Richards played eight years  in the major leagues, seven with the San Diego Padres.  </P></p>

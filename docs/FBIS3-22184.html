			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Amritsar, Dec 17--Amritsar is fast becoming one of  the most polluted cities in the state, according to a study  conducted by the state pollution board.    The quantity of suspended particle matter (SPM), commonly  known as dust particles, has registered a 50 percent increase in  the past seven months, while the sulphur dioxide content in the  air has shot up by 100 percent in the same period. In addition,  36 lakh kg of organic fluid is discharged from various sources  daily, spelling disaster for the crops in the vicinity.    The state environment secretary, Mr. J. S. Maini, in his  keynote address at a workshop organised by the pollution board  here recently, had referred to the substantial increase in  air-related diseases among the locals. He had warned that this  might assume alarming proportions if allowed to grow unchecked.    Pollution is at times so acute in the residential colonies  on  Batala road that a white sheet left in the open often turns  black overnight as the suspended particles settle down.    Amritsar now comes a close second to Ludhiana in the  pollution chart released by the board every week. The city  recorded 840 and 640 microgram normal cubic metre of suspended  particles against the permissible limit of 200 microgram normal  cubic metre.</p>

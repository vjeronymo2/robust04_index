			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Bingham made Master of Rolls LORD JUSTICE Bingham, the Appeal Court judge who has just completed an 11-month inquiry into the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, was yesterday appointed Master of the Rolls in succession to Lord Donaldson. Lord Donaldson retires at the end of next month after 10 years as the most senior civil court judge in England and Wales. The BCCI report is expected to be published before Sir Thomas takes up his new office on September 30. Sir Thomas, 58, is widely regarded by the legal profession as having one of the best intellects on the bench and as a radical who is willing to speak his mind. In 1989 he was the first judge to speak out strongly in favour of Lord Mackay's proposed reforms of the legal profession. To the surprise of many barristers and judges, Sir Thomas said the greatest threat to barristers was not the reforms but the profession's negative reaction to them. The rules preventing solicitors from appearing as advocates in the higher courts were illogical, indefensible and could not be justified, he said. In marked contrast to the attitude of Lord Donaldson, who warned the Lord Chancellor to 'get your tanks off my lawn', Sir Thomas dismissed the suggestions of his fellow judges that Lord Mackay's reforms threatened judicial independence and were not wanted by the public. He said: 'We delude ourselves if we suppose there is not a large body of responsible, middle-of-the-road opinion that regards the legal profession as riddled with anachronistic conventions and privileges.' Sir Thomas, the only son of two doctors, was educated at Sedbergh and Balliol College, Oxford, where he took a first in modern history. He was called to the Bar by Gray's Inn in 1959 after coming top in the Bar exams and rapidly earned recognition as one of the brightest commercial lawyers of his generation and a brilliant advocate. He took silk at the age of 38 in 1972 and was appointed to the High Court bench in 1980. In 1986 he was promoted to the Court of Appeal. He is no stranger to controversy. In 1977 he was appointed by Dr David Owen, then foreign secretary, to head the inquiry into Rhodesia sanctions-busting by the big UK oil companies. His report concluded that they had knowingly violated United Nations sanctions, and that government officials were aware of that. In 1982 he conducted an inquiry for the Lord Chancellor into the issues raised by the contempt-of-court action brought against the government by Ms Harriet Harman, now Labour MP for Peckham in south London, over non-disclosure of documents. During the 1991 Gulf war he was one of the 'three wise men' who reviewed cases of Arabs facing deportation as security risks. Lord Justice Bingham is known to share the concerns of the present Master of the Rolls about the delays and costs of the civil justice system. Mr Mark Sheldon, president of the Law Society, the solicitors' governing body, welcomed the appointment, and praised Sir Thomas as 'a lawyer of great intellect with a reputation for innovation and an open-minded approach to reform'. The society hopes that as one of the four designated judges who must decide on wider rights of audience for solicitors, Sir Thomas will prove a formidable ally. The Bar Council, the barristers' ruling body, also welcomed the appointment. Mr John Rowe QC, vice-chairman, said Sir Thomas was 'forward-looking' and 'likely to bring innovation to civil justice'.</p>

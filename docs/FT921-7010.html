			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Russia braced for large output cuts A FURTHER sharp fall in Russia's industrial production is inevitable but action will be taken to stimulate sectors which decline by more than 50 per cent over the next few months, the Russian government said yesterday. Mr Andrei Nechayev, head of the newly recreated Economics Ministry, forecast that output would fall 'significantly' in the next two months as a result of the government's tight monetary and credit policy. The first sector likely to experience a slump was agricultural machinery, but taxation and other financial benefits would be deployed to help. The minister also announced plans to free the domestic price of oil and gas at the end of April as part of the effort to stabilise prices. The step will deal a further blow to industry accustomed to cheap energy. The state-controlled domestic price of oil is Rbs350 a tonne. The price of coal is also to be freed on April 15, although the price of coking coal, crucial to the metallurgy industry, is to remain fixed. Pleading for restraint on the part of workers to help avoid hyperinflation, Mr Nechayev said that the government's agreement under duress to increase the pay of coalminers in the northern Voruta region was a dangerous precedent which could spark a chain reaction and torpedo the government's whole reform programme. He said prices this month had risen 10-12 per cent compared to last February. The Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs produced figures showing that industrial output in the whole of the former Soviet Union had fallen 17 per cent in January. Although the defence industry is being cut, the 27 per cent fall in steel production for January will hurt other industries such as agricultural machinery. Coal output was down 10 per cent and oil 12 per cent. Professor Yeveny Yasin, the industrialists' prominent economist, warned that production in the next two months could fall to half last year's level. He said the decline was partly because of the disruption of traditional supplies between enterprises, and partly because of tight credit. Russia, the only one of the former Soviet republics to have made debt payments, is refusing to attend debt talks organised by the Ukrainians in Kiev today. Russian officials said they were irritated by Ukraine's failure to send a high-level official to a meeting on the more than Dollars 60bn debt in Moscow yesterday, as well as by the fact it had not taken part in previous debt meetings. Ukraine, which wants to pay its share separately and rejects a memorandum undertaking joint and several responsibility for the debt, joined the meeting in Moscow, but did not adhere to any of its conclusions.

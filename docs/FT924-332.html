			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Clinton appointments upset party factions PRESIDENT-elect Bill Clinton is spending this week in South Carolina in the company of friends. But his final flurry of cabinet appointments on Christmas Eve may have made him a few enemies and has not necessarily clarified many of the directions his new government will take. He and his wife Hillary will be attending the annual retreat known as Renaissance, which brings together mostly like-minded politicians, writers, lawyers, civil servants and many from the private sector for discussions on everything from health care reform to personal spirituality. The Renaissance group forms one of Mr Clinton's own network of contacts, some of whom he used in the formation of his government. Intriguing appointments - such as those of Ms Zoe Baird, who is the first woman named attorney-general, and Mrs Hazel O'Leary, the black businesswoman who will run the energy department - demonstrated how independent Mr Clinton could be of the well-established vested interest groups. However, some of these powerful lobbies are disappointed in some of his selections. Among those he may have alienated are the Daley family of Chicago. Mr William Daley, brother of Mayor Richard Daley, was thought to be the likely transportation secretary, only to be superseded on Christmas Eve by the nomination of Mr Federico Pena, Hispanic former mayor of Denver, Colorado. The Daleys worked mightily in the election to ensure Mr Clinton carried with ease the vital state of Illinois. Environmentalists were ultimately satisfied with the naming of Mr Bruce Babbitt, former governor of Arizona, to the interior department. It had seemed Mr Babbitt was destined to be US trade representative, so as to open up the interior position to another Hispanic, Congressman Bill Richardson of New Mexico, not considered a strong environmentalist. Another candidate of the green lobby, Mr Tim Wirth, the outgoing senator from Colorado, failed to land a cabinet position, as was expected. Trade specialists profess to be puzzled by the appointment of Mr Mickey Kantor, Mr Clinton's campaign manager, to the position now held by Mrs Carla Hills. Mr Kantor is a veteran political operator, to whom the president-elect is much indebted, but he has no trade experience at a time when the Gatt negotiations may be reaching a climax. The evidence is that the president-elect will be almost as involved in the choice of the second-tier members of his government. Some of those disappointed so far may thus be offered substantive positions.  --------------------------------------------------------------- The Clinton team  --------------------------------------------------------------- Agriculture secretary        Mike Espy Attorney general             Zoe Baird Commerce secretary           Ron Brown Defence secretary            Les Aspin Education secretary          Richard Riley Energy secretary             Hazel O'Leary Environmental Protection  Agency administrator       Carol Browner Health and human services  secretary                  Donna Shalala Housing and urban  development secretary      Henry Cisneros Interior secretary          Bruce Babbitt Labour secretary            Robert Reich Secretary of State          Warren Christopher Transport secretary         Federico Pena Treasury secretary          Lloyd Bentsen United Nations ambassador   Madeline Albright Veteran Affairs secretary   Jesse Brown White House chief of staff  Thomas McLarty Management and Budget  director                   Leon Panetta Central Intelligence   director                  R.

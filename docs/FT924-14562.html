			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Leading Article: France's narrow ERM options IN ITS statements on European integration, the German government likes habitually to repeat the words of Thomas Mann. In recent years, Bonn has declared its aim is a 'European Germany', not a 'German Europe'. Unfortunately, in monetary terms, the latter state of affairs, not the former, now prevails. This has important consequences for the French government. After the departure of Britain and Italy from the exchange rate mechanism (ERM), the Franco-German relationship, still more clearly than before, lies at the heart of the Continent's monetary arrangements. Paradoxically, in view of France's much improved inflation performance, Germany's influence in that partnership has increased disproportionately. Re-establishing equilibrium will have a vital bearing both on the ERM's future, and on the wider prospects for economic and monetary union (Emu). September's currency squalls resulted, at least temporarily, in a huge shift of European central banks' currency reserves. The four most important EC economies after Germany - France, the UK, Italy and Spain  - lost perhaps 40 per cent of their foreign exchange holdings, while the Bundesbank's published foreign currency reserves rose by nearly DM80bn (Pounds 32.3bn) last month. Britain and Italy will both be mobilising large foreign loans - Britain via the Ecu10bn facility announced in September, Italy through the credit it is negotiating with the EC - to repay later this year at least part of their short-term credits raised from the Bundesbank to finance currency intervention. Three options In contrast to Britain and Italy, France, with the aid of the Bundesbank, won last month's tussle to maintain its parity. But Paris has yet to show that victory was not Pyrrhic. The Bank of France sharply ran down its reserves, spending at least FFr80bn (Pounds 9.52bn) and possibly as much as FFr150bn to judge by the central bank's weekly currency returns. Although the foreign exchanges have quietened, with the franc yesterday comfortably above its D-Mark floor, further upheavals cannot be ruled out. The French government and the Bank of France have three basic options. First, the French authorities can remain resolute, patient - and passive. Further Bundesbank interest rate cuts, which now seem likely during the next few weeks, will create room for long-promised cuts in French interest rates. The gap between banks' base rates (held down at government behest at 9.85 per cent) and overnight money market funds (yesterday, 12.25 per cent) is severely squeezing banks' profitability - bringing losses which largely will have to be borne by the French Treasury. Yet, so long as the squeeze ends soon, the government regards this as a price worth paying. Last resort Second, France could - as a last resort if it faces a fresh run on reserves  -carry out a realignment to lower pressure on the franc. This not only would bring great loss of prestige, but also would be economically counter-productive. A revaluation of the D-Mark against the franc, when French unit labour costs are rising much more slowly than in Germany, would further damp German business prospects. Even if a D-Mark/franc shift were accompanied by another Bundesbank interest rate cut, it would make a German recession more likely. Third, France could increase its policy credibility by adopting a more narrow ERM fluctuation band against the D-Mark, perhaps reducing the present 2.25 per cent margin to only 1 per cent - similar to action already taken by Belgium. This would buttress the Bundesbank's message that the franc is correctly valued. Such a move could be combined with institutional steps aimed at giving independence to the Bank of France. Narrower bands would involve risks, especially in a political climate which will become more tense during the run-up to general elections in March. But this step could heighten the chances that France's strategic goal of Emu - inevitably, formed around a Franco-German core - will become reality. If a European central bank is, one day, to displace the Bundesbank from its throne, last month's joust with the currency speculators was just one of the battles France needs to win.</p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Going it alone - A campaign designed to promote self-employment is about to be launched When Miguel Forde lost his job as a furniture restorer he received some second-rate suggestions about what he should do next. In particular, the government's Restart Scheme, which tries to help the long-term unemployed, kept trying to persuade him to take a job packing supermarket shelves. Fortunately, the 23-year-old Forde, who was trained but lacked many formal qualifications, had a higher opinion of his abilities. 'There is no point in you, for example, being trained as a journalist and going to do shelf packing,' says Forde. He and two friends, Michael Barrett and Henroy McPherson, who lost their jobs about the same time, tried to start their own restoration company. After taking a business course run by Urban and Economic Development (Urbed), which aims to regenerate run-down areas, they heard of the Prince's Youth Business Trust, whose president and enthusiastic patron is the Prince of Wales. With the help of Pounds 3,000 in PYBT loans and grants they were able to set up Michenuels of London in Deptford, south London, which is just completing its first year. The PYBT, says Forde, took a crucial step that should be considered by many more people in his position. Led by Jeremy White, the new chief executive, the PYBT is about to launch a national campaign to demonstrate that self-employment is a real alternative to unemployment. About 22,000 people have already got the message in the PYBT's first 10 years. Aimed at people who are disadvantaged by their educational, economic or ethnic minority backgrounds or by physical disability, the charity has disbursed Pounds 40m. Four thousand people receive loans and grants a year and two-thirds of their businesses survive into their third year. White is fond of saying the PYBT is one of the largest consultancy services in the UK. Its 5,000 advisers give three-quarters of a million hours of free advice a year, a factor Forde and his colleagues found exceptionally helpful in their first year. The PYBT's achievements have been widely recognised; in March the government, with cross-party support, committed itself to giving the PYBT Pounds 10m over three years if the PYBT could raise the same amount from industry. While the government and those captains of industry who have been touched for a contribution may be well aware of PYBT, there is a problem. In spite of marketing itself through Tecs, Job Centres and banks, the PYBT's message may not be getting through to where it matters - the street. Forde, for example, did not immediately think of the PYBT when he was looking for backing. 'I thought you had to be some rich kid before they thought you were worthy of them,' Forde says. Hence the marketing drive. White is also trying to recruit more advisers. The success rate of PYBT-backed businesses is much higher than that achieved by banks that back small start-ups. White believes the secret is the hand-holding they receive from advisers. But while there are plenty of volunteers in Surrey, they are much harder to find in south London. Longer term, White is considering trying to raise money through a government-guaranteed eurobond issue. Such guarantees might be classified as part of the government's public sector borrowing requirement, a problem that has yet to be resolved. White recognises that any future government funding will depend on the PYBT's ability to demonstrate it is good value for money. 'The onus is on us to understand our target market more and to show that self-employment provides a viable alternative to unemployment.' White is also aiming to change the PYBT's focus. He wants even more of its funds to be disbursed as loans rather than grants - because of the discipline this instills. More fundamentally, he wants to shift away from a welfare role. He defines the PYBT as an 'enterprise charity' that supports people who want to start sustainable businesses but who could not do it alone. 'We see a lot of people who are very needy,' says White. 'There are other channels that are better equipped to give more welfare help. We are more interested in giving people the chance to go into enterprise.' Already the PYBT has backed some ventures that have grown into sizeable businesses. Its biggest success, measured in turnover terms, is a mobile milk-testing company that has a turnover of over Pounds 6m. Others that are growing and starting to provide employment include a business making animated film titles, a geological surveyor, an agency recruitment for charities and a hospital entertainment group. What the PYBT backs is people with bright ideas and enthusiasm, White says. 'But they do not have the other dimensions that bankers could look at. No qualifications, limited literacy and numeracy, no capital or family funds. But being articulate is only one factor; very often resourceful determination is more important.' The determination of Forde and his partners has carried Michenuels through its first year. Forde, who is no longer drawing state benefit, says he is earning less than when he was last employed. 'But I am happy. It is still early stages,' he says. 'The last three months have been good. If it keeps up we can pay ourselves more.'</p>

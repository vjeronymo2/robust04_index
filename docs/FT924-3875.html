			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / UN gives Somalia force go-ahead THE United Nations last night gave the go-ahead for an international force under US command to go to Somalia to back up the world's aid efforts with firepower. The unanimous vote by the 15-nation Security Council is the signal for the US to send more than 20,000 troops to the starving country to disarm local warlords and make sure food aid is not looted. France yesterday offered to contribute 2,000 troops to the force and other countries, including Italy, Canada and some African states, are expected to send contingents. The Pentagon put units on alert in California and New York for rapid airlift to Somalia. Warships carrying 1,800 Marines and 23 helicopters are already off the coast of the east African nation ready to spearhead the UN-authorised force. Command arrangements will resemble the Gulf war's Desert Storm operation. All troops will be nominally under UN auspices, but effectively under US command. Lieutenant Robert Johnston, who was General Norman Schwarzkopf's chief-of-staff in the Gulf war, is expected to command the force. Half the French contingent is likely to be drawn from a base in neighbouring Djibouti and half from France. France may ask the US to airlift light French tanks to the area, while the French base at Djibouti may in turn be used by US forces. This is the first time the Security Council has approved force for humanitarian ends. In the 21-point text, UN member states were authorised 'in consultation with the secretary-general to use all necessary means to establish as soon as possible a secure environment for humanitarian relief operations in Somalia'. The resolution endorsed the view of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, secretary-general, that the use of force now is imperative. But he also favours a switch to conventional peace - keeping procedures as soon as order is restored. Heeding African and other third world suspicions about a US-led campaign so soon after the Gulf conflict, the council gave the secretary-general the role of co-ordinator of the operation. He is to report within 15 days. A small UN liaison staff to work with the 'unified command' - a term out of the resolution that sent US-led troops to Korea 40 years ago - will be set up, along with a special commission. Placing the secretary-general 'at the controlling centre' was a compromise that enabled Zimbabwe to support the action and assured other third world backing. For an organisation in financial need, there is another positive element: the US and other countries contributing troops will not be expected to submit bills. In Washington, although the use of force in Somalia appears to have general public and political support, some opposition has been voiced. Congressman John Murtha complained that US intervention in Somalia could be a precedent for demands in a host of other countries.</p>

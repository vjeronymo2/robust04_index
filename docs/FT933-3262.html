			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Investors rush to pour money into China THE LURE of China's large and fast-expanding domestic market has made it the biggest recipient of overseas investment among developing nations, according to figures published by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development yesterday. It has also turned China into one of the leading recipients of foreign investment worldwide. In the first six months of 1993, foreign direct investment in China totalled Dollars 9.4bn (Pounds 6.1bn), a 180 per cent rise on the same period in 1992. Investment last year rose by 40 per cent to Dollars 11bn, but the number of approved foreign investment projects almost trebled to 49,000; and the planned investment of more than Dollars 58bn was nearly four times higher than in 1991. The figures, given to an Unctad-sponsored conference in Beijing by Ms Wu Yi, China's foreign trade minister, show that by mid-1993 some 135,000 Chinese enterprises had overseas participation, with projected foreign investment of nearly Dollars 170bn and actual investment of some Dollars 44bn. Enterprises with foreign participation produced about 6 per cent of China's total industrial output in 1992. More than 100 countries and territories are now investing in China, the most important being Hong Kong, Taiwan, the US, Japan, Singapore, Germany, Britain, Thailand, France and Canada. Ms Wu said the government was encouraging foreign direct investment outside the coastal economic zones and noted that a fifth of such investment last year was in inland provinces. Foreign capital was now going into enterprises in the service sector, in areas such as finance, property, insurance, retailing and consultancy. The Beijing conference, attended by representatives of about 40 multinational companies, urged the Chinese government to improve conditions for foreign investment. Among the recommendations were further liberalisation of the service sector, easier labour mobility for Chinese employees, reduced bureaucracy, increased access to foreign exchange and more effective protection for intellectual property.</p>

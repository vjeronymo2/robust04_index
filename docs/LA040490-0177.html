			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GULFSTREAM'S DATE CHANGES A BLOW TO HIALEAH  </P> <P> The feud among South Florida's three thoroughbred tracks intensified when  Gulfstream Park made a last-minute switch in its racing dates for 1990-91.  </P> <P> The change, which came just before Monday's deadline for South Florida's three  tracks to submit their dates, defeated Hialeah Park's plan to race unopposed at  least one day a week.  </P> <P> "It's despicable," said John Brunetti Sr., owner of financially troubled  Hialeah Park. "I think it's a slap in the face."  </P> <P> Hialeah, which closed abruptly Dec. 18 under the duress caused by declines in  wagering and attendance, submitted an application calling for three-day-a-week  racing -- Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays -- from Dec. 22 to April 8. The idea  was that while Hialeah would compete on the weekend dates, it would have  Mondays to itself.  </P> <P> Mondays traditionally are off days at Gulfstream and Calder Race Course.  </P> <P> But Gulfstream officials adjusted their weekly racing schedule for next year so  that Wednesdays, not Mondays, would be the off days, at least until April.  </P> <P> "It's a deliberate effort on their part to make any possibility of our being  economically successful fail at the outset," Brunetti said. "No matter what  days or dates we asked for, they would continue to take every opportunity to do  whatever they possibly could do to squelch Hialeah's chances for a successful  meeting."  </P> <P> Hialeah is scheduled to open in the midst of Calder's meeting, which starts May  5 and runs through Jan. 13. Gulfstream will then open and race until it is  Calder's turn again.  </P> <P> Hialeah has no time just to itself.  </P> <P> "From a business and competitive standpoint," Gulfstream attorney David Romanik  said, "it did not make sense for us to compete with Hialeah on our two best  days (Saturday and Sunday) and then allow Hialeah to operate uncontested on  Mondays."  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV COULD USE SUMMIT TO GET HELP FOR SOVIET REFORMS;  </P> <P> DEALS: GERMAN REUNIFICATION, DISARMAMENT AND REGIONAL CONFLICTS ARE ALSO  EXPECTED TO BE DISCUSSED.  </P> <P> About 24 hours before the announcement of next Sunday's U.S.-Soviet summit, a  reporter asked Mikhail S. Gorbachev about his travel plans. "I will limit my  trips abroad to the minimum in this period -- to the possible minimum," the  Soviet president replied after two days of meetings on how to salvage the  economy.  </P> <P> So on Saturday evening there was general surprise when state-run television  broadcast a one-sentence bulletin saying Gorbachev will travel to Helsinki one  week from today to discuss "international and bilateral issues" with President  Bush.  </P> <P> Despite its unexpectedness, the latest event in U.S.-Soviet history --  Gorbachev's eighth meeting with an American President -- will be greeted with a  shrug by many here. Attention is already focused on other arenas, like the  national and Russian republic's legislatures, where as early as Monday, debate  will open on how to halt the spiral of economic decline and institute  market-style reforms.  </P> <P> With the shortage-riddled economy now so badly off that, as one newspaper  bitterly noted, desperate smokers gladly buy jars of cigarette butts, Gorbachev  certainly knows he can expect little public relations capital at home from a  hastily scheduled one-day meeting with Bush.  </P> <P> However, with U.S.-Soviet ties closer than ever, Helsinki will be a timely  occasion for the Kremlin leader to do some horse-trading to help bolster his  own political position and seek more Western help for his reforms, which he  admitted to reporters Friday were undergoing "serious trials."  </P> <P> Since the presidents last met in June in Washington, D.C., Gorbachev's list of  domestic woes has gotten longer. The very term Soviet Union now seems outmoded,  as republics one by one have declared their independence or sovereignty.  </P> <P> The radical populist who is the leader of Russia, Boris N. Yeltsin, has rapidly  grown in stature to the point where, to millions disappointed by the meager  fruits of Gorbachev's perestroika, he seems a preferable, and very  presidential, alternative.  </P> <P> When he meets Bush, Gorbachev could conceivably seek to capitalize on  tit-for-tat deals or tangible benefits for the changed line of Soviet conduct.  Among those areas:  </P> <P> * First and foremost, the Persian Gulf crisis, which has seen historic  U.S.-Soviet cooperation and coordination to extinguish a Third World hot spot,  but which Kremlin officials say will cost their country more than $800 million  in lost trade with Iraq this year alone.  </P> <P> * The so-called two-plus-four negotiations on German reunification, whose next  round in Moscow on Sept. 12 is supposed to be the last, but where some issues  remain unresolved.  </P> <P> * Separate sets of disarmament negotiations in which superpower envoys are said  to be marking time: the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) talks in Vienna and  bilateral negotiations on cutting strategic nuclear weapons.  </P> <P> * Efforts to end conflicts in Afghanistan and Cambodia. On Cambodia, Washington  and the Kremlin have agreed at the United Nations to what one U.S. official  said will be an unprecedented U.N. peacekeeping operation that could cost $5  billion.  </P> <P> In one area, a deal seems certain.  </P> <P> At the Washington summit, Bush had agreed to grant Moscow the same tariff terms  that the United States sets for its allies -- most favored nation status -- as  soon as the Supreme Soviet legislature completes work on a law to allow  citizens to emigrate freely.  </P> <P> A draft of that legislation, which had originally been expected in time for  Gorbachev's trip to Washington, is now ready for submission at the Supreme  Soviet session that begins immediately after the Helsinki summit, and doubtless  some member of Gorbachev's entourage will be carrying a copy to show the  Americans.  </P> <P> MFN status would allow Soviet products to enter the U.S. market at a lower  tariff rate, making them more competitive and giving a boost to the Kremlin's  campaign to sell more abroad and thus earn more convertible currency.  </P> <P> Although Bush has told reporters that he had suggested the third meeting  between himself and Gorbachev, the location -- the Finnish capital about 600  miles northwest of Moscow -- was obviously selected for Gorbachev's  convenience.  </P> <P> With three different political institutions about to begin meetings that could  prove crucial -- the Russian Parliament on Monday, the Russian Communist Party  on Tuesday and the Soviet legislature on Sept. 10 -- Gorbachev will be able to  meet with the Americans and get back home quickly for any necessary damage  control.  </P> <P> Although Bush said Saturday that he didn't foresee Moscow playing a mediating  role in the Persian Gulf crisis, the different postures taken by the  superpowers often seem like a diplomatic version of "good cop, bad cop." For  example, the United States sent aircraft carriers to the Persian Gulf, and  Gorbachev sent a special envoy.  </P> <P> Asked at a Friday news conference if the superpowers differ on how to handle  Iraq, Gorbachev answered: "We all have to be very responsible so that a  large-scale military conflict is not unleashed. This, I think, is our mutual  concern. . . . If you think that this is disagreement in our policies, I, on  the contrary, think this is cooperation."  </P> <P> By speaking in Helsinki with one voice to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Bush  and Gorbachev would vividly demonstrate the new relationship between their  countries, as well as dramatically serve notice to Baghdad of its isolation in  the world community.  </P></p>

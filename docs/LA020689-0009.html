			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'BURNING BEACH': AN ALLEGORY ABOUT CUBA'S POLITICAL HISTORY  </P> <P> Playwright Eduardo Machado's family came to the United States after the Castro  revolution, when he was only 8 years old. Naturally, Cuba is a magical island  to Machado and his characters. The aunt in his "Broken Eggs" (1984) even  imagines that her "second self" is still living down there.  </P> <P> Machado's new play at the Los Angeles Theatre Center, "A Burning Beach," is set  in the twice-mythical Cuba of the past. The time is 1895. Two well-brought-up  sisters have just lost their sinful Papa, and who is to take charge of the  plantation now?  </P> <P> Also figuring in the story are their black maid, with whom their father sinned;  their half brother, the result of the sin; a beautiful and seductive American  girl who claims to be related to Teddy Roosevelt; and the young leader of the  first Cuban independence movement, Jose Marti.  </P> <P> Actor E. J. Castillo makes Marti a dream presence, more than an actual one,  perhaps reminding us of the godlike, young singing star in the play that  Machado has just translated, beautifully, for the Mark Taper Forum, Jose  Ignacio Cabrujas' "The Day You'll Love Me." There, too, we had a tribe of  sisters wondering what to do next.  </P> <P> "A Burning Beach," however, has a much more political agenda than the Cabrujas  play. It is an allegory. The young American woman (Jennifer Joan Taylor) stands  for seductive American imperialism. The black maid (Jonelle Allen) stands for  voodoo and heat. The half-brother is Cuba (Robert Beltran), realizing that its  mixed-blood is its strength.  </P> <P> The two sisters? The frilly one (Christine Avila) is the patrician class,  beautiful but ineffectual. The angular one (Ellen Barber) is harder to read.  She shows considerable spirit, up to a point, but ultimately accepts being  defined as an onlooker rather than a maker of history. Maybe we need to know  more of the actual history here, or maybe Machado hasn't made his statement  clearly enough.  </P> <P> How does it work as a play? Not particularly well. Certain scenes go nicely:  the business where the Yankee girl tries to seduce the sisters by turn, the  meeting between the son and the mythical Marti.  </P> <P> But the overall effect reminds one of the play's front curtain, presumably  painted by designer John Iacovelli. It's a mural of heroic figures with a white  space in the middle, as though the mural (the revolution?) hadn't been  completed. We admire the scale of the work, we enjoy the freshness of the  colors and we can make a general guess as to the strategy of the composition.  But it doesn't truly fall into place, as a good mural and a good play ought to  do.  </P> <P> To marry the allegorical and the personal is a tough trick. "A Burning Beach"  doesn't quite give us characters in whom we can believe, yet doesn't quite give  us a clear and compelling social parable either. We may need to have more about  the son's journey, the only one that has a real arrival. But something's  keeping the story at bay.  </P> <P> The production, co-directed by Bill Bushnell and Jose Luis Valenzuela,  emphasizes visuals so strongly that one suspects a certain lack of confidence  in the text. There are some striking stage pictures here -- a room full of  cane-bottom chairs knocked askew by the fighting sisters, a row of doors  opening onto a ghostly green void, a "beach" that is planks. (Douglas D.  Smith's hot lights and Jon Gottlieb's surging ocean sounds supply the rest of  the picture.)  </P> <P> But when everything has to stop at a crucial point until the next scenic effect  is ready behind the curtain -- this involving lots of candles -- the trappings  of the production get in the way.  </P> <P> This is a play that needs momentum, not pageantry.  </P> <P> The acting, throughout, is lively and idiomatic, with Barber particularly  affecting as the angular sister who doesn't know exactly what she wants, but  knows that it's more than this. The cast understands the play in its blood, and  that's a big help to the spectator who doesn't. Even then, "A Burning Beach"  stays just out of reach.  </P> <P>  Plays Tuesdays-Sundays at 8 p.m., with Saturday-Sunday matinees at2 p.m.  Closes March 19. Tickets $22-$25. 514 S.

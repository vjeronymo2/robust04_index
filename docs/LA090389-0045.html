			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLA BREVE: NEW ON CDS: OPERAS FROM GERSHWIN TO VERDI  </P> <P> D'ALBERT: "Tiefland." Isabell Strauss, Rudolf Schock, Gerd Feldhoff; RIAS  Choir; Berlin Symphony, conducted by Hans Zanotelli. Eurodisc 7797-2-RG (two  compact discs). Eugene d'Albert's one enduring contribution to the operatic  literature is a bit of Teutonic verismo set in Spain, heavily indebted to  Wagnerian and Straussian chromaticism and a bit too much of all of them. Rudolf  Lothar's libretto, which concerns the evil landowner Sebastiano's attempt to  marry off his mistress, Marta, to the simple shepherd Pedro, while still  enjoying her favors, strains the credulity, even in the wildly irrational world  of opera. That may explain why the piece, despite its moderate appeal, has  failed to convert audiences outside German-language countries. Eurodisc's  performance derives from the sound track of a 1963 television film. Strauss'  passionate Marta make one regret the soprano's premature death; Schock as the  hero and Feldhoff as the villain voice their platitudes convincingly.  Zanotelli's conducting and RCA's digital remastering are serviceable.ALLAN  ULRICH  </P></p>

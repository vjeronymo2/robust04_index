			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (27): Analysts point to pricing anomalies - Brady bonds From unsure beginnings, Brady bonds have become one of the most actively-traded sectors of the international bond markets. The bonds emerged from the ashes of the 1980s developing-country debt crisis and the debt initiative launched in 1989 by the then US Treasury Secretary, Nicholas Brady. Brady bonds were concessional bonds issued to holders of bank debt which had been subject to restructurings throughout the 1980s; often the bonds were backed by guarantees of some interest and principal. Now the universe of Brady bonds is around Dollars 95bn, of which issues amounting to something less than Dollars 80bn are actively traded. A large proportion of these bonds are no longer held by banks, and are traded among individual and, increasingly, institutional investors. For much of the 1990s, helped by the improved economic performance of countries such as Mexico and Argentina, the prices of Brady bonds have moved relentlessly upwards. As yields fell on the bonds of these well-performing governments, investors began to cast the net wider, seeking high yields. Even poorly performing countries such as Nigeria and countries without a Brady deal, such as Peru, have seen the prices of their debt rising sharply. The rises - J P Morgan calculates total 1993 return from fixed-rate Brady bonds last year were 48.99 per cent and floating-rate Brady-bonds 38.37 per cent - have been such that some investors have begun to question whether there is anything left for investors in the Brady bond market. To argue that there is, many analysts are pointing to what they say are pricing anomalies between the Brady bond market and comparable Eurobonds. Typical of these anomalies is the yield gap between the Dollars 1bn global bond issued by Mexico's Bancomext in January and so-called Aztec bonds, issued by the government under a 1988 attempt to restructure debt which anticipated the Brady initiative. The issue for state-owned Bancomext was launched at around 160 basis points of 10-year US Treasury note rates; the Aztec bonds - which mature in 14 years' time - yield 200 basis points over the Treasury yield curve. Yet, because of the US Treasury collateral, the yield, stripped of its US Treasury element, is calculated at 400 basis points or more - significantly more than the Bancomext issue. Mr Shahriar Shahida, head of emerging market debt trading and sales at Paribas Capital Markets in London, argues that, not only do many Brady bond issues yield more than equivalent Eurobonds, but they are also often more liquid and easy to trade. Mr Paul Luke, at Morgan Grenfell, and others say that Brady bonds may be a superior risk to comparable Eurobonds. He argues that, in Latin American restructurings arising from defaults in the 1930s, bondholders that had already been forced to take a write-down were treated better in subsequent restructurings. Furthermore, the 'specialness' of the Latin Eurobond issues, which meant that there were no significant defaults through the 1980s (because there were hardly any outstanding bonds), is disappearing. Some Dollars 25bn of new bond market debt was issued by Latin American issuers last year alone. Some investors still believe that the biggest gains are to be made in that shrinking number of countries yet to achieve a Brady deal. Brazil, which has scheduled a closing for its Brady deal by April 15, Peru, Ecuador, and Poland have all to complete Brady reschedulings. The price of Peru's debt, for example, has risen sevenfold in the past couple of years, and is now trading at 70 cents to the dollar. Roughly half of this is accounted for by unpaid interest. Some investors are still excited by the opportunity for profit through an expected active debt-for-equity swap programme in the mould of Argentina's privatisation plan. Investors in this pre-Brady debt have emerged as an increasingly important force: the Dart family of the US - which made its fortune in the 1960s through the invention of the polystyrene cup - has amassed a holding of at least Dollars 1.2bn face-value of Brazilian debt - 3.5 per cent of the outstanding medium-term debt not held by Brazilian banks. The family is unwilling to join the agreement carved out between the banks and the government, which threatens to hold up the agreement. The Darts, bankers reckon, may have important positions in other pre-Brady countries.</p>

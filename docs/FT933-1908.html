			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Crisis in Russia: Die is cast in Moscow for a fight to the finish THE DIE, long awaited, appears to be cast. In his television address to the nation, broadcast at 8pm Moscow time on the channel still received in most parts of the former Soviet Union, President Boris Yeltsin finally and explicitly acknowledged that he could not create new constitutional forms of government without breaching the present, Soviet era constitution. He has decided to do so: and has signed the order dissolving the parliament. It has been an excruciating delay since, in April, he received the support of the Russian people in a referendum for himself and for his economic policies. That vote, surprisingly positive from a people wearied of political squabbles and economic decline, was followed by further squabbling (at a higher pitch) and further decline (at a faster rate). Mr Yeltsin had identified two projects which he was determined to set in train. One was the creation of a federation council which would form the top tier of a new, two-chamber parliament, to be known as the federal assembly. It is this last body which, last night, he said would be the supreme legislative body in the country - even though, last weekend, at their meeting in Moscow, the regional leaders refused to agree to their transformation into the new assembly's upper tier. The second was the publication of a new constitution, to lay the legislative basis for the vexed question of the division of power among the presidency, parliament, government and regional and local administrations. He wanted at the very least an electoral law and a 'short constitution' allowing elections to the new body which would supersede the standing Supreme Soviet and its Congress of People's Deputies. Parliamentary leaders, with their own draft of a constitution, had appealed to the president to meet them to discuss merging the two drafts. This appeal, apparently, had fallen on deaf ears, probably because the president and his advisers did not believe that a draft outlining a strong presidency and a subordinate parliament could be merged with one calling for a strong parliament and a presidency confined largely to foreign affairs, nominations of leading government figures and ceremony. Mr Yeltsin devoted at least half of last night's address to attempting to show that all his efforts at compromise over the past months had been in vain, saying that in the last few days it had become obvious no co-operation between presidency and parliament was possible. 'Parliament', he claimed, 'has been seized by a group of persons who have turned it into the staff of the irreconcilable opposition. Hiding behind deputies, this group is pushing Russia towards the abyss. . . (it) has lost its right to be in control of crucial levers of state power.' As well as a stasis of political power, the president has seen a collapse of any hopes of economic regeneration this year. Inflation, lowered in the spring to around 15 per cent a month, reached around 30 per cent in August. Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, said in an interview published yesterday that it would not fall below a 15-20 per cent range this year. Decisions by the parliament to increase spending on a range of social and industrial programmes would have pushed the deficit up to around 25 per cent of GNP - and Mr Yeltsin's refusal to sign the budget into law was held by Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, to be a breach of the constitution. In naming Mr Yegor Gaidar, the former acting prime minister, to be first deputy premier in charge of the economy, the president again defied a parliament which had brought about Mr Gaidar's dismissal from office last December. In his appointment, Mr Yeltsin was also trying to address the fears of the Group of Seven nations and the International Monetary Fund that the reformers were hopelessly off track and could not attract more assistance while they remained so. Now that he has, in a stroke, rid himself of his opponents, he will presumably give free rein to Mr Gaidar and to the reformers to bring in the measures about which they have spoken for so long - tight credit, cuts in budget programmes and faster progress in privatisation.</p>

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Virtuality incurs Pounds 365,000 deficit Virtuality Group, the designer and manufacturer of virtual reality computer games which floated in October, is planning to treble its development spending this year to take advantage of the potential home market. Mr Jon Waldern, managing director, warned that the increased investment would mean continued losses for the company, which yesterday announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 365,000 for the year to end-December. Mr Waldern said that the next generation of home computer games machines, which would be able to run virtual reality software, were being developed more quickly than expected and were now forecast to reach the market by the beginning of next year. Virtuality is negotiating potential partnerships with the main home games machine manufacturers, which include Nintendo, Sega and Sony. Virtuality has 13 games, developed for its own arcade-style machines, which could be transferred to the new home computers. Mr Waldern said there were also opportunities to license Virtuality's technology for use in non-entertainment applications. Valued at nearly Pounds 85m on the stock market, Virtuality increased its sales to Pounds 5.4m (Pounds 5.25m) last year, representing growth of 50 per cent excluding a one-off order in 1992. In January, it launched its second generation machines, which incorporate better graphics and lighter headsets. They are also 30 per cent cheaper at about Pounds 20,000 each. Mr Waldern said the reaction to the new products had exceeded expectations, with sales so far up 50 per cent on last year. Development expenditure jumped from Pounds 505,000 to Pounds 1.23m last year, turning a Pounds 217,000 profit into a Pounds 365,000 loss. In its flotation prospectus Virtuality forecast a loss of Pounds 400,000 and said it would not pay dividends 'during the initial period of the company's growth'. Although development spending may rise by another Pounds 2m in 1994, the company had year-end cash balances of Pounds 7.47m, which it said was sufficient for its current needs. In response to interest from American investors, Virtuality has arranged for its shares to be traded on the US Nasdaq market in the form of American Depositary Receipts from April 5. 'It should increase understanding of our business in the US, which is our largest market,' said Mr Waldern. Virtuality shares were unchanged at 324p, almost double their placing price of 170p.</p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Business start-ups increase by 19% A SHARP increase in the number of business start-ups in the last three months of last year may indicate that the worst of the recession is over, a survey by Barclays Bank says. The bank's small business bulletin reported that 125,000 businesses were launched in the last quarter of last year - an increase of 19 per cent on the same period of 1991. The increase was due in part to cuts in bank base rates and rising levels of unemployment, the bulletin said. In the whole of last year, however, new business starts fell to 455,000 from 484,000 the year before. Business closures continued to outnumber new starts with 570,000 businesses ceasing to trade. This was 17,000 fewer than the closures in 1991. Overall, the stock of small businesses fell 4 per cent to 2.77m although there were still more businesses registered than at any time before 1987-1989. The failure of many very small and young businesses has led to a change in the profile of the average business. The proportion of older, larger businesses is on the increase. Businesses with an annual turnover of more than Pounds 100,000 rose by 60,000 (5 per cent) between 1990 and 1992. Nearly 13 per cent of all starts were in the manufacturing sector last year, compared with 9 per cent in 1991, the bulletin reported.</p>

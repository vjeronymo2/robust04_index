Sharma,  today issued an ordinance giving effect to the new mineral  policy which opens up the non-energy mining sector to private  enterprise, both domestic and foreign.    The ordinance amends the Mines and Minerals (regulation and  development) Act, 1957, to achieve the objective.    The national mineral policy, announced in March last year,  had dispensed with the reservation of all the 13 minerals for  exclusive exploitation by the public sector and sought to invite  foreign investment in the mining sector.    The minerals dereserved are iron ore, manganese, chrome,  sulphur, gold, diamond, copper, lead, zinc, molybdenum,  tungsten, nickel and platinum.--UNI</p>

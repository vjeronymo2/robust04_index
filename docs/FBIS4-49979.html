			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Rain Ren] </F>   [Text] Hopes for an agreement over military lands have  evaporated following a dramatic new set of demands by the  Chinese, it was revealed yesterday. Officials close to the  negotiations said the British were "shocked" when told that the  promised new naval base for the People's Liberation Army (PLA)  on Stonecutters Island was "too small."    The Chinese have also reneged on a promise to allow some  residential property occupied by the British military to be  redeveloped. The PLA now wants to use the property to house its  own soldiers.    Chinese negotiators were also reluctant to agree on specific  wording that any unused sites after the 1997 handover must be  given to the special administrative region government. The PLA,  a powerful behind-the-scenes influence during the seven-year  talks, is thought to be responsible for the new demands.    These unexpected setbacks emerged after the second day of  Joint Liaison Group (JLG) talks in Hong Kong yesterday. A  source said that the British side had thought that everything  was in place and a final agreement had been expected tomorrow.  Officials said it was unlikely that Britain could meet China's  new demands.    The government's original idea was to pay for the PLA naval  base on Stonecutters Island with the profits received from the  sale of the military flats. If those flats had to be released  to the PLA, officials said, the Government would have to draw  from its reserve funds to build the new naval base. It would be  hard to win Legislative Council approval for this.    It is believed that during the last JLG defence land expert  meeting the two sides agreed the size of the new naval base  would be about 160,000 square metres. It was estimated the  government would have to pay more than $1bn for its construction.    China's new demands mean that seven years of talks have  failed to reach agreement about the disposal of military lands.  This will create a bad atmosphere at the JLG general session  scheduled for May 31.    During the two-day meeting, according to sources, British  negotiators tried deseparately to remind their Chinese  colleagues of all those matters that Britain assumed had been  agreed by China before the meeting. China had reportedly agreed  to release about 25 sites to the government for redevelopment,  including Royden Court in Repulse Bay, Mt Austin Mansion at the  Peak, Cape Mansion, Harcourt Place in Happy Valley, Tudor Court  in Kowloon, and Burma Lines in Fanling. Of 11 main military  sites, the PLA was expected to get about eight, including the  Prince of Wales building in Central, the naval base on  Stonecutters Island, the Gun Club Hill site in Kowloon, which  will be used to build a military hospital for the PLA, Stanley  Fort, and the barracks in Osborn [Kowloon Tong] and Sek Kong.    The Chinese JLG officials will be shown some sites today,  after which the talks will continue.</p>

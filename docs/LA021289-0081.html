			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEVELOPER SUES MALIBU COUNCIL FOR ATTACK IN AD  </P> <P> As the largest commercial developer in a community where the ruling political  body is controlled by staunch no- and slow-growth advocates, Roy Crummer has  been an easy target for the steady stream of slings and arrows fired by the  Malibu Township Council.  </P> <P> But recently, Crummer decided to fire back.  </P> <P> After seeing his name published in a biting newspaper ad that ran in the Malibu  Times and in the township council's newsletter, Crummer sued the council and  three of its members for libel. Crummer is seeking more than $10 million in  damages from the group, which he claims launched a scurrilous attack "without  any regard for the truth."  </P> <P> The suit underscored the decades-long political battle in Malibu over coastal  development and brought to the forefront numerous critics of the township  council, who have become increasingly dismayed over the group's tactics to win  support in the community.  </P> <P> The council, the largest civic group in Malibu, led an unsuccessful fight last  month to stop Los Angeles County supervisors from placing a sewer in Malibu  without a vote of the residents. It is responsible for launching the cityhood  effort to wrest control over development from the county.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mixed View of Council  </P> <P> Although many residents in Malibu applauded the group's efforts to limit  haphazard growth in the area, several community leaders have been appalled by  the council's methods, especially its reliance on strident rhetoric in its  newsletter and flyers.  </P> <P> The group further enraged long-time supporters recently when, after more than a  year of study, a citizens committee that included Crummer and three members of  the township council endorsed a medium-size sewer system for Malibu. However,  almost immediately after the committee unanimously voted to recommend approval  of the system to supervisors, the township council disassociated itself from  the proposal and said that its representatives on the committee did not speak  for the group.  </P> <P> And although the township council sparked the cityhood movement, some members  of the Malibu Committee for Incorporation attempted to distance themselves from  the council because of its unpopularity in some circles.  </P> <P> "The township council performs an effective function, and they have to be given  credit for the many ad hoc movements they've led," said Peter Arnold, president  of the Malibu Chamber of Commerce. "But their approach tends to be highly  confrontational. They're rather hostile to those that don't agree with them and  often they just overstate their case."  </P> <P> Crummer's lawsuit was based on published statements by the council that ran  shortly before county supervisors approved a $43-million sewer system for  Malibu on Jan. 12. Last week, the township council filed a lawsuit to block the  sewer plan, charging that homeowners have been saddled with unfair sewer fees  while businesses and large landowners reap a financial windfall.  </P> <P> Prior to the Jan. 12 meeting, the group took out an ad in one of Malibu's two  weekly newspapers to try to raise money for its anti-sewer campaign. It used  the space to blast Crummer, Pepperdine University and a lawyer for the Adamson  Companies, another large landowner in the area.  </P> <P> The ad labeled Crummer "Super Rich Roy" and charged that the developer unfairly  used his "considerable financial and political clout" with supervisors to pass  on the costs of the sewer system to homeowners. The ad was bordered by the word  "shameful" 40 times.  </P> <P> And in the township council's newsletter, the group charged that Crummer and  others have given millions of dollars in political donations to supervisors to  get approval for the sewer, which, they say, will lead to "the long-anticipated  orgy of development."  </P> <P> The developer said he has contributed less than $10,000 to Supervisor Deane  Dana, whose district includes Malibu, in the last eight years and hasn't given  any money to any of the other county supervisors. The township council devoted  an earlier newsletter to Dana, referring to him as "Sewer King Dana."  </P> <P> The group also took a shot at Crummer's newly constructed shopping mall in the  Civic Center, suggesting that it is the beginning of massive development in  Malibu.  </P> <P> Crummer responded with his libel suit, alleging that he suffered humiliation,  mental anguish and emotional distress because of the written comments. He  charged that the group's statements allegations are "false and misleading" and  "go beyond all bounds of decency such as to amount to outrageous behavior." The  lawsuit also names council President Larry Wan, Treasurer Frank Basso and  member Carl Randall.  </P> <P> "When they lie about me, they'd better get their facts straight," Crummer said.  "I'm fed up with their bullying tactics and tired of their personal attacks on  people. I've taken plenty of shots from them before, but this time they went  too far. I want them to stop telling lies about me."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Defends Action  </P> <P> Wan defended the group's action and called the libel suit an attempt to  distract attention from the township council's legal fight against the  county-approved sewer plan.  </P> <P> "That's our interpretation," Wan said. "Unfortunately, the courts today are too  often used for lawsuits of this kind."  </P> <P> Wan, Randall and other members of the township council declined to discuss the  specific charges in the libel suit.  </P> <P> However, several community leaders said the suit could be particularly damaging  to the group's credibility in Malibu. The township council, which is similar to  a residents group and has more than 1,000 members in the community of 20,000,  is by far the most powerful and the richest political group in Malibu, raising  nearly $100,000 to fight the sewer proposal. Yet several leading community  figures have left the organization in recent years, expressing dissatisfaction  with the group's views.  </P> <P> "They've turned many intelligent people off by some of their irresponsible  rhetoric," said Dr. Susan Reynolds, head of the Malibu Emergency Room and vice  president of the Chamber of Commerce. "Certain things they represent are good  for the community, but the rhetoric and negativism that they engage in need a  lot of improvement, and somebody needs to take them to task."  </P> <P> Leon Cooper, a former president of the township council and one of its most  outspoken members, did not deny that the group is often contentious, but said  that its behavior is justified by the relentless attempts by the county and  some developers to destroy some of the natural beauty of the beachfront  community. He said the group should be credited for leading the fight to block  a county proposal to build a recreational vehicle park at Zuma Beach and  praised for its efforts to create Malibu Lagoon State Park.  </P> <P> "The Malibu Township Council has a long and illustrious history of defending  issues that will benefit the community," he said. "We've been able to prevent  some disastrous things from happening.  </P> <P> "I'm pretty contentious myself, and people (in the group) get excited about  things that we think are grossly unfair. Some of the things that go on here  make me angry, and I vent my spleen. But just because some of us have a short  fuse doesn't mean that the cause is unjust."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stirred Emotion  </P> <P> The suit has stirred much emotion in the community. Ronald Carpol, Crummer's  attorney, said he has received several "hate calls" from township council  supporters. However, he said, most of the callers praise Crummer for taking on  the council.  </P> <P> Crummer said he considered ignoring the group's written remarks but decided  that he was fed up with the council's view "that they can say whatever they  want about anybody they want."  </P> <P> "These attacks are so personal and petty that it reminds me of the type of name  calling you would see in grammar school," he said. "There's nothing wrong with  criticism and with disagreements among people, but there are limits. If you  attack people or issues, you should do it in a responsible way."  </P></p>

			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Durables orders underscore recovery in US A fresh batch of economic statistics, led by strong orders for durable goods, gave further indications of the vigour of the US economy yesterday. In November, orders for manufactured durable goods rose by 2 per cent to Dollars 139.4bn. That follows a 2.6 per cent advance in October and constitutes the fourth consecutive monthly increase, the longest series of gains for more than six years. Orders stood 8.8 per cent higher than a year ago. The increase was led by the aircraft and automobile sectors, with transportation as a group up 5.7 per cent in the month. The only leading industrial category to record a decline in November was electrical machinery. In view of the contracting military budget, overall defence orders also fell - by 1.7 per cent - but that was more than offset by a healthy 5.3 per cent rise in the non-defence sector, which augurs well for future capital spending. Shipments of durable goods also rose for the fourth consecutive month, this time by 2.7 per cent, while unfilled orders - the manufacturing backlog - fell for the ninth consecutive month, by 0.6 per cent in November, to the lowest level since May 1988. The government also reported that personal incomes rose last month by more than personal spending, an indication that the consumer, although saving less, may yet help to sustain the recovery. Income went up by 0.6 per cent in November, another fourth monthly increase in succession, while spending rose for the eighth consecutive month, this time by 0.4 per cent, only half the level of October. Meanwhile, Mr Leon Panetta, the budget director, forecast that the federal deficit in fiscal 1995, starting next year, would fall to about Dollars 190bn (Pounds 127bn), compared with a little under Dollars 250bn in the current year and a shortfall for fiscal 1995 of just over Dollars 300bn projected when the Clinton administration took office. Mr Panetta attributed the reduction to the effect on new deficit-cutting policies and to the renewed strength in the economy, which increases tax revenues.</p>

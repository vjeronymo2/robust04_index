			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Reds launch an attack on off-field operations - Manchester United's non-football activities have a growing importance On May 8, more than 44,000 of the faithful will file into Old Trafford to watch one of Britain's more successful small companies at work. When Manchester United takes the field for its last home game of the season, all minds will be concentrated on football, its core business. But for the directors watching that afternoon's clash with Coventry City, the Reds represent much more than a talented squad dominated by Eric Cantona, Ryan Giggs and Andrei Kanchelskis. It has become a multi-layered business in which turnover from gate receipts has been outstripped by secondary income from merchandising, television, sponsorship, the conference business and catering. Underlining their growing importance to the club, these non-footballing activities helped lift first-half profits by 65 per cent to Pounds 7.6m. Together they contributed more than Pounds 12m to turnover which rose 75 per cent to Pounds 22.8m in the six months to January 31. While the fans savour the prospects of the double - adding the FA Cup on May 14 to the Premiership won earlier this week - the board has turned its mind increasingly to off-field activities which, it believes, could safeguard the company's finances should the team be hit by a run of poor form, injuries and failure to succeed in cup competitions. That risk is minimised primarily by season ticket sales, which swell the club's coffers in the July before each season. Following the completion of the Pounds 10.3m Stretford End stand, boasting 49 boxes and 864 club class seats, the portion of advance sales has increased sharply and helped lift average turnover for each home game from Pounds 580,000 to Pounds 767,000. Non-season ticket receipts, meanwhile, have been matched by sales from other sources such as catering, programmes and merchandise. Mr Robin Launders, finance director, believes the growth of non-core activities, including financial services, sets Manchester United apart from almost every other football club. Their year-round contribution offsets the seasonal aspect of the footballing business and generates profits long after the players have hung up their boots. All this enables the board to estimate, conservatively, what the company will earn each season. It can calculate receipts from the guaranteed number of home games, likely television distribution revenue, and profits on sponsorship, royalties and merchandise. It allows Manchester United - one of three quoted clubs  - to set aside a portion of after-tax earnings for its transfer fee reserve - essentially a pot of distributable cash for buying and selling players. 'We always budget for the worst scenario: that we are hovering near the relegation zone and have failed in the cup competitions,' says Mr Launders. 'It's then that we would fall back on the transfer fee reserve to rebuild the team.' Profit from cup competitions can, therefore, be treated as exceptional gains which can be used to top up the reserve and increase the club's ability to buy new players. The size of those profits will be substantially boosted next season by inclusion in the European Cup competition - the Continent's premier championship. Seeded along with the likes of AC Milan and Ajax, Italian and Dutch champions respectively, the club will accrue the benefit from three home ties in the league stage, along with about Pounds 500,000 from UEFA. A reasonable run in the competition could bring in about Pounds 2m. Mr Launders regards the prospect as a virtuous circle, which will prompt increased demand for season tickets and non-core products such as videos, souvenirs and even financial services. 'If we can play football in an attractive way which wins competitions it is a boon. 'We already have a guaranteed income, but if we can persuade more people to support us it creates spin-off benefits for our other businesses.' So far this year, success on the field and lucrative sideline businesses have left the club with a transfer fee reserve increased from Pounds 2.25m to Pounds 3.25m. It has also generated Pounds 5.9m net cash which, true to his conservative financial principles, Mr Launders has invested mostly in gilt-edged stock. He says such investments not only give the club fixed interest rates, but 48-hour access to funds should it need a large sum to buy a player. More importantly, it gives Manchester United financial stability in a notoriously uncertain industry. 'We're in a unique position compared with most clubs,' he says. 'New businesses like wholesaling have brought in more revenue and we don't need to borrow to buy new assets. 'It shows we are still a football team but we're prepared to seize every financial opportunity which comes out of that.'</p>

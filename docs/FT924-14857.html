			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Public spending faces further cuts MR NORMAN LAMONT will today seek to restore the government's credibility in financial markets by putting tough control of public spending at the heart of the economic strategy which replaces UK membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. As the chancellor prepared to set out at the Tory conference the new ground rules for his economic policy, cabinet colleagues said the Treasury wanted to lower further the Pounds 244.5bn spending figure agreed for next year. In spite of public admissions that the existing target would involve significant cash reductions for most Whitehall spending programmes, the minsters said the Treasury was emphasising that the figure was a 'ceiling' rather than a target. Ministers said the allocation of the overall budget between different departments would not be agreed for several weeks, but it was already clear several once-cherished projects would be cut. The Treasury has told spending ministers that four unavoidable spending increases - on the unemployed, EC farm subsidies, legal aid and on the increased numbers in higher education - have more than wiped out the Pounds 4bn available from the Treasury's contingency reserve. With more than Pounds 1bn allotted to ease the replacement of the poll tax by the council tax, it would be impossible to avoid cash reductions in budgets ranging from health to overseas aid. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, whose unemployment benefit budget will rise sharply as a result of the recession, acknowledged yesterday he faced much tighter constraints on discretion benefits for the poor and disabled. Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, and Mr John Patten, the education secretary, admitted they faced a squeeze on resources. Mr Lamont intends to use his speech to the conference to set out the broad parameters of his anti-inflation strategy. Apart from tight control of spending, he will say interest rates will be set to meet monetary targets with both exchange rate and asset prices taken into account. Business and sterling, Page 10</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Mobile Communications (7): Straws in the wind on cellular - Cellnet, Vodafone and others will soon have to 'compete for real' IT IS the boast of Vodafone and Cellnet, which hitherto carved up virtually all the UK's cellular business between them, that they have never raised a tariff. With their margins stratospheric, it is an idle boast. Vodafone last year made an operating profit equivalent to 46 per cent of sales. Cellnet did less well, but its margins are still remarkable. For those concerned about collusion in duopolies, the case for a hard look at the cellular market by the Office of Fair Trading may be overwhelming. A reference to the OFT is nonetheless highly unlikely in the near future, for two reasons. First, mobile phone users seem to enjoy paying through the nose. At least, they make few protests. Low rates of migration from the operators' high to low-usage tariffs, introduced last year, do not indicate heightened sensitivity among existing users. With the market set for another record year, with around 400,000 net new connections between Cellnet and Vodafone, operators can continue to make a healthy living from those prepared to pay current rates. tion is on the way. The existing operators seem almost relieved at the prospect. As Mr Gerry Whent said of Mercury One-2-One shortly before the launch of its PCN network in the south-east: 'We need you as competition, otherwise we will get regulated.' He immediately added, of course, that he expected the mobile business to rise overall as a result, and Vodafone to benefit thereby. It is too soon to gauge the likely impact of One-2-One, but one thing is clear: low prices, likely to promote a mobile consumer boom, are not on the near horizon. One-2-One will charge only two-thirds of the price levied by its two rivals for peak rate calls made on its PCN network. But at 16p a minute at peak rate, with an initial connection charge of Pounds 20 and a monthly subscription of the same amount, it is still anything but cheap. And that is after the cost of the handset itself, which comes out at about Pounds 250. To match Vodafone's Lowcall and Cellnet's Lifetime services, One-2-One also has a special tariff for low users. But that, again, is still beyond the reach of most consumer pockets, with a monthly subscription of Pounds 12.50 and a peak-rate call charge of 25p a minute. Vodafone and Cellnet have not been slow to respond. Vodafone has reduced its London tariff to bring it in line with its national tariff - a 25 per cent cut from 33p a minute to 25p at peak rate. It has also announced lower charges for its new MetroDigital service to be launched next month, using a digital network piggy-backing on its GSM network. The MetroDigital rate for daytime local calls will be 20p a minute. Off-peak calls will be priced at 10p a minute. Cellnet has gone further still, launching a new 'Citytime' tariff on its existing analogue network, cutting call prices for subscribers within the M25 area by up to 39 per cent. From next month, the daytime 'Citytime' tariff for calls made within the area will be 20p a minute, but at the expense of a far higher price than present - 50p a minute - for calls made outside the M25 zone. All off-peak calls will be priced at 10p a minute. These reductions are probably the minimum the older operators could have got away with, given One-2-One's catchment area and the fact that about a quarter of all mobile calls are made within the M25. Of course, further cuts are on the cards if Mercury comes remotely close to realising the goal of Mr Richard Goswell, its managing director, for 1m customers. They might also come if Hutchison's 'Rabbit' telepoint service, which is now complete, looked like creaming off a significant slice of the 'cheaper' business market - something it has failed to do so far, its price providing insufficient compensation for its inability to receive incoming calls, and the restriction of being able to make outgoing calls only in places with a Rabbit sign. There is a further straw in the wind: the growing reluctance of the operators to sell their wares through service providers, who act as retailers of their 'wholesale' tariffs, creaming off a profit on the way. One-2-One has all but shut out the service providers - much to their chagrin  -and will deal directly with most of its customers. Cellnet and Vodafone are still bound to use service providers by the terms of their licences; but these terms are subject to review at the end of the year, and it is likely that one or both of them will undertake direct selling of their own, albeit without seeking to undermine the service providers at the outset. 'The industry is moving towards more personalised communications and marketing,' says Mr Dean Eyres, an analyst with Dataquest, the consultancy company. 'Originally it was just sales, no marketing. Operators realise that the higher margin business is going, and they have to start competing for real.' As yet, they have barely started 'competing for real'. It is not just a question of whether an unregulated three-cornered market proves more cost-conscious than the existing regime. There is also the question of how to market such a complex array of tariffs - now some 10 in all - between the three operators. Mr Whent does not regard that number as a problem. 'It is far fewer than in life insurance,' he claims. So wait for the mobile door-to-do salesman around the corner.</p>

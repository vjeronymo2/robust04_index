The final rules adopted in this decision may be found elsewhere in this issue. In the Further Notice Proposed Rulemaking, the Commission sought comment on possible alternative definitions for small cable operators, independent small cable systems, and small cable systems owned by small multiple system operators. The Commission also sought comment on whether to retain current definitions or use different definitions for purposes of establishing special rate or administrative treatment for small operators and small multiple system operators. The Commission specifically seeks comment on these issues in light of Section 3(a) of the Small Business Act, and on whether the Commission should employ the current Small Business Administration definition of a small cable company in the cable rules. A change in the definitions of these categories of cable operators may affect eligibility under any final rules which the Commission may adopt pertaining to small cable systems. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> dates:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments are due on or before November 16, 1994 and reply comments are due on or before December 16, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> addresses:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments and reply comments should be sent to Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M Street NW., Washington, DC 20554. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> for further information contact:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Susan Cosentino, (202) 416&hyph;0800. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> supplementary information:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> This is the proposed rules segment of the Commission's Fifth Order on Reconsideration and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in MM Docket No. 92&hyph;266 and MM Docket No. 93&hyph;215, FCC 94&hyph;234, adopted September 12, 1994 and released September 26, 1994.

SBA rules currently define a small cable company as one with $11 million or less in gross revenues. The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 defined a small cable system as one with 1,000 or fewer subscribers. A small cable operator is defined as one with 15,000 or fewer subscribers that is not affiliated with a larger operator. In addition, a small multiple system operator (``MSO'') is one serving 250,000 or fewer total subscribers that owns only systems with less than 10,000 subscribers each and has an average system size of 1,000 or fewer subscribers. In this rulemaking, the SBA's Office of Advocacy and the Small Cable Business Association have expressed concern about the Commission's definitions of small operators eligible for transition relief and our definition of small MSOs. Specifically, the SBA's Office of Advocacy and the Small Cable Business Association believe the current definitions in our rules defining eligibility for transition and administrative relief are under inclusive and were promulgated in violation of &sect;3(a) of the Small Business Act. They urge us to re-evaluate the definitions and seek public input before deciding on permanent standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Chief Counsel of the SBA's Office of Advocacy has urged the Commission to explore a full range of burden-reducing regulatory options in our rate proceedings. We are in full agreement with that suggestion. Based on the existing record, however, we are not persuaded that the actions taken to date to ease the regulatory difficulties faced by smaller operators have been undertaken in violation of the law. Specifically, the Commission does not believe that Small Business Administration size standards, to which federal agencies may be required to adhere under Section 3 of the Small Business Act, are applicable to the Commission's definitions of small cable operators and small cable systems developed in the Second Order on Reconsideration, Fourth Report and Order, and Fifth Notice of Proposed Rulemaking MM Docket No. 92&hyph;266. For example, Section 3(a) of the Small Business Act provides that SBA size standards apply for the purposes of all legislation, unless the legislation specifically authorizes different size standards. The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (``1992 Cable Act'') in fact contains a size definition of a small system as one with 1,000 or fewer subscribers. See 47 U.S.C. &sect;543(i). Specifically, the statute requires the Commission to develop cable rate regulations that reduce cost and administrative burdens for such ``small systems.'' Given the statute's small system definition of 1,000 or fewer subscribers, Section 3(a) of the Small Business Act is inapplicable. The Commission has implemented the statutory provision regarding small system relief in a more flexible manner than is explicitly mandated by the 1992 Cable Act and is now considering further flexibility through extending relief to additional systems. But this does not alter the fact that the Commission is implementing a statute with an explicit small business standard. Additionally, the Small Business Act defines small-business concerns as one ``which is not dominant in its field of operation.'' 15 U.S.C. &sect;632(a)(1). Cable systems subject to rate regulation, regardless of whether they are large or small, are by definition dominant in their field of operation because they do not face effective competition. Thus, Section 3(a) of the Small Business Act also does not apply because regulated cable systems do not meet the definition of a small business concern. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

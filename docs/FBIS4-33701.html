			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>   [Text] It was reported this afternoon that a clandestine  group -- the self-proclaimed Domingo Monterrosa Command -- has  issued a death threat against Human Rights Ombudsman Carlos  Mauricio Molina. Molina, however, denied that he himself  received the death threat, but he did not rule out the  possibility that such a threat had indeed been made. According  to news agencies reports, Molina was given 48 hours to leave the  country, or he will be executed.    [Begin Molina recording] I cannot rule out the possibility  that the threat, which was uttered by people who oppose peace  and the country's stability, might be serious. [end recording]    Molina added that despite the threat he is willing to remain  in his post, because he has made a pledge to the people and  intends to fulfill it. He also said he will open an  investigation to identify the individuals behind the threats --  individuals he said should be considered enemies of peace.    [Begin Molina recording] The threats against several Jesuits  do not contribute to the peace process whatsoever. Instead,  each voice that calls for violence undermines the present trend  toward peace. [end recording]    A communique signed by the Domingo Monterrosa Command and  reported by various news agencies also contains death threats  against the attorney general, the president of the Judiciary  Council, Jesuit priests, and Luis Gomez Zarate for his criticism  of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal.</p>

This warning was given today by General Joao de Matos, chief  of the Armed Forces General Staff, who urged the population to  arm themselves because the war is far from over.    [Begin Matos recording] My hope is that the Angolan people  will be on their guard and that they will arm and organize  themselves in preparation for very difficult times, because  UNITA will continue waging war. [end recording]    Joao de Matos further stated that there has been no progress  whatsoever at the peace talks and that UNITA is only using them  to play for time.    [Begin Matos recording] We in the Armed Forces are beginning  to lose our patience. The negotiations have been going on for  so many months, and we in the Armed Forces note that there has  been no significant progress. Despite statements to the  contrary that have been made, all that is happening in Lusaka is  mere propaganda. Now, for example, UNITA has agreed to resolve  the question of the police force, but, in our opinion, this was  basically and solely because the UN Security Council was about  to meet. Now UNITA will continue to play its game, to play for  time, until the next Security Council meeting. [end recording]    Joao de Matos was speaking to reporters prior to departing  for Brazil where he will be negotiating arms supplies for the  Luanda government.</p>

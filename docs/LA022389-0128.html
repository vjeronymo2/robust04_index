			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UC IRVINE PLAYS HOST TO CS LONG BEACH  </P> <P> UC Irvine has won five of its last six basketball games and will finish the  regular season with a four-game home stand that begins tonight at 7:30 when the  Anteaters play host to Cal State Long Beach.  </P> <P> A sweep would guarantee Irvine at least a tie for second in the Big West  Conference, which would be a remarkable feat considering Irvine's 3-5 start in  conference play. The Anteaters are 11-12 overall and 8-6 in the Big West.  </P> <P> Long Beach (12-12, 9-6) had won four in a row before getting routed at Las  Vegas Monday night by 18th-ranked UNLV, 104-74. In the first meeting this  season, Long Beach won, 75-70. JOHN WEYLER  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Iraqi opposition sources in the north of the  homeland have accused elements among the Iraqi agents of killing  German journalist Lissy Schmidt, who worked for AFP and several  German newspapers. The source said that Saddam's bloody regime  promised its agents a reward of $10,000 for killing a foreigner  in north Iraq and that Schmidt is a victim of this criminal  campaign. The spokesman affirmed that Saddam makes light of the  UN resolutions, particularly Security Council Resolution 687,  which stipulates that halting terrorism is one of the conditions  for lifting the international sanctions imposed on Iraq because  of Saddam's indiscriminate policy. These sources added that  unknown gunmen killed Schmidt and her Kurdish companion, 'Aziz  Qadir, at noon the day before yesterday when they were  travelling to a village in al-Sulaymaniyah Governorate to report  on the arrival of humanitarian aid to the region.</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Blow to Sweden over Dollars 2.5bn bridge A project to build a Dollars 2.5bn bridge and tunnel link between Sweden and Denmark was further delayed yesterday in an embarrassing setback to Sweden's centre-right government. A commission expected to clear the remaining environmental objections said it was not satisfied on the key question of water flows through the Oresund strait. Its findings mean that a final decision on the project is unlikely to be taken before Sweden's September general election, following further investigations. The 17km combined road and rail link between Copenhagen and the southern Swedish city of Malmo would be one of Europe's largest infrastructure projects. The plan, which was first agreed by the Danish and Swedish governments in 1991, has received strong backing from most Swedish and Danish politicians, as well as industry and unions. However, Sweden's Centre Party, one of the partners in the four party coalition of prime minister Carl Bildt, has come out strongly against the project. It forced a detailed environmental investigation of the plan last January by threatening to leave the government. The central issue is whether the bridge will impede water flows into and out of the heavily polluted Baltic Sea. The aim has to been to secure a so-called 'zero solution, ensuring the water flows are not disturbed at all. Yesterday, Sweden's Water Rights Court said the bridge consortium had not shown that a 'zero solution' could be achieved in line with its criteria. Stressing that a 'zero solution' was still 'technically possible,' it called for the consortium to carry out new measurements before reporting back to the government. The government, accepting that the decision was a setback, said it would not necessarily be an electoral disadvantage if it meant that the Centre Party picked up extra votes from environmentalists. It directed its anger at the consortium for having failed to provide the Water Court with the information it required. 'They've blown it,' said one government source. The decision to proceed may end up being taken by the opposition Social Democrats. They are favoured to win the September election and have made it clear that they want the bridge to be built. Clearance work on the approaches to the bridge has already begun on the Danish side although it was suspended earlier this year pending a final decision from Sweden.</p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Survey of International Legal Services (4): Risks for directors grow - The public wants stricter corporate accountability Blame it on Maxwell, Guinness, Polly Peck, the Zeebrugge ferry disaster or multi-million pound pay-offs to Britain's business leaders - whatever the reason, standards of corporate governance are under the microscope. When things go wrong the public no longer seems prepared simply for a company to be in the dock; it wants the individuals responsible to be identified and held accountable. It is not just executive directors in the firing line, either. Other managers and officers in positions of authority in a company may also find themselves held accountable. Non-executive directors are no less vulnerable than their executive colleagues. And shadow directors - individuals on whose instruction or direction a company acts - can also find themselves under attack. Directors have become used to the idea that shareholders will sue the board of a company for mismanagement after an unexpected trading loss. They know, too, that they can be sued during takeovers, either by shareholders unhappy with the new board, or by the incoming board alleging misrepresentation against the outgoing directors. But recent legislative changes have also greatly increased the potential liability faced by directors and officers. The 1985 Companies Act sets out more than 200 offences with which a director or officer can be charged. There are further offences under health and safety, environmental, data protection and financial services legislation which can result in a fine, imprisonment or both. The potential personal exposure of directors was increased markedly by the Insolvency Act and by the Company Directors Disqualification Act. And there is more legislation to come - particularly from Europe - in the company, environmental and financial services fields. As trade barriers come down and the business world grows closer together, companies doing business across borders can find themselves facing unexpected liabilities in foreign jurisdictions. Investment in the US carries with it a substantial risk of litigation. Actions or the threat of actions against directors are a commonly used tactic in takeover battles. Martin Piers, partner of Gouldens, solicitors, says that UK lawyers and insurers at the recent Professional Liability Underwriting Society conference in Chicago were horrified by tales of the American Plaintiff Bar's ability to launch actions for 'securities fraud' against directors within hours of a significant drop in a company's share price. Delegates who took heart from the fact that such actions cannot be brought in the UK would have derived less comfort, he says, from the view expressed by US delegates and attorneys with knowledge of the UK market that the picture being painted of the UK situation was a little too rosy. Had US delegates known about the 1992 English case in which the court ruled that a director or officer can be held personally liable for a claim by a former employee who has suffered an industrial injury during the course of his employment, their assessment may have been less favourable. Employment practices claims are now the leading class of action against directors and officers in the US. Part of the solution to the growing number of potential liabilities faced by directors is directors' and officers' liability insurance (D&amp;O). Mr Roger Flaxman, a director of Miller Professional Liabilities, says that between 1984 and 1991 the UK market premium for directors' and officers' liability insurance grew from about Pounds 6m to Pounds 35m. Since 1991 the annual premium income from D&amp;O insurance has risen to almost Pounds 75m. The initial reason for the jump in the UK market premium was the 1989 Companies Act. This made clear, for the first time, that although a company cannot indemnify its directors, it can buy D&amp;O cover for its directors and officers and pay the premium without worrying about the legality or enforceability of the contract. The act also requires companies to mention the purchase or maintenance of D&amp;O cover in its annual reports and accounts. The effect of this, says Mr Flaxman, has been to heighten directors' appreciation of potential liabilities which resulted in an enormous increase in enquiries to the D&amp;O insurance market. The requirement to mention D&amp;O cover in annual reports also has an unlooked-for effect: it tips off those contemplating legal action against a company or its directors of a potential 'deep pocket' to sue, thereby encouraging claims. Claims have certainly increased. It is estimated that there are more than 1,000 claims outstanding against UK company directors. The value of the claims averages Pounds 70,000. However, having encouraged the purchase of D&amp;O cover through the 1989 act, the government now appears to be doing its best to discourage it, by allowing the Inland Revenue to tax directors and officers, who buy it, on the premium, or on the proceeds of a claim, as a benefit in kind. Lawyers' current advice to directors is to pay tax on the premium, rather than risk tax on the actual benefit deemed to accrue by successfully defending a claim of more than Pounds 70,000. But if what happens in the US today happens in the UK tomorrow - as is often the case - paying tax on the premium itself may soon become a considerable tax burden. In the US the average cost of cover per director is already somewhere between Pounds 17,000 and Pounds 20,000. Mr Flaxman believes the UK Inland Revenue must be persuaded to drop this. He says that D&amp;O cover provides no personal benefit whatever in an individual director's private capacity. The benefit is to a director in his corporate capacity, therefore it should not be subject to taxation as benefit in kind. If the Revenue persists with this approach and, in particular, if non-executive directors have to pay tax on each non-executive directorship, there is a real danger that the competent and honest non-executive directors, on whom the government is counting to improve standards in the boardroom, may begin to decline appointments. But insurance is not the whole solution to the problem, either. For example, it does not cover liability for environmental pollution - something directors are increasingly concerned about. Mr Nigel Graham Maw, the former senior partner of Rowe &amp; Maw, City solicitors, believes that the key to allaying public anxiety over boardroom behaviour, which has been fed by recent scandals, is the adoption of a general code of corporate governance going beyond the recommendations of the Cadbury Committee. Mr Graham Maw has just written the first UK book on corporate governance. In it he sets out a suggested code of practice which, he says, ought to be adopted and complied with by the boards of all companies to which the City Takeover Code applies. 'A code should be mandatory,' he says. 'Companies can write their own, but it ought to be no less stringent than ours.' His code, which covers the constitution of the board, audit and remuneration committees, the functioning of the board and accountability, is tougher than Cadbury in that it includes a number of mandatory requirements. It stresses the role of non-executive directors in improving standards, and it provides, among other things: that a minimum of one third of the total number of directors must be non-executives; the chairman should be a non-executive, but if for some reason he is not, the deputy chairman must be a non-executive; non-executives' remuneration must not be performance or project related; companies must have audit and remuneration committees, all the members of which must be non-executives. 'It won't rid the country of scandals such as the Maxwell scandal, but it can reduce the risk of them,' Mr Graham Maw says. He also believes that corporate governance is not an area which lends itself to statutory regulation. If things are to improve, he says, then standards of self-regulation will have to rise. That means that bodies such as the Stock Exchange must take a tougher line on bad corporate behaviour. If these steps are taken, then the UK may yet turn the corner on directors' liability.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- INDUSTRY AND PURCHASE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Number     Percentage                           of           with Industry              respondents   D&amp;O cover  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Banking                      3           33 Insurance                    9           56 Other financial              5           40 Industrial holding          13           62 Oils/chem/pharm              7           43 Consumer goods/foods         6           33 Electrical                   4            0 Engineering                 16           31 Property                     4           50 Other manufacturing         15           33 Service                      8           50 Retail                       4            0 Other                       14           29  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: The Wyatt Company UK D&amp;O Liability Survey 1991  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

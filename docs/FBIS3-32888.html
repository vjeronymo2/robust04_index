Mendiandua: "Workers Contribute Ideas </F> To Improve Economic Situation"]    [Text] Havana, 3 Feb (PL) -- Cuban workers are proposing  various measures and multiplying their initiatives in assemblies  held in their workplaces to identify their productive reserves  and help resolve the country's difficult economic situation.    The Cuban Workers Federation (CTC) has convened nearly  80,000  meetings until 15 March so workers can analyze how to reduce  expenses, increase revenue, achieve profitability, and in this  way contribute to the economic efficiency of their enterprises  and the reorganization of the national finances.    This process is known in Cuba as the workers' parliament,  because the ideas and proposals that emerge will enrich the  debate of the People's Government National Assembly (parliament)  during a special session called to adopt measures to improve the  country's economic situation.    According to experts, the principal problems affecting the  economy are excess money in circulation, swollen payrolls with  more workers than necessary, and a drop in labor productivity.    Cuba entered a period of severe shortages after the collapse  of the European socialist bloc, which provided the island with  almost all the fuel it used and more that 85 percent of its raw  materials, fertilizers, pesticides, and animal feed.    Deputies, provincial and rank and file delegates are  participating in the workplace meetings, offering extensive  information on national and regional problems while at the same  time receiving the proposals and initiatives, enriching the  debate and identifying them with their constituents, according  to repeated evaluations by Cuban authorities.    Repeated proposals in the assemblies held throughout the  country include charges for certain sports and cultural events,  price increases for nonessential articles such as rum and  cigarettes, and the elimination of subsidies as well as more  strict control over state property.    Many workers have advocated a gradual application of these  measures and are against streamlining payrolls without union  participation.    The workers debates began in January with approximately 200  assemblies of union leaders as an initial organizational step  and resumed 31 January with the massive participation of all  workers.    In a labor meeting at the Foreign Ministry, it was learned  the ministry cut its expenses by $4 million during 1992 to 1993,  and several proposals emerged for the ministry to finance itself.    The proposals included: setting the price of consular  services at the same average level of other Foreign Ministries;  charging for services of the documentation center, data base,  chronologies, and others as well as streamlining foreign  communications.    A poll of the sociopolitical studies center based on a  sample  of 1,300 workers representative of the unions and all the  provinces has revealed that 86 percent said the assemblies are  worthwhile, and 75 percent believe very useful initiatives will  be gathered in the debates.</p>

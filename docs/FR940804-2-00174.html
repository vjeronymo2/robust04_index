The petition is described below, including the regulatory provisions involved, the nature of the relief being requested and the petitioner's arguments in favor of relief.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Burlington Northern Railroad (BN)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (FRA Waiver Petition Docket Number SA&hyph;94&hyph;5)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The BN seeks a waiver of compliance from certain sections of the Railroad Safety Appliance Standards (49 CFR Part 231). BN states that it will be building one trainset of its ``trough train'' equipment. This train will be composed of 22 13-section cars. The parking brakes on these cars are of conventional design, but their location is not standard. The unique size and design of one 13-section car does not allow the conventional application of a handbrake.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BN requests a waiver from 49 CFR 231.1(a)(1), 231.1(a)(3)(i), and 231.1(a)(3)(ii). Section 231.1(a)(1) requires that there be one efficient handbrake which shall operate in harmony with the power brake installed on the car.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BN states that the 13-section trough train car has 14 truck assemblies; 2 single axle trucks and 12 two axle trucks. It is impossible to brake a minimum of half the total axles under the 13-section car from one parking brake location. A much more positive brake is provided by the proposed system that has each parking brake holding 2 two axle trucks. No active linkage cross any articulation under this system. The system uses a minimum of 4 parking brakes that brake 16 axles out of the 24 axle total. The 13-section trough train car requires more than one parking brake per car to safely hold the car when stopped. There are many cars that operate successfully with more than one handbrake, such as heavy duty flat cars, articulated intermodal cars and stand alone intermodal cars connected into groups with drawbars.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 231.1(a)(3)(i) requires that the handbrake be so located that it can be safely operated while the car is in motion. BN states that the long length of a trough train car  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (278 feet) necessitates multiple parking brakes to hold the car safely on grades and direct simple parking brake connections to the individual trucks and axles, requires that multiple parking brakes be applied along the length of the car. Four parking brakes per car is proposed. The location of the parking brakes does not lend itself to making provisions for the brake to be operated while the car is in motion. The design of the car will not allow the application of a standard handbrake to safely allow a man to ride the car while setting the brake. These cars are specifically designed for unit train operation and will be used in services where the train is loaded and unloaded in full trains or large blocks of cars, while coupled to and under the control of a locomotive. The parking brakes are designed to hold the car once stopped, on any practical grade for whatever reason. The safety of employees is enhanced by allowing them to apply the brake from the ground, without the need to climb onto the equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The BN has had a policy in effect for several years that prohibits anyone from mounting or dismounting any freight car, caboose, or locomotive while it is moving. The application of parking brakes on this type of car will only be done while the car is stopped. A waiver is requested that allows the operation of the parking brake only when the car is stopped.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 231.1(a)(3)(ii) requires that the brake shaft be located on end of car, to the left of and not less than 17 nor more than 22 inches from center.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BN states that due to the design of the car and the need to operate the parking brake from the ground, it is imperative that the brake wheel and mechanism be mounted in such a way as to make its operation as safe as possible. The brake wheel and mechanism has been mounted as low as the car design will allow (approximately 3-foot 10 inches from the top of the rail to the bottom of the wheel rim) and as close to the side of the car as possible (52 inches to the center of the brake shaft from the center of the car.) This location allows the brake to be easily operated from the ground while the car is stopped.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The BN states the trough train provides the latest advancements in slackless technology, car geometry, aerodynamics and safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written views, data, or comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts do not appear to warrant a hearing. If any interested party desires an opportunity for oral comment, they should notify FRA, in writing, before the end of the comment period and specify the basis for their request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All communications concerning these proceedings should identify the appropriate docket number (e.g., Waiver Petition Docket Number SA&hyph;94&hyph;5 and must be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel, FRA, Nassif Building,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590. Communications received before September 6, 1994 will be considered by FRA before final action is taken. Comments received after that date will be considered as far as practicable.

			<p>930526 FT  26 MAY 93 / Danish bank chief says EMS 'collapsed' The European monetary system has, in effect, broken down by letting countries win competitive advantage by devaluing currencies, said Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, the Danish Central Bank chief, Reuter reports from Copenhagen. 'I have no reservations about saying that the currency co-operation has collapsed in the past nine months,' he told a Danish business seminar. Britain and Italy pulled their currencies out of the exchange rate mechanism last autumn, and Ireland, Spain and Portugal have been forced to devalue within the mechanism. 'We have seen a series of major devaluations which were completely out of line with the reasonable pattern in a fixed exchange rate co-operation,' Mr Hoffmeyer said. He emphasised that the point of the EMS was to avoid competitive devaluations. 'This has not been the case. What we have seen have been irresponsible exchange-rate changes.' Mr Hoffmeyer said market confidence in the EMS would not return until the pound and lira had come back to the grid.</p>

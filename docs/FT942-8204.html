			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / International Company News: Dresdner sees no need for provision against Schneider Dresdner Bank has no need to make any provisions against its loans to the collapsed Jurgen Schneider property group, chairman Mr Jurgen Sarrazin told shareholders yesterday. The bank's main involvement was in the financing of two of the group's projects. Dresdner's loans, concentrated on two properties in Berlin and Leipzig, were secured against the value of the projects. Addressing the annual meeting a day after Deutsche Bank announced provisions of DM500m (Dollars 303m) against its exposure to Schneider, Mr Sarrazin said both projects would be completed to increase their value. The bank had taken over responsibility for the sites and paid contractors and other suppliers for work done. Meanwhile, Dresdner was negotiating over the conditions under which the projects could be passed into 'other hands'. After allowing for risk provisions, the bank's operating profits showed 'pleasing' growth in the first four months of this year, Mr Sarrazin said. Deutsche earlier reported a 10 per cent decline over the same period. Offering no more details, he said he expected a satisfactory result for the full year, although it was too early to make forecasts. This was partly because of uncertainties over the need for provisions against bad debts. Commenting on progress so far, Mr Sarrazin said although own-account trading results were markedly down, he expected market activity and prices to improve during the the year. On the other hand, risk provisioning had been reduced and interest and fee income had both increased.</p>

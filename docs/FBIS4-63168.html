			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vasiliy Kononenko: "B. Yeltsin Prepared To Meet </F> With D. Dudayev and Include New `Party People' in Government"]    [Text] A routine briefing by V. Kostikov, the Russian  Federation president's press secretary, 19 May in the Kremlin  confirmed Moscow's intention to begin serious contacts with  Groznyy officials.    In view of the acute economic and political crisis there are  indications from Chechnya of the desirability of unofficial  talks with the Russian leadership. The indications are coming  both from the Chechen opposition and from Dzh. Dudayev. There  has been no reaction from Russian power structures so far. But  B. Yeltsin no longer sees any insuperable obstacles to talks  with Groznyy, and the appointment of N. Yegorov to the post of  new leader of the Ministry for Nationalities Affairs is meant to  step up work in this sphere. We do not yet know whether S.  Shakhray will participate in the talks with the Chechnya  representatives. The press secretary announced that the  president has not accepted his resignation.    V. Kostikov once again explained the president's position on  the actions of the intransigent opposition in the shape of A.  Rutskoy and his associates. B. Yeltsin is keeping a close eye  on the way the "intransigents" are beginning to raise their  heads, remembering the unfortunate experience of collaboration  with the former Supreme Soviet. He is aware how far they might  go. The events of 9 May showed that the opposition does not  always engage in civilized ways of achieving its ends. So the  president intends to take a tough line on any actions outside  the Constitution. At the same time, as the press secretary  noted, B. Yeltsin is not against all activity by the opposition,  as shown by his words: "We do not want to create some kind of  police state. But as far as uncivilized methods of political  struggle, crime, and corruption are concerned, in such cases the  authorities will take a tough line."    At the end of the briefing, when I asked whether the  president was afraid of Khasbulatov's returning to big-time  politics (some analysts are forecasting his "resurrection,"  saying that he will grab power in Groznyy), the press secretary  indicated that the president did not see this as a serious  danger. Nonetheless, it is probable that certain changes in  Moscow's stance on Groznyy are linked to this factor.    I was able to talk recently on this topic with other members  of the president's immediate entourage. Summing up what they  said, I can construct the following scenario. Dzh. Dudayev has  undergone his own political evolution. The Kremlin, aware of  the need to strengthen the Federation, is now inclined to  acknowledge Dudayev as the legitimate president of Chechnya and  hold talks with him. There may be talks in the very near future,  leading to a meeting between B. Yeltsin and Dzh. Dudayev.    At the briefing the press secretary made another curious  admission, citing the president's opinion (he had talked with B.  Yeltsin the day before). According to him, the president  intends to employ the practice of expanding party representation  in the cabinet of ministers. This pronouncement should be seen  as a signal, if you consider what the other representatives of  the power structures said on the topic in conversation with me.  Although the idea of including N. Travkin in the cabinet of  ministers came from V. Chernomyrdin, the president described it  as fitting in perfectly with the process of achieving accord and  he is prepared to discuss the inclusion of representatives of  other parties in the government. As my interlocutors stressed,  this does not mean that the process will snowball and posts will  be artificially made available for "party people."    V. Kostikov denied rumors that S. Filatov and A. Chubays are  about to resign.</p>

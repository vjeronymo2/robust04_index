			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Construction Contracts: Seating at Manchester stadium CAMPBELL REITH HILL, a London firm of consulting engineers, is to carry out the structural design on the new Pounds 10m all-seater stand at the famous Stretford End of Old Trafford Stadium. With a 10,300 capacity, the stand will include 4,000 dedicated 'family' seats. This is believed to be the highest ratio in the UK. High level executive boxes will also be provided. Structurally the stand will comprise an in situ concrete frame on piled foundations. The use of precast units for terraces and concourses will speed construction. At roof level steel lattice girders cantilver forward 34.5 metres from the rear of the stand to give an uninterrupted sightline for spectators.</p>

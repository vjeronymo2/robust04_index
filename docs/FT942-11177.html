			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: First-quarter improvement at Dyno Industrier Dyno Industrier, the Norwegian chemicals, explosives and plastics group, yesterday reported a sharp rise in first-quarter pre-tax profit to NKr130m (Dollars 18m) from NKr75m, helped by increased demand and higher volumes. Dyno expects the positive development to continue throughout the year, helped by the emerging economic recovery in European markets and a slight increase in coal production in North America, which will contribute positively to explosives activities. First-quarter sales rose to NKr2.26bn from NKr1.91bn, boosted by a combination of growth in volumes, the stronger dollar and higher prices for a number of raw materials. Operating profit increased to NKr147m from NKr114m. Dyno warned, however, that increasing prices for the group's most important raw materials purchases could create pressure on margins for the remainder of the year. Vard, the troubled Norwegian cruise and ferry group, has cut first-quarter pre-tax losses by more than half to NKr57.3m from NKr127.6m. The result was better than analysts had expected. Vard said the improvement was due to increased passenger volume for its ferries and reduced shore-side expenses and higher turnover for in cruise division. Operating revenue rose to NKr1.8bn from NKr1.6bn. Operating expenses increased to NKr1.58bn from NKr1.44bn leaving operating profit up to NKr96.7m from NKr11.08m. Financial items charged against first-quarter accounts increased to NKr153.95m from NKr138.41m partly as a result of a rise in interest expenses to NKr192m from NKr130m in the same period last year.</p>

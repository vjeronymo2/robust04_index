			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Seoul cuts rates to boost investment SOUTH KOREA yesterday cut the central bank's rediscount rates in an attempt to revive the sluggish economy. Government officials hope that the interest rate reductions will encourage companies to increase investments and pull the economy out of its slowest growth period since 1981. The Bank of Korea, the central bank, recently estimated that the economy grew by 4 per cent last year against 8.4 per cent in 1991. The slowdown was primarily caused by the government's strict monetary policy to cool the overheated economy and reduce inflation. But the measures proved to be more effective than officials had expected, curbing growth far below the target figure of 7 per cent. The government wants to achieve a growth rate of at least 6 per cent this year. The reduction in the rediscount rates, which is what the central bank charges on loans to other banks, is the sharpest since 1982. They include lowering the rediscount rate on commercial bills by two percentage points to 5 per cent, while rates on trade bills were cut by one percentage point to 6 per cent. This will result in the commercial banks' general lending rates being lowered by 1.5 to 2 percentage points from the current range of 10 to 12.5 per cent. The finance ministry estimates that lower interest rates will raise the profitability of Korean companies this year by cutting financial costs by more than Won 3,000bn (Pounds 2.47bn) and reducing their interest payments to 5.4 per cent of sales from 6.2 per cent last year. But a cut of one to three percentage points for deposit rates, which were also announced yesterday, are likely to decrease bank profits this year as the gap between deposit and lending rates is reduced. The government predicts that the interest rate cuts will add one percentage point to economic growth this year and 1.5 percentage points annually over the next five years if companies use the money for industrial investments. But some warned businesses may be tempted to use the funds instead for property speculation, as Seoul recently eased restrictions on property purchases by large companies.</p>

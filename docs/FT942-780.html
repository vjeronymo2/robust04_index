			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / ILO move on part-timers and mine safety The 75th anniversary congress of the International Labour Organisation in Geneva ended at the weekend having passed two new labour conventions  - on part-time work and health and safety in mines - and established a working party on the contentious issue of a world social clause. The working party, set up by Mr Michel Hansenne, the ILO general secretary, will report by November and hand its finding to the World Trade Organisation, the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which is due to discuss the link between trade and social standards next year. The working party will also produce a report on the subject for next year's United Nations social summit in Copenhagen. Against the wishes of representatives of ILO employers and some governments, including Britain, the organisation passed a convention calling for equal rights for part-time workers. The convention also calls for pro rata equal pay for part-timers. 'Measures appropriate to national law and practice shall be taken to ensure that part-time workers do not, solely because they work part-time, receive a basic wage which, calculated proportionately on an hourly, performance-related, or piece-rate basis, is lower than the basic wage of comparable full-time workers', it states. The congress took one small de-regulatory step by revising the convention on private employment agencies. The convention on health and safety in mines calls on employers to ensure that all mines are designed and equipped to secure safety. Where workers are exposed to physical, chemical or biological hazards, they should be fully informed of the hazards and the employer must provide suitable protective clothing. Every employer is also called upon to prepare an emergency response plan, specific to each mine, 'for reasonably foreseeable industrial and natural disasters'.</p>

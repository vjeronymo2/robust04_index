			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: HSBC puts Dollars 100m into US arm HONGKONG AND Shanghai Bank revealed yesterday it had suffered yet another blow from its accident-prone US operations at a time when Marine Midland, its New York subsidiary, appears to have made a firm return to profit. The bank disclosed that it had been forced to make charges of Dollars 75m (Pounds 43.8m) and also to inject Dollars 100m into Concord Leasing, its US leasing subsidiary, after discovering that some of the assets in its portfolio had been substantially over-valued. The charge will be taken in the accounts of the quarter which ends today. The move was accompanied by news of the resignation of the two top men in Concord Leasing - Mr Michael O'Hanlon, president and chief executive officer, and Mr Richard Parkes, executive vice-president. A senior executive, so far unnamed, is being seconded from Hongkong Bank to run the company for the time being. Hongkong Bank said yesterday that the move followed a routine auditing examination of Concord's assets in which nine ships in its portfolio were discovered to be seriously overvalued. Fraud is not suspected. Concord Leasing was sold to HSBC Holdings, the group parent company, by Marine Midland, its New York subsidiary, two years ago at a time when Mr Keith Whitson, now the new deputy chief executive of Midland Bank, was fighting to turn Marine Midland around after it chalked up losses of nearly Dollars 500m in two years. The company, which prided itself on operating in highly diversified products in a wide range of markets, was regarded at the time of the sale as one of the few bits of the Marine Midland empire which was consistently profitable. Last year the company had total assets of Dollars 2.17bn and made a record profit of Dollars 20.9m, despite the depressed state of the US economy. Hongkong Bank said yesterday it remained committed to supporting Concord as necessary and to ensuring it was able to fulfil all its financial obligations.</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Irish misty eyed over Digital days / A look at the local impact of a shake-up in the world computer industry THE decision last week by Digital Equipment, the US computer maker, to close its manufacturing facility at Galway in the west of Ireland has produced much dismay and soul-searching in Ireland. Digital has been in Ireland for 22 years, and was the biggest employer in the electronics sector until its decision to concentrate production at Ayr in Scotland, with the loss of 780 jobs at the Galway factory. The Irish government has blamed the British government for allegedly offering lucrative government contracts to Digital (although it admits to having no hard evidence). The opposition blames the government and the Industrial Development Authority for having done 'too little too late' to save the Galway factory. More nationalistic voices, including some in government, have been heard questioning the dominant role being played by multinationals in Ireland's industrial sector, and arguing that fewer tax and grant incentives should be given to foreign companies and greater support given to indigenous Irish industry. More sober reflection by those not so close to the political front line, though, view the Digital closure as part of an inevitable shake-out of an industry facing rapid technological change. Mr Edward Johnston, the director of the Federation of Electronic and Informatic Industries in Ireland, said: 'We have to live with the fact of occasional failures in terms of closures.' Digital's Galway plant was primarily manufacturing VAX minicomputers. In early 1992 it decided to start building its new Delta workstation around its newly developed Alpha chip. According to industry sources, test marketing of the Delta in Europe proved a failure, as PCs have increasingly come to dominate the market over workstations and minicomputers. As Digital had already begun PC manufacturing at Ayr, and had opened a new semiconductor plant in Scotland, the concentration of production at Ayr became inevitable. Next to the food processing industry, electronics is Ireland's most important manufacturing sector. Built up in just 25 years it now employs 17,000 people with a further 7,000 employed in software production and development. Net investment in fixed assets in the electronics sector amounts to IPounds 763m (Pounds 747m), which produces an annual output worth close to IPounds 5bn, of which 80 per cent is exported. In the early 1970s, jobs in the industry were mainly in the basic assembly of low-cost products. Today workers are involved in the production of high-value systems, components and software. According to the IDA, the government agency responsible for promoting inward investment into Ireland, as much as 40 per cent of the 9,000 jobs in the electronics sector in 1980 no longer exist. Nonetheless the sector has experienced continuous growth, with high-tech plants replacing the older assembly 'screwdriver plant' type operations, and demanding better trained employees. The past year has been one of even greater change. Last year, Wang, which went into receivership, shed 75 per cent of its 700-strong workforce in Ireland. Apple was on the point of putting off 400 of their 800 workforce, but have since revised their decision. By the end of 1993, in the space of two years, about 10 per cent of the workforce in the existing electronics industry will have been made redundant as a result of the Wang and Digital wind-downs and the closures of several smaller companies. Nonetheless this is being offset by new entrants such as Dell and Intel, which are making major investments which within two years could boost the sector's output by as much as 25 per cent. Dell decided to set up its sole European manufacturing base Ireland just two years ago. According to Mr Buddy Griffin, the managing director for manufacturing, 'there has been no cause for pain or regrets. On the contrary the operation has been highly successful and facilitated very rapid growth in sales in the European market.' Intel is in the process of constructing a IPounds 500m semiconductor plant, the biggest electronics investment ever in Ireland. The plant will manufacture wafers for its new generation Pentium chip, otherwise known as the 586 processor, and will be the company's main world manufacturing facility for the processor, with sales projected at a level of 'billions of dollars'. Some 1,500 jobs in total will be created at the plant. Mr Frank Turpin, the external affairs manager at Intel, said the reasons for choosing Ireland for this strategic plant were primarily due to the workforce skills available and the 10 per cent corporation tax regime. 'Due to the complexity of the technology, we felt it had to be an English language location, and in Scotland we felt we would face poaching by other companies,' he said. Intel itself has poached 200 Irish engineers from other electronics companies worldwide. Mr Dan Flinter, the executive director for overseas industry at the IDA, is in no doubt that, despite the setback of Digital's closure, the electronics industry will continue to grow in Ireland. 'We shall continue to back strong companies that want to locate here. We are in the business of applying capital resources to get the best return, not necessarily the safest.' It is not the most comforting message for the 780 who are to lose their jobs at Galway, but as Mr Turpin said: 'There is a whole world of difference in the industry now compared to when Digital came to Ireland.'</p>

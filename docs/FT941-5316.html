			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Equity Markets: Time now for the bargain hunters - London It was another difficult week for equities, although the final net loss of only a few points on the FT-SE 100 Index is not in itself anything to lose sleep over. The question asked on all sides is, quite simply, 'Is it over yet or is another March 1987 lurking in the shadows?' The answer from market strategists is that fears have been overdone, that a shakeout in bond markets was inevitable and that equities now present a buying opportunity not to be missed. And the market seems to be agreeing with them. There has been no great selling of equities - bonds and stock index futures are another matter - and the institutions have begun to buy. They have sought out bargains rather than buying across the board, and they have eschewed sectors seen as deserving a good hiding; the financial sectors, and in particular those with securities markets exposure, have continued to suffer. The good news is that the European bond markets, directly responsible for the setback in equities, now show signs of disengaging from the US Treasury market. London, like other European markets, is still resigned to a further tightening by the Federal Reserve, but such fears no longer appear to be upsetting share prices. The London stock market is now looking towards economic recovery for support, now interest rate prospects are more clouded. This week brings potential developments on this score. The oil sector's concern over languishing crude prices has relaxed as Opec does not meet until the end of the month. But ministers of the Gulf-Co-Operation Council (GCC), which is effectively led by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, meet in Jeddah this weekend. Nomura Research warns that the stock market may be greatly mistaken in its apparent assumption that oil price weakness is merely a temporary aberration. The GCC is unlikely to contradict the blunt statement from the Saudis last December that they are not prepared to cut production. Oil exploration stocks, notably Enterprise and Lasmo, are still vulnerable to adverse news on oil pricing and share prices may not wait for the Opec meeting. The uncertainties of the past fortnight have refocused attention on solid dividend-paying stocks which will underpin the liability side of pension fund balance sheets. The RECs, the 12 regional electricity companies, plus the two Scottish companies, have been overshadowed by awareness that their distribution reviews are in hand and that a harsher regulatory regime lies ahead. Panmure Gordon believes their dividend paying capacities will not be too badly hindered by tighter regulation. Panmure reckons the value of the National Grid, owned by the RECs, is 'grossly underestimated' in balance sheets, and may be worth about Pounds 4.1bn. It considers dividend rates of 6 per cent should be possible and rates London Electricity, Northern Electric, Seeboard, Southern Electric and Yorkshire Electricity as buys.</p>

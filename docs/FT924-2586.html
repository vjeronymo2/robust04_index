			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / International Company News: Borland proposes Dollars 35m charge to cover job cuts BORLAND International, the California personal computer software company, has cut its workforce by 15 per cent with the loss of 350 jobs. The price war that has raged among personal computer manufacturers for the past year has now begun to hit the software segment of the industry. Borland said it would take a charge of about Dollars 35m against current third-quarter earnings to cover the cost of the cuts as it consolidates its operations. 'A new industry pricing model is emerging,' said Mr Philippe Kahn, Borland chairman, president and chief executive. The re-organisation 'is designed to make Borland leaner, more competitive and profitable'. Borland, best known for its database management programs which enable PC users to organise and access large quantities of data, is facing intense competition from Microsoft, the PC software industry leader. Microsoft recently launched its own database management program, aggressively priced at under Dollars 100. 'The software industry is going through a fundamental pricing shift similar to the one in hardware,' a Borland official added. 'We recognise this is a major trend in the industry and we have to be poised for it.' Mr Kahn said the company would launch two long-awaited database management products early next year.</p>

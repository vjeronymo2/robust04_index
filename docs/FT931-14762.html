			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Culture and comfort weaken Scottish appetite for new business: A lack of regard for the entrepreneur is stifling company start-ups WHEN leading Scots were asked what they felt about their country's poor record on company creation, they gave replies which some will find disturbing. 'New firms cause competition and displacement,' said one. 'This is not always an advantage to the economy.' 'In the long term a few start-up businesses might help but I don't see them as crucial,' said another. 'We would not need new firms if we paid attention to assisting and rescuing old businesses,' was another view. This suggestion of complacency - if not hostility - towards rising entrepreneurs is a sign of a cultural problem which appears to be a factor in limiting growth of new businesses, and holding back the Scottish economy. Research by Scottish Enterprise, the official development body, shows that Scotland's business birth rate for companies of more than 50 people between 1978 and 1990 was 77 new companies per 1m of population. The figure for the west Midlands was 86 and for south-east England it was 116. All were dwarfed by the performance of Massachusetts in the US with 333. In 1990 125,000 people were working in independent businesses in Scotland set up since 1978 - but an extra 70,000 jobs would have been created if Scottish business formation had matched that of the west Midlands, and 320,000 if growth had been as strong as in the south-east. Not that the Scottish economy is in terminal decline. Over the past two decades it has escaped its dependence on heavy industry and has achieved more balance. It has also suffered less severely from the recession than much of the rest of Britain. In a country of 5m people fewer than 250,000 are registered unemployed. But why should Scotland, whose entrepreneurs thrived in the 19th century and whose expatriates head important businesses in England, California and elsewhere, generate relatively few at home? Scottish Enterprise's research, carried out by nine firms of consultants, says culture is partly to blame. Scots rated the entrepreneur as fifth most admired profession below teachers, bankers and manual workers such as plumbers and bus drivers. The English put entrepreneurs third after teachers and bankers, and Germans put them after teachers. Entrepreneurs were not perceived as being the caring sort of people Scots are educated to admire. And interviews with people in the business and financial community, as well as trade unionists, academics, journalists and churchmen, revealed serious doubts about the value of new businesses. Many believed it would be better to concentrate on helping existing companies and encouraging a continuing stream of inward investors. In spite of what might seem a discouraging cultural environment, Scottish Enterprise's research showed that 570,000 men and 285,000 women - 19 per cent of the adult population - would like to start businesses and believe they are capable of it. That was the same proportion as for Britain as a whole, though below the south-east's 21 per cent. But only 7 per cent of Scotland's potential entrepreneurs had taken up the challenge compared with 13.7 per cent in southern England. The main reason was difficulty raising finance. As elsewhere borrowers complain that lenders are too cautious, and lenders say the projects are not good enough. Two distinct Scottish factors play a part. One is that Scots tend to have less personal wealth than people in other parts of Britain. Slightly more than half of Scots own their homes compared with more than two thirds in England. Only 35 per cent were owner occupiers in 1979. Since much lending for new ventures is secured on the house of the founder, Scots have less borrowing potential. Scottish houses are generally less valuable than those in southern England, so Scots may have less free equity in their house. It is often said that Scotland is a village in which everybody knows somebody - ideal territory, it might be thought, for 'networking', by which people with business projects contact individuals with money to invest. Yet the research showed that networking works poorly in Scotland, because many would-be entrepreneurs are slow to discuss ideas with friends, and many are not members of clubs and associations. And the quality of life may mean those people who do form companies satisfy their ambitions relatively early, to the detriment of expansion. 'The quality of life in Scotland is just too good and doesn't cost much to get a good slice of,' one venture capitalist says. 'If you are making Pounds 100,000 after tax from a business, you can afford a nice house and access to open space that in the south would need a much bigger income. For some, life's too comfortable.'</p>

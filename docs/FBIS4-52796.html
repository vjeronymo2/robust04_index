			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Current-Account Surplus -- Stop the Vicious </F> Cycle of Recession and High Yen"]    [Text] Both Japan's current-account surplus and the trade  surplus (on a dollar basis) in 1993 were record-breakers.  Japan's surpluses stand out among industrialized nations, but  the country has a problem in ridding itself of economic  recession. What we see is a vicious cycle of surpluses causing  the high yen, the high yen worsening the recession, and then the  recession increasing the surpluses.    On top of that, there is the worldwide trend for decline of  the dollar, and there are now growing apprehensions that the yen  will go up further. On 4 May, led by the U.S. Treasury  Department, central banks of about a dozen nations decided to  collaborate in dollar-buying money market interventions to put a  stop to the fall of the dollar.    The Clinton administration has in the past accepted the  conditions of the cheap dollar and the high yen as a way of  pushing for correction of the imbalance in the trade surplus,  but this time the U.S. administration made clear that it is  changing that policy. The administration has also made its  position clear that the excessivly low evaluation of the dollar  does not serve the national interests. To look back on the  times when the U.S. monetary authorities made active market  interventions, there has hardly been an instance of the markets  being impervious to such treatment.    Many market observers think the U.S. authorities' shift of  policy this time is working as a brake on the dollar's  minicrisis. The U.S. authorities have apparently determined  that the high yen and the high [German] mark will work adversely  against the Japanese and European economies and this can  boomerang against the U.S. economy. We hope this will become an  opportunity for countries to have better policy coordination.    The Hata government should make the most of this amicable  atmosphere in policy cooperation and deal with the high yen  problem by making active interventions in the market.    The current-account surplus may be at the highest level  ever,  but changes are being seen in the basic tone of the expanding  surplus. There is the definite trend of the export volume  decreasing and the import volume rising. Exporters are coming  to find it increasingly difficult to fill up high-yen-caused  gaps in income by passing cost pressures on to local  dollar-based prices. The growth rate of the surplus is slowing  as well. There are many signs which suggest that the high yen  cycle that started in 1990 is coming to an end.    With all this happening, what the government should do now  is  come up with a daring surplus reduction target, and announce it  to the world. It may be only an endeavour target, but still if  it can help reverse the trend for the high yen soon, it surely  will have served as an effective economic measure. When a  target is set only to respond to pressure from the United  States, the effect of it will diminish by half.    The government must push for and carry out deregulation  daringly, and must show the world that it is serious about  reform of the economic and social structure.    Meanwhile, there are excessive reactions in the money  markets  to the worldwide trend for the cheap dollar. The U.S. Federal  Reserve Board (FRB) in early February started taking the  precautionary action of raising the short-term interest rates to  prevent overheated economic conditions from causing inflation.    It is said that U.S. long-term interest rates are reacting  to  these actions, causing prices of stocks and bonds to fall, and  leading even the dollar to fall in the exchange market. There  is now concern that there will be another Black Monday like we  saw seven years ago.    But as yet we do not see any indications that the U.S.  economy will actually plunge into inflation, and we do not see  any reason to expect long-term interest rates to keep on rising.    Compared with seven years ago, conditions are different;  take  the cooperative relationship among the monetary authorities for  instance. There was a major rift between the United States and  Germany at that time. There remains the question of whether the  U.S. financial deficit condition will really improve, but we  hope the Clinton government will succeed with its health-care  system reform and other programs.    It looks like the German economy has hit bottom, and that  European interest rates have stopped falling. It is probably  true that the world's interest rates have bottomed out. It is  not so rare to see the markets rocking in a transitional period  like this.    Being in such times, Japan and the United States need to  have  closer cooperation. The two countries should forget all that  has passed, and resume the Japan-U.S. economic consultations  without delay. It will serve as a good message to the markets.</p>

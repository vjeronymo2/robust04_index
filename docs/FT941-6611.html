			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Greater than the sum of his parts: Can HSBC Holdings persuade doubters in the City that global commercial banking makes sense? Sitting in his office overlooking the muddy Thames, the chairman of Britain's second most valuable company vents a characteristic flash of irritation at the stockbrokers massed behind him in the City. 'The first view was 'Here is this bank from Asia. They have got these huge profits, but look at their track record in Australia, look at America. They can't manage any bloody thing.' Well, my team and I have got to prove those detractors wrong,' says Sir William Purves. For most of his working life, the 62-year-old expatriate Scot did not have to worry overmuch about City institutions. The chairman of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank answered only to the retail investors of Hong Kong and a supportive board, whose non-executives traditionally came from the UK colony's trading companies. 'Going back a few years, I don't suppose I looked at the bank's share price more than once a month, or something,' says Sir William, with a touch of nostalgia. But things have changed since the Bank of England insisted that Sir William shift his headquarters from a glamorous tower by Hong Kong harbour to an undistinguished blue-tinted block near Tower Bridge. The Pounds 3.9bn acquisition of Midland Bank - the fourth-largest UK clearing bank - in a contest with Lloyds Bank 18 months ago not only transformed Hongkong and Shanghai into a global banking group called HSBC Holdings, but exposed it to unaccustomed scrutiny. After a series of flawed attempts to diversify its retail banking activities around the world in the 1980s, the boom in its south-east Asia base combined with the Midland acquisition has given Sir William a chance to lay the doubts to rest before he retires. To do so, he must not only show that HSBC's core of 400 senior managers can run banks around the world competently, but demonstrate, against conventional wisdom, that the concept of a global commercial bank makes sense. The 51 per cent rise in HSBC's pre-tax profits for 1993 to Pounds 2.6bn, announced yesterday, is a stage in this process. Sir William is expected to retire in 1995, although it could be later, and has set himself a single task before he goes. 'I would like to see the jury not being out, I would like to see some credibility,' he says. 'It is not going to be easy because the years ahead may not be so easy for banks. But I would like to see some of the question marks about HSBC Holdings lifted.' The initial doubts he had to dispel were among Midland shareholders, who not only had more instinctive respect for the management record of Mr Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds Bank, but were not eager to swap their Midland stakes for HSBC paper. 'The people running the UK funds said: 'If I'd wanted a stake in a global bank, I would have bought it',' says Mr George Cardona, HSBC's head of planning. Those shareholders are convinced - for the moment. HSBC has gained from the hunger for emerging markets since the acquisition of Midland on July 10 1992. HSBC's shares have risen from 477p each to yesterday's close of 945p. But the difficult part is still to come. The group must make the other parts of its business work, by redressing the imbalance of holding 40 per cent of its assets in south-east Asia, while deriving Pounds 1.9bn - or 75 per cent  -of pre-tax profits from the region. Although the largest investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have developed operations around the world to channel cross-border flows of capital, there are few contenders to become global commercial banks. After the losses sustained in the 1980s by banks which tried to expand overseas by lending to big companies at narrow margins, or buying small retail banks in other countries, most banks have accepted that they are more successful sticking to the home markets in which they are strong. The exceptions are European banks such Deutsche Bank and Credit Lyonnais, which still have ambitions to build cross-border retail franchises, and Citicorp, the US bank which has a strong retail business in many emerging markets such as Latin America. But HSBC has managed its portfolio of banks differently. Instead of forming a single bank, it has allowed the managements of banks such as Marine Midland in New York and Hongkong Bank of Canada to run them independently. HSBC's attempts to expand internationally go back a long way. It always had an international outlook, because it was formed to finance trade out of the south-east Asia in 1865. But Sir William dates the decision to do more than establish overseas offices from the 1970s. 'We believed that if we just sat as a strong regional bank, we would be swallowed up by a Japanese or an American bank. We thought there was an opportunity for a Hong Kong bank to expand into a big fellow,' he says. By the late 1980s, its method of doing so looked disastrously ineffective. HSBC's directors were particularly chastened by Marine Midland, which they fully acquired in 1987. It sustained losses of Dollars 720m between 1987 and 1991 after its US managers tried to turn it from a regional bank in New York state into a rival to Chase Manhattan and Citicorp. Sir William watched from the sidelines, because HSBC had agreed to allow Marine Midland autonomy as the price for acquiring a US bank. It was a frustrating period for a naturally impatient man, made worse by the fact that HSBC's small Australian subsidiary was also losing money. US regulators and HSBC eventually decided enough was enough, and a team of HSBC directors took over. Marine Midland returned to its regional bank role and recovered to a Dollars 173.2m pre-tax profit last year. The team included Mr Keith Whitson, who is taking over from Sir Brian Pearse as chief executive of Midland Bank from next month. Mr Whitson says HSBC learnt a lesson from Marine Midland. 'Clearly, with the benefit of hindsight, we kept our hands far too much off the tiller. We did not manage to get the management there to become part of the group. They paid lip service to it, but they did not do it,' he says. HSBC does not intend to make a similar mistake with Midland. It has already merged HSBC's and Midland's treasury operations, and is working on plans to improve Midland's technology. The most obvious symbol of the group's determination not to delay in getting to grips with Midland is the retirement of Sir Brian, a well-respected banker brought in by the Bank of England to rescue Midland at the height of its bad debt and management problems in 1991. Sir Brian was thought by some to be a candidate as Midland chairman. Although HSBC directors talk of Sir Brian's achievements admiringly, Sir William is taking on the Midland chairmanship himself. Strengthening Midland, and returning it to something closer to its glory days in the 1950s as the largest UK bank, is crucial to Sir William's task of proving that HSBC can manage businesses well. He believes there is room for improvement. 'British high-street banking has developed more slowly than in other places. In many countries in Asia, I think that the customer has a much better service,' he says. HSBC directors believe that both technology and staff training need to be improved. Apart from improving service to personal customers, HSBC is trying to rebuild Midland's lost market share in lending money to, and handling cash for, small companies. Other banks say that Midland has emerged as the high-street bank most willing to lend money to small businesses since it acquired HSBC's backing. 'We want that image, as long as we do not get the reputation for throwing money at people without assessing the risks properly. We are looking for business,' says Mr Whitson. Attracting more business from large companies has, initially at least, not been too difficult. The HSBC takeover has given Midland the backing of a parent company with a lot of capital, which makes big companies feel safer. HSBC's influence makes it a more natural choice for European companies trading in south-east Asia. 'We have gained quite a lot of corporate business from across the Channel which would never have come to Midland previously,' says Sir William. But HSBC has a long way to go before it rivals US banks like J P Morgan in providing a range of financial services, including the underwriting and distribution of securities for big companies as well as lending to them. This would require it to integrate commercial banking better with global investment banking. Investment banking activities made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 253m last year, and remain a poor cousin of the group's main banking business. HSBC saw the logic of shifting its balance of business towards investment banking in the 1980s when it acquired James Capel, the London-based equity broker, to add to its Wardley merchant banking arm in Asia. But before it took over Midland - and with it Samuel Montagu, the merchant bank - the investment banking businesses operated separately from each other and from the commercial banking side, and were ineffective. 'We had a rather motley crew all doing different things, and not co-operating very much,' says Sir William. HSBC has now set its sights on creating a global investment bank under the direction of Mr Bernard Asher. He says HSBC has got the size and range of activities that attract large companies to deal with its treasury and capital markets arms. 'We started in a colonial cul-de-sac, and you do not get many large multinationals there. Once you become large and generate activity, multinational companies feel they have to deal with you,' he says. Yet HSBC has so far shied away from carrying out the full merger of its corporate advisory and equity underwriting arms with its broking and trading activities to create an integrated investment bank. This is a tacit acknowledgement of the weakness of its merchant banking operations. Integration would stop James Capel from offering broking services to other banks, and Samuel Montagu could not supply enough business to compensate. The move to London has thus presented Sir William and HSBC with twin challenges in creating both an improved form of British clearing bank, and a global investment bank. Sir William says this was the reason HSBC's board decided he should remain at the helm after the official retirement age of 60. 'I said to the board: 'I think it is an opportunity for me to retire. I would normally be retiring if this move was not taking place.' I am afraid I did not get too much encouragement,' he says. But beyond the concrete task of forging new businesses lies the less tangible one of showing that HSBC's management can add value to a diverse set of businesses. It is not just the past that provokes doubt, but the impression that Sir William himself is so dominating a figure that the bank depends too much on his presence. Although he dislikes such talk, at times he appears almost single-handedly to have dragged HSBC into being as a global force. Critics say that, despite an enormous appetite for work and a formidable grasp of detail, he can be too impatient. They also question whether his gruff exterior and imposing presence have discouraged the emergence of a successor. Until the Bank of England insisted that the jobs were separated, Sir William was both chairman and chief executive of HSBC and, even now, it is difficult to imagine him giving free rein to Mr John Bond, the chief executive. As the winter sunshine streams in, Sir William reflects on his reputation for ferocity. 'I lead a meeting, some would say I dominate a meeting, but let me tell you that, if there is someone in my team who does not agree with what I am saying, I hope I listen to them. I believe I listen to them.' He pauses a few seconds. 'I don't like a long story. It doesn't impress me having to listen to 15 minutes, and I sometimes say: 'Where's the real meat here?' ' Some colleagues maintain that Sir William has tried to promote a new generation of managers. It did not always work, as he acknowledges. 'There was a 10-year period when for one reason or another we did not seem able to get sufficiently good people, but we have got some excellent young people coming up,' he says. He insists that he will not delay his departure too long. 'There is no way that one man can run a group like this. 'Who knows when it will be time for me to go? Sometime soon, sometime soon I expect. I don't see why I should go on working forever. I believe that, when the moment comes, it will be clear to me, but human beings sometimes don't see it. If I don't, one of my team will say to me: 'Willie, time to go.' And I'll be off.'</p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / International Company News: Lower dollar and weak markets take their toll on Hunter Douglas HUNTER Douglas, the Dutch window-covering and architectural products manufacturer, suffered a 53.2 per cent decline in net profits in 1992, reflecting continued weakness in important markets, the lower US dollar and a decline in aluminium prices. Net profit fell to Fl 33.4m (Dollars 18m) from Fl 71.4m a year earlier, on sales down 4.7 per cent at Fl 1.68bn. The company cut its dividend to Fl 1.50 from Fl 2.00, saying this reflected not only the fall in 1992 profit but also 'the conservative outlook for 1993.' However, Hunter Douglas described its pay-out ratio as high when viewed historically, and said this was due to its sound balance sheet and confidence about the longer term. It made no specific forecast for 1993, but said it expected a difficult and challenging year. The 1992 figures include an extraordinary charge of Fl 13.5m for restructuring in the Netherlands and south-east Asia. If the charge is excluded, net profit would have fallen by 34.3 per cent to Fl 46.9bn. Hunter Douglas said that business in Europe weakened, especially in the second half, while economic recovery in the US and Australia was slower than expected, restricting consumer spending. Lower aluminium prices had a negative impact on aluminium smelting operations. Koninklijke Van Ommeren, the transport and tank storage group, said it could invest up to Fl 500m in expansion, but that better returns on existing investments were its top priority, Reuter reports from Rotterdam. 'We are examining all activities critically on the basis of returns,' said Mr Carel van den Driest, chairman. He added that the sale of Ceteco, the trade arm, had given it scope for 'ambitious' expansion in shipping and storage.</p>

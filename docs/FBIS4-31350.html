			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Nikolic] </F>   [Excerpts] On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the  Allied operation in Normandy, a celebration was held in the  Central Club of the Yugoslav Army. Vladimir Nikolic reports.    [Begin recording] [Nikolic] The festivities were attended  by Federal Prime Minister Radoje Kontic, Federal Foreign  Minister Vladislav Jovanovic, Federal Defense Minister Pavle  Bulatovic, members of the federal, republican, and city councils  of the Federation of Associations of Veterans of the People's  Liberation War [SUBNOR], and the military attaches of the  British, French, and Russian Embassies in Belgrade. Although he  was invited, the military representative of the U.S. Embassy in  Belgrade failed to show up. [passage omitted]    After the gathering ended, we asked Foreign Minister  Vladislav Jovanovic to assess this year's celebration of the  Allied operation.    [Jovanovic] According to my feelings for history, this  should have been the place to reaffirm -- in a very graphic and  demonstrative way -- the unity in the struggle against fascism  and all forces that participated in the struggle against fascism  should have been here. That is why the back door invitation, so  to speak, (?extended) to the SUBNOR representatives is not how  the Yugoslav victims -- fighters against fascism -- deserve to  be treated by the allies of yesterday, who have now become our  opponents. On the other hand, not inviting Russia as the  successor of the former Soviet Union is not very convincing.    [Nikolic] We also asked Minister Jovanovic to comment on the  progress of the Geneva negotiations so far.    [Jovanovic] Everything is clear, everything is on the table.  What we have been saying for a year, if not longer, has finally  come to light. The Muslim side in Bosnia -- or more precisely,  its fundamentalist leadership -- simply does not want the end of  the war or peace. It wants war, or the peace that it would  achieve through war. This means they are insisting on a unitary  Bosnia and the full domination of the Croatian-Muslim element  over the Serbs in Bosnia. [end recording]</p>

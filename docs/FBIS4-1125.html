			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by C Govender] </F>   [Text] Durban April 21 SAPA -- An upbeat Clarence Makwetu  took the Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] election trail to Durban  on Thursday [21 April] night, promising free housing and land to  the deprived masses. Addressing Indian businessmen in  Shallcross, south of Durban, Mr Makwetu urged business to  support his organisation in the interests of democracy "unless  you want to see a one-party state emerge".    He said there was no chance of an alliance between the  African National Congress and the PAC as there were elements in  the ANC that were not committed to democracy. "We urge an  attitude of change. We hope to gain material support from you."    On perceptions that the PAC was a racist political  organisation, Mr Makwetu said his party was not against whites  but against white domination. Membership of the PAC "is and has  always been open to all human beings. To say it is open to  (black) Africans only is nonsense". "One's skin colour will not  buy leadership in our organisation."    He reiterated that the PAC stood for the redistribution of  land from privileged landowners to the rural masses. "The  problem stems from deprivation of land and from concentration of  land. Those who control the land control the people." He said  a programme of restitution had to involve land ownership in  order to aid suitable rural development, but he cautioned that  no land reform programme was possible without government  co-operation. PAC strategy was to utilise land to its optimum.  Mr Makwetu warned that any other approach would unleash a  "torrential force the likes of which none of us has seen".    Clarifying the PAC's stance on "Africans" Mr Makwetu said  anyone who owed allegiance to the land and believed in the PAC's  principles could be regarded as African. "We believe there is  only one race -- the human race."    The slogan "one settler, one bullet" was not PAC policy but  merely a slogan of the armed struggle which the PAC had  abandoned. It would take some time for the slogan to disappear.  He suggested that "settler" was not a PAC word but one derived  from whites themselves. "In Grahamstown there is the 1820  settlers monument. The road to Cape Town's airport is called  Settlers Way and a small town outside Pretoria is called  Settlers."</p>

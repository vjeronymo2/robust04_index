			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 4 KYODO -- Dissident Wei Jingsheng  has violated the conditions of his parole and is being  investigated by Chinese security departments, a Foreign Ministry  spokesman said Monday [4 April].    "Wei Jingsheng, during the period of his parole and  deprivation of his political rights, has violated the concerned  regulations, and the public security organs have the right to  investigate him according to the law," the spokesman said.    The statement came days after Wei was detained by police  while returning to Beijing following a forced exile from the  capital, which coincided with a visit by U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher and the meeting of China's National People's  Congress.    Wei, the godfather of China's pro-democracy movement, was  detained in early March after meeting with U.S. Undersecretary  of State John Shattuck and expressing his view that the United  States should continue to pressure China on human rights issues.    The meeting reportedly infuriated China's dictatorial  leaders  who has viewed Wei as a menace to their authority since he  called for greater democracy in the late 1970s.    On Saturday, Xinhua News Agency reported that Wei "had a  talk" with Beijing police and "left the bureau immediately  afterwards," but on Monday the dissident's family and friends  had no clue as to his whereabouts and under what pretext he was  taken away.    Wei was released last September, seven months short of a  15-year term, in what was widely regarded as a cynical human  rights gesture aimed at influencing the International Olympic  Committee into selecting Beijing as the host for the 2000  Olympic games.    His parole was to last until March 29, the original date of  his release, while his political rights will continue to be  withheld for three years.    Since his release, Wei has been hounded by the police and  told to refrain from being interviewed by foreign journalists  and writing essays for the foreign press.    Last year, Wei, who steadfastly maintained his innocence  throughout his 15-year ordeal, was a cowinner with Nelson  Mandela of the Gleitsman Foundation international activist award.</p>

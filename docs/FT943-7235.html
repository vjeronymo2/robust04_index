			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / International Company News: Swedish banking recovery gathers pace A sharp fall in the loan losses which threatened to cripple Sweden's banking system 18 months ago has helped two leading commercial banks, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and Svenska Handelsbanken, yesterday report a strong improvement in first-half earnings. Handelsbanken, the only bank to survive the crisis without appealing for state aid, announced a threefold rise in operating profits, to SKr2.3bn (Dollars 304.6m) from a surplus of SKr768m last time, as loan losses tumbled 60 per cent from SKr3.63bn to SKr1.46bn. At SE-Banken, which a year ago dropped an application for state assistance as its performance recovered, the swing was even larger. It posted a profit of SKr2.22bn after a loss in the first half last year of SKr298m. Its loan losses, at SKr2.95bn, remain much greater than those of its traditional rival, but were 43 per cent lower than the SKr5.15bn in the same period last year. The figures were further evidence that economic recovery and lower interest rates, compared with 1992 and early 1993 when the crisis hit, have enabled the banks to overcome much of the damage done to their loan books by over-exposure to overheated property markets. Handelsbanken said its total of problem loans after provisions had fallen to SKr7.95bn from SKr13.25bn a year ago, and now accounted for 2.9 per cent of lending volume, compared with 4.4 per cent. S-E-Banken's problem loans after provisions totalled SKr10.69bn, down from SKr22.53bn a year ago. They accounted for 4 per cent of all loans, compared with 6.9 per cent. Although the worst of the loan-loss flood has been stemmed, Handelsbanken stressed that the level of credit losses - in its case around 1 per cent of annual lending - was still above 'normal' levels of around 0.5 per cent. The level at SE-Banken was 1.97 per cent. Meanwhile, both banks reported a weaker underlying performance for the period, as net interest income was hit by low lending volumes, narrow margins and lower returns from bond trading. Net interest income at Handelsbanken was down 15 per cent at SKr4.29bn, compared with SKr5.03bn. In spite of a 13 per cent rise in commission income to SKr1.5bn, profit before loan losses fell 14 per cent from SKr4.39bn to SKr3.76bn. Profits before credit losses were up 7 per cent at SE-Banken, to SKr5.18bn from SKr4.85bn. However, the result was distorted by gains from disposals, which raised non-interest and non-commission income to SKr1.87bn from SKr726m. Net interest income fell 7 per cent to SKr4.26bn from SKr4.58bn, and commission income slipped to SKr3bn from SKr3.28bn. Handelsbanken said rapid growth in its Swedish krone surplus liquidity, stemming from the low loan volumes, had led to a big rise in its holdings of government securities and bonds. These had grown to SKr105bn from SKr59.7bn at the same stage last year. It said SKr36bn of the holdings were held in a trading portfolio, the value of which had a direct impact on the profit and loss account.</p>

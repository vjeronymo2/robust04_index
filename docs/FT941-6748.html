			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Turkish privatisation hit by devaluation - Motor company Tofas faces more than one challenge Correction (published 3rd March 1994) appended to this article. A devaluation is just about the last thing an international share issue wants weeks ahead of launch date. But for Tofas, the Turkish motor group, adverse currency movements are simply the latest in a long line of problems. The Turkish government is selling its 21 per cent stake in Tofas, in which Fiat of Italy and the Turkish Koc group are major shareholders. Brokers expect the issue to be at a significant discount to the market. The international equity offering is for 20m global depositary receipts (GDRs) and American depositary receipts and is expected to raise between Dollars 400m-Dollars 450m. It will be followed by a smaller domestic offering. Pricing is due to take place tomorrow. J Henry Schroder Wagg and Lehman Brothers are joint lead managers and joint global co-ordinators, with Daiwa, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and UBS as co-leads. If successful, the offering could revitalise Turkey's privatisation programme and open the way for the disposal of a range of Turkish state monopolies in the next two years. Tofas is Turkey's largest car producer with 25 per cent of the local market. Total car sales grew from 118,000 in 1988 to 311,000 by 1992. Net sales were Dollars 1.05bn in 1992, and Dollars 1.1bn for the first nine months of 1993. But in many ways the company is an uncomfortable relic of Turkey's protectionist past. It produces out-moded models behind high tariff barriers, supplied by local components manufacturers in which the company is also controlling shareholder. Tofas is a manufacturing company with its distribution business, Turk Oto Ticaret, separately listed on the Istanbul stock exchange. The issue prospectus goes to lengths to dispel concerns about possible transfer pricing between the manufacturing and distribution businesses. Tofas is in a curious position. Once import tariffs are scrapped in line with the customs union with the European Union in 1995, there is little to stop Fiat importing direct from Italy instead of sinking further funds into its Turkish subsidiary. Making matters even more precarious, the licensing agreement with Fiat, on which Tofas is dependent for technology and design, expires in 1997. There are also doubts about the relationship between the Turkish government and Fiat. The government was forced to cancel plans for a full public listing in New York, after Fiat intervened. Both Fiat, with 42 per cent, and Koc, with 34 per cent, were known to have reservations, particularly over the rigorous disclosure demanded by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The present international share issue is a more restricted private placement with institutional investors, with GDRs issued in European markets. A small amount of stock will be floated in a secondary offering in Istanbul, where Tofas is listed. Last month's 12 per cent devaluation of the Turkish lira has cast further doubt over the sale. Tofas is vulnerable to currency instability since its recent profits performance has been fuelled in large part by the availability of easy credit. With interest rates pushed higher to defend the currency, Turkish hire purchase costs have rocketed and consumer demand fallen. The currency turbulence has meant the banks are unwilling to underwrite the Turkish offering, which is being allotted in a 'best offer' basis. A quarter of Tofas' 8,500 workforce is being stood down for a month as part of a production slowdown. But the company is planning to spend Dollars 500m to increase installed capacity to 300,000 cars by the end of 1996. There are also plans for new lines. At the same time, the industry is lobbying for a five-year reprieve to the customs union deadline. Reprieve or not, motor industry analysts anticipate shrinking market shares for local car producers, reduced margins, and lower real earnings, as imports increase. CORRECTION Tofas, the Turkish motor group. has a domestic market share of 45 per cent, and not 25 per cent as reported on Tuesday.</p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Bilton edges ahead to Pounds 9.06m Patchy trading conditions in the south-east industrial property market were yesterday blamed by Bilton for the marginal improvement in pre-tax profits from Pounds 8.99m to Pounds 9.06m for the half year to June 30. Investment income fell from Pounds 11.16m to Pounds 11.11m, and Mr Tim Goodwin, finance director, said that rents remained under pressure. 'Rental levels are flat and it is difficult to say what is going to happen.' The net asset value declined from 372p to 325p a share following the 11 per cent drop in the value of the group's property investment portfolio reported in April. Earnings per share were flat at 7.1p, while the interim dividend improved marginally to 2.89p (2.84p). Turnover from ordinary activities at the trading level increased by 23 per cent to Pounds 5.88m (Pounds 4.78m). Trading conditions in the housebuilding, plant hire and contracting side were difficult. Mr Hugh Free, the chairman, commented: 'Profitable work remains scarce and the housing market continues to be uncertain.' Rents receivable improved slightly at Pounds 12.52m (Pounds 12.5m), although there was an increase in ground rents which affected the overall investment income. Mr Goodwin said there were a few positive signs within the property sector, such as fewer companies closing and a corresponding rise in the number of companies renewing leases. However, he added that conditions remained too uncertain to comment on the trading outlook for the full year.</p>

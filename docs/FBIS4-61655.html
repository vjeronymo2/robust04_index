			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Anatol Hurynovich, deputy chairman of the </F> Minsk City Council, by Lyudmila Klaskowskaya; place and date not  given: "One Should Do His Best To Make Presidential Campaign  Fair"]    [Text] [Klaskowskaya] The presidential campaign is already  under way, and you must have your first observations...    [Hurynovich] As is known, at the first stage, initiating  groups in charge of collecting signatures for their candidates  tried to register with the Central Commission. The number of  those groups alone shows that the presidential campaign is going  to be hot.    At that time, the organization of the city and district  electoral commissions was initiated, the participation in which  was sought by different political organizations and working  teams. Their reasons are only too clear: With our thus far  very weak democratic traditions, every political force wants to  have its "eye" there. To maintain popular trust in those  commissions, we admitted a broad circle of political parties.  The commissions have been set up by now, and their personal  line-up was made public.    Now, as you know, the initiating groups have begun  collecting  signatures for their candidates.    [Klaskowskaya] Do you have any more observations regarding  this first presidential campaign held in Belarus?    [Hurynovich] First, the electoral law, which was hastily  adopted, is not perfect. It failed to sufficiently specify the  election procedures in the military and in restricted-admittance  medical institutions. Poorly thought out is a provision saying  that under certain circumstance, citizens may vote within 10  days [as published]. There will be problems with putting  together electorate lists.    In addition, we are concerned about the prospective turnout.  The election day, 23 January, is Thursday, which is one day  before the weekend. You cannot guarantee that people will not  grab all four days to leave for their suburban land plots.    [Klaskowskaya] The presidential campaign promises to be  exhausting both for the candidates and their teams. What  difficulties do you and the structures that will be created on  the city and district levels anticipate in ensuring smooth  elections?    [Hurynovich] I had a meeting with deputy chairmen and  administration heads at the Minsk city districts council the  other day. They were surprised that the draft electoral law was  not published in the press. People who, as they say, cut their  teeth on this, could have helped make this law more accomplished.    The main burden is now carried by the city districts. Top  priority issues include staking out boundaries of constituencies  and setting up electoral commissions there. In addition, time  is pressing.    [Klaskowskaya] The law guarantees equal rights and  conditions  for each contender for the presidential post. But we all know  just how it is in real life. What are the illegal campaigning  methods that we will have to weed out?    [Hurynovich] Due to a rudimentary political culture and a  lack of basic ethics, the campaign will surely provide us with  many surprises. There can be no equal opportunities for all  presidential candidates at a time when all media are  monopolistically owned by the state. Evidence of this is  already on hand. No sooner had the prime minister signed the  monetary merger agreement (I personally view this fact as a  propaganda ploy on the eve of the elections) than all the media  exploded with reports touting the good that Kebich supposedly  did for Belarus. Why weren't economists, independent experts,  and politicians given an opportunity to present their educated  and objective opinions about this treaty? This kind of  political "game" will be very dangerous if played throughout the  campaign.    [Klaskowskaya] Your own experience has taught you many  things...    [Hurynovich] Running for a seat at the Minsk City Council, I  myself experienced the foul methods of my political rivals.  The mudslinging machine is well-maintained. One day they  spread rumors that you were embracing... a fascist, but the next  day, it suddenly turns out that you are not a fascist, but a  good friend of Belarus.    Such practices are still used today. Many people excelled  especially well in this type of "campaigning." Some of them  used to be highly-paid party hacks and came from Russia to  install communism here and manipulate public opinion with  Bolshevik tricks, mixing lies with a small dash of truth.  Others, like a bureaucrat from the Cabinet of Ministers and the  prime minister's press secretary, engage in political  falsifications disparaging political opponents to their chiefs.  If the prime minister is for a fair campaign, he should be the  first to stop Mr. Zamyatalin.    Officials and state institutions should not be allowed to  participate in the campaign during working hours. One cannot  tolerate a situation when the entire state administration  machine, putting important matters aside, is engaged in an  election campaign. There is evidence that emissaries traverse  the entire Belarus during their working hours to coerce local  leaders and the electorate into voting for their candidate.  They also get people to participate in initiating groups  contrary to their will.    The government and the Central Electoral Commission has even  issued rules for using mass media by presidential candidates.  But look at item 9: Major media receive subsidies from the  Cabinet of Ministers. He who pays orders the music, but the  Cabinet of Ministers pays the money that comes from the  electorate. What equal conditions can we talk about when the  media work in favor of some candidate, and for our money at that?    Incidentally, the democratically-oriented Belarusian Social  Democratic Assembly, the United Democratic Party of Belarus, the  Party of People's Accord, the National Democratic Party, and  others signed an agreement on the joint political fight. And  one more thing, only time will tell whether judicial  institutions will impartially control implementation of the  electoral law.    [Klaskowskaya] It is said that the party of power will exert  pressure on electoral commissions to neutralize its opponents.  Do you agree that this is possible?    [Hurynovich] Yes. However, I hope that the commissions are  staffed with honest people who will strictly abide by the law,  regardless of their political convictions. Besides, one should  not forget that in the opposite case, they may face  administrative and criminal charges.    The presence of observers at the electoral districts is  another condition for holding fair elections. The procedure for  their appointment is quite democratic, and I think, there will  be no problems here.    [Klaskowskaya] But still, is it possible that a candidate,  having garnered the required number of votes, might trip over  some bureaucratic obstacles or hit some hidden snag?    [Hurynovich] I see no such snags. Of course, if someone  collects exactly 100,000 signatures, he might not be registered  as a candidate. The district commissions are tasked with  overseeing activities of initiating groups. In case of a  violation on their part (for example, an individual signed for  the same candidate on two different signature lists), all those  100,000 votes are gone. I would advise signature collectors to  be cautions regarding provocations.    [Klaskowskaya] In this situation, much depends on the  electorate itself...    [Hurynovich] I would ask all the voters to treat the  presidential elections very seriously. At this point, many of  them find it difficult to determine their own position. Let me  remind them again that the electoral law allows one voter to  sign for several contenders for the presidential post [previous  sentence published in boldface]. After that, they will get a  chance to read their programs and determine which one they would  vote for on 23 June.</p>

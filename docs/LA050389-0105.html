			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BETTER ON-JOB TRAINING VITAL, MIT STUDY SAYS;  </P> <P> CALLS IT KEY TO MATCHING JAPANESE IN PRODUCTIVITY  </P> <P> Better on-the-job training, even more than better schools, is the key to  helping U.S. workers catch up to the Japanese and others in productivity,  concluded an MIT report released Tuesday.  </P> <P> "Young Americans receive most of their job skills in institutions of formal  learning, and what they pick up on the job is usually of a limited nature,  gathered from watching a colleague," said the report, "Made in America."  </P> <P> Taking only small or partial steps to improve the nation's competitiveness will  doom the United States to steady slippage in the standard of living, according  to the two-year study by scientists, engineers and economists from  Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  </P> <P> Japanese and West German corporations invest far more than most U.S. firms in  training and retraining workers over a lifetime. The payoff, said the study, is  a work force prepared and flexible enough to adapt to changing styles and  technologies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Started From Scratch  </P> <P> U.S. companies that are doing well today often are ones that have started from  scratch or come through crises, the authors said.  </P> <P> They cited Xerox Corp., which fought back after losing most of the world copier  market in the 1970s and early 1980s, and Ford Motor Co., which has rebounded to  become the nation's most profitable auto maker after losing $3.3 billion from  1980 through 1982.  </P> <P> "The management trick is, can you change before you have a crisis?" said Lester  Thurow, dean of MIT's Sloan School of Management. It can be done, he said.  </P> <P> International Business Machines Corp., Digital Equipment Corp. and Chaparral  Industries Inc. do provide effective training, the report said. But many small  and medium-sized companies feel they can't afford to establish extensive  training programs. Or they are concerned that if they do, they'd lose their  investment when workers transfer to other companies.  </P> <P> Changing this "would require a kind of national political leadership that has  not yet appeared," the report said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Neglect of Human Resources  </P> <P> The study was produced by a 16-member MIT Commission on Industrial  Productivity.  </P> <P> The 344-page report's principal authors were Michael L. Dertouzos, professor of  engineering and computer science, Richard K. Lester, associate professor of  nuclear engineering, and Robert M. Solow, professor of economics and Nobel  laureate in economics.  </P> <P> Neglect of human resources may be the United States' biggest failing, Dertouzos  said at a news conference on the report.  </P> <P> Unless something is done, he said, "The nation will become progressively more  impoverished in relative terms."  </P> <P> While critical of U.S. public schools and vocational schools for turning out  children ill-equipped in math, science and other disciplines, the report said  school reform is only a first step toward a more productive work force.  </P> <P> </P> <P> On the Job  </P> <P> "Even if American schools were to be improved, there are reasons to believe  that learning work skills on the job might be preferable to learning them in  schools," the report argued.  </P> <P> Skills developed on the job tend to be broader, more flexible and more relevant  to the future needs of the corporation. Such skills are general enough so that  they can be useful even if the worker switches jobs.  </P> <P> West Germany, for example, offers young workers apprenticeships in 400  occupations. The apprentice, usually 16 years old, spends an average of three  years working in a firm under a supervisor. The training curriculum is  negotiated with government, employers' associations and trade unions.  </P> <P> In Japan, workers rotate between research, manufacturing, sales and other  areas. They spend several days a year in corporate training centers and are  also encouraged to take correspondence courses.  </P> <P> The report disputed the notion that U.S. workers are being outdone by foreign  competitors because of a decline in the work ethic.  </P></p>

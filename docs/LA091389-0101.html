			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEARINGS ON CREDIT PRIVACY BEGIN TODAY  </P> <P> For years, Orange-based TRW Credit Data and a handful of other credit reporting  giants have earned a good living generating detailed reports on the ability of  millions of Americans to pay their bills.  </P> <P> More recently, however, the credit companies and their parent firms have found  a new way to turn a profit by selling sophisticated mailing lists and related  services drawing, in part, on credit information stored in their massive data  banks.  </P> <P> It is not an innovation that pleases everyone.  </P> <P> A congressional subcommittee, in a hearing today, will be examining the  19-year-old federal credit privacy law and the degree to which TRW and its  competitors keep faith with both its letter and spirit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'War Already Lost'  </P> <P> "Credit information is being used for secondary purposes -- purposes different  from the one for which the information was gathered," said Robert Ellis Smith,  publisher of the Washington-based Privacy Journal, which covers the credit  reporting industry. "This violates the intent of the Fair Credit Reporting  Act."  </P> <P> Selling credit data for use in direct-mail marketing efforts "is a privacy  intrusion," said Janlori Goldman, Washington staff attorney for the American  Civil Liberties Union. "That is where we think the act needs to be  strengthened."  </P> <P> "The war (for) privacy has already been lost," added Steve Hamm, past president  of the National Assn. of Consumer Agency Administrators and administrator of  the South Carolina Department of Consumer Affairs.  </P> <P> The consumer affairs subcommittee of the House Banking, Finance and Urban  Affairs Committee is particularly interested in the issue of using credit  information to generate mailing lists and consumer profiles, one staff member  said.  </P> <P> So far, the Federal Trade Commission, which is responsible for enforcing the  Fair Credit Reporting Act, has found no grounds to halt the practice.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Not Discussed Directly'  </P> <P> "It's something that is not discussed directly in the act at all," said the  staff member, who asked not to be named. "I think it's a growing concern of  people."  </P> <P> Along with TRW, other major credit reporting services that sell information to  be used in direct-mail solicitations are Equifax Inc. of Atlanta and Trans  Union Corp. of Chicago. Together, the firms maintain some 400 million credit  files on about 180 million Americans. All three will be represented at the  congressional hearing.  </P> <P> A spokesman for TRW said the company has gone to extraordinary lengths to  protect the privacy of the 150 million or so Americans on which it maintains  credit files.  </P> <P> "I believe we are absolutely the industry leader . . . in protecting privacy,"  Michael M. Van Buskirk, vice president of TRW Information Systems Group, said  in a telephone interview from his Orange County office.  </P></p>

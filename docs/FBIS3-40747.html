			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Madras, Dec. 1--The designated court trying the  Rajiv Gandhi assassination case today held an exclusive sitting  to read out the charges framed against five of the accused  including Murugan alias Sriharan, one of the key accused and  husband of the first accused, Nalini, and three others who have  been boycotting the court proceedings.    When the court met this morning, three of the  accused--Shanthan, Ravichandran and Suseendran--who had been  boycotting the proceedings, were present along with Irumborai  who could not come to the court during the last sitting on Nov.  25.    Murugan did not turn up at first but appeared after a break  in the proceedings. The charges were read out to him when he was  alone in the court.    He covers his face: Throughout the 30-minute  exclusive proceedings, Murugan who had been boycotting the  proceedings saying that he did not believe that he would get a  fair trial, neither responded to the court staff's query nor  accepted the charges against him. He hung his head and covered  his face with one hand even as the court staff after reading out  each of the charges repeatedly asked him whether he accepted  them.    Murugan, who did not engage a lawyer for himself, however,  received a copy of the court order framing charges against all  the 26 accused after signing the acknowledgement.    The bearded Murugan, who usually dressed neatly, was clad in  a lungi and shirt when he came to the court. He left the court  immediately after the staff announced that the proceedings were  adjourned to Dec. 9.    Though he did not stand up when the court staff called his  name, a normal practice followed by all the other accused to  hear the charges, Murugan stood up as a mark of respect when the  presiding officer, Mr. S.M. Siddickk, entered the court and  retired back to his chamber.    Earlier, after the charges were read out against the four  accused, the judge retired to his chamber even as the prison  authorities tried to bring Murugan to the court.    After a 30-minute break, Murugan, accompanied by senior  prison personnel including the Additional Superintendent of  Police, came to the court. Following this, the judge came to the  court again after which the court staff read out the charges  framed against Murugan.    Though the accused remained silent when the court staff  asked  whether he pleaded guilty, it will be recorded by the judge that  the accused did not plead guilty as per Section 228 of the Code  of the Criminal Procedure.    Murugan has been charged under Section 14 of the Foreigners  Act, Section 6 (1-a) of the Wireless and Telegraphy Act, besides  the common charges framed against all accused under Section 120  9B Indian Penal Code (punishment for conspiracy) and various  Sections of the IPC and provisions of the TADA Act.    The other four accused replied in the negative when they  were  asked whether they pleaded guilty. They were engaged in a  conversation for most of the time when the charges against them  were read out.    Why the 'reluctance': Murugan was reluctant to  come to the court as he did not like to reply in one word to the  court's query whether he pleaded guilty or not to the charges,  Mr. V. Elangovan, defence lawyer, who met the accused this  morning to persuade him to attend the court, said.    The accused was also advised by another defence lawyer, Mr.  T. Ramadoss, who was said to have told him that it was not fair  to boycott the proceedings after having appeared in the court  once and argued his case.    Stage set for trial: With this, the process of  reading out the charges to all the 26 accused was completed. The  stage is now set for starting the regular trial and examination  of witnesses. The judge did not fix any date for the trial, but  official sources said it was likely to begin during the second  or third week of Jan.    Barring Mr. Doraisamy, counsel for 13 accused including  Nalini, none of the other defence lawyers is planning to appeal  against the trial court order framing charges against the  accused.    With the pre-trial proceedings coming to an end, further  proceedings including cross examination of witnesses would be  held in-camera.    The two National news agencies, United News of India and  Press Trust of India were allowed to cover the pre-trial  proceedings under Section 226 (prosecution presenting its case)  227 (defence reply to the case) and 228 (framing of charges) of  the code of criminal procedure.    No more press coverage?: Though the recent  amendment to the TADA Act gives the discretionary power to the  designated court judge to conduct the trial in open or  in-camera, it is unlikely that the press would be allowed to  cover further proceedings in the case.    The prosecution was very particular and cautious in not  disclosing the identity of the witnesses and the details of  their deposition in the interest of both the accused and the  case, sources said.</p>

			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Wobbly dollar is no big deal The gulf between US and European attitudes towards exchange rates is so broad as sometimes to seem unbridgeable. The dollar's recent weakness has received scant coverage in the American press - at best short stories on the business pages. The German discount rate increase, for example, not only failed to make the front pages of the New York Times or Washington Post; it was not even in their lengthy inside news summaries. If you failed to turn to the business sections, you missed it altogether. The Democratic convention was admittedly monopolising the public's attention. But even on an ordinary day little would be made of a decision by the Bundesbank. Few Americans know or care what the dollar is worth in terms of other currencies. They certainly do not expect fluctuations on the foreign exchanges to have much impact on domestic economic policy. Americans would be stunned if the Federal Reserve - the central bank - were to announce that it had to raise interest rates in order to defend the dollar. On Main Street, the Fed's sole task is seen as bolstering the flagging economic recovery. In US financial markets, similar attitudes prevail. On a tour of Wall Street last week, every analyst I consulted expressed concern that the domestic recovery might be losing momentum. All anticipated further dollar weakness but none saw this as a cause for great concern. Even the Fed seems unusually relaxed: the most recent published minutes of its policy-making open market committee barely mentioned the dollar. Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman, is likely to refer to exchange rate movements in his biannual Humphrey-Hawkins congressional testimony on Tuesday, but he can hardly deny that the Fed has so far focused almost exclusively on the needs of the domestic economy. Having grown accustomed to US indifference to exchange rates, it can be hard to grasp what a different world the UK inhabits. It seems incredible that minute movements of sterling within the EMS can send shock waves through British society. Two decades after the world's biggest economies opted for floating exchange rates, the sight of Mr John Major, the prime minister, solemnly ruling out devaluation seems oddly old-fashioned. It reminds me of the 1960s and Harold Wilson's valiant - but ultimately doomed - fight to avoid the humiliation of devaluation. In the US, few people regard the exchange rate as a symbol of national virility; the attitude, rather, is that if the dollar drifts lower against the D-Mark and yen, US exporters will gain a welcome edge in overseas markets. What accounts for this striking difference in attitudes? The US psychology is different partly because Americans have been owners of the world's only viable international currency for half a century. The dollar, they point out, is still overwhelmingly the most popular unit of account and store of value in global transactions. The US can borrow apparently limitless sums without taking on a currency risk. In a real sense, therefore, American insouciance about the dollar's value in terms of lesser currencies is justified. At the same time, the biggest potential disadvantage of a depreciating currency - accelerating inflation - is rarely perceived as a serious risk. The relaxed attitude towards the inflationary consequences of dollar depreciation is justified in two ways. In the first place the US is a huge, continental economy in which trade still plays a relatively minor role. Exports and imports account for only 10.5 per cent and 10.9 per cent respectively of US gross domestic product, compared with ratios of closer to a third in the UK. This means that increases in the prices of imports have only a small impact on the overall price level. In addition the US has the world's most competitive labour market - reflecting both the weakness of unions and its willingness to permit immigration of low paid workers. The British assumption that depreciation will be automatically dissipated in higher pay awards does not apply: with most categories of workers experiencing steady falls in real wages, depreciation is more likely to lead to higher profits and investment. Look at what has happened since 1985, say American economists. The dollar's plunge against the D-Mark and yen did not set off an inflationary spiral. On the contrary, exports surged, imports began to level off and the trade deficit narrowed sharply. The conclusion is that a little more of the same medicine will do no harm. Americans and Europeans seem destined to continue misunderstanding each other. The US is quite comfortable with a floating exchange rate: it is hard to imagine circumstances in which US monetary policy would be tightened ahead of the November election. When the Fed does eventually tighten, it will be moving mainly in response to its assessment of domestic inflationary pressures. Europeans are likely fully to understand America's carefree attitude to the dollar only if they finally achieve economic and monetary union. Trade would then be a relatively minor component of the integrated European economy. And Europe's currency would be mighty on the world stage. In the fullness of time, London may be as blithely indifferent to exchange rates as the capitals of Nebraska or Arkansas.</p>

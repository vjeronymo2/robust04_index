			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  chairman of the Presidential Council, met yesterday evening with  the brother members of the Political Forces Dialogue Committee.  The meeting addressed several issues on the local scene, as  well as the efforts being made by the committee to end the  political crisis. The conferees also reviewed the decisions  reached by the committee during its recent meetings in the  commercial and economic capital, Aden. These decisions aim at  implementing the accord document, activating Constitutional  agencies, enhancing trust between political leaders, and  supporting efforts to lead Yemen to a safe haven. The purpose  of this is to safeguard Yemeni unity and democracy and build a  modern Yemeni state.    During the meeting, the brother chairman of the Presidential  Council welcomed the members of the committee and blessed the  committee's decisions. He said: We bless you and highly  appreciate the committee's efforts that resulted in the accord  document. This shows concern on the part of everybody. The  homeland is, after all, for everybody and it is the duty of  every patriotic and well-meaning individual to seek an end to  the crisis that has plagued our people for more than seven  months.    Addressing the dialogue committee, the brother chairman  said:  We do not want you to be biased toward this or that party. We  want you to favor the homeland and to champion it wisely and  adroitly. The interests of the homeland should be placed above  all other considerations. The political forces and all the sons  of the homeland are responsible for ridding the homeland of the  ongoing developments and schemes to foil the homeland's unity.  These schemes cannot succeed unless there are domestic tools to  implement them and unless the doors are open to them. We should  close all doors and not allow the fragmentation of national  unity, whatever the differences. We should have recourse to  dialogue and not infringe on constant national principles and  not harm our unity. It is better for us to sit at the  negotiating table right from the very beginning to find  solutions to our problems, instead of resorting to armed  struggle and violence and later sitting at the negotiating  table, having shed blood and destroyed the homeland.    The brother chairman stressed the need for the dialogue  committee to monitor the official media and make sure they abide  by the committee's decisions and end the media campaigns. He  said the Dialogue Committee should make a decision to assume  direct supervision, through work teams, over all airports and  seaports in Aden, Sanaa, Hadhramaut, al-Hudaydah, Ta'izz, and  other Yemeni ports to make sure no weapons or military equipment  and hardware are imported from abroad, and to stop military  escalation.    The brother chairman reiterated the commitment of the  General  People's Congress [GPC] to any decision adopted in this regard.  He also denied press reports that Yemen has imported  internationally banned weapons. He expressed extreme regret  over hearing such unfounded rumors. He said: Whatever the  political differences between the political organizations, we  should not allow this to reach the level of harming Yemen and  its international reputation. Repeating such false rumors does  not harm just one political side alone; it harms all the Yemeni  people and distorts their image worldwide. Consequently, it  will be difficult to remove such a distorted image in the short  run. Everybody should enjoy national responsibility toward such  irresponsible practices. We should enhance mutual trust. The  Dialogue Committee should also intensify its efforts so the  homeland can recover and trust can be restored. This will enable  everybody to devote their efforts to promoting a safe, stable  homeland enjoying unity and democracy.    The meeting was attended by brother 'Abd-al-'Aziz  'Abd-al-Ghani, member of the Presidential Council and GPC  assistant secretary general.</p>

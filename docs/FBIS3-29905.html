			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [YONHAP report from Washington] </F>   [Text] It has been learned that the United States and  North Korea held a working-level contact in New York again this  morning to discuss the inspection schedule of the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and the preparations for the third  round of U.S.-North Korean talks.    Well-informed Washington sources confirmed on 22 February  that the working-level contact between the United States and  North Korea was held in New York, but did not give details of  the negotiations. Today's contact was held upon the request of  North Korea. Tom Hubbard, deputy assistant secretary of the  U.S. State Department, and Ho Chong, deputy chief of North  Korean Permanent Mission to the United Nations were present.    It has been learned that in today's contact North Korea  delivered a letter from Kang Sok-chu, vice minister of the North  Korean Foreign Ministry, in reply to a letter from Assistant  Secretary Robert Gallucci, and asked for a clear and early  expression of the U.S. stance on follow-up steps, including the  suspension of the Team Spirit exercise and the schedule for the  third round of U.S.-North Korean talks.    The U.S. side expressed grave concern over the delay in  issuing visas for the IAEA inspection team and reiterated its  stance that the United States would set a date and begin  full-scale preparations for the third round of the talks once  the inspection begins and North-South dialogue resumes.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, June 28, (IRNA) -- Deputy Foreign Minister  Abbas Maleki here Tuesday [28 June] refuted claims by certain  Western mass media that the peace talks on Tajikistan held in  Tehran have failed, saying the West did not want Iran to play a  pivotal role in the negotiations.    Maleki, a deputy for research and training, said that not  only the Tehran talks have been a success but they have also  indicated Iran's key role in tackling regional problems.    The West intends to play down any peace efforts being made  in  the absence of Western organizations, the deputy foreign  minister reiterated.    Although the West wants the crisis in Tajikistan to be  settled by Western countries, the success of the Tehran talks  was such that even the especial envoy of the U.N. secretary  general, R. Piriz Ballon confirmed it, he added.    According to Maleki, the bases for national reconciliation  were laid in the second round of peace talks on Tajikistan held  in Tehran from June 18-28.    Maleki said that the two parties involved in the peace talks  agreed upon the definition of the notion of the ceasefire, the  terms for ceasefire, the release of political prisoners, freedom  of the press, public amnesty and renewal of activities of  political parties.    Stressing the political dialogue as the only solution to the  problems of Tajikistan, Maleki said that the Tajik Government  was well aware that the development of that country was tied to  achievement of a lasting peace.</p>

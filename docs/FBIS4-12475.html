			<p>BFN     [Text] Doha, April 10 (AFP)--An Israeli delegation is due  here for the first time next month for talks on Middle East arms  control, after Qatari foreign ministry sources said Sunday the  negotiations would last from May 2 to 5.    Invitations to attend the talks in Doha have already started  being sent out to interested countries and institutions to take  part in the fifth round of talks on weapons non-proliferation,  sources said.    But they refused to discuss any details of Israel's  involvement in the negotiations, which form one of the five  working groups set up as part of the multilateral Arab-Israeli  peace process.    Israel is due to attend a meeting in Oman next Sunday to  discuss water resources in the Middle East.    Oman will be the first Gulf monarchy to host a round of  Middle East peace talks, at which the Israeli delegation is due  to be led by Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin.    Neither Oman or Qatar, like the other Gulf monarchies, have  any official diplomatic relations with Israel.</p>

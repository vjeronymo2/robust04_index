			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Bratislava, Jan 26 (CTK) -- [passage omitted]  The independent NARODNA OBRODA turns its attention to the  forthcoming discussion in the Slovak Parliament today of the  government and opposition amendments to the Law on Large  Privatization. Given the current distribution of forces in  Parliament, every vote will count in whether the government bill  or that of the opposition is approved, the daily writes. The  opposition think that by pushing its bill through parliament,  the government seeks to gain a decisive influence over the  privatization process, which will basically define not only  economic but also power developments in Slovakia for years to  come.    The daily SME, referring to the same topic, writes that the  result of the vote will determine whether Slovak Premier  Vladimir Meciar will have everything or only almost everything.  If he succeeded in getting his triple office -- the premier,  privatization minister, and president of National Property Fund  (FNM) -- endorsed by the supreme legislature then nothing would  remain for the opposition than, in the words of Frantisek  Miklosko (chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH)  deputies' group) to watch. Following the implemented purges in  the state administration bodies and the breakup of the deputies'  group of the government coalition Slovak National Party (SNS),  Meciar will now only have to get an upper hand over  privatization which, given the prevailing methods of the  "division" of state property, offers boundless possibilities for  producing new owners of small shops who would be appreciated for  their staunch positions and who would be always reliable as far  as voting is concerned."    Although opposition deputies realize this, the question is  whether they will be able to prevent this trend. The premier is  also very well aware of what is at stake in this game and what  the current distribution of forces looks like. The fact that  the amended bill on investment funds, which met opposition from  domestic and foreign businessmen, was withdrawn from the agenda  of the current parliamentary session also testified to this.    "And yet it could not be ruled out that several mini chess  games will be played in connection with the bill on large  privatization, because it is more advantageous for the premier  to preserve the status quo than to risk the separation of the  functions of FNM president and privatization minister, which  could happen under a certain constellation of deputies' votes,"  the daily writes.    SLOVENSKY DENNIK, close to the opposition KDH, writes that  "the opposition was thus far able to just point to the  accumulation of functions and power." The daily voices the view  that this state of affairs will remain unchanged. It is likely  that Parliament will not be able, during the vote on the Bill on  Large Privatization, to approve the separation of the office of  privatization minister from the functions of FNM chairman, and  the functions of the finance minister from the functions of  chairman of FNM Supervisory Council.    The independent daily SME carries an interview with Mikulas  Dzurinda, deputy chairman of the opposition Christian Democratic  Movement (KDH), on the same topic. "It is high time that not  only the opposition deputies' clubs realized the danger that the  concentration of economic power in the hands of one movement or  one person poses, not only for the development of the economy,  but also for democracy in Slovakia," Dzurinda says in connection  with the upcoming parliamentary session, at which government and  opposition amendments to the Law on Large Privatization are to  be discussed.    Approval of the government amendment, Dzurinda says, "would  mean that the premier will be able to influence changes to and  interference in privatization projects, even approved ones, even  more."    Dzurinda also expresses fear that Meciar tactically did not  decide to remove the large privatization amendment from the  parliamentary agenda. "It is now clear to everyone that the  premier is concentrating his power, and that through the  concentration of economic power wants to increase his own  political power. Even the smallest suspicion that this power  could be weakened could lead him to remove the amendment on  large privatization from the agenda. And this would be very  bad," he says.    In an interview with SLOVENSKY DENNIK, Peter Weiss, chairman  of the Democratic Left Party (SDL), also expresses disagreement  with the government amendment to the law on large privatization.  "I believe that opposition deputies and at least some from the  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) are aware of the risk  of approving such a proposal," he says.    "We wanted to and continue to want to prevent the further  concentration of power and the division of privatization for  political reasons. The government did not accept this and  decided to create a faithful structure of owners, because it  will depend on the deputies of the governing movement what  position it takes on this tendency. The opposition parties are  united in the view that it is necessary to prevent the  continuation of the personal union between the Privatization  Ministry and the FNM," Weiss says.

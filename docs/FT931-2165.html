			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / ICI waste output falls sharply IMPERIAL CHEMICAL Industries, the UK's biggest manufacturer, reduced its worldwide emissions to land, sea and air by 9 per cent from a total of 5.68bn tonnes in 1991 to 5.167bn tonnes last year, the company states in its second environmental report, Paul Abrahams writes. Hazardous waste was cut by 26 per cent from 475,000 tonnes in 1991 to 350,000 tonnes last year. That represents a fall of 48 per cent since 1990. Over the same period non-hazardous waste was cut by 9.7 per cent. Waste production overall has fallen by 14 per cent since 1990. The group was fined and prosecuted 21 times for environmental incidents, including seven times in the US, four times in continental Europe and five times in the UK. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, said there was clearly much to be done in this area.</p>

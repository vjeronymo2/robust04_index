			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Wellcome wobbles The US Food and Drug Administration's warning letter to Wellcome about manufacturing triggered painful memories of the crisis that engulfed Fisons. However, Wellcome's FDA-related difficulties appear far less perilous. And, unlike Fisons, it could supply products from elsewhere if forced to halt US production. There are doubts about Wellcome, but complying with manufacturing standards is among the least of them. The most important question hanging over the company is whether it has a viable independent future. Such doubts have been behind the bid speculation that has driven up its share price by 32 per cent since April. Wellcome is only the 24th largest drugs group in what is clearly an over-fragmented industry. Within three years it will have to face the US patent expiry of Zovirax, its biggest selling medicine. And its ability to launch new products to compensate for Zovirax is in doubt; three drugs have dropped out of the pipeline in recent months. Such arguments are not compelling. Wellcome controls a commanding position in the fast-growing anti-viral segment. Because of its near monopoly, the group is almost wholly protected from the recent changes in the US market. The company also has an impressive strategy for generating non-prescription revenues from Zovirax after patent expiry. Finally, there are enough promising products in the pipeline to carry the group forward after 1997. Competitors may well look on with envy. Investors, disillusioned by the 18 per cent fall in the share price since the 1992 share issue, should show more patience.</p>

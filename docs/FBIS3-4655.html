			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 28 February commentary: "Appeal of a Fool </F> Who Fell in a Pit"]    [Text] The traitor Kim Yong-sam held a so-called news  conference on 25 February marking the first anniversary of his  inauguration.    Taking the podium, traitor Kim Yong-sam made preposterous  absurd remarks for an hour and 30 minutes by reading a prepared  statement and by reciting answers for prepared questions. His  utterances as the so-called president were immature and were not  even worth consideration.    Traitor Kim Yong-sam, first of all, frantically  propagandized  the achievements he made for the past one year since he came to  Chongwadae [presidential office], and put forward five so-called  issues. They were merely his confession, appeal, excuses, and  remarks intended to evade responsibility for the row of failures  in reform and opening of the past one year.    As South Korean publications reported, although traitor Kim  Yong- sam frantically carried out a propaganda campaign on the  civilian government, on reform, on changes, and so forth,  nothing has changed in South Korea whatsoever.    South Korea still remains a U.S. colony, just as one year  before when the civilian government came to office. A South  Korean professor said with a jeer that the Kim Yong-sam regime  invited a man called the United States into the living room and  served him in the nude.    The traitor Kim Yong-sam talked as if he would eradicate the  fascist rule. The society has been suffocated by the civilian  government's rule for maintaining public peace and human rights  have been cruelly infringed upon. This is a solemn reality in  South Korea.    The South Korean people assess that the rule of the new  authoritarian civilian government is more atrocious than that of  the military dictatorship.    Let us examine public welfare problems. Because of the  pressure to share pains enforced by traitor Kim Yong-sam by  raving about reform, the workers are suffering greater burdens  and farmers will completely lose their means of living due to  the poorest harvest since 1980, and to make the matters worse,  by the opening of the rice market.    Traitor Kim Yong-sam attempted to shift the responsibility  for the catastrophic situation prevailing in South Korea onto  his predecessors. He also tried to lay blame on his inferiors by  raving about the easy-going attitude and slackened discipline of  government officials and so forth. However, his mean trick did  not work.    As long as traitor Kim Yong-sam implements the antinational,  nation-selling flunkeyist rule by relying on outside forces and  being deprived of sovereignty -- the life of a nation -- he  cannot avoid failure, no matter how frantically he may  propagandize civilian government and wage reform and opening.  Traitor Kim Yong- sam should have frankly admitted this.    Traitor Kim Yong-sam attempted to find a way out of the  prevailing crisis through declaration of a fascist rule,  including violent remarks that lawlessness and violence will not  be tolerated under any pretext, and through the policy of  dependence on outside forces for so-called internationalization  and globalization. This will work only as a means for expediting  the final downfall of traitor Kim Yong-sam and the civilian  regime.    What one should not overlook in the remarks made by traitor  Kim Yong-sam at the news conference that day is the portion  pertaining to North Korea.    As has been exposed, since traitor Kim Yong-sam came to  power, he has pursued North-South confrontation on the pretext  of the nuclear issue in the North; severed North-South dialogue,  which existed even in the era of previous military dictatorship;  froze all North-South relations; and drove the situation to the  brink of war.    In fact, this is antinational high treason that cannot be  pardoned. That day traitor Kim Yong-sam talked about summit  talks, exchange of special envoys, suspension of the Team Spirit  joint military exercise, joint economic development, and so  forth. He raved as if he would show a certain change in  North-South relations. His remarks, however, only served as  self-acknowledgement of the erroneous policy that has been  implemented toward North Korea for the past year.    Traitor Kim Yong-sam's position on relations with the North  is still erroneous [paruji mottada]. This was proven by the fact  that the traitor put forward, again, the nuclear issue as a  condition for development of North-South relations.    The so-called nuclear issue of the North is a product of  antisocialist and anti-Republic maneuvers persistently pursued  by the United States. The South Korean ruling bunch brought U.S.  nuclear weapons into South Korea, generated the nuclear problem  on the Korean peninsula, and is providing its own nuclear  mushroom [chacheui haek posotkkaji chariuda] under the U.S.  nuclear umbrella. Thus, the South Korean ruling bunch is not  entitled, nor has the face, to mention the nuclear issue of the  North.    Moreover, at the news conference that day, traitor Kim  Yong-sam said that he cannot find proof showing that the North  has nuclear arms. Nevertheless, he tried to continually blame us  for the nuclear issue, and even said that the nuclear issue in  the North is a stumbling block that may hinder reunification  forever.    In fact, his remarks only revealed the criminal intention to  continue the confrontation policy on the pretext of the nuclear  issue, to pursue permanent national division, and to constantly  maneuver to harm [haechida] us in collusion with the imperialist  reactionaries.    Setting reunification in the nineties as their firm goal,  all  fellow countrymen in the North, the South, and overseas have  joined a gigantic reunification march toward great national  unity.    National reunification will be achieved, regardless of what  the Kim Yong-sam group wants. That the Kim Yong-sam group  pursues confrontation on the pretext of the nuclear issue in  collusion with outside forces by betraying the nation, and  advances in the direction of disturbing reunification, can be  only regarded as the way of thinking by a stupid person who lost  his sense and who cannot find the correct direction to advance.    It is clear to everyone that traitor Kim Yong-sam held a  news  conference on the occasion of the first anniversary of his  inauguration in an attempt to repress the people's heightened  antigovernment struggle and to evade the crisis in his rule.  However, this is the same as shopping for wool and coming home  shorn. The puppet confessed by accident that South Korea was  fallen into a swamp of stagnation, but failed to put forward any  alternative policy for rescuing the people from the swamp, thus  disappointing the people.    The puppet also made gibberish as if he receives so-called  reports from the United States pertaining to DPRK-U.S. talks and  as if he controls the talks, in spite of being unqualified even  to join the talk table. He even described the people's slogan  for overthrowing Kim Yong-sam and heightened spirit of  protesting against the civilian government as the result of  democratic development. Even with a prepared text for answers to  expected questions, he could not find a proper answer in the  text, thus speaking in ambiguities. All this showed the  puppet's shamelessness, cunning nature, and ignorance.    All of traitor Kim Yong-sam's remarks and acts that day  evoked only the people's disappointment. With rascal Kim  Yong-sam, one cannot achieve independence and democracy of South  Korean society, nor can the rights of existence be guaranteed,  and one can never expect peace and reunification from  North-South relations. This is the conclusion drawn again by the  people after seeing the news conference.    The sooner such a foolish national traitor like traitor Kim  Yong- sam is removed, the better. The South Korean people will  rise in the struggle to overthrow Kim Yong-sam's traitorous  regime and to establish an independent and democratic government.</p>

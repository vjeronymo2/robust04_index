			<p>BFN     [Text] AKHIR KHABAR has learned that the French interior  minister has placed Jordan on the list of states sponsoring  terrorism in the world, imposed restrictions on the movement of  Jordanian nationals in France, and forced them to obtain exit  permits before leaving France. In a statement to AKHIR KHABAR,  Deputy Muhammad Abu-'Alim, who recently returned from an  official visit to the French capital, said that he, as well as  the Arab delegations participating in the Arab-European  parliamentary dialogue, were surprised at the official French  stand vis-a-vis Jordan. He added that they discussed the matter  with the French officials, particularly since we in Jordan are  not aware of this matter.    Abu-'Alim said: The Jordanian Embassy in Paris is aware of  this. I personally met with Mr. Bouchar [name as published] who  is currently the head of the Middle East Political Desk at the  French Foreign Ministry, He added that the French official  admitted that Jordan was mistakenly placed on the terrorism  list. The French official said: The French Government will  discuss the matter.    AKHIR KHABAR has also learned that the [Jordanian]  Government  is currently holding contacts with the French officials in this  regard and that it expects the situation to be addressed before  declaring the official French stand which is known to French  political figures.    The French foreign minister visited Israel three weeks ago  and refused the meet the Jordanian deputies who visited Paris.</p>

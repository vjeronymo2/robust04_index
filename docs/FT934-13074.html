			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / BAe and Taiwan end talks without agreement TALKS between British Aerospace and Taiwan Aerospace Corporation (TAC) over a long-delayed joint venture to build regional jet aircraft broke up yesterday little nearer resolution. Both sides said the talks had been constructive and that they would discuss them at board meetings. They would not commit themselves to holding any further face-to-face discussions. Failure to secure the venture, called Avro, would be a blow to BAe's plans to improve its performance. The regional jet business loses money and it has not made a full-year pre-tax profit since 1990. Taiwan's government also wants the deal to go ahead as part of a policy to bring the island's engineering industries into the civil aviation sector. But the proposals to build BAe's range of RJ regional jets in Taiwan in return for a cash injection have hit opposition from politicians, bankers and industrialists, who argue that they are uncommercial and too ambitious. The centrepiece of yesterday's meeting was the TAC demand that BAe give a legally-binding commitment to the development of a new generation of aircraft, called the RJX. Without it, Avro would not have a product to take it into the next decade, argues TAC. The government, which is TAC's biggest shareholder with a 19 per cent stake, supports this view. Mr John Cahill, BAe's chairman, can point to one partial success during this week's visit. Yesterday they were able for the first time to present their case directly to several of the most influential members of TAC's board of directors. Last week, BAe said that one of its aims was to clarify who was in TAC's negotiating team; the man who in January 1993 signed the original deal to create Avro, Mr Denny Ko, stepped down from his post of company president last month and Mr Earle Hou, the chairman, has also said he wants to leave. Mr Hou said yesterday the two companies had 'a mutual understanding' on the key issues of technology transfer and the specifications for a proposed advanced two-engine passenger jet. But he said he 'had no comment' on whether BAe had agreed to make a legal commitment to co-develop the advanced RJX with TAC. Reuter adds from Jakarta: Indonesia's Research and Technology Minister Jusuf Habibie said yesterday that the country's state-run aerospace company IPTN was in the final stages of talks with BAe on plans to co-operate in aircraft marketing.</p>

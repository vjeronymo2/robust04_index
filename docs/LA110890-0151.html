			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: TEMPLE CITY;  </P> <P> SIGN ORDINANCE SOFTENED  </P> <P> The City Council on Tuesday softened its English-language sign ordinance,  angering some residents in the audience, who complained not only of Chinese  language signs, but also of an Asian "invasion" in the city.  </P> <P> The council's action comes in response to a report from City Manager Denise  Ovrom, who wrote that the law had to be changed because of a U.S. District  Court decision against Pomona. Both cities had similar ordinances requiring  that 50% of a sign be devoted to Roman letters and/or Arabic numerals.  </P> <P> The new Temple City ordinance requires only that businesses be identified in  English with letters at least nine inches high in colors compatible with the  background.  </P></p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Low turnout for funeral of Sri Lankan President The daughter of assassinated Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa cries over his coffin, moments before it was taken on a procession through Colombo for cremation yesterday. The funeral ceremony, of great calm and dignity, was attended by far smaller crowds than the organisers had expected, writes Stefan Wagstyl in Colombo. The low turnout disappointed the ruling United National Party which had hoped the funeral would prove a show of political strength. The mourners numbered fewer than 10,000 compared with 100,000-plus who attended the funeral last week of a murdered opposition party leader, Mr Lalith Athulathmudali. UNP officials blamed the turnout on a curfew which forced thousands of mourners to start their journeys home before the funeral started. Police and army units were deployed throughout the city to prevent possible unrest. There were fears that the majority Sinhalese community might seek to attack members of the Tamil minority. The Tamil Tigers, a Tamil insurgency group, is widely blamed for the president's death.</p>

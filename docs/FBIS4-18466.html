			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Conciliatory Tone in Midst of </F> Turmoil on the Right"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 5 -- The Northern League  visionary, Senator Gianfranco Miglio, sounded a conciliatory  note today following the harsh exchange yesterday between Silvio  Berlusconi of Forza Italia and League leader Umberto Bossi, the  major beneficiaries of the shift to the right in last week's  general elections.    Miglio explained that Bossi, "within the League, has always  used harsh language, violent. But he has often followed attacks  by hugs," declared the senator who said he was optimistic that  Bossi and Berlusconi would patch things up.    On federalism, the leading item on the League's agenda,  Miglio said, "Difficulties are derived from our firmness on the  federal constitution. And on this there is a difference between  us and Fini," Gianfranco Fini, the head of the neo-Fascist  National Alliance holding up one end of the Berlusconi-led  Freedom Front.    "And Berlusconi is in the middle," the man considered the  architect of League theory said. "We want iron-clad guarantees  on the launch of the skeleton of a federal constitution within  90 days."    After having said he was confident of a future "embrace"  between Bossi and Berlusconi, Miglio warned that these gestures  are always "very relative" in politics. "What counts are  relations of loyalty to commitments taken on, not loving  relationships."    On the problem of government formation, one which has been  keeping political observers guessing since the general election  tally was completed, the senator said, there is no majority in  the new Parliament "without Fini. Nor is there one without us.  And we cannot go back. We have our shoulders to the wall  because without the federalist project, the League has no sense  and there will be no move on to the Second Republic."    On Bossi's talk of extending dealings to the parties in the  center and the left which provoked Berlusconi's anger, Miglio  linked the League leader's meetings with Mario Segni, whose Pact  for Italy sent a dozen MPs to the Lower House, and the  Progressive camp's Democratic Alliance, to a bid to re-write the  constitution of 1948.    "It's not true that this is a betrayal of the will of the  voters," he said to counter Berlusconi's objection. "The 49  percent represented by the opposition is not dead. Bossi is  doing the right thing in listening to them on a new  constitution," he added.</p>

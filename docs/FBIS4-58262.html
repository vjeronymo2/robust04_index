			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive report"] </F>   [Text] Even with the fabricated atmosphere permeating  Jordanian-U.S. meetings, and the less-than-warm statements about  relations, the United States continues to harbor a grudge  against Jordan and expresses dissatisfaction with its pan-Arab  policy. The United States is also playing a decisive role in  maintaining the estrangement between Jordan and Saudi Arabia.  It wants to confuse Jordan's stands and to foil its initiatives  and policies.    The reason for all this is that the United States still  insists that Jordan supplied Iraq with information about  coalition forces during the Gulf war and that it was, and still  is, an outlet supplying Iraq with its needs, despite the unjust  embargo.    The United States continues to tighten the siege on the Port  of al-'Aqabah in order to cause more harm to the Jordanian  economy, in retaliation for the Jordanian masses' stands in  support of Iraq -- stands that continued to escalate and  nurtured a sense of hostility in the Jordanian arena against the  United States's positions.    Political analysts say that during every meeting with  Jordan,  the United States asks questions about the Gulf war, attempting  to confirm its doubts and statements. By interfering in  Jordan's relations with Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia, it tries  to isolate Jordan and its positions from any Arab support.    Jordan has confirmed to the United States that these  accusations are untrue and that its role during the Gulf was  only a moral one.    The Israeli claim that Jordan accommodates Hamas leaders is  the second stage of the U.S.-Israeli conspiracy aimed at  creating a state of instability in Jordan. Jordan condemned  such interference in its domestic affairs, saying it does not  allow anyone to impose a mandate or a decision on it because  this constitutes an encroachment on its sovereignty and violates  its stands.    The Americans tried several times to twist Jordan's arm by  various means of intimidation and temptation for the purpose of  singling Jordan out. However, despite all its suffering, Jordan  has rejected these demands and maintained its firm pan-Arab  stand toward Palestine and the Gulf war.</p>

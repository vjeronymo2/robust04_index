			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / French shipyard confirms Swan bid Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie, the French shipbuilder, last night confirmed it intends to make an offer to buy Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipyard which has been in receivership since May, Chris Tighe writes. The French company recently beat Swan Hunter in the fight for a Pounds 50m Oman patrol boats order. Mr Fred Henderson, chairman of English subsidiary CMN Support Services, said: 'We intend to make an offer subject to the preconditions being sorted out.' He added: 'We would hope to largely continue the present workforce.' He could not give any indication of the value of the bid. Mr Henderson said good progress had been made in two days of talks in identifying and clearing the many outstanding matters which needed to be resolved, including legal points on the transfer of undertakings. A programme had been agreed to address these issues. He hoped an offer would be made before the end of March.</p>

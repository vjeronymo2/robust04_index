			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLOTHESLINES  </P> <P> Question: I'm tempted to buy one of the new shearlings, especially the Donna  Karan jacket with the drawstring at hips and hem. Please tell me more about  shearling. How does it differ from sheepskin? -- L.A.N.  </P> <P> Answer: Here's a sketch of Karan shearling, and some care information from  leather expert Clifford Olson of Positano Leathers. Shearling is taken from the  first shearing of a yearling, and the skins are tanned with the wool on. Treat  the suede side of shearling like any suede, advises Olson, suggesting that a  good brushing with a plastic-bristle brush will revive tired and/or worn skins.  If you get a spot, he says to use a suede eraser such as Tana's Nubuck Block.  The fur side of your shearling won't show the dirt as much as the suede side,  and when it does, dry cleaning is not as dangerous as with suede or leathers.  "Dry cleaners much prefer cleaning shearling," says Olson, "because it causes  fewer problems than either leather or suede. Karan's shearling is available by  special order at Saks Fifth Ave.  </P> <P>  Luther, a freelance fashion journalist, welcomes questions from readers.

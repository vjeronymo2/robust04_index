			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Commission attacks UK stance on waste water law The European Commission yesterday hit back at UK demands to postpone implementation of a Euro-law on cleaning up sewage water pollution, claiming that Britain had not done its homework on costs, and was trying to shift blame onto Brussels for expenditure it would have to make anyway. Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer, told EU finance ministers on Monday that Britain was seeking a longer phasing in of the waste water treatment directive as part of a campaign to review, and in some cases repeal, EU laws which impose costs hindering competitiveness. Mr Clarke maintained that the cost of implementing the waste water directive would be Pounds 10.5bn (Dollars 15.6bn), or five-times more than originally thought, although he admitted that the UK Department of the Environment was responsible for the miscalculation. But yesterday, Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the EU environment commissioner, queried Britain's figures and motives in launching its attack on the waste water directive. The British government has a habit of shifting blame onto Europe, he said yesterday, but this is 'a debate between them and the British people'. 'Before complaining, the British government should do its homework more carefully,' he added. Mr Clarke, was 'either misinformed,' Mr Paleokrassas said, 'or he has some other motives which have nothing to do with the waste water directive.' Other EC officials and diplomats present at Monday's meeting believe Mr John Major's Conservative government is concerned about passing on rising water costs in south-west England, which could effect its slim electoral majority. The UK claims the directive will add Pounds 525 to average household water bills in 1995-2000, and a further Pounds 12 in between 2000 and 2005, by which time its provisions should be fully implemented. The current average for water bills is Pounds 193, Whitehall says. Mr Clarke said on Monday that EU finance ministers should have closer oversight of all Euro-laws which placed new cost burdens on industry. Mr Paleokrassas, a former Greek finance minister, argued yesterday that: The waste water directive, along with all other directives to clean up European drinking and bathing water, had been passed unanimously by the 12, with UK assent. The UK to date has presented four different sets of figures: the original Pounds 2bn estimate; a 1989 figure of Pounds 7bn-8bn; Mr Clarke's Pounds 10.5bn; and an additional Pounds 27bn to maintain and improve the sewage system, which the UK acknowledges has nothing to do with the directive. The commissioner said UK water costs were anyway well below EU averages, and that the jump in costs was due to the privatised water boards passing on the investment costs immediately rather than taking advantage of the directive's greater flexibility.</p>

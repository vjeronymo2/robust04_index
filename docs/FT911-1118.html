			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / HDTV strategy 'still faces hurdles' INDUSTRY agreement on a European Community strategy for high-definition television (HDTV) may be more fragile than the European Commission has suggested, according to EC satellite operators and broadcasters. Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi, the technology commissioner, claimed last month that broadcasters, satellite operators and the electronics industry had reached 'agreement in principle' on an EC strategy. Yesterday the five commissioners responsible for audiovisual policy debated the framework for a consortium which would promote wide-screen HDTV services in Europe. This consensus approach would be combined with new European legislation which the Commission wants to put to telecommunications ministers next month. Although progress has been made by feuding industry factions, participants say important hurdles remain. 'There is a reasonably high degree of optimism that on Monday (when interest groups meet for more discussions on the issue) we will be in a position to make some significant further progress,' said one broadcaster yesterday. 'But it isn't correct to say that the deal is done.' In particular, broadcasters and satellite operators like Societe Europeenne des Satellites, which runs the Astra satellite used by British Sky Broadcasting, are worried that the Pal standard they use will be phased out in favour of an intermediate HDTV standard, D2-Mac. Satellite groups and commercial broadcasters prefer the option of simultaneous broadcasting in Pal and D2-Mac, leading to the eventual introduction of a full HDTV standard, known as HD-Mac. However, electronics groups such as Thomson of France, which has invested heavily in HDTV technology, are concerned that simultaneous broadcasting may lead to technical problems with satellite capacity. Last month's drafts of the framework for establishing a consortium suggested interest groups had agreed 'the D2-Mac standard offers the best path towards the development of HDTV with (wide-screen) D2-Mac as the main step in that direction'. Satellite operators fear that if they sign such an agreement, commissioners will interpret it as a mandate to introduce compulsory D2-Mac in the draft HDTV directive. Attempts are being made to revive Eurosport, the satellite television sports channel that went off the air yesterday, writes Raymond Snoddy. It collapsed after attempts to find Pounds 60m from new investors failed before last Friday's deadline. The Eurosport consortium brought together 17 of Europe's public service broadcasters. Mr Alan Hart, Eurosport chairman, said yesterday that there was still a consortium 'and we will do all we can to keep the concept alive'.</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Property: Watchdog sees room for change - The estate agents' ombudsman tells Gerald Cadogan how conveyancing could be improved Estate agents can never take too much time to make sure both sellers and buyers understand the processes, and the implications of each step, in transferring property. That is the view of David Quayle, the Ombudsman for the Corporate Estate Agents (OCEA): 'It is my job to remove misunderstanding.' This group of agents - made up either of public limited companies or those owned by banks, building societies and insurance companies - is known best for its monthly index of activity in the property market. The index is based on data from more than 4,000 offices. Quayle finds the Scots are clearer about how their system works than the rest of the UK, where he is eager to re-open the debate about the procedures for transfer. 'We need a satisfactory system for the next century,' he adds. A retired major-general, who served with the British Army on the Rhine and was once military attache in Bonn, Quayle has an office in Salisbury, Wiltshire. Last year, it received 2,340 initial inquiries, of which 1,375 were outside his terms of reference - mainly because the agents involved were not members of the OCEA. But 965 cases did come within his remit. The chief complaints usually concerned matters of maladministration, professional misjudgment, or breakdown in communications. But Quayle admits: 'My work load is nothing like that of the ombudsmen for the building societies and the insurance industry.' To be considered by Quayle, the complainant must first raise the matter with the agency he considers at fault and work through its complaints procedure. If not satisfied, he can then turn to the ombudsman. Of 198 cases closed by Quayle last year, he found against the agencies in 71. Awards, which are binding, were mostly in the Pounds 100 to Pounds 499 range, although the highest was Pounds 5,500 (capped recently by one of Pounds 13,000). The awards do not bind the complainant, though; he can still go to law if he wants. They are not intended to be punitive, either. What they offer is some recompense, mostly for the inconvenience, when buying or selling has gone wrong through no fault of the client. In best army fashion, Quayle administers pragmatic but fair justice. In the 3 1/2 years of the scheme, he says only three or four cases have shown deliberate malpractice. More typical are those when an agent has failed to pass on a new offer to a seller because something has gone wrong in the office. With so much of the work now done by computer it is easy for matters to be overlooked if they have not been logged in. Either that, or the nuances of agentspeak - which are important as they reflect more subtly than a computer the progress of a sale - may be missed altogether. Quayle says the times when it is crucial that all is made clear are instruction (for the seller), offer (for the buyer), and acceptance subject to contract (for both). The agent must be explicit that either party can withdraw until exchange of contract. On gazumping, Quayle points out that it is not the agent who gazumps but the seller. By law, the agent must pass on all offers. When the seller decides to break an agreement, the agent takes the flak from the aggrieved underbidder. He makes little extra money in commission and his reputation is damaged. The ombudsman can do little except try to ensure that agents in general perform to the best standards and have high-quality paper/computer work. Quayle is eager for a change to the habit of asking for 'best and final' offers. They are fine, he says, if they really are final. But, often, they are not, as in repossessions when a mortgagee might succumb to a higher offer after bidding has seemed to close. Quayle proposes that sellers should ask for best offers by a certain day, and not indulge in spurious finality. He also sees a future in lock-out agreements, where the buyer makes the offer only if the seller agrees not to break it for another offer during a specified period (while contracts are prepared and exchanged). This can ease the usual worrying time of uncertainty for both sides. In 1993 more buyers made initial inquiries to the ombudsman than sellers but the latter predominated in cases he closed. And he found more often for the agency (106 cases) last year than the complainant. Often, sellers did not want to pay the agency fee. 'They were in dire straits, and looked for every way possible to reduce their bills,' says Quayle. He would first see what was due, and then whether the service given merited an award to the complainant. Quayle feels it is time to think again of a system in England and Wales where surveys and mortgages are all settled before an offer is made and accepted. This happens in Scotland. But a frequent objection there is that this makes for unnecessary and expensive surveys before buyers find what they want. Quayle counters that the Scots know they are spending risk money; it is considered part of the game. In England, though, buyers view a place as their new house the moment their offer is accepted - subject to contract and survey, of course. He says conveyancing could be speeded if solicitors acting for sellers started the searches, and if all houses had a log book (as do some new houses and Anglican churches) - a move proposed by the chairman of the OCEA council, Lady Mallalieu. Quayle also urges buyers to start their mortgage inquiries before they even offer. 'Find out what the building society will give on the basis of income, and then you know what you can afford,' he says. That would cut delay and help the seller, who would know that the buyer was likely to complete. These suggestions show that the property market needs more openness and consideration for the other party. That would do wonders for the often abysmal public esteem for estate agents, and might even produce better prices if buyers and sellers took it on themselves to start the legal and financial investigations well ahead of the decisions on what to buy or whom to sell it to. Perhaps such changes will come only through legislation. In the meantime, Quayle says the OCEA scheme is improving the quality of estate agencies and their public esteem. He champions clear English and encourages young recruits to the business to take the National and Scottish Vocational Qualifications in estate agency. All power to his elbow.

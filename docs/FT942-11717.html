			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper price rise forecast Copper is benefiting from rising European demand, analysts suggest, and prices should be sharply up in the last quarter of 1994. The market may see a supply deficit of 225,000 tonnes this year and of 350,000 tonnes in 1995, according to Mr Fred Demler, analyst with the ED &amp; F. Man commodities group. 'This builds a case for volatile and rising prices, despite the large increase in primary output (expected) in 1995,' he adds. Man in its latest metals markets review is forecasting copper prices averaging 95 cents a pound in the final quarter of this year. Merrill Lynch is even more bullish and says Dollars 1 a pound is 'not an unreasonble objective' while 83 cents seems to be the bottom of the trading range. Merrill says in its Weekly Futures Report that the second quarter could see some prices weakness develop but so far 'demand from Europe has taken some of the pressure off the inevitable slowing of US demand. We believe that the potential correction in copper prices will not be as great as some are anticipating'. European copper consumption rose about 4 per cent above late-1993 levels at the begining of this year, Bloomsbury Minerals Economics points out in its Copper Briefing Services. The turn-round in the automotive industries of the UK, France and Spain was the most important factor. Mr Peter Hollands of BME says that the most important source of uncertainty is China. However, he guesses that light Chinese selling may occur every time the copper price nears 90 cents and there may be speculative buying when it falls below 85 cents. 'Two-way Chinese trade might keep the price within a fairly narrow range for some time,' he adds Nevertheless, BME suggests the copper price will bottom out at 83 to 85 cents in the next few weeks, then will trend slowly upwards through October to about 90 cents and 'thereafter there looks likely to be scope for rapid price increases towards Dollars 1 a pound'.</p>

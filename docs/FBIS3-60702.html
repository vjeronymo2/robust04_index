The  main force behind the Pressler Amendment will have met the prime  minister and the foreign minister by the time this editorial is  published. Meanwhile, the U.S. ambassador also called on Prime  Minister Bhutto yesterday and expressed the hope that the U.S.  aid to Pakistan would be resumed. During the meeting, the prime  minister made it clear that Pakistan has the right to defend  itself and it will definitely not roll back its nuclear program.    The U.S. senator's delegation has arrived in Pakistan at a  time when the country is in the midst of debates and discussions  on the nuclear issue. The visit assumes great significance in  view of the fact that the United States not only suspended aid  to Pakistan on the pretext of the nuclear program, but also  resorted to the practice of harassing it. The visit is also  significant in view of the impression being created by  governmental circles that the present government will be able to  restore U.S. aid without any ``compromise'' on the nuclear  program; while the opposition is saying that the government has  bowed to the U.S. conditions and that is why the aid is going to  be restored. Unaware of the reality, the people are wondering  whether to believe in what the present prime minister is saying  or to accept as true the allegation by the former prime minister.    Confusion prevails even about Pakistan's nuclear program  itself. India and the United States insist that we have crossed  the red light. But our responsible figures are terming it as  ``[word indistinct].'' A statement by former foreign minister  Agha Shahi was published in today's newspapers in which he  claimed that Pakistan's nuclear program has been frozen.  However, General Mirza Aslam Beg, the former chief of the army  staff, while acknowledging the freezing of the program, has  simultaneously claimed that Pakistan had acquired the  weapon-manufacturing capability in 1987.    When people in responsible positions are not consistent in  their statements, it naturally creates confusion. However, the  main thing is the national interest. It has become evident from  the debates held so far on the nuclear issue that our nuclear  program is an inevitable necessity so far as the national  security is concerned. And if we have so far been able to  protect ourselves from Indian aggression, it is due mainly to  the nuclear deterrent. It is a ``peaceful'' program in the sense  that it provides a guarantee for peace and against war in this  subcontinent.    We should clearly tell the United States and its delegated  envoys that we have acquired the nuclear capability for peaceful  purposes. And since we have acquired it through our own  resources, it is therefore not possible for us to accept any  conditions on it. How can the countries which went to extremes  to restrain us from having a peaceful program--and tried to  punish us by stopping economic and military aid--have the right  to dictate to us on our nuclear program? As our program is  aimed at securing peace and ending aggression, we will be ready  to accept any reasonable proposal. Hoever, that will be only  when India signs the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, accepts  the world body's resolutions on all disputes, including the  Kashmir issue, and implements them.    It is India which is the root cause of the disturbances in  this region. No neighboring country can remain complacent about  its defense unless India shuns its oppressive designs. The  present government will do a service to the nation if it  succeeds in convincing Pressler and his companions of Pakistan's  nuclear stand. We hope that Pressler is not visiting Pakistan to  force this country to accept his conditions, but to end the  present coldness in Pakistan-U.S. relations and to attain a  realistic perception of the problems and difficulties being  faced by Pakistan. We also hope that he will return to  Washington satisfied.</p>

			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> No More Mural for Cos: Bill Cosby has removed a colorful mural shown during the  opening title credits of "The Cosby Show" in a dispute with a teacher whose  Harlem students inspired the artwork. The snit involves a mural painted on a  Harlem building by children at the Creative Arts Workshop for Homeless Children  and a similar painting shown on the top-rated NBC series.  </P> <P> Workshop director Brookie Maxwell said that the children who painted the  original should get credit on the TV show and be paid if the idea is marketed.  NBC spokeswoman Rosemary O'Brien said that two months of negotiations between  the workshop and the show's producer, Carsey-Werner Co., failed when Maxwell  "threatened" Cosby on Tuesday. Cosby released this statement on Wednesday: "I  am deeply disappointed in that I had such high hopes for raising the spirits of  the children with this mural. This would have been something that for another  10 years they could have pointed to with pride in that this was something they  inspired." Viewers tonight( will see revised opening credits with footage used  last season. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN SHOT TO DEATH AT MEDICAL CLINIC AFTER REPEATED THREATS FROM HUSBAND  </P> <P> A woman who told a friend that her estranged husband was going to kill her was  shot to death in a Santa Fe Springs medical clinic Thursday, authorities said.  </P> <P> Although several witnesses identified the gunman as the husband, Los Angeles  County sheriff's investigators said only that they were seeking a "male family  member" in the slaying.  </P> <P> The 35-year-old victim, who was shot several times in the torso, died shortly  after arrival at a nearby hospital, deputies said. They released no other  details of the shooting.  </P> <P> Carmen Semidey, an employee of the clinic and a longtime friend of the victim,  said the gunman walked into the facility shortly before noon and demanded from  the woman that he be allowed to see their 6-month-old son. After a short  argument, he pulled out a handgun, shot the victim once and paused until she  fell to the ground, then shot her again several times, Semidey said.  </P> <P> "It was too fast there was not much I could do," she said.  </P> <P> Semidey, office manager of the clinic in the 10000 block of Orr &amp; Day Road,  said her friend had been estranged from her husband since discovering two  months ago that he had another wife. The victim, who had custody of the  6-month-old son, had been living with different friends until about two weeks  ago, Semidey said, and had been asked to leave by various hosts because of the  possible danger posed by the husband.  </P> <P> The woman and her child spent a night on the streets before turning to Semidey,  who said she consoled the victim through several periods of marital turbulence.  </P> <P> Semidey said she took the woman in and gave her $300 to hire a lawyer. The  victim was planning to obtain a restraining order on grounds of emotional and  physical abuse, Semidey said, but the petition had not been filed.  </P> <P> Semidey said the husband tracked the woman and continued to harass her during  the two months of estrangement.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, the husband found the woman at Semidey's home and for the  two days preceding the shooting, the couple discussed how they could "work  things out," Semidey said.  </P> <P> Semidey said the wife was trying to divide the couple's belongings and get the  husband to leave her alone. The woman wanted to take the child and separate  from the husband "without violence," Semidey said.  </P> <P> Before Semidey left for work on Thursday, the woman spoke anxiously about her  husband's most recent threat to kill her, Semidey said.  </P> <P> Times staff writer John H. Lee contributed to this story.  </P></p>

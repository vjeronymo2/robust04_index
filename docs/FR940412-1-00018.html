			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (f) At no time shall an active welding rod or an uninsulated welding lead be allowed to contact the scaffold or its suspension system.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (b) above addresses suspension scaffolds with hoists but does not specifically address non-adjustable suspension scaffolds (i.e., scaffolds that do not have hoists). The Agency believes that employees performing welding operations from non-adjustable suspension scaffolds are exposed to the same or similar hazards as those faced by employees on adjustable suspension scaffolds. Accordingly, the Agency seeks public comment on the following issues:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Should OSHA require that wire ropes on non-adjustable suspension scaffolds from which employees are performing welding operations be insulated to a height above the scaffold sufficient to prevent accidental contact between the ropes and an active welding rod or an uninsulated welding lead? If so, what should that height be?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Should OSHA require that an insulated thimble or equivalent be used to attach each suspension wire rope to the platform of a non-adjustable suspension scaffold used for welding operations?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. What other measures should OSHA require for the protection of employees performing welding from suspended scaffolds?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Incorporation of Dockets S&hyph;205, S&hyph;205A, and S&hyph;205B (Part 1926, Subpart L, Scaffolds Used in the Construction Industry) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On November 25, 1986, the Agency proposed to update the requirements for protection of employees on scaffolds used in construction (part 1926, subpart L, 51 FR 42680). The public record on scaffolds used in construction was reopened on March 29, 1993 (58 FR 16509), and again on February 1, 1994 (59 FR 4615). The proposed construction industry requirements for scaffolds were generally consistent with those proposed for shipyards in 1988. The construction proposal and the two notices of limited reopening generated public input which OSHA is considering as the Agency drafts the final rule for scaffolds covered by part 1926, subpart L. Many of those materials contain relevant information or raise scaffold-related concerns not yet addressed in the comments on part 1915, proposed subpart N. The Agency believes that, in developing separate standards for the construction industry (part 1926) and for the shipyard industry (part 1915), the substance of those standards should be consistent, except where there are demonstrable differences in scaffold use which would justify differences in coverage. Therefore, OSHA has determined that the Agency needs to consider the information generated in the subpart L rulemaking when the Agency drafts the final rule for scaffolds in the shipyard industry. In addition, OSHA notes that Docket S&hyph;205B also contains scaffold-related materials from the proposed general industry standard for walking and working surfaces (Docket S&hyph;041, part 1910, subpart D) and an August, 1993, NIOSH study of construction-related fatalities titled Fatal Injuries to Workers in the United States, 1980&hyph;1989: A Decade of Surveillance. In order to assure that those relevant materials are considered by both the Agency and the public as they relate to scaffold use in shipyards, OSHA is incorporating pertinent exhibits from the construction industry rulemaking record (Dockets S&hyph;205, S&hyph;205A, and S&hyph;205B) into the part 1915, subpart N rulemaking (Docket S&hyph;047). All the materials incorporated from subpart L will be identified in the subpart N docket as Exhibit 8, with attachments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> J. Costs, Benefits, and Technological Feasibility <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the regulatory analysis accompanying the proposed rule published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on November 29, 1988, the Agency identified three provisions that would impose compliance burdens: (1) Requiring scaffolds to be no more than 14 inches from the vertical work area unless there was a guardrail or body belt employed; (2) prohibiting the use of ladders on top scaffolds; (3) forbidding workers to ride on mobile scaffolds unless the surface to be driven over was free of hazards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency requests comments from the shipyard industry about the costs of these provisions, other provisions in the original proposed rule, and the issues raised in this notice, especially the use of interior hung scaffolds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to update the rulemaking record, the Agency solicits information regarding: (1) The annual number of accidents (especially falls) that occur while workers are engaged in erecting or working on scaffolds; (2) the annual number of workers injured; (3) the severity of injuries; and (4) the causes of accidents. OSHA also solicits comments regarding the extent to which shipyard scaffold accidents will be avoided by complying with the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency also requests comments, with supporting information, about the technological feasibility of applying the proposed standard, including the alternatives set out in this notice, to the shipyard industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II.

Four copies of these comments must be submitted to the Docket Office, Docket No. S&hyph;047A, U.S. Department of Labor, room N&hyph;2625, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210.

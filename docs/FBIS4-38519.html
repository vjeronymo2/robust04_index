			<p>BFN     [Text] Simferopol, May 30, RIA -- Despite the political  situation in Crimea, the security service operated by Kiev and  locally subordinated Interior Ministry structures are working  hand in glove to ensure legality and law and order, Valeriy  Malikov, first deputy chairman of the Ukrainian Security  Service, told a RIA correspondent.    The services are cooperating above all in combating  organised  crime.    There is also close cooperation between the security  service,  the Interior Ministry and specialists of the Black Sea Fleet in  the investigation of a case involving an attempt to carry out a  blast in Sevastopol on May 24.    Criminal proceedings have been instituted against Veniamin  Demin, a suspect, but he continues to deny his guilt.    In Malikov's view, there are no problems between members of  his department and the Interior Ministry in Crimea.    "If professionals were less distracted into political  wrangles, their work would be more productive," he said.    The most important thing for the security service and the  Interior Ministry in Crimea now is to solve legal questions --  eliminate contradictions in legislative standards of Crimea and  Ukraine.</p>

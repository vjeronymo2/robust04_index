			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> INEVITABLE PROCESS  </P> <P> The commentary expressed by Al Ducheny and Robert Tambuzi, "Who Can Best Lead  The Disenfranchised?" (July 23) is highly illustrative of the dilemmas faced by  any individual or group of individuals who seek any type of change in  marginalized communities.  </P> <P> Yet I don't think the authors were fair with the black and Chicano leadership  in San Diego. These leaders know that if they fail to dance according to the  system's tune, they will lose funds their communities need in order to keep  from sinking into even further deterioration.  </P> <P> I agree with the authors that "we cannot defer political leadership to  providers of services, who by nature must be in good graces with the standing  administration in order to be funded," but as long as our people continue to be  trapped in the vicious cycle of broken and unloving homes, deficient and  overcrowded schools, high dropout levels among our culturally confused and  alienated youth, unemployment, unwed motherhood, welfare and crime, what other  viable alternatives exist?  </P> <P> Bureaucratization and subsequent exclusion are not only the province of  governmental intrusion; these features are also found in community planning  groups run by business and religious organizations. It seems to be an  inevitable process of human interaction.  </P> <P> In an imperfect world, in which effective leadership is seldom accompanied by  sainthood, members of underrepresented ethnic groups must learn to live with  both the limitations and advantages of seeking leadership and, if possible, try  to speak with our own individual voices for the defense of our own interests.  </P> <P> RAMON OCEGUERA  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

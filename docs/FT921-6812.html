			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / International Company News: Setback for electronics groups THREE leading Japanese electronics groups yesterday announced sharp downward revisions in profit forecasts for the current year ending March. Matsushita Electric Industrial, Hitachi, and Oki Electric Industry became the latest companies to issue warnings of lower earnings due to a worsening market for semiconductors, computers, communication equipment and consumer electronics products. The announcements follow the spate of downward earnings revisions by other large Japanese companies such as NEC and Fujitsu. Sony, the consumer electronics and entertainment group, said last week its parent company would post a full-year operating loss for the first time since it was listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1958. Japanese electronics-makers have suffered from falling semiconductor prices, especially of the 4 megabyte D-Ram chip. Intensifying competition in the computer market has squeezed profits from the US and European markets. In Japan, the stock market slump has prompted financial institutions and brokers to cut back or postpone investments in computer network systems. The strength of the yen against the dollar has also contributed to the fall in profits. Matsushita said consolidated pre-tax profits for the year to March would fall 43 per cent from a year ago, to Y340bn (Dollars 2.65bn), 26.6 per cent lower than it forecast three months ago. Overall sales were revised downward to a 12 per cent rise to Y7,360bn, down from a 14 per cent increase, and after-tax profits are expected to decline a year-on-year 49 per cent to Y130bn. Matsushita said its financial balance sheet would deteriorate due to a decline in funds for management due to the squeeze on profits. It expected a foreign exchange loss of Y60bn, and added that depreciation costs for MCA would total some Y20bn. The company also released dismal third-quarter results. Consolidated pre-tax profits fell 32 per cent to Y125bn on a 12 per cent rise in sales to Y2,005bn. After-tax profits fell 38 per cent to Y52.4bn. Hitachi, announcing its second downward revision for the current year, projected a 37 per cent decline in consolidated pre-tax profits to Y355bn. The company expected sales to remain flat at Y7,700bn. Oki Electric Industry said it was hard hit by sluggish demand from banks and securities houses for its information processing equipment, the company's main product. Oki said a sharp fall in domestic demand had hurt its profitability. The company forecasted a 91.1 per cent drop in consolidated pre-tax profits to Y2bn, on a 1.4 per cent rise in sales to Y670bn. After-tax profits are expected to plunge 95 per cent to Y500m.</p>

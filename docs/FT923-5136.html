			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Ukraine clash over need to import grain A STRUGGLE erupted yesterday within the Ukrainian government over grain, Ukraine's most precious commodity. A deputy minister announced that Ukraine would buy 5m tonnes of grain from abroad. But the republic's agriculture minister almost immediately contradicted him, saying Ukraine would export grain and accusing corrupt groups in the government of trying to profit through foreign contracts. At a news conference earlier in the day, Mr Valentyn Lytvyn, deputy minister of bread products, whose ministry is responsible for ensuring the government has enough grain, announced a plan to buy 5m tonnes of foreign grain, despite an above average harvest. Later, however, Mr Vasyl Tkachuk, agriculture minister, claimed the republic had enough to export. Mr Tkachuk, a recently appointed reformist minister, believes pressure to buy grain abroad is inspired by corrupt groups in the government. Experts are forecasting an excellent harvest of more than 45m tonnes. However, the government has had problems meeting its grain quotas because farmers are either selling their grain on commodities markets or keeping it for their own livestock rather than offering it to the government at low state prices. Thus, the government has managed to purchase only 10m tonnes of the 17m it considers necessary.</p>

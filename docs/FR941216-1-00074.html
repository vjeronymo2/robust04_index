The contractor may choose to correct the deficiencies immediately, submit a written letter of intent to correct the deficiencies (which will become binding if awarded the contract), or request acceptance of specifically identified existing conditions or facilities by the purchasing activity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) When the contractor cannot comply with the mandatory safety provisions of the contract, the contractor shall develop and submit a request for a waiver through the ACO to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) for final determination. The request shall contain complete information concerning the requirements violated, actions planned to minimize the hazard, and a proposed date for correction of the deficiency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Site and construction plans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Development and submission of site plans, modifications, construction, and utility drawings pertaining to DoD-owned facilities shall be processed in accordance with the requirements of DoD Directive 6055.9, <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  as implemented by the applicable military service requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Copies may be obtained, at cost, from the National Technical Information Service, U.S. Department of Commerce, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) For contractor-owned, contractor-operated (COCO) facilities, the contractor shall submit, through the ACO to the PCO, site and construction plans for all new construction or major modification of facilities for ammunition and explosive activities and for the facilities that may be exposed to A&amp;E hazards if improperly located.

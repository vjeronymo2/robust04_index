According to Azerbaijani intelligence data, the arms and  military hardware are being flown from Sochi to Gyumri on board  military cargo planes. The same source says the Russian  military cargo planes are carrying out around 30 flights a day.    TURAN claims that Armenia has already received a few dozen  modern tanks from Russia. According to the news agency, the  arms dispatch was stepped up following Armenian defeats on the  battlefront.    As proof, TURAN cites an AFP correspondent in Armenia  claiming that officials in Yerevan are not hiding that the flow  of military hardware from Russia became possible after Yegor  Gaydar resigned; he was stingy about this.    In connection with untrue Azerbaijani press reports, a SNARK  reporter asked Seyran (Shakhbugaryan), the head of the Armenian  Defense Ministry Press Service, to comment on this issue.  (Shakhbugaryan) stated that the military cooperation between  Russia and Armenia is in line with the status of the Russian  troops in Armenia. Beyond that, no arms have ever or are being  dispatched.</p>

			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Letter: Simpler method of assessing council tax Sir, Mr Bradman (Letters, December 5) underestimates the problems householders face with the (in)equity of the council tax, and exaggerates the steps needed to improve it. The fact that the date for national valuation is April 1 1991 for everyone does not mean that everyone faces the same prospect of being in the wrong band. Since that date the proportion of properties in the Granada TV region falling into the A band has declined from 41.6 to 35.1 per cent; in the Thames TV region, the proportion has increased from 10.7 to 13.4 per cent. Even within the same area different types of property have behaved differently in price terms. The simplest way of assessing property tax, as we pointed out to the Treasury at the time, is to proportion payments to the number of rooms in the dwelling. This can readily be self-assessed (and would have saved millions of pounds of tax-payers' money had it been) and checked, and will not change unless the owner wishes it to. It has justice in that the over-crowded pay less than those with greater amenity, while most people will pay more or less in proportion to their demands on the services provided.

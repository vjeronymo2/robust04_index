			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: Inco considers unloading stake in TVX Gold INCO, the international nickel producer, is considering a sale or merger of its 62 per cent stake in TVX Gold, a Toronto-based gold and silver producer with interests in six mines in North and South America. At TVX's current share price of CDollars 4.90, Inco's stake is worth CDollars 407m (USDollars 318m). Inco has up to now shrugged off talk that it was seeking to unload its stake in TVX. But in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, it acknowledged it would 'explore potential transactions, including a merger, a public or private sale, or similar transaction'. Mr Eike Batista, TVX's chairman, holds a 13 per cent stake in the company. Inco said any sale 'may or may not' involve Mr Batista's shares. TVX Gold was formed in 1991 when Inco merged some of its gold mining interests with Consolidated TVX Mining. TVX Gold posted earnings of CDollars 10.4m last year on revenues of CDollars 152.4m. Its strengths include long-life reserve, modern facilities and low operating costs.</p>

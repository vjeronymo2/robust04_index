			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Maria Elena Gil: "Cuba and Grenada Normalize Bilateral </F> Relations"]    [Text] Havana, 12 Apr (PL) -- Another chapter of the Cold  War, which was brought over to the warm waters of the Caribbean  Sea, has just ended with the resumption of diplomatic relations  between Cuba and Grenada and the willingness of the two  governments to resume bilateral cooperation.    Concurrent [concurrente] Ambassador Lazaro Cabezas presented  his credentials to Governor General Sir Reginald Oswald Palmer  in St. George's on 5 April and held official discussions with  Nicholas Brathwaite, prime minister and foreign minister.    Cabezas, an ambassador stationed in Barbados and accredited  to five eastern Caribbean countries, told PRENSA LATINA during a  telephone interview that the reception in Grenada was  surprisingly friendly despite many years without diplomatic  relations.    "We felt all of Grenadian society recognizes the important  contribution Cuba made during the government of Maurice Bishop  (1979-1983) to the development of that small island," he said.    Government officials and professionals who studied in Cuba  told Cabezas of the importance of Cuba's contribution in  building the Point Salines International Airport, which has led  to an increase in tourism, the giving of advice to the fisheries  industry and health sector, and the offering of scholarships.    The Cuban diplomat said the governor general as well as  Brathwaite conveyed to him their gratitude for past assistance  and their interest in promoting new ties of cooperation, mainly  in the public health field. In a visit to explore means of  cooperation, the Cuban representative met with Phinsley St.  Louis, health, housing, and environment minister, and Shirley  Mcthlin, Foreign Ministry permanent secretary and law school  graduate from Santiago de Cuba University.    Cabezas also met with executives of the Grenada Chamber of  Commerce, whom he invited to participate in the meeting of  Caribbean businessmen scheduled for June in Santiago de Cuba.    In the VIP book of visitors to St. George's Government  House,  the Cuban ambassador left a written testimony of "this historic  day" during which Grenada and Cuba grew close again.    Bilateral relations reached their peak during the popular  revolutionary government of Maurice Bishop, who was ousted and  killed by a faction of his cabinet on 19 October 1983.    The United States launched a powerful military invasion  against the small island seven days later under the pretext of  rescuing U.S. citizens who were at St. George's.    The U.S. military occupation lasted a year and a half, and  bilateral relations were frozen during the government installed  under those circumstances.    Following the election of the current Grenadian Government,  Cuba stopped questioning its legality in international forums,  and Grenada lifted its objections of allowing Cuba into the  Caribbean Tourism Organization (CTO). All of these actions can  be considered a process of detente which culminated in the  acceptance of the new ambassador's credentials.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The expected change in total hospital service output is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the product of projected growth in total admissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (adjusted for outpatient usage), projected real case-mix  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> growth, and expected quality enhancing intensity growth, net  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of expected decline in intensity due to reduction of cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ineffective practice. Case-mix growth and intensity numbers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for Medicare are used as proxies for those of the total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital, since case-mix increases (used in the intensity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measure as well) are unavailable for non-Medicare patients.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, expected output growth is simply the product of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected change in intensity (0.0 percent), projected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> admissions change (3.2 percent for 1995) and projected real  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case-mix growth (1.0 to 1.4 percent for 1995), or 4.2 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.6 percent. The share of direct labor services in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital market basket rate of increase (consisting of wages  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and salaries and employee benefits) is 61.7 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Multiplying the expected change in total hospital service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> output by the ratio of historical service productivity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change to total service growth of 0.30 to 0.35 and by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direct labor share percentage provides our productivity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard of 0.8 to 1.0 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ProPAC also believes hospitals should be given an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incentive for additional productivity improvement. ProPAC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures productivity as the ratio of hospital admissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (adjusted for case mix and outpatient services) per FTE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employee (adjusted for changes in skill mix). ProPAC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes in its productivity measurement the effect of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes in practice patterns. We treat practice pattern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes as a portion of our intensity adjustment, described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below. This year, ProPAC assumes a productivity gain of at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least 1.4 percent and recommends a ^0.7 percentage point  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment on the basis that any productivity gains should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be shared equally by Medicare and hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Intensity <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : We base our intensity standard on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combined effect of three separate factors: changes in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of quality enhancing services, changes in the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services due to shifts in within-DRG severity, and changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the use of services due to reductions of cost-ineffective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practices. For 1995, we recommend an adjustment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.0 percent. The basis of this recommendation is discussed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have no empirical evidence that accurately gauges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the level of quality-enhancing technology changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Typically, a specific new technology increases costs in some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uses and decreases costs in other uses. Concurrently,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health status is improved in some situations while in other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situations it may be unaffected or even worsened using the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same technology. It is difficult to separate out the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relative significance of each of the cost-increasing effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for individual technologies and new technologies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The quality enhancing technology component is intended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to recognize the use of services which increase cost but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whose value in terms of enhanced health-status is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commensurate with these costs. Such services may result  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from technological change, or in some cases, increased use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of existing technologies. The latter recognizes that as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost and medical effectiveness studies become available,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some increased use of existing, as well as new, services may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The component for reduction of cost-ineffective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practice recognizes that some improvements in practice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patterns could be made so that the intensity of services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided is more consistent with the efficient use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited resources. That is, improvements could be made so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the number of services provided during an inpatient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stay, and their complexity, produce an improvement in health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> status that is consistent with the cost of care. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component of our update recommendation is intended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encourage both hospitals and physicians to more carefully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider the cost-effectiveness of medical care. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component of the framework also accounts for real within-DRG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change, since that should be directly reflected in the CMI-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjusted growth in real charges per case.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We note that, since 1985, the intensity of services per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inpatient admission has increased, even after adjusting for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the growth in real case mix each year. These increases,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which are similar to pre-prospective payment system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increases, followed intensity decreases in both 1984 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1985. Following methods developed by HCFA's Office of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Actuary for deriving hospital output estimates from total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital charges, ProPAC has estimated that case mix  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constant intensity per admission increased at an average of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.5 percent annually from 1985&hyph;1990. We have developed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare-specific intensity measures for inpatient services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on a five-year average using FY 1988&hyph;1993 MedPAR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> billing data. Consistent with ProPAC, case-mix constant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intensity is calculated as the change in total Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> charges per discharge adjusted for changes in the average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> charge per unit of service as measured by the Medical CPI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital component, and changes in real case-mix. Past  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> studies of case-mix change by the RAND Corporation indicate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the change in real case-mix ranges from 1.0 percent to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.4 percent per year. If we assume that real case-mix  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change is 1.4 percent per year, we estimate case-mix  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constant intensity to have declined by an average of 0.4  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent each year during the FY 1988&hyph;1993 period, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cumulative decrease of 2.1 percent. If we assume that real  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case-mix has been growing at 1.0 percent annually, case-mix  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constant intensity has declined by an average of 0.1 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annually, for a cumulative decrease of 0.6 percent. We note  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that regardless of which real case-mix number we assume (1.0  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or 1.4), we used the observed case-mix increase for FY 1993  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 0.8 percent to calculate the real case-mix constant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intensity. Since we estimate that intensity has declined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the FY 1988&hyph;1993 period, we are recommending a 0.0  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent intensity adjustment for FY 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

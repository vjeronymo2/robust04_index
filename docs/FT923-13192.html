			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / UK Company News: European sales rise helps Low &amp; Bonar improve to Pounds 11.8m LOW &amp; BONAR, the Dundee-based packaging and plastics company, yesterday announced a slight increase in interim profits, buoyed by European sales. At the pre-tax level they rose by 4.9 per cent to Pounds 11.8m. Mr Jim Leng, who is being promoted later this year from chief executive, Europe, to group chief executive, said the performance was due to improved productivity and better margins, stemming from cost cutting. Turnover for the six months to May 31 slipped to Pounds 151m (Pounds 152.2m) due to lower prices and a fall off in North American sales. Poor demand for industrial shipping sacks led to a pre-interest loss of Pounds 329,000 for the US packaging division, compared to a Pounds 311,000 profit a year ago. But European profits increased 20 per cent to Pounds 11m, despite difficult markets. Margins improved from 9 per cent to 10.6 per cent and the UK plastics division turned from a loss to a small profit. Profits before interest increased 5.6 per cent to Pounds 13.1m. Interest charges rose slightly to Pounds 1.24m (Pounds 1.1m), partly caused by the acquisition in May of a Dutch floorcovering company. Earnings increased 6.7 per cent to 9.39p and the interim dividend is a same-again 2.7p. The shares gained 4p to 281p. COMMENT After falling out of favour for 18 months, Low &amp; Bonar is finding its way back onto brokers' buy lists. The company's investment programme is starting to show fruits in terms of improved productivity. As the programme winds down, Low &amp; Bonar's capital expenditure to depreciation ratio is set to fall from 2 times in 1990 to about 1.5 this year. The market also likes the look of the new management. The one question mark hangs over US packaging, which will remain a loss-maker this year and will only really turn round when customers in the industrial and construction sectors see an improvement. The shares, like the rest of the sector, have already anticipated recovery, but forecast profits for the full year of Pounds 26m put Low &amp; Bonar on a multiple of 13.7, which is not demanding.</p>

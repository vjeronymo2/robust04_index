			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICK DU BROW: THRIVING IN HEAT OF ADVERSITY;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: DESPITE HEART BYPASS SURGERY AND THE PERSONAL PROBLEMS OF HIS  CO-STAR HOWARD ROLLINS, CARROLL O'CONNOR IS HAPPY IN HIS WORK.  </P> <P> Carroll O'Connor is sitting at a corner table in his Beverly Hills restaurant,  contemplating the past year. He's never been through anything like it.  </P> <P> "No, I certainly haven't," he says, shaking his head.  </P> <P> A year ago this month, O'Connor underwent heart bypass surgery at an Atlanta  hospital, a short drive from the Covington, Ga., set of his NBC series, "In the  Heat of the Night."  </P> <P> He recovered quickly, returned to the show and, instead of easing off,  increased his workload by taking over as co-executive producer.  </P> <P> The police series has also undergone another crisis in its two years on the air  as O'Connor's co-star, Howard Rollins, fought his own private battle, which  first came to light following his 1988 arrest in Louisiana for drug possession  and drunk driving.  </P> <P> O'Connor says he's "very fond" of the talented young actor, who, he adds, has a  "life's task" of recovery -- but is also a valuable partner on the show.  </P> <P> Despite this history of headaches, "In the Heat of the Night" powered into the  Top 10 programs in this week's national ratings -- an amazing survivor of a  chain of events that might have killed off another series.  </P> <P> O'Connor's dedication to the show, in which he plays a Southern police chief  and Rollins is his top detective, has been typically relentless.  </P> <P> "I'm satisfied we've turned in a good season in my first season as executive  producer (with Fred Silverman)," says O'Connor, 65. "But I'm not satisfied with  that. I think we can do even better."  </P> <P> He adds: "The only thing that was on my mind after last season, counting in the  operation and recuperation, was to get control of this series. And I wasn't  thinking of backing off or taking any rest or vacations."  </P> <P> The success of the program, which was renewed Wednesday for next season, has  finally given O'Connor a new image to replace his greatest role -- that of the  bigot Archie Bunker in "All in the Family."  </P> <P> But has the extra work been worth it? How's O'Connor feeling a year after the  surgery?  </P> <P> Digging into a luncheon salad at The Ginger Man restaurant, soon to be renamed  Carroll O'Connor's Place, the actor says:  </P> <P> "I'm glad to be able to tell all prospective heart patients that I feel better  than I did before the operation. I had six blockages that they bypassed, and  now the arteries are open. It's bound to make you feel better.  </P> <P> "I ride the stationary bicycle. When I was down in Georgia, I walked a  treadmill. Back home, I can go down to the beach in Malibu and walk. They told  me I didn't have to get into calisthenics. I don't walk as much as I should.  I've got to get with it more."  </P> <P> O'Connor's year to remember was full of highlights -- including one that  "delighted" him, a fifth Emmy Award for best leading actor, honoring him for  "In the Heat of the Night." He was also inducted into the TV academy's Hall of  Fame.  </P> <P> But his consuming passion, he says, has been the scripts for "In the Heat of  the Night." He writes some and "I've rewritten everything. You do not have the  freedom to do your best acting working with a piece of material in which you  have no belief, no confidence, because then you're bound up with inhibitions  and fear and you can't act.  </P> <P> "I know the first thing is your health. But assuming I wasn't going to devote  the rest of my life, or what's left, to making sure I get as many years as I  can -- once I said I'll keep working -- then the first priority was controlling  the series creatively. There was no sense in going on with it and not having  control because I simply would have had a heart attack in spite of the  bypasses, because the stress of doing things that you detest is indescribable.  It is for me. I just cannot live with something that I not only don't like, but  don't respect."  </P> <P> Following his successful surgery, O'Connor took out a Hollywood trade paper ad  humorously suggesting that he might be easier to get along with.  </P> <P> "A lot of executives in the business," he laughs, "have found me to be, to say  the least, a cranky fellow. So I was really saying to them that I was feeling  better and that I might be a more acceptable personality.  </P> <P> "We're back to the writing again. From the time I did 'All in the Family,' I've  always been very cranky about the material, and I used to get into bitter  arguments with writers, directors and producers, saying, 'This is wrong' or 'I  don't like this' or 'This is not funny.' And they'd become furious. I wasn't  always right. And I'm very sorry for losing my temper and being a boor during  'All in the Family.' "  </P> <P> Doing "In the Heat of the Night," says O'Connor, "I tend not to be a bully,  but" -- he admits -- "now and then I give way to temper and take up a bullying  stance, for which I'm sorry. It's all about material."  </P> <P> The material, plus the teaming of O'Connor and Rollins, has indeed worked  wonders in head-on competition with ABC's top-rated "Roseanne." In last week's  ratings, for instance, "Roseanne" drew 33% of the national audience while "In  the Heat of the Night" was a strong contender with 27%. In the past season, the  O'Connor-Rollins series cut "Roseanne's" advantage in total TV homes by 28%.  </P> <P> During their personal health tribulations while on the weekly one-hour program,  O'Connor and Rollins have expressed concern for each other's well-being. Each  missed several episodes because of their problems, Rollins just a few months  ago. O'Connor acknowledges that actors with problems can ask to leave a  project, but bristles at the notion that Rollins might not be back on the show  next season.  </P> <P> "First of all," says O'Connor, "I missed him professionally from the show.  Second of all, I missed him personally because I'm very fond of this man. He is  a very charming, endearing person. He's witty. He's fun. He's a very amiable  companion."  </P> <P> O'Connor says that he phoned his co-star several times when he was recovering  in a clinic during his recent absence.  </P> <P> "I'd just ask him, 'You want a report on what we're doing?' 'Yeah, tell me.'  I'd say, 'Well, we did this and this and this.' It's kind of silly to give  advice. A person is in a recovery place, he's getting advice from people and  suggestions and orders all day long. You spend about three or four minutes on  the phone. You try to be funny and cheerful and say, 'We love you and we miss  you.' "  </P> <P> During the past year, "In the Heat of the Night" almost seemed jinxed. In  addition to the problems of O'Connor and Rollins, Silverman also suffered a  heart attack, from which he, too, has recovered. "I have thought the very same  thing," says O'Connor. "We've had a lot of bad luck."  </P> <P> But now it's on to next season, and O'Connor says he no longer wants to spend  seven months a year on location in Georgia doing "In the Heat of the Night."  MGM-TV President David Gerber, Silverman and the actor are deciding on filming  plans, based on cost and how to retain the flavor of the show if some or most  of it is shot here.  </P></p>

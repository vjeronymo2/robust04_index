An official of the department said that exports from  Shanghai  amounted to 7.38 billion U.S. dollars for the whole of 1993.  The figure represented a nearly 13 percent rise over the year  before, exceeding the nation's average growth rate for the first  time in the previous 23 years.    The municipal government has decided to mobilize all  economic  sectors in Shanghai to expand exports, in a bid to spur the  city's economic growth in the new year, he said.    The manufacturing industry plans to increase exports by at  least 15 percent this year, he said.    To achieve the goal, local manufacturers will try to  increase  production of goods popular on the global market, particularly  new mechanical and electrical products.    Furthermore, the municipal government will do everything  within its power to expand production of 50 kinds of products  each with an annual export topping five million dollars, and aid  35 key manufacturers each exporting at least 20 million U.S.  dollars' worth a year, the official said.    Meanwhile, the Pudong New Area, where flexible policies are  being pursued to encourage Chinese and overseas investors, will  try to broaden its foreign markets by giving full scope to its  position as a free trade zone, he said.</p>

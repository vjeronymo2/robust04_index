			<p>BFN     [Text] London, 13 May (MENA) -- Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa  emphasized Egypt's deep interest in the need to reach a just  solution to the Bosnian problem. He called for lifting the  weapons embargo to Bosnia and denounced the behavior of the  forces that have been dealing with this problem but have not  been serious about finding a solution to it. He described the  crisis as a bad omen for the international community.    In a lecture he delivered today before the Royal British  Institute for Foreign Affairs (Chatham House), Musa said that  more complicated problems will arise in Central and Eastern  Europe if no solution is found to the Bosnian problem. He  criticized the international community's behavior on this issue  and condemned racial and sectarian discrimination in Bosnia.    'Amr Musa reiterated Egypt's stance, which calls for lifting  the embargo on weapons to Bosnia, noting that the Serbs are  getting weapons from Belgrade. He said that Egypt is ready to  provide troops within the framework of a relevant UN resolution.  He added: We in Egypt feel disappointed with the contradictory  actions of the international community in Bosnia. He stressed  the need to respect human rights there, adding that what is  happening in Bosnia is a test for the new world order.    In his lecture, which was attended by a number of Arab  ambassadors, the British ambassador in Egypt, and a number of  Middle East experts, the foreign minister referred to his visit  to South Africa. He said that South Africa is now in the stage  of change and that the nineties are important to all of us. He  added: The change taking place now has positive and negative  aspects. A new stage has also started in the Middle East  following the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. He said: We are  seeking to achieve a permanent settlement based on guaranteeing  the inalienable and political rights of everyone in the region  and are looking toward the post-settlement stage to achieve  development and prosperity. He noted that the achievement of  these objectives will come through cooperation between all  countries of the region.    Musa added that Egypt will continue its efforts to give  impetus to the peace process in the region, achieve peaceful  coexistence between all parties, and reach a just solution that  guarantees all the political rights of the parties involved. He  emphasized that the stage following the signing of the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement will require more efforts,  especially as there are still obstacles to peace.    He explained that Egypt is seeking to achieve an Israeli  withdrawal from the territories occupied in 1967, guarantee  security for all countries, and establish peaceful and normal  relations with Israel. He said: If all this is done, then the  Middle East region will be completely different.    The foreign minister said: Egypt has proposed the  establishment of a forum for the Mediterranean basin countries  to achieve cooperation between them and ensure that the Middle  East region will be completely free from weapons of mass  destruction on condition that all countries, including Israel,  comply. Then the economic growth desired by all countries in  the region will be achieved and the area will benefit from the  available resources and thus ensure a better future for their  peoples.    'Amr Musa, who is currently paying a visit to Britain, went  on to say that Egypt's objective is to ensure that the Middle  East is not isolated from the world but is interacting with its  peoples. He said: While the region is now preoccupied with the  peace process, it is also looking toward ending all the problems  surrounding it, such as the one in Bosnia. He stressed that the  situation in Bosnia does not differ much from the former state  of the Cold War. He added: The threat to peace in Bosnia and  the Balkans also is a threat to the Middle East and the  Mediterranean basin. We must open the doors for interaction  between the cultures of Europe, the Arab region, and the  Mediterranean basin. He said: We do not want to go back to the  Cold War era with all its challenges, hatreds, and  confrontations.    Musa noted that Egypt is interested in solving the problems  in Yemen, Sudan, and Iraq because his country is part of the  region, knows its responsibilities regarding these problems, and  earnestly seeks to achieve stability in the area. He pointed  out that as far as Yemen is concerned, Egypt seeks to contain  the current differences and crisis there.    Referring to the British policy, which he said he noted in  his current talks with senior British officials, Musa said that  Britain also wants to help achieve stability in the Middle East.  He also noted that Egypt is interested in steering the  Israeli-Palestinian talks in the right direction to achieve the  desired objectives. He pointed out that the confidence-building  process between the Arabs and Israel has already started but it  requires time. It also must come from both sides, not just from  the Arabs. Israel must work in that direction, too, he added.    Musa stressed that the peace process in the region is still  just beginning, since the negotiations between Israel and  Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon still remain. He noted that the Arab  boycott of Israel will be lifted, but at the appropriate time.    Musa noted that Egypt is concerned about the developments in  Algeria. He hoped that stability will be achieved in Algeria,  adding that the Algerian people are capable of establishing  stability. He noted that what is happening in Algeria does not  worry Egypt alone but all the countries in the region, the Arab  and Islamic worlds, and Europe. He urged helping Algeria emerge  from its current crisis.    Turning to Egyptian-Sudanese relations, Musa noted that  there  is a difference between the two governments over the two  countries' policies. He stressed that Egypt does not accept the  partitioning of Sudan.    On relations with Iran, Musa said that Egypt is concerned  with security in the Gulf and the need to prevent attempts to  export the Iranian revolution to other countries in the region.  He added: With the exception of these points, there is no  political antagonism between us and Iran. He called for Iran to  change the policies it follows regarding the Arab region.    Concerning the issue of Jerusalem, Musa said that it will be  part of the negotiations to be held at a later stage between  Israel and the Palestinians. He added: There is no reason to  object to the principle of negotiations over Jerusalem or  dividing it. The whole issue, he added, is negotiable between  the Palestinians and Israelis. He stressed that Jerusalem will  remain one city [madinah wahidah] and its status will be  discussed at a later stage in the negotiations.    Regarding the question of Iraq, Musa said that this issue is  very complicated. He added: There is only one key to the  crisis with Kuwait, namely, that Iraq recognizes Kuwait and that  the UN Security Council resolutions on this subject be  implemented. He stressed that Egypt does not accept the  partitioning of Iraq or anything that may jeopardize its  sovereignty and territorial integrity.    Concerning the situation in Lebanon, Musa said that things  are improving there and that the Lebanese Government is  extending its authority over Lebanese territory. He stressed  that Egypt is concerned with Lebanon's sovereignty and stability.    Regarding Lebanese-Syrian negotiations, Musa said that there  is a framework for negotiations and there are Security Council  Resolutions 242 and 425. He hoped that stability will be  restored in Lebanon and that the country will return its former  stability.</p>

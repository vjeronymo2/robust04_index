			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KID BEAT: 'CIRQUE DU L.A.' CELEBRATES IMAGINATION  </P> <P> Unlike that famous visiting Cirque from Canada, "Cirque du L.A.: Working  Without Annette," at the Odyssey Theatre Ensemble, has no big top, no spangled  acrobats nor spectacular high-wire tricks.  </P> <P> It does have French tightrope walkers, a talking chimpanzee, a husband-and-wife  daredevil act and a magician named Fred.  </P> <P> Sort of.  </P> <P> On an almost bare stage, enlivened with humor and warmth, this zesty new show  for ages 5 to 12 is an imagination celebration.  </P> <P> After pre-show theater games out in the lobby -- there is lots of voluntary  audience participation -- the Glorious Players, an adult cast of professionals,  skillfully directed by actress-educator Debbie Devine, offers the story of  12-year-old Molly (Cheryl Crabtree) who can't read and is afraid to try.  </P> <P> To escape from her troubles, Molly runs away to join a circus. But the circus  performers have their own problems -- they're not attracting audiences because  they refuse to learn new tricks.  </P> <P> When Molly helps the troupe overcome its fear of change, she loses her own fear  as well.  </P> <P> The message is buoyed up by well-timed nonsense from the polished cast who,  except for Crabtree, play multiple roles. Jay Kyle McAdams is a hoot as Molly's  mom and dad, her mischievous little brother, a Teutonic daredevil and  cigar-smoking chimpanzee trainer. The rest of the ensemble -- Crabtree, Andy  Papp, Jill Cervant, Jinni and Erick Melton -- score high marks for humor as  well.  </P> <P> Debbie Chew's original music is a big plus, particularly when she gives "voice"  to the giraffe and the zebra. The puppets, designed by Victoria Carpenter and  Martha Crawford, are a visual treat and seen too briefly.  </P> <P>  At 2055 S. Sepulveda Blvd., West Los Angeles, for an indefinite run,  Saturdays, 1 p.m. Tickets, $6.50; (213) 477-2055.  </P> <P> </P></p>

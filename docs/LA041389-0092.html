			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WATCHDOG PANEL URGED FOR POLICE  </P> <P> A citizens' advisory commission to the Long Beach Police Department voted  unanimously Wednesday night to recommend creation of an independent city agency  to investigate allegations of officer misconduct.  </P> <P> The Public Safety Advisory Commission also voted to revive the idea of a  citizens review board to hear certain types of police misconduct cases,  including brutality allegations and in-custody deaths.  </P> <P> The ideas were proposed by a committee formed in the wake of the January  incident in which Don Jackson, a black off-duty Hawthorne police sergeant,  appeared to have been pushed through a plate-glass window by a white Long Beach  police officer, Mark Dickey. Dickey faces misdemeanor criminal charges stemming  from the incident, which was secretly videotaped by a television crew.  </P> <P> The commission's proposals now go to the City Council, which last year rejected  calls for a citizen review board. But Commission Chairman Larry Davis said he  believes the Jackson incident has softened opposition to reforming the  complaint process.  </P></p>

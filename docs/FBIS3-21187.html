Mitsui's Global Tech, a  U.S. corporation, has already invested in a genetic engineering  firm. With the move of Global Tech's headquarters to Washington,  D.C., Mitsui plans to ally with U.S. companies in fields such as  environmental technology and cooling systems.    Three years ago Mitsui set up Global Tech in the United  States, then created Rio Grande Development (Albuquerque, New  Mexico) as a joint venture with BDM International, a leading  Defense Department contractor known for its automotive airbag  manufacturing. Rio Grande invests in start-up companies and  helps them even with tasks such product development.    Rio Grande has shown results by investing in Cell Robotics,  a  genetic engineering company which soon is expected to  commercialize technology to extract single cells and manipulate  them using genetic engineering.    Since the alliance with BDM was on a three-year contract,  Global Tech is moving its headquarters to Arlington, Virginia, a  suburb of Washington, D.C., to plan alliances with national  research institutes, start-up companies, and large corporations  clustered in that area.    According to Hiroshi Takeuchi, vice president of Global  Tech,  one promising area is environmental technology to address  problems such as systems to comply with freon regulations,  cooling systems for industrial machinery, and management of  toxic wastes and discarded tires. It's attractive because the  Clinton administration is calling for industry advances in this  area.    More than 100 Japanese companies have set up offices in the  Washington, D.C., area to collect information and lobby.  Mitsui's mission of Japan-U.S. business alliances makes it  unusual.</p>

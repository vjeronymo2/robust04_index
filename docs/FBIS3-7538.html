			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Suharto Monday criticized the West  developed countries which set democracy as one of conditions to  extend development cooperation with the developing countries.    "The developed countries are raising democracy issue and  good  government as the integral part of development process, mainly  in the developing countries," Suharto said opening the  leadership meeting of the Foreign Affairs Ministry here on  Monday.    Suharto stressed there is no a single form of democracy  which  could be applied universally. "Democracy is not a static  concept which is limited on the standard forms and practices  although it has universal principles and aspects," Suharto said.    Suharto said that cultural values and historical experience  of every nation are very variable.    If every nation is demanded to apply the basic principle of  democracy by ignoring the values in inter-nations relationship,  this would really deny the basic principle of democracy, Suharto  sald.    Suharto argued that democracy and democratisation are  dynamic  process which is harmony with fundamental values of every nation  and it is necessary to be adjusted with the developing reality  [sentence as published].    "Therefore, democratisation remains relevant with national  life," Suharto said.    Suharto said that in a such dynamic world, Indonesia and  other developing nations are implementing their respective  national development.    "There is no a single nation that could be developed from  outside," Suharto stressed.    Therefore, the president added the development of the  developing nations must be based on principle of national  self-reliance.    "However, we are aware that with all fund and capability  deployed by the developing nations for their development, it  would be difficult to achieve a success if international  environment is not conducive.    Suharto believes that the advanced and developing countries  need to reach a new agreement since almost all international  issues are interrelated and have global impacts.    "It is time for the North and South to create a new  consensus  on the international development and establish democratic  partnership, especially in dealing with global issues," the  president stated.    Only this way all nations in the world can reorganize the  international economic order to make it fairer and more reliable.    On the changing world, he said no country can isolate itself  from the prevailing change.    Therefore, every nation must improve its capability of  understanding the change and adjust itself to the situation, he  added.    "Adjusting ourselves does not mean that we have to follow  whereever the wind blows, but we have to strengthen the positive  elements to boost peace and welfare, and on the other hand we  have to try our best to avoid the negative elements," the  president explained.    He said the world is now still far from being peaceful,  safe,  and prosperous despite the end of the Cold War.    Meanwhile, Minister Alatas reported that the meeting lasting  until March 26 is attended by 78 ambassadors and representative  heads, 20 consul generals, five consuls, an ambassador-at-large,  and some senior officials of the foreign ministry.    The Foreign Ministry holds its working meeting every five  years. Among those attending the opening ceremony of five  meeting were Coordinating Minister for Political and Security  Susilo Sudarman and former foreign minister Sunario.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Kohl attacked over economic failure in east THE GERMAN government was accused yesterday of presiding over the de-industrialisation of former East Germany, and failing to develop a coherent industrial policy to protect it. The charge was made by opposition speakers, who blamed the government for over-optimism about recovery in the east, and for underestimating the cost of its collapse for the western economy. Members of the government insisted recovery was on the way, and accused the opposition of blocking tax reforms to gain electoral advantage, although all the benefit would go to the east. The angry exchanges dominated the parliamentary debate on the government's annual economic report, and on the parallel debate about tax reforms, currently deadlocked between the two houses of parliament. The increasingly bitter German economic debate takes place against a background of conflicting conclusions about the east German economy, with Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his colleagues talking about recovery within five years, while economists say it will take 20 years or more to catch up with the west. The latest study by the Prognos institute in Basle (for the federal Economics Ministry) predicts that by 2010, per capita GNP in the east will be about 87 per cent that in the west. Mr Wolfgang Roth, economics spokesman for the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), said east Germany was threatened with 'broad stretches of de-industrialisation'. The government was presiding over a 'catastrophic development' in eastern industry, because it refused to draw up a coherent industrial policy. He called for a coherent, and legally-based, rehabilitation policy for the Treuhand agency, which has hitherto concentrated overwhelmingly on privatisation of east German industry. He also called for a specific policy of public support for 'structurally-essential' industries, to prevent entire industrial areas from closing. And he proposed a 'co-operation policy' to bring together central government, the state governments, employers, unions and the Treuhand, to agree on common policies. Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister, repeated his plea to unions and employers to show restraint in the current wage round to bring inflation back below 4 per cent.</p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / UK Company News: SEET reduces losses and borrowings SEET, the textiles company, cut losses from Pounds 370,138 to Pounds 60,840 in the year to April 30 and Mr Jock Mackenzie, the chairman, reported that the company's financial position had also strengthened materially in the period. This improvement had arisen from the settlement of the Homemaker action in June last year, the sale of Kenneth Mackenzie in November and the settlement of a professional negligence claim in April this year. As a result of the sale of Kenneth Mackenzie Holdings for Pounds 1.25m last October and the receipt of money from the US following litigation there, group net borrowings at the year end were reduced from almost Pounds 2m to under Pounds 300,000, and since then there had been a further improvement. Mr Mackenzie said all operations were now trading profitably. Turnover for the year was Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 7.14m). Losses were struck after exceptional credits of Pounds 333,031 (Pounds 50,592) and net interest payments of Pounds 148,853 (Pounds 218,660). Losses per share came to 1.8p (9.07p).</p>

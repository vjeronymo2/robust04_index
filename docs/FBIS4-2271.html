			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Song Xiang (1345 5046)] </F>   [Text] Chengdu, 28 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--This  reporter learned today from the Sichuan Provincial Commodity  Price Bureau that in view of the present situation of  fluctuating prices for grain and edible oils in some localities,  Sichuan Vice Governor Diao Jinxiang announced, on behalf of the  provincial government, three measures sternly forbidding various  localities from raising market prices of grain and edible oils  without authorization in a bid to curb the re-escalation of  grain and edible oils prices in various localities.    Prices in the grain and edible oil markets in Sichuan during  the Spring Festival were relatively stable, but immediately  after the festival, prices rose again. Because the supply of  grain and edible oil in some localities in the province was not  timely, lawless merchants took advantage of the situation and  engaged in hoarding and speculation to drive up prices. A few  state grain shops also raised prices without authorization.  This caused excessive rises in grain and edible oil prices and  at the same time pushed up the entire retail price index.  Everyone is talking about the matter in various localities.    It is learned that the three measures to curb and stabilize  grain and edible oil prices adopted by Sichuan Province include:    --Major measures to curb and stabilize grain and edible oil  prices put forward by the State Council and the Sichuan  Provincial Government must be seriously implemented and fixed  prices must be strictly followed in order to maintain the  stability of grain and edible oil prices;    --In some places where the supply of edible oils is  excessively short, rationing can be adopted; and    --In a few localities where there really is difficulty in  the supply of edible oils and where a readjustment of prices is  needed, a report can be submitted to the provincial commodity  price bureau for approval, but rises cannot exceed 10 percent of  the price limit.</p>

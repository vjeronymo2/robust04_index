			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / UN ready with system of weapons monitoring The report on the long-term monitoring of Iraq's weapons systems handed to the UN yesterday marks the culmination of an unprecedented effort to destroy one of the world's biggest national arms efforts. The slim report handed by Mr Rolf Ekeus, the UN special envoy, to the Security Council declared 'provisionally operational' a monitoring system designed to ensure Iraq can never again produce or acquire chemical, biological or nuclear weapons of mass destruction, in accordance with the Gulf war ceasefire resolution 687. The political consequences of this report have still to be worked out, though Iraq claims it represents proof it has complied fully with the UN's post Gulf war strictures and that they should thus be rewarded by an easing of sanctions. The scale of the enterprise in finding, destroying and monitoring President Saddam Hussein's deadly arsenal, designed to make Iraq an Arab superpower, has been colossal. It has involved the destruction of hundreds of Scud missiles, hundreds of tonnes of chemical weapons and the detection and dismantling of at least 82 separate sites identified as part of an effort to create nuclear weapons. Mr Jaako Ylitako, chief field officer for the UN Special Commission, says over 8,000 people were employed in the chemical weapons industry alone, most at the al-Muthanna complex south of Baghdad, a plant the size of a big car factory. He estimates 12,000 were employed in Iraq's nuclear programme, now halted. Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency will remain permanently in Iraq, monitoring among other things all Iraq's main rivers to test for abnormal levels of radiation as a sign of any attempts to cheat. Experts are to arrive soon to set up similar monitoring systems for Iraq's biological weapons programme. More than 45 inspectors are starting to monitor data from 50 cameras installed at missile production plants and air chemical sensors installed at chemical works. Weekly flights by a US spy plane, and routine patrols by two helicopters are designed to ensure Iraq is unable to rebuild elsewhere. Mr Ylitako says the senior Iraqis who watched destroyed what was once their most advanced enterprise did so largely impassively. 'But I got the feeling some of them, as they destroyed all this, were glad to be out of this business,' he says.</p>

			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Arts: 'Martha' and 'Un ballo in maschera' - Opera in Dublin A year or two after Ireland's two main opera companies came under the same artistic director the arrangement would seem to be working to everybody's advantage. The Wexford Festival is left to investigate the rare operas it has always favoured, while DGOS Opera Ireland tries to satisfy the capital's hunger for the arts with opera of an international flavour. This year's spring season in Dublin pairs two contrasting operas: Flotow's Martha and Verdi's Un ballo in maschera. Given the limited rehearsal time the productions are respectable enough, but it is the imaginative casting policy that invariably makes a visit to Wexford or Dublin worthwhile. The best young Irish singers are found alongside promising newcomers from abroad and a sprinkling of established names. This was especially the case in the Flotow, which had a cast with no weak link. When Martha was given its first performance in Dublin in 1859 the singers included Mario and Grisi in the two leading roles, with Pauline Viardot-Garcia as support, a remarkable trio, for these were not just the most famous singers of the day, they rank among the most celebrated operatic stars of all time. These days it is young faces and fresh voices at DGOS Opera Ireland, which works just as well in this opera. Or possibly better. Martha is one of those homespun mid 19th-century German pieces, all springtime love and naive innocence, hummable tunes and comfortable harmonies, which could hardly fail to warm the heart, if handled with sensitivity. This delightful performance did not put a foot wrong. In the best tradition of opera productions run on a tight budget the producer Dieter Kaegi and his designer Bruno Schwengl had devised a setting that was as simple as it was effective: no political point making, no heavy handed comic tomfoolery. The opera famously features Flotow's version of 'The Last Rose of Summer', but this staging was at least half Germanic by nature, with its beer swilling yokels and Middle European atmosphere. The successors to those famed stars of old were the Irish soprano Marie-Claire O'Reirdan and American tenor Kip Wilborn, both fine voices, attractive personalities. As the secondary couple, Ulrika Precht and James Wood caught nicely the more outgoing humour that comes their way, the Swedish mezzo in particular giving notice of a voice to watch. James Lockhart was the conductor, who obtained crisp playing from the National Symphony Orchestra. The whole performance kept sticky sentiment at bay. The company's Un ballo in maschera had more ambitious aims. As befits Verdi in grand opera style, this had aspirations to be an evening of international class, which always poses problems. The conductor, Guido Ajmone-Marsan, brought a keen Italianate drive to the performance, while the producer, Ceri Sherlock, clothed the opera unexpectedly in Italian garb, moving the setting to the Italy of Verdi's own day. Otherwise the visiting principals had been left to do their own thing. Maurizio Saltarin was the rather tight-voiced Riccardo, with the right Italianate style, although one imagines it would be beyond the wit of any producer to get him to sing his love duet to anybody but the conductor. Carol Neblett made an appearance as guest diva in the role of Amelia, somewhat blowsy vocally these days, though she has plenty of voice left and shirks nothing. Frances Lucey was the winning Oscar, Jacalyn Bower a forthright Ulrica. The evening, however, belonged to the remaining member of the cast. Vladimir Redkin, Moscow-born, Bolshoy-trained, sang a Renato of an impressive breadth and vocal security which mark him out as yet another Russian baritone headed for the top of his profession. The casting genie of DGOS Opera Ireland has done it again: he is a real find. Gaiety Theatre, Dublin. Season lasts until May 3.</p>

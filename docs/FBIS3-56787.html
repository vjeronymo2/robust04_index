			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy has  assessed the trilateral agreement on nuclear disarmament signed  by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk in Moscow on January 14  as "timely." "Ukraine has been and will be a great missile and  space power regardless of the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from  our territory," he told a meeting with the heads of the mass  media in Kiev. "We have everything necessary to build missiles  and fly into space," he added.    Speaking on his attitude to the presidential elections in  Crimea, Radetskyy pointed out that as defense minister he  regarded this event "normally." "But as a citizen of Ukraine, I  am confident that there must be only one president in the  republic," he said.    The minister also said an inspection of the Black Sea Fleet  will be carried out in the near future. He said it was "costly"  for both Russia and Ukraine to maintain the Black Sea Fleet.    Summing up the results of the first two years since the  creation of the Ukrainian army, Radetskyy said that during this  time Ukraine concluded bilateral agreements on military  cooperation with 19 states. During Kazakh President Nursultan  Nazarbayev's visit to Kiev scheduled for January 20-21, such an  agreement is expected to be signed with Kazakhstan, too.    According to Radetskyy, by now the Ukrainian army has been  reduced by over 200,000 troops compared to last year. By the  end of 1995, the republican armed forces will have 450,000  personnel.</p>

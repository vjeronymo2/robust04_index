			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed CC/TP: "Swiss Air Force To Be Modernized by </F> Late 1990's"]    [Text] Bern, 8 June (ATS) -- The Swiss Air Force is going  to modernize the Rapier air defense system by the year 2000.  The goal is to make it less vulnerable to electronic jamming  and to facilitate its maintenance, said the Federal Military  Department (DMF). The cost of the operation is expected to be  18 million [Swiss] francs [SFr].    The Armament Group (GDA) has signed a contract with British  Aerospace, which designed the system. The GDA has placed a SFr4  million order so far. This modernization process will be  presented to parliament in the framework of one of the armament  programs of the second half of the decade.    The Rapier system was purchased in the early eighties. At  the time, parliament voted an overall SFr1.39 billion credit.  The system has been used in the Swiss Air Force since 1985. It  makes it possible to fight targets flying at average altitudes,  day or night, even in bad weather.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Forecasters face long leap into statistical darkness THE NEXT six months will test the initiative of industrialists and economists tracking the UK economy. Yesterday's trade figures were the last in the current series and there will be no more official data on intra-European Community trade until the middle of June. Few appear to have made contingency plans, even though the Central Statistical Office announced the disruption a year ago. That is hardly surprising given the difficulties involved. The old system for collecting data was based on Customs declarations. With the abolition of border requirements under the single market this system is now void. The new system will be based on value added tax returns and a monthly report for bigger companies. The timing of the interruption is irritating. Almost 60 per cent of the UK's external trade is generated in the EC and the figures for the first half of the year would have been especially important for what they could reveal about the effect of sterling's devaluation on UK trade. 'The timing is unfortunate,' said Mr Richard Brown, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce. 'We do appear to be at a turning point and we have been arguing that when it comes it will be export-led. Our quarterly survey has shown a pick-up in export orders and it will be frustrating not to have that confirmed by official figures.' Economists will meanwhile have to make do with a variety of other indicators from which they may be able to extrapolate trends. The Confederation of British Industry says it will use data from its industrial and distributive trades surveys as a partial substitute for the trade figures. It is considering conducting a special survey in the spring. Otherwise economists will draw on: Trade with the rest of Europe. Trade with non-EC countries in Europe, such as Austria and the Nordic countries, will continue to be published on a monthly basis. Trade with the rest of the world. These will also continue to be published but may give a misleading impression. The US economy is forecast to grow steadily in the first half of this year, but much of continental Europe is sliding into recession. So exports to the US are unlikely to mirror the trend in exports to the EC. CBI and British Chambers of Commerce surveys. The CBI's monthly and quarterly industrial trends inquiries ask companies about export orders. Its distributive trades survey asks wholesalers and retailers whether imports as a total share of trade have gone up or down. The BCC also makes inquiries about export orders. Other EC results. Some EC members are planning to produce figures earlier than June. Regional disparities. Some regions are more export intensive than others.</p>

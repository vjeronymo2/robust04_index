			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] North Korean UN Ambassador Pak Kil-yon today said  that since the U.S.-North Korean negotiation has reached a final  stage, a final conclusion [choejong kyollon] will be made soon,  adding that since the issue of nuclear inspection requires  technical procedures, North Korea will be able to resolve it in  consultation with the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA].  It is, therefore, expected that the IAEA's nuclear inspection  team will visit North Korea to conduct inspections of the seven  declared North Korean nuclear sites. However, the IAEA said  that it has not yet been contacted by North Korea or the United  States in connection with the inspection of the North Korean  nuclear sites.</p>

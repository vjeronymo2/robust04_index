			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Levitt's QC criticised for prejudicing jury The barrister who defended Mr Roger Levitt, the financial services salesman given a community service order after admitting fraud, was criticised by the trial judge for making a prejudicial speech to the jury, it was disclosed yesterday. Criticisms made of Mr Jonathan Goldberg QC during the trial by Mr Justice Laws were made public yesterday after the Serious Fraud Office won a High Court ruling to have reporting restrictions lifted on legal arguments which were held during the trial in the absence of the jury. The move by the SFO amounts to a further attempt to defend itself following criticism of its acceptance of the plea bargain which led to Mr Levitt walking free from court. It was followed by a statement from Sir Nicholas Lyall, the attorney general, defending the SFO's handling of the case. Answering a parliamentary question, he said prosecution of Mr Levitt had been fairly and vigorously conducted. He also ruled out any appeal against the sentence on grounds of leniency, saying it was impossible under the law. Prosecution sources have indicated that their acceptance of Mr Levitt's plea to a much-reduced charge of deceiving Fimbra, the self-regulating body for financial advisers, was largely influenced by the prejudicial speech made by Mr Goldberg and the subsequent decision by the judge, Mr Justice Laws, not to order a retrial. In this speech, outlining the general nature of Mr Levitt's case, Mr Goldberg said that the means Mr Levitt had used to obtain Pounds 21m he later injected into his company were totally honest. During the trial it was alleged Mr Levitt then fraudulently injected this money into the Levitt Group in a failed attempt to save the company - a claim he still denies. Most of this money had been obtained by Mr Levitt by raising loans and selling shares in the group to banks and other institutions. However, while the jury was absent the court was told that the SFO had always disputed Mr Levitt's honesty in the way he raised this money. During pre-trial hearings the judge had resolved the issue by insisting that both the SFO and Mr Levitt's defence team could put only a neutral interpretation on how the Pounds 21m was raised. By claiming Mr Levitt had raised the money honestly, Mr Goldberg had 'gravely misrepresented the true facts' and subverted this ruling, the judge said. In spite of agreeing with Mr David Cocks QC, for the SFO, that the speech had been prejudicial, the judge rejected his call for a re-trial.</p>

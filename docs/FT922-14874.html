			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / MGN may have to write off Pounds 180m MIRROR Group Newspapers is facing a write-off of Pounds 180m, a much larger amount than previously realised. The figure is contained in accounts being finalised following the death of Mr Robert Maxwell and the realisation that Pounds 99m had been borrowed from MGM and not returned. The accounts are being produced to prepare MGN, which publishes the Daily and Sunday Mirror, The People and the Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail, for sale later this year. Fifty-one per cent of the shares of the publicly quoted MGN are held by the private Maxwell interests now in administration and effectively controlled by banks. A collection of Maxwell deals charged to MGM in addition to the missing Pounds 99m has taken the write-off total to Pounds 180m. They include: A loss on the sale of a stake in the Canadian commercial printing company Quebecor Printing and a CDollars 50m (Pounds 24m) loan attributable to MGM. A liability to Mr Mark Booth, former chief executive of MTV when Maxwell sold his stake in the pop music channel. Rent arrears on the MGM's Worship Street premises. The considerable financing and consultancy charges being paid to banks. The unexpectedly large write-offs suggest that MGM is in a worse financial state than previously believed but is unlikely to be fatal. The company is still trading profitably. Final agreement was reached this week on interim financing to take MGM until the end of May.</p>

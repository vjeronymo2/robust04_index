			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Letter: Solutions to the career problems of women with children (1) Sir, Your articles on the state of child care coupled with your report ('Few top company jobs go to women', January 20) on the scarcity of female representation at board level in British companies suggested one obvious solution to me. There is one job which in terms of hours and remuneration would be eminently suitable for most women with children - that of non-executive director. Perhaps if more women were offered this opportunity we would also see a change in the corporate culture in a country which makes the arrival of children such a problem for working women.

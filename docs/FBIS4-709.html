			<p>BFN     [Text] Brazzaville, 8 Apr (AFP) -- Congolese radio  announced today that Paulin Ayina, the chief treasurer of Congo  (director of the Treasury), was dismissed yesterday by Prime  Minister Jacques Joachim Yhombi Opango.    He was replaced by a principal inspector of the Treasury,  Mampassi Tsika, the radio added, without giving the reasons for  the dismissal.    A senior civil servant close to the Congolese Presidency  told  AFP that the government accused Mr. Ayina of the "centralization  of power and an absence of transparency in his activities."    The public treasury collects about 7 billion CFA francs (70  million French francs) every month, representing regular income  and oil royalties for the Congo.    Several trade unions have recently denounced the poor  management of state incomes and the abusive expenses of public  treasury funds.</p>

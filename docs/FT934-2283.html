			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / SA clash looms on homelands South Africa's multi-party Transitional Executive Council yesterday set itself on collision course with right-wing parties, threatening legal action against the KwaZulu black 'homeland' of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and blocking a development loan to nominally independent Bophuthatswana. The African National Congress, which dominates the TEC together with its political allies, has been flexing its muscles in the council since its installation a week ago. Last week, the ANC provoked a showdown with the government by insisting the TEC urge withdrawal of the Internal Stability Unit from the Bhambayi squatter camp, Natal, and the East Rand townships near Johannesburg. Yesterday, Mr Hernus Kriel, law and order minister, agreed to withdraw all but a token ISU force from Bhambayi. A decision on the East Rand was delayed pending talks between police and residents. Another showdown with the government loomed over whether police will be deployed in northern Natal, as demanded by the TEC last week. Such deployments would bring the TEC into confrontation with the KwaZulu government, which administers parts of northern Natal as a self-governing state. ANC officials admit the TEC cannot force Mr Kriel to act (it can only recommend action), but they want to show the TEC has power in policing, which is important to free and fair elections. But sending police to northern Natal could provoke conflict with KwaZulu, which rejects the TEC's authority.</p>

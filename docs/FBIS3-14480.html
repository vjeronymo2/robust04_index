It also provides  for Israel's adoption of a set of measures to meet the  increasing security needs of the Palestinians, especially in  Hebron.    The Palestinian source informed the MENA correspondent in  Tunis of the text of the agreement, which includes the following  points:    A. A temporary international presence in Hebron.    B. Deployment of the Palestinian police force and its  activity in Hebron.    C. Joint patrols in Hebron.    D. Israel's responsibility for the security of all  Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including  Jerusalem.    E. Resumption of the Gaza-Jericho talks as of today.    The following is the text of the agreement:    Following the heinous crime in Hebron and in accordance with  Security Council Resolution 904, the Israeli and PLO delegations  met in Cairo on 23 March and agreed to adopt the following  measures to meet the increasing security needs of the  Palestinians, especially in Hebron.    This agreement led to resuming the talks between the two  sides to implement the Gaza-Jericho agreement as soon as  possible.    A. [letter as received] A temporary international presence  in  Hebron.    Israel believes this presence should be for observation  purposes, while the PLO believes it should be for the purpose of  meeting the Palestinians' need for security and stability by  helping with observation and submitting reports on the acts that  affect the safety of the Palestinians and their property, which  will encourage the return of normal life among the Palestinians.    To facilitate the tasks of the international observer force,  an office will be set up in Hebron. The office will submit  periodic reports to the joint Israeli-Palestinian Liaison  Affairs Committee to be formed in accordance with the  Declaration of Principles.    The international observer force will submit reports on  specific incidents to the Joint Hebron Committee composed of the  Israeli military governor of Hebron, the Palestinian mayor of  Hebron, and the commander of the soon-to-be-formed Palestinian  police for the town. The PLO believes an invitation should be  sent to the representative of the international observer force  to participate in the meetings of the Joint Liaison Affairs  Committee.    Israel believes the members of the international observer  force should wear civilian clothes and carry pistols, while the  PLO believes they should wear official uniforms with special  insignia to be agreed upon by the two sides, that their cars  carry this insignia, and that they be armed with light weapons  for self-defense in Hebron.    Israel believes the international observer force should  number 20. The PLO believes their number should be 200 in  addition to an enhanced role for the International Committee of  the Red Cross by raising the number of its team to 30  representatives.    Israel demands that the financiers appoint 20 Norwegian  civilians while the PLO demands that the financiers should  appoint 200 individuals from their own citizens as observers on  condition that the first batch will be appointed from Norway,  Egypt, and the United States.    The duties of the international observer force are to  provide  a sense of security for the Palestinian residents of Hebron and  create the appropriate atmosphere leading to strengthening the  prosperity and economic progress of the Palestinians. The duty  of this force is also to supervise the return of normal life to  Hebron and to complete reports on that.    The members of the international observer force will enjoy  freedom of movement to perform their duties. This freedom will  not be limited for any reason other than compelling military  requirements, which will be temporary and extraordinary measures.    The financing countries will bear the expenses of the force.  The International Red Cross is asked to expand and intensify  its activities in Hebron by increasing its staff to 30  individuals. The force can proceed with its work as soon as the  agreement is signed. Israel is demanding that the term of the  observer force be three months while the PLO is demanding a  one-year term with the approval of the two sides, which can be  extended in accordance with the agreement.    Regarding the deployment and activity of the Palestinian  authority in Hebron and without prejudicing Israel's authority  and its responsibility for security and public order, the two  sides agreed on the formation of the Palestinian police and its  work in the town.    Israel demands that the police number 50 individuals while  the PLO demands that it number 400 policemen who will be chosen  and appointed by the directorate of the Palestinian police force  that will be formed in Gaza and Jericho.    The duties of the Palestinian police in the town will be to  protect public establishments and the Palestinian installations  on which agreement will be reached and to participate in joint  patrols. The police will periodically hold contacts with the  directorate of the Palestinian police force to receive general  instructions, training, and administrative duties connected with  it.    The Palestinian police will submit its reports to the Joint  Liaison Affairs Committee, which will define the daily activity  of the Palestinian police personnel in coordination with the  Israeli security and police forces. Israel's collective  responsibility for security will be recognized.    To coordinate between the Palestinian and Israeli police,  the  Joint Liaison Affairs Committee will set up a coordinating  bureau in Hebron administered jointly and working 24 hours a  day. The committee will define all details regarding the  structure and tasks of the Hebron police coordinating bureau.    Israel demands that the Palestinian policemen in Hebron wear  ordinary clothes and carry pistols while the PLO demands that  they wear a special uniform with an insignia, carry light  weapons, and that their cars carry special insignia to be agreed  upon by the Hebron coordinating committee.    The two sides will negotiate in Cairo on the organizational  structure of the Palestinian police in the town and on its  equipment and vehicles.    The Palestinian police in Hebron will work in accordance  with  a special decree issued by the military governor defining its  duties and tasks.    As for regulations governing the joint police patrols, the  duties of which are to provide security for the Palestinians,  observe the situation, and compile reports on it, Israel  believes that these patrols should be the same as the patrols in  the city of Hebron and consist of two Palestinian policemen and  two Israeli policemen in one vehicle driven by an Israeli  officer of a higher rank.    The PLO believes that there should be two four-wheeled  vehicles, one Palestinian and the other Israeli. The vehicle  [not further specified] will be distinguished from other  vehicles in the area and driven by an Israeli officer of a  higher rank. He should be in contact with the police  coordination office.    The Joint Hebron Committee is specifying and equipping the  number of patrols, defining their duties, and drawing up the  course of their patrol and the routes they should follow.    In the agreement, Israel affirmed its responsibility for the  safety of all Palestinians and Israelis in the West Bank and  Gaza Strip, including the city of Hebron. It will continue to  implement all the necessary measures to avert any conflict  between the settlers and the Palestinians and to prevent acts of  violence by the settlers.    With respect to the Gaza-Jericho agreement, the two sides  agreed to resume the Gaza-Jericho negotiations today, Tuesday,  and to speed them up to make up for lost time. Israel will  reduce the period of the withdrawal schedule and adhere to the  dates specified in the Declaration of Principles.    Immediately after finalizing the Gaza-Jericho agreement, the  negotiations on the early transfer of authority will start. The  two sides will then discuss the possibility of expanding the  scope of negotiations and resuming them over the transitional  arrangements in accordance with the Declaration of Principles.    The agreement reconfirmed that preparations for the  permanent  situation will start as soon as possible on condition that they  do not continue beyond the third year of the transitional  period, as is stipulated in the Declaration of Principles.    The gradual entry of the Palestinian police into Gaza and  Jericho will start one week after the resumption of the  Gaza-Jericho negotiations, so as to start preparations for  taking on responsibilities and authority.</p>

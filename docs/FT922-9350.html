			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Binoculars marvel at the landscape In the past 90 years the design of binoculars has changed very little, but their use has sometimes been limited by the narrow field of view which makes it difficult to find or follow fast-moving objects. Mike Freeman, who heads Optics and Vision, a consultancy company based in Denbigh, Wales, believes he has found a solution with a new design of binocular which gives a wide field of view - more than twice that of standard binoculars - and up to 12 times magnification. The breakthrough was achieved using a curved mirror system to fold the light path and correctly position the image. This replaces glass prisms which are much heavier and expensive to produce.

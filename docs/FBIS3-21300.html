			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marit Gilat] </F>   [Text] Prizma, a new dye factory run by Koor's subsidy  Makhteshim, began operation last week. Koor described the  venture as part of its strategic diversification designed to  broaden the company's basket of products.    Much has been said of the recovery plan, by which Koor's  creditor banks have forced it to sell its controlling interest  in Tambor at a price far below its current worth. Koor's renewed  entry into the Israeli dye industry is intended to break  Tambor's monopoly over 80 percent of the local market.    There is more than meets the eye in this script. Koor may  have sold its direct interest in Tambor but it continues to hold  half the shares of Mashav, which owns 24 percent of Tambor's  shares. At the end of this chain, Koor has 12 percent of  Tambor's shares. The opening of a rival dye company does not  mesh with its interests as a part owner.    It seems reasonable to conclude that Koor was unwillingly  drawn into the venture by Makhteshim even though Makhteshim's  CEO is Yehuda Milo, Koor's deputy CEO.    "Koor controls lines that are fundamentally independent," a  member of Koor's board of directors explained this week. "Not  everything is set from above. A subsystem can identify a  business opportunity in a field that runs against Koor's  interests, the management team brings the proposal to the  company's board of directors and the board then decides. The  chairman of the board does not make the decision himself."    The dye company is just one example of a symptom inherent in  Koor's strategy of diversification--its fluid assets are not  within the company itself. Koor's latest financial report shows  a considerable improvement in its fluidity, amounting to working  capital of 724 million shekels at the end of September, 1993.    The financial reports for the first seven months of this  year, however, are combined reports. Koor admits that most of  its fluid assets were drained in satisfying its debts to Israeli  and foreign banks.    The company's current fluid holdings are in its  subsidiaries,  primarily Nesher and Tadiran. The Prizma project is proof that  under current conditions, Koor does not have absolute control  over its lines of investment or their nature.    On the other hand, Koor will have no difficulty finding  funds  to finance its diversification program on its own. Because it is  not leveraged at present, it enjoys a wide field for acquiring  funds. Indeed, it expects to raise close to 120 million shekels  in convertible bonds, which it will use carrying out its  five-year strategic plan.    Koor must expand in order to preserve its returns on  capital.  The high profits of 1992-1993 led to a sharp increase in its  shareholder equity. Accordingly, it must expand its sources of  income and, above all, diversify them.    The company's recovery plan was essentially a consolidation  plan by which Koor sold dozens of concerns. The reduction  brought it back to profitability but also made it highly  dependent on three sources of income: Tadiran and Telrad,  Nesher, and Makhteshim and Agan.    Tadiran alone accounted for one-third of Koor's profits in  1993. Along with Telrad, its dependence on the communications  branch is very high.    This dependence is particularly problematic in light of  Tadiran's own deep roots in Bezeq, which is suffering from  steadily lower prices; it also is having difficulties making the  transition from the local market to exports and from a slice of  the military market to the civilian one.    Its opportunities in cellular phones also have plunged since  GTE withdrew from competition. If it does not find a new  partner, it too will have to drop out.    Koor's success in 1994 will depend on its success in  steering  Tadiran through an obstacle course. That, apparently, is the  reason that Koor's CEO, Benny Ga'on, recently appointed himself  chairman of Tadiran.    The goal that Koor has established for itself in the  strategic plan is to reach annual sales of $3 billion by 1997,  $1 billion from exports. The strategic plan is based on an  economic survey the company made that identified two critical  fields with potential--the tourist industry in peacetime and the  capital market. As for tourism, Koor has announced its intention  to go into four areas: hotels, car rental, travel agencies, and  holiday parks. As for the stock market, Koor's managers are  talking about opening or buying a brokerage house.    In fact, market analysts say, Koor has already begun making  vast acquisitions. "There is practically no company trading on  the market that has not passed over Koor's desk," is the way a  senior figure at a competitor puts it. "As a general matter, it  looks like the company is buying almost everything available,  and at high prices."    Despite a superficial resemblance to the Koor of prerecovery  plan days, this is not a return to the mold that brought it down  back then. In the 1980's, Koor bought anything at hand,  including highly leveraged, money-losing businesses without  knowing what was going on inside them. Its motives were partly  political, and the interlocking debts among the companies  dragged the whole system into bankruptcy.    Today, the companies do not owe debts to one another. Each  profit center is autonomous, so a loss in one company will not  topple the entire house of cards. But the prices at which Koor  has been making its acquisitions, critics contend, are liable to  become problems in the future.    'Ami Goldene, managing director of Me'ir 'Ezra, which is  competing with Koor for acquisition of Milutal, a frozen  vegetables business, has assailed Koor for the high price it  offered for the business. Goldene may have an ax to grind, but  the capital market provides other examples. Along with Klal,  Koor bought Yuli 'Ofer's holdings in Carmel Granites at market  prices.    Of the acquisition of 15 percent of Arki'a, one market  analyst says, a company like Koor has no reason to invest in a  business without taking control of it. "You have to remember  that the moment that Eilat has 6,000 hotel rooms, another  carrier will be able to enter that route. Arki'a will lose its  monopoly and be forced to cut fares," says the analyst.    The purchase of the Kinorot Tiberias hotel has also drawn  criticism. "If Koor wants to enjoy the peace dividend, it has to  build hotels rather than buy them. When you buy a hotel today,  the price already reflects the expected dividend," says the  analyst.    Koor is used to giving reasons in its defense. Koor's CEO,  Benny Ga'on, refused to be interviewed for this article, but  other company officials stressed that the best evidence of  Koor's caution is the long list of companies that it  contacted--and turned down. A random and unrepresentative  sampling of the list includes Tempo, Sahar, Moritz-Tukhlar, Dan  Rent-A-Car and Histour.    "There is a lot of noise surrounding Koor, a sense that it  has a hand in everything. Koor is thought of as a company that  brings financial and organizational skills. We get business  offers every day," says a Koor official, "but we turn away most  of them. If you look at where we have actually put our money,  you see that the company has been very selective."    According to this official, once Koor achieves the goals it  has set itself, it will stop the entire process. "You can expect  that we will quit running after opportunities at a certain  point."    With the exception--surprisingly--of Milutal, the officer  completely rejects complaints about specific investments. "The  deal still is not done and nothing is definite," says the  official. "The frozen vegetable market is highly saturated and  we have a lot of questions. It will depend on the numbers the  other side shows us." As for the other investments, adds the  official, all considerations were taken into account at the time  of acquisition.    "How can you say that we bought Arki'a at market prices when  the deal was done the night the shares were issued? On paper,  we've made 25 million shekels since the sale, a half million  sheqels a day," says the Koor official.    Someone else, outside the company, also rejects the  criticism. "Two years ago, Koor was deep in the recovery plan  and not in a position to buy anything. What IDB [Israel Discount  Bank] got quietly during those two years, Koor is now doing all  at once and very noisily," says the CEO of one of the economy's  leading corporations.    "They said prices on the market were high two years ago,  too,  and it later turned out that anyone who did not buy then lost  out, and big. It is true that Koor is now buying at market  prices and multipliers of 25 and 30, when many companies are  being sold above their value. The problem is not companies that  are sold on the stock market but those not on the market. But  you have to remember that even Koor itself is acquiring ever  higher multipliers, so it is difficult to say definitely whether  it is buying at exceptionally dear prices," says the CEO.    If one can judge by Koor's publicly traded stock, the market  still has not decided. Its shares sell now for the same price  they did six months ago, far below the overall share index. Some  attribute that to the volume of trades that the government set  in motion on the market. Others see it as a vote of no  confidence in the strategic plan.    Three directors have resigned from Koor's board over the  past  half year. Some have tried to link the wave of departures with a  feeling of uneasiness arising from developments in the company.  The three members involved categorically deny that and claim  that they resigned because of conflicts of interest. Accountant  Ariela Zukhobitzky preferred the stock market's board of  directors. Minister Shalom Shiran says that Koor's entry into  the world of stock portfolios made him fearful of conflicts of  interests because he serves as adviser to a number of companies  in the field. "If I would had any complaints, I would have made  them known," contends Shiran.    Shmu'el Rotem, of Nayar Hadera, says that he decided to  resign after he was asked to serve as director on behalf of the  public; there was some overlap between the operations of Argaz  and those of Markavim, which is a subsidiary of Koor. Rotem cut  to the heart of the matter in a single sentence: "Koor's  directors and management have to guard against euphoria and keep  a sense of proportion in their decisions and activities."    People close to the company today speak out more pointedly  when the word "euphoria" goes around. "Some acquisitions were  worth getting, some not. Some things might have been bought more  cheaply," said one person close to the company.    "It is natural that a sense of euphoria has developed in  Koor," says one member of the board of directors. "It is no  wonder that that is happening in a company that was mired so  deeply in the mud and got out thanks to good management.  Undoubtedly there are people on the leadership teams who have  said the same thing."    Benny Ga'on, say those close to Koor, wields almost total  control over the company. Partly, that is a matter of his  charismatic personality and the status he can claim as the man  responsible for the company's revival. But the deeper reason is  that Koor has no owners in the true sense of the word, and in  the absence of owners, one member of the board explained,  management becomes whatever it can.    Koor bore the yoke of the bank arrangement until a year ago.  When it was freed of the arrangement, Hevrat Ha'ovdim, which now  holds 37 percent of Koor's shares, was supposed to step back in  and take on the role of owner. Since the collapse of the  Histadrut's own companies, however, this body has been emptied  of much of its substance. If Hevrat Ha'ovdim is now regaining  its strength, that is due to its possession of Koor, and not the  reverse. Prof. Eytan Sheshinsky, chairman of Koor's board of  directors and a dominant figure in his own right, was formally  appointed by Hevrat Ha'ovdim. But as an active partner in the  recovery process, Sheshinsky was identified more with management  than with the shareholders.    In any event, Hevrat Ha'ovdim's control over Koor is  temporary. In the meantime, Bank Hapo'alim is the sole body that  has exercised the options it received as part of the Koor  arrangement in return for wiping out it debts. The bank has held  23.9 percent of the company's shares since August, 1993. When  the other banks, foremost among them Bank Le'umi, exercise their  options, Hevrat Ha'ovdim's share of Koor will drop to 22 percent  and Bank Hapo'alim will become the controlling shareholder in  the company.    Bank Hapo'alim already keeps real holdings to the extent  permitted by law, so the Bank of Israel has instructed it to  sell its interest in Koor; it is also, in any case, forbidden to  be the company's largest shareholder. According to the banks'  restructuring plan, however, Bank Hapo'alim will be required to  sell most of its holdings in Klal, Deleq, Ampal and Dior P.B.  Sources close to the bank estimate that it would prefer to sell  one of its other large holdings provided that it can take  control of Koor.    In any case, changes recently were made in Bank Hapo'alim to  increase its involvement in Koor. Formally, the creditor banks  had two representatives on Koor's directorate--Roni Feinstein  and Moshe Veitman. Bank Hapo'alim, whose holdings entitle it to  appoint four of Koor's board members, is now working to place  two of its people on the management council. Those are Dafna  Peli, secretary of Bank Hapo'alim, and Badan Yahas, who is in  charge of the bank's finance and customer services divisions.  Both were involved in overseeing Koor during the recovery plan,  so they know the company well.    "It is not that the board of directors has failed to do its  duty, God forbid. There were a number of arguments and incidents  in which the directors refused to confirm plans that management  had brought. That is the same thing we have seen in Bank Le'umi  and Bank Hapo'alim. In the same way, it is hard to point to  anyone who gives orders to Moshe Zanbar or 'Amiram Siyon," says  one member of the board.    As he sees it, Bank Hapo'alim's control of the board of  directors will change the picture. "The moment that Hapo'alim  becomes owner and appoints its own people, it will exercise  tremendous influence in the way it sees fit. It isn't a question  of caution or of someone with a better understanding of how the  economy works. 'Amiram Siyon is not preferable to Benny  Ga'on--they hatched from the same egg. It is a question of  balance in making decisions."  <H5>  [Box, p C1] </H5> <H5>  Koor's Investments </H5>   Capital Market: Established an investment company,  Primavera,  in partnership with Yosi Hakhmi of Hapanex and Udi Recanati.

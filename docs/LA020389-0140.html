			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TAKING CHARGE;  </P> <P> PETTENGILL DISCARDS HIS MISGIVINGS AND LEARNS TO EXCEL IN ROLE AS POINT MAN FOR  KENNEDY  </P> <P> Thirty-three dribbles and one assist marked Mike Pettengill's debut as a  varsity point guard at Kennedy High School.  </P> <P> Pettengill was a nervous freshman, brought up to the varsity by Kennedy Coach  John Mayberry for a tournament at Cerritos High. The idea was for Pettengill,  who had been playing on the junior varsity, to gain a little experience  practicing and watching games from the bench.  </P> <P> But Pettengill found himself in a game during the waning minutes of a blowout  victory over Cerritos.  </P> <P> He dribbled the ball upcourt, fighting the butterflies as he went. He kept  dribbling and dribbling, looking for someone to get open. Finally, he found  someone, but not before Mayberry counted 33 consecutive dribbles.  </P> <P> "The crowd cheered when he finally passed," Mayberry said.  </P> <P> Afterward, Pettengill told Mayberry he did not want to be a point guard.  </P> <P> Pettengill managed to record an assist and added a free throw, but he  envisioned himself as a shooting guard. Playing point was too difficult, he  thought.  </P> <P> Three years and countless passes later, Pettengill, a 5-foot 10-inch senior,  has established himself as a prototypal point guard. His resume includes an  Orange County-leading 9.6 assists a game last season. He also helped Kennedy  win the Garden Grove League and Southern Section 3-A championships.  </P> <P> This season he averages 6.6 assists, 13 points and -- despite controlling the  ball 90% of the time -- only 5 turnovers a game. Kennedy is 15-7 overall and  8-2 in the Garden Grove League.  </P> <P> But most impressive is his transition from reluctant passer to Kennedy's  unquestioned leader. He is no longer "scared to death" on the court, but a  composed and polished player, eager to take control in the late going.  </P> <P> "I didn't used to like being the point guard, but now I love knowing that  everyone is depending on me," Pettengill said.  </P> <P> Said Mayberry: "I always knew he was going to be my starting point guard. I  think he just built some confidence."  </P> <P> His confidence has swelled as he has matured into his role as Kennedy's floor  leader. Often, he directs the team's practices whenever Mayberry is a few  minutes late. He puts the team through the drills, deciding which to run  beforehand. He consults with Mayberry on what offenses and defenses the team  should work on.  </P> <P> "It's now to the point where I can read Coach Mayberry's mind," Pettengill  said. "I know what he would say. I know all his drills."  </P> <P> It started when Pettengill was a junior. Mayberry wanted him to take more of a  leadership role on what was hoped would be a championship-caliber team.  </P> <P> But running practice?  </P> <P> "He was a little late one day, so I took it upon myself to start practice,"  Pettengill said.  </P> <P> Said Mayberry: "He's out of the old mold in his leadership abilities. He  doesn't try to cut corners. Sometimes he'll add drills we haven't done in a  long time. Sometimes I'll just go out on the floor and watch what he's doing."  </P> <P> One of Pettengill's favorite games in practice is a free throw shooting  contest. Each player lines up to shoot a one-and-one. If the player makes it,  the team gets a point. If he misses, Mayberry gets two points.  </P> <P> Pettengill, who makes 77% in games, likes to shoot last because he likes to  have to have the contest riding -- and his teammates depending -- on his free  throws.  </P> <P> Pressure was something he was confronted with almost on a nightly basis during  the playoffs last season. It proved to be a turning point in Pettengill's  career.  </P> <P> After spending his sophomore season as the backup point guard, he became the  starter as a junior.  </P> <P> It was a heady introduction to the starting lineup. Kennedy had a veteran team  and expectations were high. Twins Michael and Maurice Keith, Mike Williams and  Wendell Lauderdale were experienced seniors, determined since they were junior  high teammates to win a Southern Section championship.  </P> <P> After an easy victory over Troy in the first round, the games got tougher.  Kennedy had to go to Lancaster to play Antelope Valley, where it pulled off a  58-55 victory. Next was top-seeded Saddleback in the quarterfinals. A late  drive by Pettengill sealed a 58-55 victory over the Roadrunners.  </P> <P> In the semifinals, Pettengill was a steadying influence in an 83-80,  triple-overtime victory over Rolling Hills. Compared with that, the final  against Tustin in the Sports Arena was a breeze. Kennedy took the title, 58-54,  in overtime.  </P> <P> The drive to the state championship game stalled in the semifinals, where the  Fighting Irish lost to Bakersfield Foothill.  </P> <P> Pettengill said those tense playoff games made him a better player. This  season, he has tried to pass on what he learned. He said the team often watches  a videotape of the triple-overtime game against Rolling Hills, trying to pick  out the little things that helped Kennedy win the game.  </P> <P> What they see again and again is Pettengill taking control and leading Kennedy  to the victory.  </P> <P> "In the playoffs last year, his teammates wanted him to have the ball in his  hands," Mayberry said. "He wanted it too. That's rare. I haven't had many  players like that."  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CONFLICT THEORIES TAKE ON WORLD  </P> <P> As a former business consultant, Solana Beach psychologist Thomas Gordon has  seen bosses straight out of "Nightmare on Elm Street" -- intimidating, Freddy  Krueger-type superiors who stop at nothing to get their way.  </P> <P> The 72-year-old author of seven books on interpersonal relationships --  including effective parenting and teaching -- has seen how unhealthy aggression  can poison communication between husbands and wives, students and teachers,  friends and lovers.  </P> <P> Now the founder of one of the world's largest human relations training firms,  whose theories are employed by the San Diego Unified School District and firms  such as Exxon, Coca-Cola and General Motors, wants to take his insights into  conflict-solving out of the consultation room and onto the street in what he  calls a global gesture toward world peace.  </P> <P> On Saturday, Gordon's Effectiveness Training Inc. will sponsor free conflict  resolution training seminars in more than 27 countries -- on the theory that  solving wars at home and at school isn't much different from solving wars  between nations.  </P> <P> More than 500 authorized instructors will conduct the eight-hour classes in all  sorts of unlikely venues -- from an auditorium at the Sorbonne in Paris to the  grand ballroom of a Bermuda hotel to five classroom locations throughout San  Diego -- counseling people in the art of negotiation.  </P> <P> It's no harmonic convergence, no connecting on telepathic waves, Gordon said --  just qualified authorities offering common-sense advice to help people get  along.  </P> <P> "You have to remember, negotiating between nations is done by people," he said.  "You can't achieve world peace all at once. You do it a relationship at a time.  These seminars are simply aimed at getting people to listen to one another.  </P> <P> "If we're successful, we'll show people there is an alternative to violence.  And that not only applies to breakdowns between nations, but between husbands  and wives, parents and children, teachers and students, just about anyone."  </P> <P> Called "No-Lose Conflict-Resolution Training," the course will teach  participants 15 and older specific skills to end power struggles, turn  arguments into agreements and replace competition with cooperation, Gordon  said.  </P> <P> His six-step method defuses power struggles by clarifying and meeting the needs  of both parties in any disagreement. The goal is teaching people that they  don't have to be the victor in every dispute.  </P> <P> "All relationships have conflicts -- they're inevitable," he said.  </P> <P> "But there are ways to handle these conflicts so neither person comes out  feeling like they're the loser. In the end, it will help people develop better,  more satisfying and enduring relationships."  </P> <P> Gordon has credentials to back up his experience. A former psychology professor  at the University of Chicago, he maintained a private practice in Pasadena for  18 years while writing a series of books to teach people how to communicate  more effectively. Today, his Solana Beach firm offers courses on all aspects of  interpersonal communication.  </P> <P> He is perhaps best known for his "Parent Effectiveness Training" and "Teacher  Effectiveness Training" books, which have sold millions of copies worldwide,  the psychologist said.  </P> <P> Beverly Foster, assistant superintendent for the San Diego Unifed School  District, said the district has endorsed several of Gordon's teaching  techniques. "We support what he's done," she said.  </P> <P> "He's very legitimate. He's done a lot of work with teachers and parents  throughout the county and the state. He's committed. He's not just one of those  fly-by-nights who comes rolling through with a package to sell."  </P> <P> Gordon, past president of the California State Psychological Assn. and member  of two White House task committees on children, said many of his peace-keeping  theories originated during years spent as a consultant for business and  industry.  </P> <P> "I found the most successful offices had supervisors who listened to their  staff, who solicited their opinions," he said. "But too many were run by overly  aggressive jerks who always made a point of getting their way."  </P> <P> The same scenario develops in households and at school, where parents and  teachers too often go overboard in their attempts to play boss.  </P> <P> "It's parents who use punishment to resolve conflicts, who never learn that  punishment doesn't control kids, who end up with antisocial children who suffer  psychologically, often the rest of their lives."  </P> <P> Gordon dreamed up the idea for the worldwide seminars several years ago as a  small gesture to further world peace. The classes will be taught by teachers  from South Africa to the Soviet Union who have been instructed in Gordon's  theories of one-on-one communication, he said.  </P> <P> So who does crisis-solver Gordon look up to as the Grand Master of  Negotiations?  </P> <P> "It's Jimmy Carter -- for the work he did at Camp David bringing a resolution  to the Arab-Israeli conflict," he said. "In four or five days, he took the  leaders of two countries that had been bitter enemies for as long as anyone can  remember and got them to come to terms on their differences.  </P> <P> "Two men who had never even shaken hands before hugged one another on world  television. We can all learn something from a gesture like that."  </P></p>

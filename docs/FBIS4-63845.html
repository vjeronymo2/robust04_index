			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correrspondents Grigoriy Arslanov and </F> Vyacheslav Tomilin]    [Text] Beijing 25 May TASS -- "The Chinese visit by Russian  Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin which will start on Thursday [26  May] and the second session of the Russian-Chinese  intergovernment commission on trade, economic, scientific and  technical cooperation which opens in Beijing on Wednesday, are  two independent events, but they are closely connected with each  other," Russian Vice-Premier Aleksandr Shokhin who is also  co-chairman of the commission, said at the Beijing airport today.    "I believe that this coincidence is beneficial for our  work,"  he said in an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS on his arrival  in Beijing. "We shall prepare to a great extent the economic  part of our premier's visit during the commission's work.    "We shall actively join the work of the premier's delegation  tomorrow, taking into account results achieved at the session."    The first session of the joint commission was held in Moscow  in 1992, while the next one was scheduled for last autumn.  "Regrettably," Shokhin said, "we are late a bit with its holding  due to political events in Russia. I mean the elections."    Turning to the present state of bilateral trade and economic  relations, he pointed to good results of the past two years: the  volume of trade turnover achieved even during the best years of  Soviet-Chinese cooperation, has been topped.    At the same time, some drop has been registered of late. In  the opinion of the vice-premier, this is explained by the fact  that traditional forms of cooperation have been exhausted.    "We plan to discuss new methods of cooperation with our  Chinese colleagues. I have in mind such mechanisms as access of  Russian exporters to the Chinese national currency and the right  of importers to choose commodity suppliers as well as long-term  investment cooperation.    "I believe that, using this forms of cooperation, we shall  be  able to bring Russian-Chinese trade and economic relations to a  new level of development," the vice-premier concluded.</p>

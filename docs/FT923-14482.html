			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Farmer's Viewpoint: Advice tops shopping lists at Royal Show  -Coping with reform is the main concern of visitors to Britain's premier farming event A CYNIC might suggest that there are only three areas of potential trading growth in UK agriculture today: weed-trimmers, to keep tidy the 15 per cent of British land that will be set-aside and growing weeds next year, following last month's reform of the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy; farm sales and receiverships, as growers get out of business, voluntarily or because they are pushed; and advice on how to cope with the reforms, which are so fundamental that they will change the face of Britain. The greatest need is for advice. It is offered in variety and profusion at this week's four-day Royal Show, which opened at Stoneleigh, Warwickshire, yesterday. The Royal Agricultural Society is staging seminars four times a day in a hastily erected marquee. Firms of land agents, management advisers and just about anyone who can drive a computer have programmed their portable machines with the information so far available to produce on-the-spot print-outs of inquirers' likely gains and losses. The organic farming movement announced yesterday that it did not want set-aside at all and would much prefer everybody to stop using fertilisers and sprays and reduce production capacity in what they claimed was a more environment-friendly way. They were only partly satisfied that for the first time Community funding might, as a result of the reform package, be available to help them. They will only believe that when they see it. Even the British Ministry of Agriculture, through its now part-privatised Agricultural Development and Advisory Service, was touting solutions to problems raised by the policies introduced by its own political masters - for a fee of course. But, as the leaflet accompanying the ADAS sales pitch conceded, the fine detail of the new EC agricultural policy, agreed on May 21, is unlikely to be announced until mid-August. The advice offered can only be approximate, therefore, but such is farmers' confusion at the complicated package, together with their need to know in order to be able to prepare cropping plans for implementation this autumn, that all such sources of advice are likely to be kept busy until the show closes on Thursday. Meanwhile, enthusiasm in the machinery lines was muted. Farmers enjoy looking at machinery and will buy it if they can possibly afford it - and sometimes when they cannot. But with 15 per cent less land to cultivate next year, there is neither the cash nor much need to purchase. Recognising this, some big manufacturers withdrew from the show only a few weeks ago. Notable among these was John Deere, the US/German tractor manufacturer, which has been a staunch supporter of the show for many years. It was following the example of other, similarly high-profile firms that have been pulling out by dribs and drabs since the farm recession began. The organisers claimed, quite accurately, that such absentees had been replaced by many more companies in the farm machinery business. But a chap selling hand-tools out of the back of a van is no substitute for a big international company with shiny tractors, flapping flags, and an entertainment complex spreading over half an acre of showground. It is all a sad reflection of the fact that UK tractor sales, always a good guide to the health or otherwise of the agricultural industry, have declined even further from the disastrously low 15,250 sold last year. This compares with between 28,000 and 29,000 in 1983. For 1992, the Agricultural Engineers' Association is predicting, perhaps somewhat optimistically, that sales will reach 15,000. It bases this forecast largely on the fact that many tractors are growing old and unreliable and will have to be replaced soon. I can only report that most of the farmers I met at the show told me they would not be buying anything until they had absorbed exactly what CAP reform meant to them and that few thought they would be in a buying mood after that. I share their feelings entirely. One often-expressed hope of relief from all this gloom at the Royal Show yesterday was the environmental aspect of CAP reform. The National Farmers' Union led the way. The reform package, Mr David Naish, the NFU president, pointed out, specifically allowed for farmers to be financially encouraged to improve conservation on farms. Moreover, limited cash had been allocated to help pay for such activities. For this to become worthwhile for British farmers, however, it would be necessary for the UK Treasury to match the EC allocation, and this at a time of financial stringency. Like the organic movement, therefore, the NFU fears that little real help may be forthcoming. To the casual observer the Royal Show may look much as it did ten years ago. But that is an illusion. The theme and concentration has moved from the production of food to marketing it, and to business expertise in general. The supermarket group, Safeway, led the way in bridging the gap a coupled of years ago by taking and sponsoring trade stands. This year it has been joined by Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer, together with McCains, the large buyer and processor of potatoes. Collectively, farmers hope, this represents a slowly growing acceptance by the food trade that it relies on British farmers for much of its raw materials. It is certainly welcomed by the farming industry at large, always provided that the retailing companies in question back their presence at the show with fair terms and prices for the food they buy from British farms. For, although farmers hope that selling to such multiple giants will enable them to earn premium prices, the present reality is that it is necessary to cut all possible costs to stay in business. I found myself questioning, as I walked around the show, the 150-year-old motto of the Royal Agricultural Society of England prominently displayed all around the ground. 'Practise with Science' it reads. That, I suggest, may now be a little out of date. Perhaps 'Survival through Economy' would now be more appropriate.</p>

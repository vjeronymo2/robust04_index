			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Interior Minister Nahit Mentese has said that all  ethnic groups in Turkey enjoy equal rights, adding that the  terms Kurdish identity and Kurdish political rights are part of  a plot hatched by foreign circles. He explained that the state  and security forces are very successful against separatist  terrorism. The regional people agree with us, he said, and they  come and thank us.    Mentese chaired a meeting of the Prime Minister's State of  Emergency Coordination Council in Ankara today. In an opening  speech, Mentese denied the claims that the PKK [Workers Party of  Kurdistan] is fighting for the Kurdish identity or for the  freedom of the Kurdish people. He said that the press and the  citizens of Kurdish origin living in southeastern Anatolia are  being misled about this issue. Certain circles are trying to  spread the rumor that there is a Kurdish problem, he said,  adding that the PKK is merely a terrorist organization that  sheds blood mercilessly. He asked: How can one say that this  organization fights for the freedom of the Kurdish people?    The interior minister said the council will review the  short-, medium-, and long-term measures to be taken regarding  this issue.</p>

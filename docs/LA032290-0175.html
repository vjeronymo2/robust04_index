			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLINIC KEEPS GIVING THE GIFT OF GOOD MEDICINE;  </P> <P> VENICE: A HEALTH-CARE CLINIC THAT OPENED 20 YEARS AGO FOR WHAT WAS HOPED WOULD  BE A SHORT TIME IS STILL OPEN. IN FACT, IT HAS JUST EXPANDED.  </P> <P> When the Venice Family Clinic opened its doors 20 years ago, its founders hoped  they would soon be out of business. Instead it has expanded and grown beyond  anyone's expectations.  </P> <P> The clinic initially was founded to appease a group of Venice residents who  were angry about the lack of affordable health care and the scarcity of doctors  in the area, according to Dr. Mayer Davidson, one of the founders. It is now  the family doctor for thousands of homeless, working poor and unemployed people  and is bigger than ever.  </P> <P> "Ideally, it should have gone out of business. Everyone should have affordable  health care," Davidson said.  </P> <P> But demand for its services have grown, and in response the clinic opened a  newly expanded Venice facility March 19 to accommodate thousands of additional  patient visits.  </P> <P> The 11,000-square-foot, $3-million expansion adjoining the existing building at  604 Rose Ave. triples the size of the facility, and will allow it to handle  15,000 more patient visits a year for a total of about 45,000 a year, Executive  Director Fern Seizer said.  </P> <P> The white, airy rooms of the new two-story building house office space, a large  waiting room, examination rooms, counseling rooms, a dispensary and a full  laboratory.  </P> <P> The expansion will probably increase the clinic's annual operating budget from  $2 million to about $3 million, Seizer said. Eighty percent of the budget comes  from private donations, she said, including the proceeds of the annual Venice  Art Walk, a foot tour of Venice artists' homes and studios.  </P> <P> Although it will be difficult to come up with the additional money needed to  operate the expanded facility, Seizer said, it is badly needed.  </P> <P> Last year, at least 5,000 people were turned away because of lack of room to  treat them, she said. "Many get discouraged because we're so crowded," she  said.  </P> <P> The clinic's patients are a poor, uninsured population. About 92% have incomes  below the poverty level -- $12,000 a year for a family of four -- and 94% have  no health insurance, Seizer said.  </P> <P> Most uninsured patients depend on county facilities for medical treatment, but  those facilities have also become crowded.  </P> <P> Even those people who can afford private care could have difficulty finding it  in the Venice area, where the doctor shortage that prompted Davidson and others  to found the clinic has not changed much. The Venice Family Clinic offers an  alternative.  </P> <P> Mothers can make same-day appointments for their children to get shots,  prescriptions, or an examination. Walk-in appointments are available to the  homeless who need medical treatment or counseling. Seniors can get eyeglasses.  All of the services are given on a free or pay-what-you-can basis.  </P> <P> The demand for these services sometimes means a long wait in the clinic's  crowded lobby. Some patients come from as far away as downtown and  South-Central Los Angeles, Seizer said. Despite the obstacles, the clinic for  many has become the family doctor that will take care of most of their medical  needs.  </P> <P> When a patient has a medical problem the clinic cannot handle, the patient is  referred to one of several hospitals -- Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital, St.  John's Hospital, and Los Angeles County-UCLA Medical Center -- that provide  free services arranged for at the clinic.  </P> <P> On a recent Wednesday afternoon, the clinic's waiting room was warm and noisy,  with mothers and children waiting to be seen for same-day appointments, and  homeless men and women who had come in on a walk-in basis.  </P> <P> Andrea Ramirez, 3, clung to her mother's knees as the two waited to be seen.  Andrea had a fever and an ear infection, her mother, Rosalia, said in Spanish.  Her work as a maid does not provide medical insurance for her and her two  children.  </P> <P> "I've been coming here for 10 years," Ramirez said. "At times we can get  Medi-Cal, at times we can't. Sometimes I take the children to other clinics or  doctors, but they're expensive or don't accept Medi-Cal. Here, you have to  wait, but they treat you well. And they give good, effective medicine."  </P> <P> Ramirez's case is not unusual, Seizer said. Many families depend on the clinic  sporadically for years. According to statistics compiled by the clinic's  directors, Latinos make up a majority of the patients, many of them recent  immigrants who work low-paying jobs.  </P> <P> One crucial service the clinic provides is free medical care for the homeless,  who make up about 27% of the patients, both on a walk-in basis and through  outreach teams that make weekly visits to nearby homeless shelters.  </P> <P> At one of these shelters, the Bible Tabernacle church in Venice, about 150  homeless women and children bed down every night on the sanctuary's benches and  floors, according to Director Mark Hilst.  </P> <P> Every Tuesday evening, the clinic's coordinator of services for the homeless,  Diane Foray, brings a doctor, a psychologist or social worker, a nurse  practitioner, and one or two other volunteers to the church. They set up tables  and screens in the church basement and examine or treat whoever needs help. In  two hours, they may see 15 patients, some for the first time, some for  follow-up treatment after previous examinations at the church or clinic, Foray  said.  </P> <P> Most of the families at the shelter suffer from poor health, said nurse  practitioner Mary Smith, who has volunteered her time at the clinic for the  past six years. "They may not have enough clothes, so they catch a cold. Here  it's like a family. When one person catches a cold, everyone else does," she  said.  </P> <P> Some of the children, many from abusive or otherwise dysfunctional families,  suffer from mental health problems expressed through sleep disturbances,  anxiety and thumb-sucking, Smith said. Because the clinic is not a formal  mental-health agency, it treats the mentally ill mainly through diagnosis and  referral to county facilities, she said.  </P> <P> Sometimes the best help the workers can give is to listen. "They very often  just want to unload. They want someone to listen to them and treat them with  kindness," said psychologist Joanne Jubelier, who has a regular practice in  Beverly Hills but volunteers her time at the clinic.  </P> <P> "The people I see in private practice have the resources to take their kid to  be diagnosed, or to see their physician. These families don't have the  resources to even identify their needs," she said.  </P> <P> Krystal Gregory, 27, said she came to the Bible Tabernacle for shelter after  her mother and 4-month-old boy died, leaving her depressed and dependent on her  father, with whom she didn't get along. She didn't have a husband, and had  recently gotten out of the Army. "I was never independent before. I was  suicidal, I was crying out for help," she said.  </P> <P> Gregory got medication for a cough and skin rash from the clinic, along with  some compassionate counseling, she said.  </P> <P> VENICE FAMILY CLINIC AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> * Clinic officials say about 92% of the patients have incomes below the poverty  level -- $12,000 a year for a family of four -- and 94 percent have no health  insurance.  </P> <P> * The clinic provides free medical care for the homeless, who make up about 27%  of the patients. Treatment is supplied through a walk-in basis and outreach  teams that make weekly visits to nearby homeless shelters.  </P> <P> * The newly expanded 11,000-square foot facility will be able to handle an  additional 15,000 patient visits. Clinic officials say that will about 45,000  total visits a year.  </P></p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Back to the drawing-board: Financial self-regulation in the UK is facing mounting calls for reform Eleven years ago, the City was thrown into protracted wrangling by the government's appointment of Professor Jim Gower to recommend how the UK financial services industry should be regulated. His report, and the rancorous debate that followed, led to the Financial Services Act of 1986 and the painful transformation of the investment industry's regulatory structure. After that gruelling experience, the last thing you might expect is that City grandees would be calling for another wholesale redesign of the regulatory system. Yet that is exactly what an increasing number of influential figures say they want. More surprising still, some want to undo the City's main achievement last time round - keeping the government at arm's length through a system best described as self-regulation within a statutory framework. Listen to Mr Mick Newmarch, chairman of Britain's largest life insurer, Prudential Corporation: 'The Financial Services Act is an unsatisfactory basis for the adequate protection of savers.' He went on to attack the principle of self-regulation: 'The government should now acknowledge,' he said, 'that the experiment has failed and begin to organise investor protection on a fully statutory basis under direct government control.' Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank and perhaps the City's most experienced lawyer, also wants to sweep away the present collection of self-regulatory agencies. A powerful single regulatory body 'seems ultimately to be inevitable', he said. 'To end the fatigue of regulatory change, perhaps the time has come when we should take this step with one bound.' The regulators themselves have joined the chorus. 'Self-regulation is drinking in the last-chance saloon,' said Mr Christopher Sharples, chief executive of the Securities and Futures Association, the self-regulatory body for wholesale financial service firms. And Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, the central self-regulatory body, is likely to urge big changes in the system when he completes his current review of the way it works, commissioned by the Treasury in July. Dissatisfaction with the present system stems from the way in which it tries  -and too often fails - to tackle three separate issues. The regulatory structure is supposed to root out fraud; to ensure consumer protection and fair dealing for the millions of retail customers of financial services businesses; and to supervise a range of complex wholesale financial markets. On all three counts, it is failing: Fraud. The most spectacular recent failure was the ease with which the late Robert Maxwell, using a regulated fund management company which he controlled, was able to walk off with more than Pounds 400m of money from pension schemes, threatening the security in old age of more than 20,000 former employees. The Maxwell case revealed poor performance by Imro, the self-regulatory body that watches over fund managers. More important, it highlighted the fact that the reforms of the mid-1980s had left a big gap: they did not provide a strong legal structure for pension funds, something the Gower report had called for. The Maxwell case aside, there have been serious criticisms of the way investigations that may culminate in allegations of fraud are handled. For a suspected fraud involving trading in the shares of a quoted company, for example, investigators from the Stock Exchange, the Securities and Futures Association, the Securities and Investments Board, the City police fraud squad and the Serious Fraud Office may all be involved, with final decisions on prosecution taken by the head of the SFO and the director of public prosecutions. The result - as in the Blue Arrow case - is long drawn-out investigations, a huge number of charges, and cases that drag on for years. The current system of prosecuting suspected wrongdoers, said Lord Alexander, is 'slow, expensive and unpredictable . . . It is unfair both to the public and the accused.' Consumer protection. From the outset this has proved contentious. Prof Gower was determined to bring the marketing of retail investment products, such as insurance, into the supervisory net. Initially, the government planned a self-regulatory body called the Marketing of Investments Board to handle this, but - after worries it would lead to fragmented supervision - it was eventually merged into SIB. The debate about standards of consumer protection continues: the Office of Fair Trading, the competition watchdog, has repeatedly asked SIB to revise its disclosure rules for commission payments on life assurance policies, and may yet urge the chancellor to reject them. And, while the rules applying to all businesses under the Financial Services Act are broadly equivalent, different SROs enforce them with varying degrees of vigour. For instance, Lautro, which supervises the life insurers, has insisted that its members make refunds to people who have been sold inappropriate personal pensions. Fimbra, the self-regulatory body for independent financial advisers, and SIB have told the firms they directly regulate to adopt new guidelines for the sale of personal pensions, but have not asked them to make refunds for policies mis-sold in the past. The crisis of the regulatory system has not come to a head over consumer groups' complaints, but over the need to salvage Fimbra. It has been unable to raise enough money from members to regulate its patch effectively or to make its full share of contributions to the Investors Compensation Scheme. SIB's solution, a merger of Fimbra with other self-regulatory bodies to form a new Personal Investments Authority (PIA), has proved extremely unpopular with big banks and insurance companies, and has led to the current calls for change. Wholesale markets. Here, the record of the reforms has been best. The government decided that stronger supervision of wholesale markets was necessary to cope with the influx of international firms into London's securities markets as a result of Big Bang, the wave of deregulation going on at the same time as the debate over regulatory reform. Initially, the new regulators' approach - very detailed rulebooks and a strong emphasis on legalism - was resented by the City, because of its costs and complexity. After a change to simpler rulebooks was introduced by Sir David Walker, the second chairman of SIB, some of these complaints have lessened. But there is still a feeling that the system is unnecessarily complex, with too many bodies sharing responsibility, and too few really first-rate people taking part in self-regulation. These are the arguments mustered by those who push for sweeping regulatory reforms. There is also a healthy amount of commercial self-interest, however, in the call for change. The row over the PIA, which has brought the debate over the future of regulation out into the open, is a good example. There has been intense wrangling over the size of the PIA's board and just who should sit on it. Set at 30 members, it is designed so that neither life insurers, IFAs or public interest members have a majority. But that balancing act, as unwieldy as it is, has still not guaranteed the success of the new body. The life insurers, who have subsidised both the operating costs and ICS contributions of Fimbra members, have said they will not join unless 95 per cent of all the firms in retail financial services join as well. And that means the banks and building societies who are encroaching on life insurers' territory with increasing confidence and efficiency. The banks, for their part, have chosen to be regulated by SIB directly, and see no reason why they should join. 'Why should we bail out the independent financial advisers who are selling the products of the life insurers?' asked one banker involved in the discussions. Even if the PIA gets off the ground, it may not serve the interests of the investing public. Last week, Ms Julia Leisching, chief policy and administration officer at Lautro, announced she would not serve the new PIA because too little thought was being given to improving consumer protection. Investor protection was the theme stressed in the second reading of the Financial Services Bill by an obscure Conservative backbencher, Mr Anthony Nelson. 'Supervisory boards and self-regulating organisations historically have been and remain too practitioner-oriented and cosy,' he said. 'The principal function of both the designated agency (SIB) and the SROs should not be to provide an easy working machine which is not subjected to criticism. Their principal objective is to protect investors. Their face must always be pointed towards the investor, and they must apply that criterion to every decision.' Mr Nelson, by a happy chance, is now in a position to do something about putting his strongly expressed views into practice. He is the minister at the Treasury responsible for the supervision of the financial system. He will soon be weighing up Mr Large's review and deciding whether to try to put the whole system back into the melting pot. The issues he will have to face are these. First, is the current system working well, apart from the problem of supervising independent financial advisers? If that is the only substantial problem, then steps may have to be taken to force a solution, perhaps by withdrawing the right of a financial services firm to choose its own regulator and obliging the banks and insurers to join the PIA. If he decides there is a more widespread problem with the system, he will have to consider how to resolve it. The more sweeping proposals - Mr Newmarch's wish for direct regulation of the insurance industry by the government, for example, or Lord Alexander's call for a single regulator with powers to levy heavy civil penalties on miscreant firms and individuals, in parallel with any criminal proceedings - will certainly require more legislation. Such a revised act would need to fit with the recently agreed EC Investment Services Directive. It would require a new institutional structure, with fresh efforts to balance the participation of practitioners with the day-to-day efforts of full-time regulators. Mr Nelson and his advisers may well blanch at the thought. But they may have little choice but to contemplate it. With such heavyweight figures in the City coming out so publicly in favour of change, the present system may be dangerously close to the limits of its credibility.</p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> Sallinen Premiere Expected in L.A.: Peter Hemmings, general director of Los  Angeles Music Center Opera, is expected to announce the world premiere today of  Aulis Sallinen's fourth opera, "Kullervo," at the Music Center in early 1992.  Hemmings will make the announcement in Helsinki, Finland, jointly with Ilkka  Kuusisto, general manager of Finnish National Opera, which will produce the  work at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Feb. 22-March 1, 1992, in association  with LAMCO. The Finnish contingent will furnish the leading singers -- led by  baritone Jorma Hynninen, who is artistic director of the Finnish company -- the  chorus and conductor Ulf Soderblom. The composer has fashioned his own libretto  for "Kullervo," loosely basing it on the play "Kullervo" by the 19th-Century  Finnish playwright Aleksis Kivi. SHAUNA SNOW  </P></p>

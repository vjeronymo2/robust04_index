			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Technology: Sharper image on the box 'WE'RE living in a pixel world,' believes Willy Johnson, chief executive of Durant, a company better know in Japan than in Johnson's home town of Lymington, on the south coast of England. Pixels, picture elements which form the images on miniature flat-screen television sets and portable computers, are Durant's business. Or more precisely, Durant is in the business of 'depixellation' - getting rid of them. The 'pixel problem', as Johnson calls it, is that liquid crystal screens produce stunning pictures but are tiny. Manufacturers have been unable to produce larger flat screens because the quality control needed is exorbitantly expensive to attain. Just one malfunctioning pixel and the whole picture is ruined - and a 16.5-inch screen, for example, would need more than 1.2m pixels. The most obvious other solution would be to blow up the picture, but then each pixel becomes clearly visible, destroying the picture quality. And this is where Durant's technology comes in. Several Japanese games and computer makers are now testing Durant's Microsharp technology, which is essentially a series of holographic lenses. Superimposed over the liquid crystal screen, the lenses spread the light emitted by each pixel so that they merge into a continuous picture, with the light emitted from adjacent ones. These graded refractive index (Grin) lenses are produced by exposing a sheet of photopolymer film, made by Du Pont, to ultra-violet light. Microsharp has taken eight years to develop and Johnson is confident the company has secured watertight international patents. Durant is on the point of signing an agreement with a US company for manufacture of the lenses. After that, the possibilities for Microsharp could be endless, believes Johnson. Television pictures could be displayed on large screens or projected onto walls. Helmets for virtual reality could incorporate high-quality images displayed on two screens inside the helmet. Microsharp could even be used to produce a more efficient generation of solar-powered electricity generators.</p>

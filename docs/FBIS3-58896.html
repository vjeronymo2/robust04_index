			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Hanover (DPA)--Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel,  chairman of the Free Democratic Party, has come out in favor of  further close cooperation with Russia. At his party's national  conference in Hanover today of representatives for the European  elections, Kinkel said: "Russia remains a very important  security partner in the East for us."    The more successful cooperation with Russia is, the quicker  the prospect of NATO membership for the candidates among the  Eastern reformist states can become a reality. It should be  made clear to the reformist states, however, that no new rifts  must be created, Kinkel stressed. Russia and Ukraine must not  be excluded. "This would be the most stupid thing we could do."    The foreign minister went on to say that economic  stabilization in the East is a basic precondition for lasting  security in all of Europe. The response to the electoral  success of old and new enemies of democracy in the East is the  Partnership for Peace offered by NATO. This would also take the  wind out of the sails of the right-wing nationalists in Russia  for the time being.    Commenting on the European elections to be held on 12 June,  Kinkel said these elections will be crucial because the process  of European unification is important for Germans in particular.  "We must use these elections to mobilize the citizens of  Europe." Today, the national economies in Europe are so closely  interlinked that growth, employment, and competitiveness can  only be created by joint efforts. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Take a Coke, a glass of Moet, shake well There was a pleasing symmetry about the news that both Coca-Cola and Moet et Chandon were launching advertising campaigns this month; two world-famous brands, both under threat from arriviste competitors, giving their respective bottles a good shake to spray the opposition away in time for Christmas. Both drinks stand for fizz, froth and fun, but they manage to appeal to opposite instincts in us. Coca-Cola, hitting back at the supermarkets with a Pounds 4m television campaign, taps that youthful, clean-living, democratic impulse which we should all, in principle, like to share: its message is shamelessly romantic, all-embracing, hopeful and artfully naive. It is a NOW product, a multi-national beverage for the modern world. Moet et Chandon, on the other hand, in devising its first-ever British advertising campaign, has no hesitation in harking back to the louche air of fin-de-siecle Paris to promote its appeal, its curvy, Mucha-esque siren giving us the kind of sultry come-on which the clueless boys and girls in Coke-land would probably interpret as a touch of flu. Here is wickedness, expense and exclusivity, and democracy be hanged. It is, of course, the story of the new world versus the old; brash, in-your-face Americana meeting creaking, decadent Europa across the billboards, the latest in an endless series of cultural bouts. The relationship between America and Europe, and France in particular, is actually more complex than is commonly supposed. One only has to watch the opening frames of Jean-Luc Godard's A Bout de Souffle to appreciate the happy symbiosis that can be achieved between the two cultures: street-styled existentialism and B-movie beefcake combining effortlessly to provide some of the most influential images of the 1960s (American pop culture intriguingly paid back by almost naming the captain of the new USS Enterprise after the iconoclastic director). The mutual exchange of jokes went on: America sent Jerry Lewis to France, where he became a cult hero; the French took revenge by sending a succession of the most ponderous philosophers of all time to lecture to the brightest-eyed students in the world. Years later, Allan Bloom would write The Closing of the American Mind to attack the consequences of continental thinkers on his country's sensibility, while in Paris, something called Euro-Disney appeared to add spice to all those interminable cafe conversations. Semickeyotics or what? The most magnificent example of Franco-American horseplay is Stanley Donen's romantic comedy Funny Face, in which an avuncular Fred Astaire wins the heart of Audrey Hepburn by dancing rings around a group of earnest philosophers in hooped shirts and berets. Here was American brashness - and intellectual insecurity - in abundance, but displayed with such good humour and brio that it was difficult to take seriously. Who could declare cultural war on Astaire, for goodness sake? What is remarkable, however, is that, even in the trans-global, multi-faceted 1990s, the cultural battle between new and old world continues. Its most obvious manifestation in London in recent weeks has been in the box office skirmish between Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colours: Red, a conflict which began at this year's Cannes Film Festival and at which the American was controversially rewarded with the Palme d'Or. Here is a classic choice, between the hard-edged, primary-coloured, self-referential savagery of Tarantino and Kieslowski's quizzical, open-ended musings on relationships and destiny, the two directors possessing in common an immense talent but as divided in their world views as those bottles of fizzy drink. In London, as at Cannes, it is Tarantino who is winning, which I have to say depresses me a little. It is nothing to do with being anti-American, nor feeling censorious about violence; it is just that I have grave suspicions about a culture which so happily ironises its most conspicuous flaws. In standing up for little old Europe, I'd like to teach the world to sing a rather different tune.</p>

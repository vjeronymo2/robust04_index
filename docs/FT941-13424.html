			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Saudis welcome Arafat coolly Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, left Saudi Arabia yesterday after a two-day visit which marked the first thaw in relations between the two sides since the PLO support for Iraq in the Gulf war. Saudi anger at the PLO stance has not eased significantly since the conclusion of the war and Mr Arafat's meeting with King Fahd bin Abdul Aziz was described by one diplomat as 'correct but cool'. The Saudis have demanded an apology from Arab states and organisations which failed to rally to the support of the Gulf states following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 'We cannot forgive, and we cannot forget,' said a senior Saudi official recently. 'But there are two things in this world which you cannot escape, and they are families and neighbours.' It was always expected that at some time Mr Arafat, as part of the Arab family, would again be received in Saudi Arabia. But officials have also made clear that the PLO could not expect any further direct financial support, one of the main objectives of his visit. Saudi Arabia has agreed to provide an initial Dollars 100m (Pounds 67.5m) for specific infrastructure projects in the occupied Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, following an Israeli withdrawal. Officials in Riyadh stressed that its aid would be directed through international agencies and closely monitored. Support in Saudi Arabia for the September 13 declaration of principles by Israel and the PLO was tempered both by its hostility to Mr Arafat personally, and more generally by the belief that the Arab negotiators were more likely to achieve a comprehensive peace by retaining a united front.</p>

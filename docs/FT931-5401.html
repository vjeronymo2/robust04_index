			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Meciar reiterates opposition to Czech-type economic reforms SLOVAK Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar has reiterated opposition to radical economic reforms of the type embraced by the Czech Republic, and blamed its reform programme for a decline in the Slovak economy, Reuter reports from Bratislava. Local media quoted Mr Meciar as having told a rally that 'Klaus reforms', a reference to Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus, were unsuitable for Slovakia. According to reports, Mr Meciar said that Mr Klaus's economic policies had led to a 30 per cent decline in the Slovak economy. He said his government would not devalue the Slovak crown, but he called for restrictions on 'non-essential' imports. Mr Klaus introduced sweeping reforms when he became finance minister of what was then the Czechoslovakian federation.</p>

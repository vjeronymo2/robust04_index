			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Towards sound money THE CONVENTIONAL argument for making central banks independent is that politicians cannot be relied on to conduct a responsible monetary policy because of electoral pressures. How ironic, then, that France should now be introducing legislation to reduce political control over the Banque de France after an election in which the main parties of both right and left were committed to policies of exceptional monetary stringency. The outcome will reinforce suspicions of reverse causality in the statistical evidence that countries with independent central banks have lower rates of inflation. Those countries where there is a genuine consensus for low inflation, as in France over the past 10 years, will naturally be more prone to remove control of monetary policy from politicians. Not that this invalidates the case for independent central banking. Since it is now widely accepted that there is no medium or long-term trade-off between higher inflation and higher output, the monetary authorities can only aspire to achieve the limited goal of price stability. Certainly the British experience indicates that shorter-term gains in output and employment from unanticipated inflation simply result over a period of years in more inflation for the same level of output. How far a restructured and more autonomous Banque de France will add to an already credible French monetary policy is nonetheless a moot point. The government proposes to retain control over decisions on the exchange rate. As long as the Bundesbank remains the anchor of the European exchange rate mechanism and the French government remains committed to present parities, this implies that central bank decisions about interest rates are of limited import. By the same token, if the resolve to maintain the franc fort policy should weaken, the reconstituted central bank would have little say in the decision. Should the franc replace the D-Mark as the anchor of the system before any move to monetary union, the institutional arrangements would inevitably take on increased significance. The French government proposes that the jobs of the governor, two deputy governors and a group of six experts remain, in effect, within the government's gift, but with a measure of independence coming from lengthy tenure - six years for the top trio and nine for the experts. This is a less powerful formula than the one with which a federal system has endowed the Bundesbank. It has more in common with the US Federal Reserve, where appointments are made by the administration. The question is whether the clubbiness of the elite that dominates French economic policy-making will result in rather less independence than the outward forms might indicate. Equally important is the question of accountability. The bank's chief objective of price stability, which mirrors the Maastricht treaty's European central banking model, is undefined, while procedures for monitoring performance are opaque. But the fact that a retreat from disinflationary policy will require a legislative process is an important discipline. Yet the benefits of central bank independence are probably greatest for countries such as Britain, where past failure has undermined the credibility of monetary policy. In the UK, more than in France, institutional reform is needed. Merely changing the face at the top of the British Treasury would not be enough.</p>

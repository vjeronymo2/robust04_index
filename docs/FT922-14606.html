			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Complaints against brokers up COMPLAINTS about securities and futures brokers increased slightly last year, according to a report published today, John Authers writes. Nevertheless, the complaints bureau of the Securities and Futures Association, the self-regulatory organisation for the industry formed a year ago by the merger of two other watchdogs, was given a clean bill of health by the first annual report of its complaints commissioner. The report shows that 1,206 complaints were received by the SFA. Of those, 73 should have been made direct to the Stock Exchange, leaving a total of 1,133, compared with 1,115 in 1990 and 1,025 in 1989. Mr Keith Woodley, the authority's complaints commissioner, found that in general the complaints had been reviewed carefully and quickly. He did not force the SFA to reconsider any finding and made suggestions for further action in only 12 per cent of the cases he examined. Diameter Stockbrokers, a cut-price, high-volume stockbroker based in Guildford, Surrey, which specialised in cheap privatisation deals, generated 206 complaints - by far the most. It ceased trading on June 7 last year and has been declared in default by the Investors' Compensation Scheme. Complaints were made against 158 firms, 11.4 per cent of the SFA's membership of 1,380. In 1990, complaints were received against 9.5 per cent of the previous regulator's membership. Only nine firms, including Diameter, had more than 10 complaints against them. Delays in settlement and sending share certificates were the most common causes.</p>

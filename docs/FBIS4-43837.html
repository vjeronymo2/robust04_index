			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mikael Pentikainen: "National Defense </F> Information Planning Board Poll: Nearly Half Support EU  Membership"]    [Text] Support for Finland's membership in the European  Union [EU] has been growing over the last six months. In  April-May, 48 percent supported it. An opinion poll commissioned  by the National Defense Information Planning Board (MTS) reports  this.    Since 41 percent supported it in a similar poll last  October,  the increase is slightly larger than the margin for error.    The Finnish Gallup Company interviewed 1,001 Finns in person  for the MTS between 25 April and 15 May. The question on the EU  in the poll went as follows: "What is your opinion on our  country's membership in the EU? Do you support Finland's  membership in the EU or not?"    In the latest poll, 32 percent of the respondents opposed  it.  Their number has decreased by 4 percentage points during the  past six months. A fifth of them either could not or would not  voice an opinion.  <H5>  Women More Opposed Than Men </H5>   Men clearly more enthusiastically support Finland's  membership than do women: Fifty-four percent of the men are for  membership while 43 percent of the women are of this opinion.    The most suspicious of the age groups of membership is the  50-64 group, in which there are slightly more opponents of it  than supporters. In the other age groups there are clearly more  supporters than opponents.    Sixty-one percent of the high school graduates support  membership, while 37 percent of the elementary school graduates  are in favor of membership.    Of the occupational categories, the most vehement opponents  are farmers, 16 percent of whom would bring Finland into the EU.  Forty-two percent of the workers want membership, and 36 percent  oppose it.    About 60 percent of businessmen and white-collar workers are  in favor of membership.  <H5>  More Opponents Among Centrists </H5>   Of the followers of the different parties, the Conservatives  are the most enthusiastic supporters of membership. Seventy-one  percent of them support membership. Support for membership among  Social Democratic Party [SDP] constituents is 54 percent and  opposition to it is 27 percent. In the Center Party the relative  strength is 45 to 35 against membership. Supporters of  membership among the Greens, according to the poll, are in the  majority with 43 percent for and 30 percent against it. In the  Left League the opponents have the upper hand with a percentage  ratio of 60 to 31.    The poll commissioned by the MTS also indicates that  citizens  feel that Finland's economic situation is improving.    Fifty-three percent of the interviewees think that Finland's  economic situation is reducing their security. Six months ago 78  percent of them were of this opinion.  <H5>  TV News Poll: Support for EU Is Appropriate </H5>   According to an opinion poll made public Tuesday [7 June] on  the Finnish Broadcasting Corporation television news, Finns'  views on EU membership remained nearly unchanged throughout the  spring.    According to the poll, 44 percent of all Finns supported  membership in the EU at the end of May and the beginning of  June. Thirty percent of them opposed membership and 26 percent  could not yet voice an opinion.    Last April 47 percent of them supported it, 31 opposed it,  and 21 percent could not voice an opinion.</p>

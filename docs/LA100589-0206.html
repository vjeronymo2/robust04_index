			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SHOCK OF THE OLD: NATIONAL GALLERY'S FRANS HALS SHOW  </P> <P> Frans Hals' paintings have no precedents. His snapshot informalities and  democratic kindnesses were entirely original. No earlier Dutch Master dared the  unconcealed boldness, the watch-me-paint-it vigor, of his swiftly moving brush.  His markings sing of genius. His sitters look alive.  </P> <P> And yet no free and forceful painter has had a harder time holding his position  in the pantheon of painters than the portraitist of Haarlem (1581-1666) whose  retrospective exhibition went on view last weekend at the National Gallery of  Art.  </P> <P> Hals' reputation began its oscillations long before his death.  </P> <P> Hals, when in his 40s, dwelt among the rich. Yet he died in crushing poverty.  In the winter of 1664, when he was in his 80s, shivering in misery in his  rented room in Holland, he did not have enough to buy a brick of peat. His  paintings, for a while, had been as popular in Haarlem as Warhol's in  Manhattan, but then his reputation crashed. His lifelike, honest portraits --  he painted only portraits -- have been variously regarded since as worthless or  invaluable, as slapdash or sublime.  </P> <P> Kenneth Clark once scorned them "(all except the last) as revoltingly cheerful  and horribly skillful." But Manet thought them awesome. So did Whistler and  Sargent, Cassatt and Courbet. To those who wield brushes, Hals -- a painter's  painter -- has been a beacon, an exemplar.  </P> <P> But aristocratic connoisseurs have often found his portraits coarse. Sir Joshua  Reynolds, for example, thought them hasty and unpolished. Marcel Proust's  Duchesse de Guermantes thought his sitters common; she suggested they be  viewed, as one might view riffraff, safely, from a distance, from a quickly  moving tram. Other connoisseurs (on apocryphal information) decided the painter  was a lowlife-loving drunk.  </P> <P> Vincent van Gogh revered him. He loved the way Hals painted "in one rush." He  loved his subjects too. Hals never painted gods, shepherds in Arcadia, kings or  martyred saints. "He did portraits," wrote van Gogh, "and nothing, nothing  else."  </P> <P> Hals painted Gypsy girls and fishwives, young businessmen with money in the  bank, magistrates and drinkers, urchins and committees, cackling crones and  cooks. Van Gogh thought his countryman's truthful vision of humanity "worth as  much as Dante's Paradise and the Michelangelos and the Raphaels and even the  Greeks."  </P> <P> The market has expressed opinions as diverse. Consider, for example, the  various values it has placed on Hals' "Willem van Heythuysen" of 1625, one of  the 60 portraits included in the show. That slightly pompous painting -- or, to  be precise, its slightly pompous sitter with his silver-pommeled sword, his  ruff of costly lace and his suit of black embroidered silk -- fairly brags of  wealth.  </P> <P> Don't let the sword mislead you. Van Heythuysen was no soldier; he made his  money in the textile trade, and he made a lot of it. Hals invites us all to  smile at his yuppiesque pretensions. Harvard's distinguished Seymour Slive, who  catalogued the show, tells us that van Heythuysen collected "a vast number of  paintings, expensive furniture and silver, a large library, jewelry," and that  he also sported, beneath his rich black suit, "red satin underwear."  </P> <P> Hals was in high fashion when the painting was commissioned. He was out of  fashion in 1800 when it was auctioned in Haarlem for "the trifling sum of 51  guilders." But then his fortunes changed. After Hals was rediscovered in the  mid-19th Century (by the Frenchman Thore-Burger, who had also rediscovered  Vermeer) painters, by the score, began to troop to Haarlem as if to a shrine.  Hals was back in fashion the next time that the work was sold, from the  Liechtenstein Collection to the Alte Pinakothek in Munich in 1969. This time  the same portrait brought 12 million German marks. No single work of art had  ever sold for more.  </P> <P> Such fluctuating readings and wildly swinging values place a sort of question  mark above the gallery's exhibit, the first Hals show arranged in a quarter of  a century. Will the public yawn -- or marvel -- at those matrons in their caps  of lace, those children with the flying hair, those confident Dutch burghers in  their somber suits of black? Is the master due for yet another re-evaluation?  How will 1989 respond to Frans Hals?  </P> <P> If his reputation flags again the fault will not be his. Our time's  acceleration, the ubiquity of the camera, and abstract painting's triumph must  surely share the blame.  </P> <P> The trouble is that Hals' greatest innovations -- his suddenness and speed, his  republican inclusiveness and, especially, the vigor of his emphatic, unsmoothed  brush strokes -- now seem utterly familiar.  </P> <P> The factors that so moved daring younger painters when Hals was rediscovered  today seem slightly tame.  </P> <P> Take his suddenness, for instance, his astonishing exactitude, his ability to  tear an instant out of time -- say, the dawning of a smile, or the quick and  casual gesture of an arm tossed across a chair back, or the flash of  recognition in the slightly bleary eyes of the Rijksmuseum's "Merry Drinker"  who raises up his glass to welcome a good friend (the good friend is the  viewer) who has just walked through the door.  </P> <P> To seize the passing moment, to make the transitory permanent, is difficult in  paint. With a camera it's a snap.  </P> <P> Hals's open-minded fondness for different sorts of folks, for young as well as  old, drunk as well as sober, rich as well as poor, struck a special chord in  19th-Century Europe as France's Second Empire and other monarchies decayed.  Courbet, who loved his portraits, and copied them with care, was a radical  republican. It was far more than the mastery of various shades of black ("Frans  Hals," wrote van Gogh, "had no less than 27 blacks") that endeared Hals to  Manet, for Manet, too, made his various countrymen his subject -- the street  cleaners, the businessmen, the prostitutes, the drunks. Hals, as Thore-Burger  wrote, had viewed 17th-Century Holland as "a country of equality." Americans as  various as Whistler, Cassatt, Robert Henri, Frank Duveneck and William Merritt  Chase, all of whom loved Hals, must have felt some special kinship to his  all-men-are-brothers tolerance.  </P> <P> Hals, observed van Gogh, had glimpsed the one "great simple thing: the painting  of humanity, or rather of a whole republic, by the simple means of  portraiture."  </P> <P> Though some of his best-loved and most familiar works -- the Wallace  Collection's "Laughing Cavalier," the Louvre's "Gypsy Girl," the Frick's  "Portrait of a Man" and many of his largest multifigure portraits -- were not  available for loan, the gallery's exhibit, despite its modest size, provides a  superb survey of his art.  </P> <P> Hals must have painted quickly, and directly on the canvas. Lesser painters  have to work their portraits up from sketches, but if Hals ever made a drawing,  none has managed to survive. Looking at his pictures you instead get the  feeling that he reached into the world and somehow plucked his likenesses --  with their granite-like conceptions and quickly darting brush strokes -- whole  from real life. The man did not need sketches. For Hals the various acts of  forging forms in color, casting them in light, and orchestrating brush strokes  somehow became one.  </P> <P> Though van Gogh was convinced that Hals painted "in one rush," and though his  finest portraits strike you all at once, you should battle through that  quickness and try to view them slowly, as you would a Cubist work, stroke by  telling stroke. We read faces instantaneously. Because that sudden recognition  is built into our brains, the viewer may be tempted to seize these paintings at  a glance, to get them, and move on. But fight against that hurry. Hals should  not be gulped. His pictures should be grazed.  </P> <P> Look at how he painted hands, the whiteness of the knuckles, the blood beneath  the skin. No one has ever painted hands as well as Hals. Watch the way his  brush manages to catch the stiffness of white linen, the weight of silk  embroidery, the transparencies of lace. See if you can count, as van Gogh did  so carefully, his 27 blacks. And Hals, as Slive has noted, had as many whites.  (Though blacks and whites may rule this show -- the burghers of the time still  dressed in Spanish styles -- the countless colors of his flesh tones are  equally remarkable.)  </P> <P> The show is filled with splendid works -- though it does include one clunker,  the "Fisher Girl" (private collection, New York), which was once in the  collection of the Brooklyn Museum. The black hat on her head looks like a  charred pancake. The museum sold it off in 1967. It is easy to see why.  </P> <P> Most of the Dutch Master's multifigure paintings have remained in Holland, but  three of his most famous are included in the show. One is the "Officers of a  Company of the Amsterdam Crossbow Civic Guard Under Captain Reynier Reael and  Lieutenant Cornelis Michielsz Blaeuw," the 15-foot-wide canvas that is  popularly known (because of the skinniness of its 16 sitters) as "The Meagre  Company." Hals designed it and began it, but it was finished by another. The  standing figure at the left, all dressed in shades of gray, is surely from the  brush of Hals. Just look at his boots.  </P> <P> Two of the Dutch Master's last, dark and most heart-shattering works, "The  Regents of the Old Men's Almshouse" and "The Regentesses of the Old Men's  Almshouse," conclude the exhibition. The "Regentesses" alone justifies repeated  visits to the show.  </P> <P> Its five old black-garbed women haunt the room like ghosts. Though Hals is  rightly known for his merriment and brio and warm conviviality, he touches in  this masterpiece the dark soul-stirring grandeur that only rises in the final  works of such master painters as Rembrandt, Titian, Goya, Rothko and Cezanne.  All that is extraneous has been expunged from this great painting. Looking at  its sitters (they inspired, and they dwarf, Whistler's portrait of his mother)  you cannot escape the feeling that Hals, who so loved daily life, has here  accepted death.  </P> <P> The show, in the West Building, will travel in January to the Royal Academy of  Arts in London, and in May to the Frans Hals museum in Haarlem. It closes in  Washington Dec. 31.  </P></p>

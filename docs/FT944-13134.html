			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Bonds: Trans-Tokyo Bay offer sees strong demand The euromarkets saw a paucity of issues yesterday as borrowers stood on the sidelines awaiting the reaction to today's figures on GDP from the US. The main deal of the day was Trans-Tokyo Bay Highway Corp, which brought a Dollars 200m, 10-year deal with a 8 3/8 per cent coupon via Bank of Tokyo Capital Markets. A syndicate manager said demand for the deal was far stronger than expected. 'This is a hot issue,' he said, with sales to institutions in Asia and Europe. Yesterday's deal came at 38 basis points over the comparable Treasury, and did not move when freed to trade, said BoT. Other syndicates said the deal was fairly priced. Bayerische Hypobank brought a ADollars 75m, three-year deal with a 9 3/4 per cent coupon which lead-manager Hambros said met retail demand in Europe. This was Hambros' 31st deal this year in the Australian dollar sector, and Bayerische Hypobank's second. Its first deal came in August with an 8 3/4 per cent coupon and by yesterday had tightened in by 35 basis points, said Hambros. Deutsche Bank Finance brought a Dollars 200m deal with a 7.5 per cent coupon and a 39-month maturity. There was an excellent response from other syndicates, said lead manager Deutsche Bank, which brought this deal after seeing good demand for the three-year tranche of the Johnson &amp; Johnson deal this week. Dresdner International Finance opted for ABN-Amro Bank to handle its first visit this year to the euromarkets with a Fl 250m, five-year offer.</p>

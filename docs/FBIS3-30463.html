Forty percent  either knew nothing or had no opinion on the issue.    Fifty five percent of the polled argued that Poland's bid  for  NATO is now the best policy for guaranteeing the country's  security, and according to twenty two percent of the  respondents, it would be best not to join any military alliances  and become neutral. Only seven percent claimed that the best  solution would be to seek a military alliance with other states.    Almost half (48 percent) of the CBOS respondents believed  there is no threat to Poland's independence, while thirty five  percent stated the opposite.    Fifty five percent claim that Russia had objected to Poland  and other former "socialist block's" efforts to become a NATO  member because it sought to regain influence over the states,  one fourth of the polled thought Russia feared that her own  security will be jeopardized, while every fifth person had no  opinion on the subject.    The survey was conducted on a representative sample of 1,226  adult Poles on January 14-17.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Macdonald Martin 20% lower at Pounds 2.16m Macdonald Martin Distilleries, the maker of Glenmorangie malt whisky, reported a 20 per cent decline in first half pre-tax profits, from Pounds 2.69m to Pounds 2.16m. Excluding the extra costs of reducing production at the company's two distilleries, profits would have been 2 per cent ahead - 'a satisfactory result in the current economic and whisky industry climate,' said Mr Neil McKerrow, managing director. 'While it is difficult to forecast with certainty, we expect a slightly stronger second half performance,' he added. Earnings per A share fell from 13.08p to 10.46p but the dividend is lifted from 2.2p to 2.266p. Turnover in the six months to September 30 rose from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 13.1m. In the UK volume sales of single malt were marginally lower and an increase in own label business was offset by reduced sales of other blends. UK profits fell under the impact of competitive pricing in blends and increased marketing expenditure for Glenmorangie. Overseas profits improved, however. Sales of Glenmorangie and Glen Moray malts were 20 per cent higher, helped by the resumption of shipments to the US after over-stocking in that market last year. Sales of bulk blends also increased. Trading contracts within the industry remained highly competitive and profits from the business declined slightly in spite of increased turn-over.</p>

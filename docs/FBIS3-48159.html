The third achievement involves our diplomatic  activities. Vietnam's relations with foreign countries have  expanded and its prestige and position in the international  arena has been enhanced. This creates a favorable  international situation to build and defend the fatherland.    The seventh national party congress asserted Vietnam's  foreign policy of firmly maintaining peace, expanding the  relations of friendship and cooperation, creating favorable  international conditions for the cause of national construction  and defense, and positively contributing to the world people's  common struggle for peace, national independence, democracy, and  social progress.    The congress stressed Vietnam's broad-minded foreign policy  of befriending all countries in the world and struggling for  peace, independence, and progress. The party Central  Committee's third plenum concretized and seriously implemented  this policy against the background of new changes in the region  and the world and following the seventh national party congress.    We positively expanded our diplomatic activities and scored  very significant achievements. We restored normal relations  with the People's Republic of China and developed the relations  of friendship and cooperation with the country a further step.  We strengthened and enhanced the special solidarity with the  Lao People's Democratic Republic. We cosigned the Paris Accord  on Cambodia. We struggled for its serious implementation,  established friendly and neighborly relations with the Kingdom  of Cambodia, and promoted and opened up a new stage of  cooperation and friendship with ASEAN and its organizations. We  also expanded relations with other countries in the Asia-Pacific  Region, maintained and developed the existing relations of  cooperation with the Russian Federation and states of the former  Soviet Union, and East European countries. We preserved and  developed our traditional relations with Cuba, India, and the  DPRK; continued to support the legitimate causes of the  Palestinian, Asian, and South African peoples; and expanded  relations with developing countries in the Middle East, Africa,  and Latin America. We positively contributed to the  consolidation and development of the Nonaligned Movement's role  in the new situation, and also improved relations with Western  and Northern European countries, the EC, Japan, Canada,  Australia, New Zealand, and a number of new industrial  countries. We restored normal relations with international  financial and monetary organizations, and made progress in the  struggle for the lifting of the U.S. embargo and for normalizing  relations with the United States.    II. Shortcomings and Newly Arising Problems    1. Our economy still depends on agriculture, which is still  backward. Our industries are small, infrastructure is poorly  developed, material-technical bases are very few, the  accumulations attained from the internal economy are minimal,  and investment and development are not great enough.  Productivity and economic results are low, although our  economic growth is acceptable. Our production capability, which  is in the stage of developing for mobilization in the days  ahead, is not up to par. This will affect adversely economic  growth in the years to come. Our capability to curb inflation  is not consistent, while the budget deficit continues. Budget  overdrafts are high and foreign debt payments, which are due,  are too immense to be settled because our annual export values  are still minimal. Meanwhile, many sectors, localities, units,  and leading and managerial cadres are not maintaining firmly  their awareness in practicing thrift and diligence, thereby  causing great losses to public property while lavish spending is  prevalent.    It is necessary to say that our national and cooperative  economies slowly have developed and strengthened. Our national  economy has not satisfactorily assumed its active role in  production and circulation. The state-run business sector  missed good chances to develop many important domains and areas,  and this allowed a group of private traders to exploit these  opportunities and cause difficulties for both our producers and  consumers. We have not completely overcome obstacles in the  private economy. We have difficulties in production development  and experience a lack of good management and guidance.  Moreover, illegal trade is still prevalent.    We realize that our economic mechanism is at a nascent stage  with many spontaneously arising factors; our state management  capability is still low and optimally cannot develop the  strength of the market economic mechanism nor contain its many  negative sides. Our legal system is not complete while its  implementation is not seriously carried out. Planning and  activities for financial and banking sectors are still poor and  are fraught with negative practices. The goods distribution  system is irrational and it is carried out in an arbitrary  fashion. The principle of distributing incomes in accordance  with labor is not been strictly observed.    2. Cultural and Social Domains    Many great and urgent issues are still not resolved,  although  we scored some achievements in these domains. Unemployment,  especially for youth of working age, is still the pressing issue  and is one of the fundamental factors causing negative practices  in our society.    Social policy is not implemented justly. Many people  legally amass wealth, but many others get rich quickly through  illegal business activities. At the same time, many families  who rendered meritorious service to the nation, sacrificed  lives, and suffered great loss during the wars are still facing  great hardship. The number of poor and starving people still  accounts for a significant part of the population. The people's  lives in many areas -- specially the highland, isolated, and  ethnic-inhabited areas -- are still destitute.    Education is inadequate in both quality and efficiency. Many  issues relating to curriculum and training methods have not been  defined to suit development requirements. Many schools are  degrading seriously. Laboratory and scientific research  equipment is scarce and outdated. Pedagogical schools and  teachers provide poor training and education service, which is  causing great public concern. Education management cadres at  all levels hardly are given proper training. Individual  education expenses are too high, which affects the education of  children from poor families.    Funding for scientific and technological research is higher  than before, but still too low to meet the demand. It is only  about 1 percent of the total state budget. Therefore, it must  be thinly spread to different areas. The result of this level  of funding is limited returns. Measures and regulations have  not been introduced to encourage economic enterprises to invest  in this field.    Different scientific groups have not been formed. The  organic [huwux cow] relationship among scientific research  establishments, training institutions, and production units has  not been established. The import of foreign technologies has  been poorly managed and led to the import of outdated  technologies and equipment at high prices. This causes  long-term negative effects for the nation.    The situation relating to culture and arts is causing great  concern. The lifestyle of running after money, unhealthy  interests, bad customary habits, and superstitions is on the  increase. Poisonous and dangerous cultural products are readily  available in the market. Incorrect tendencies -- such as the  rejection of our revolution's achievements and our revolutionary  culture and arts, the detachment of arts from the party's  political line, the tendency to commercialize the arts, and the  spread of bad foreign-influenced arts and debauched lifestyles  -- are appearing in creative, logical, and critical works.  These mistakes and incorrect conceptions were mentioned by the  fourth plenum of the seventh party Central Committee, but they  slowly are improving. Guidance by party organs and the state  management over the cultural and arts work is weak.    Our public health service is not meeting the minimum  requirements of society. Grassroots health care is weak.  Hospitals are ill- equipped and provide low standards of  service and care. The increase in population is still higher  than 2.2 percent. This high rate obstructs socioeconomic  development, improvements to life, and affects the development  of our race.    Despite many efforts to contain them, social vices tend to  increase -- especially drug addiction, gambling, prostitution,  and robbery. Corruption and smuggling are prevalent, raising  public indignation, and greatly affecting the people's  confidence in the party and state.    3. The political situation is stable, but many complicated  factors which must not be overlooked still exist. Many party  and state organs have not been clean and strong. Political  security is not really firm. Social order and safety are not  safeguarded. The renovation line on party building has not been  satisfactorily implemented. The party mechanism is heavy and  bulky and its management method and work attitudes slowly are  being renovated. The leadership quality and result of many party  committees are still low. They even sidestep the party line in  some places.    Cadre-related work is a weak chain. The cadre contingent,  generally speaking, is not up to its duties or requirements. In  many places, difficulties and embarrassment are experienced when  able cadres are needed for appointment to key leading positions.  There are not enough qualified cadres and leading specialists to  take care of party work, state management, production and  business, external economic relations, religion, ethnic  communities, and women-related work.    The planning, training, fostering, and assigment of cadres  are not performed well. Party committees are not giving proper  attention to checking the observation of party regulations,  lines, and policies. The reform of the state mechanism is slow  and lacks efficiency. The evil practices of authoritarianism,  oppression, vindictiveness, bureaucracy, and indiscipline are  prevalent in many places.    The fatherland fronts and mass organizations are still  facing  difficulties in the contents of work and methods. The number of  cadres working in mass organizations is not stable. They lack  enthusiasm about their work and they are not given appropriate  care, training, and benefits.    Confusion and lack of vigilance are still prevalent among  our party cadres and people. They still have a low level of  awareness regarding sabotage plots and activities by hostile  forces, who always wish to scrap the party and socialism from  our country. Some party cadres remain unconcerned in the face of  wrong viewpoints or activities that are aimed at stirring up  social disorder. Others have deviated seriously from the  socialist path, or are even inclined to choose another path.    Our ideological and theoretical work is still slow, is not  sharp enough, lacks militancy, and is not able to respond  convincingly to newly emerging issues. Many party cadres,  including core leaders, are still sluggish when it comes to  self-education. They lack efforts to improve one's own  character and understanding. Disunity among cadres at some  party organizations is also very serious.    III. Generalizations    Despite the shortcomings we need to overcome, our past  important achievements are creating favorable conditions for the  country to advance gradually to a new development stage -- the  stage of industrialization and modernization for our country.  These conditions consist of many elements of stature and trend,  both material and spiritual, economic, politic, social, and  cultural, and both domestic and overseas. The reality of past  years allows us to assert that the lines and main policies of  our party on renovation were correct; the steps taken  appropriate. The resolutions of the sixth and seventh party  congresses are being absorbed in the life of our people.    Reviewing reality of renovation brings up many useful  lessons. It is necessary to determine that the first experiences  learned through the renovation process and pointed out by the  seventh party congress need to be developed and applied to our  current reality. Those were the lessons of maintaining firmly  the socialist path during the renovation process, combining the  determination of the revolutionary principles and strategies  with flexibility in policies and sensibility to the changes.  There were also the lessons of the necessity to renovate  comprehensively and harmoniously, and to apply appropriate  steps, contents, and methodologies. Other lessons learned were  to safeguard firmly the party leadership role and the state  management role during the process of developing a multisector  merchandise economy and socialist democracy as well as the need  for timely exposure and handling problems, which arise during  the renovation process. We also need to pay appropriate  attention to the task of reviewing reality and continuously  completing and perfecting the theories to build the socialist  path of our country.    Renovation is a difficult process which is unprecedented,  but  we have been bravely searching, learning, and achieving  important progress. The most basic, decisive factor was the  determination of our party to retain its leadership position; to  reject pluralism and a multiparty political system; to honor the  spirit of independence, self-determination, and innovation; and  to follow correct lines and policies, which are in good  accordance with the rules and reality of Vietnam. Our party has  also been able to develop the total strength of the great  all-people solidarity block and expand international cooperation.    The seventh party congress outlined six characteristics for  the socialist society our people are building. The congress  also pointed out seven basic directions to make these  characteristics a reality. This is the socialist direction that  the conferences of the seventh Central Committee materialized  into practical directives.    The building of the socialism, however, is still new to us.  It requires from us massive energy to research, to study, and  to discover. We will be able to figure out more clearly the  socialist path for our country by continuously reviewing our  work and studying ideological theory. We will also be able to  figure out the concrete model for each domain of economy,  politics, and social and cultural fields. We have to encourage  innovation and development of Marxism-Leninism-Ho Chi Minh  Thought, especially Leninist thoughts on a new economic policy  and the state-managed capitalism. This will help invent new  forms of transition and diversified intermediary steps which  suit our concrete historical circumstances and which will help  our country advance firmly on the socialist path.</p>

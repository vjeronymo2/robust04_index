			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / International Company News: Renown chief demoted The president of Renown, Japan's largest producer of clothing, has been demoted in a rare gesture to demonstrate the loss-making company's determination to reduce the workforce, writes William Dawkins in Tokyo. Mr Mahiro Matsuzuka, Renown's president since March 1991, will become vice-president. The move coincides with the announcement that Renown will cut 700 of its 4,000 jobs by February 1996 in an attempt to pull out of five years of losses.</p>

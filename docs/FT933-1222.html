			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (8): An unprecedented bull run - Bonds / The US and Japanese markets have proved they can defy gravity THE economic slowdown which has cast a pall over OECD countries has had at least one beneficiary: for the past three years, the world's bond markets have enjoyed an unprecedented bull run, which has already outlasted most analysts' expectations. Bad economic news spells good news for bond markets because it encourages governments to lower short-term interest rates, in turn forcing down bond yields, in an effort to revive economic growth. At the same time, economic recession drags down inflation, which means that real yields become more attractive to investors and underpin the long end of the market. The main reason for the continuing optimism over bond market performance is that the outlook for inflation has changed dramatically. Traditionally, bond markets have performed well during economic recession, and then weakened as economic conditions improved. That cycle may now have been broken. 'US bond yields are still falling, 10 quarters into a recovery, and conditions here (in Europe) are going to be rougher if anything,' said Mr Phillip Saunders, fixed interest investment director at Guinness Flight. The UK has also officially emerged from recession, yet there are expectations that not only long-term bond yields but also short-term interest rates have somewhat further to fall. 'There has been a marked change in investment psychology,' said Mr George Magnus, international economist at SG Warburg. 'There is always a cyclical decline in inflation, which is usually short-lived. This time round, low rates of inflation will persist.' He cites a number of factors, such as lack of employment opportunities and competition from rapidly growing Asian economies which will contribute to low inflation growth among developed countries. This has increased the scope for bond yields to fall, since low inflation has enhanced real yields (yields with inflation stripped out). Nevertheless, investors may not be keen to buy bonds at such historically low yields. 'You can't draw forecasts with a ruler,' warned one fund manager. 'We are in uncharted territory, and that makes everyone very nervous.' Investors are struggling to come to terms with the implications of lower yields. Some investors, such as yield-hungry US insurance companies, take on greater credit risk to enhance yields, for example by buying bonds issued by Latin American borrowers, or by poorly-rated companies. More commonly, investors have tended to extend the maturity of their bond investments, to benefit from the steep yield curves created by cuts in short-term rates. Initially, the US yield curve, for example, steepened dramatically because of the speed with which the authorities cut rates. More recently, however, there has been a flattening of the yield curve. In part, this is because very low money market rates make it cheap to fund positions at the longer end of the market. For traders, a long position in German bonds has to outperform substantially a long position in US bonds because the cost of funding the German bond position is substantially higher. As a result, the longer end of the US market has rallied, causing a flattening of the yield curve. The same pattern has already been seen, albeit less dramatically in the UK and is expected to follow in Europe. Some analysts believe that investors will simply have to adjust their expectations, since returns on stock as well as bond markets are likely to fall short of the levels seen in the 1980s, as economic growth in OECD countries is likely to remain low. However, they point out that, in a historical context, real yields are not particularly low. In the US, for example, with inflation at 2.8 per cent, a 6 per cent long bond yield offers a real yield of 3.2 per cent, which appears paltry compared with the average real yield of 6.2 per cent in the 1980s, but looks more favourable against a 2.6 per cent average in the 1960s and a 1.3 per cent average in the 1970s. Nevertheless, there is a growing sense that the US bond market rally cannot have much further to go, and the conviction that at present levels the market does not offer 'good value' relative to other markets. The only problem is that analysts have been predicting the end of the US Treasury market rally since at least the start of the year. In Japan, although the lack of any sign of inflationary pressure will continue to buoy the market, there is a sense any further rate cuts are well discounted and the market will get little further lift from arriving at its goal. Indeed, with 10-year yields at around 4 per cent, it is hard to argue for further substantial yield declines. Both markets have already proved they can defy gravity, and may well do so again. Nevertheless most fund managers believe that European bond markets, which are heading for some substantial cuts in rates, still offer the best value, and are tending to adopt overweight positions in these markets. Italian and Spanish bonds have benefited most dramatically from the break-down of the ERM: Italian 10-year bond yields have already fallen from 12 1/4 per cent in June to 9 1/2 per cent in September.</p>

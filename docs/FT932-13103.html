			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Food &amp; Drink: It needn't be so pricy - Eating out in Venice / Where to eat in La Serenissima VENICE IS an expensive city. This is not just because over the centuries they have gained an unsurpassed experience in the art of fleecing foreigners, it is also expensive for Venetians. Everything has to be transported by boat, which means that transport costs often exceed the value of the object itself. There is no storage space as there are no cellars. This does not mean that Venetians are justified in robbing everyone who visits their city, but there are mitigating circumstances. It is still possible to spend a week in Venice without taking out a second mortgage. I have seen little trattorie in Cannaregio, behind the railway station, which serve menus for as little as L14,000 (Pounds 6), although I cannot imagine that the food is anything to write home about, and they certainly will not stay open late. Food is simple. Gone are the days when Venice was noted for elaborate displays of culinary theatre which pleased the Doges. Now the emphasis is on fresh fish and seafood with a few stock dishes such as fegato alla Veneziana, calves' liver on a bed of onions sweated in oil, served with the ineluctable hunk of polenta. If you are on a tight budget, one solution is pizza. Pizzas are not typically Venetian, but there are plenty of restaurants in the city which offer them because they appeal to tourists of slender means. One reasonable pizza place is the Trattoria Pizzeria due Colonne in San Polo which has a list of about 30 including one topped with different cuts of horse meat. With a jug of the thin house wine you may get away with under Pounds 10. Another recommendation for a cheap, light meal is Vino Vino in San Marco, a bar near the Fenice with a stunning wine list. A plate of pasta followed by some polpette (meat balls) can be had for as little as L14,000. Expect to pay much more if you stray away from the house wine. They say that Vino Vino stays open till 1 am. In my experience they remain open until the particularly graceless waiter decides he wants to go home. Venice has a largely retired population and they go to bed early. One solution for princes of darkness is Haig's Bar by Santa Maria del Giglio in San Marco. By night it fills up with all Venice's more elegant insomniacs. If you desire more authentically Venetian food at reasonable prices, the Taverna San Trovaso is popular both with locals and better-heeled tourists. They appear more gracious here than in some places. The food is stock Venetian which does not mean desperately exciting: spaghetti with cuttle fish; fritto misto, a collection of shrimps, Dublin Bay prawns and squid rings in batter, for example. With a large jug of Sauvignon blanc it comes to about Pounds 20 a head. Similar, but even more popular with locals, is Trattoria della Madonna near the Rialto bridge. The style here is brash, cheeky and sometimes downright unco-operative. But, at around Pounds 25 a head, it is hardly expensive by London standards. Fresh fish is the thing here: ivory-white cigale di mare (literally sea grasshoppers - they look a little like Dublin Bay prawns and come from the Adriatic); spider crab; castraure, baby artichokes; which fish soup, which is a meal in itself; and cuttle fish or calves' liver with polenta. It is a busy, pretty restaurant with white walls and exposed beams. Rather more up-market is La Corte Sconta (the hidden courtyard) in Castello by the Arsenal. It is important to book. A jolly, red-headed woman speaking idiomatically fluent English tells you what to eat: 'I will send you some mixed antipasti and a turbot. You won't need the pasta course.' She was right. A carpaccio of salmon in Tuscan olive oil came with pots of buttery spider crab mousse; next came vongolex clams; a spider crab dressed with oil and lemon in its shell a plate of octopus, winkles, squid and shrimps, two sorts of anchovies and stuffed mussels; two sorts of polenta one with baccala (an emulsion of dried cod) the other with sardines with onions and pine nuts; then came the turbot. A still prosecco is put on your table, but there is also an extensive wine list. About Pounds 35 to Pounds 40 a head. For your last night in Venice you cannot do much better than the terrace at the Danieli. The view is stunning. Taking in with one broad sweep the domes of the Salute, San Giorgio Maggiore and the Zitelle as well as the Lido. The food is no disappointment either: a marinated sea bass with onions was surprisingly effective; mixed antipasti came with cigale di mare, prawns, octopus, spider crab and mussels; then a superb risotto with scampi and rocket. The main course was a John Dory with a sauce of finely chopped herbs, tomatoes and gherkins. The Daniel is expensive - even by London standards: about Pounds 60 a head.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yaounde, 6 May (AFP) -- Cameroonian External  Relations Minister Ferdinand Leopold Oyono has said that the  situation in the Bakassi Peninsula remains "potentially  explosive," adding that less than 1 km separates Cameroonian and  Nigerian soldiers in this border region of the Gulf of Guinea.  There is such a concentration "of men and equipment in the area  that at any moment, anything could happen," he said in a  statement published today by the pro-government daily CAMEROON  TRIBUNE.    As far as the minister is concerned, the reaction of the UN  Security Council, before which Cameroon presented its border  conflict, was favorable to Cameroon, and that in itself  constitutes "a victory." "Furthermore," he added, "the fact  that the Security Council endorsed the OAU statement of 4 April  reiterating the principle of the inviolability of borders  inherited from the colonial era, is satisfactory on at least two  scores." "On all the maps drawn up to 1990 Bakassi is  Cameroonian, only Nigerian maps drawn after this date try to  show the contrary," the minister pointed out, adding that "when  the OAU called for the withdrawal of troops from the area, it  was a thinly veiled allusion to the occupation forces" of  Nigeria, which has been "increasing its diversionary tactics."  He expressed satisfaction at the Togolese mediation and  indicated that Cameroon remained open to dialogue on one  condition: that "the Nigerian troops withdraw from our national  territory."</p>

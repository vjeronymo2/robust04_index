			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (14): Clear evidence of a turnround - The Banking Sector Swedish banks are emerging from crisis as rapidly as they plunged into it. The doom-laden atmosphere of the early part of the year, when record losses were being unveiled and banks were falling over each other in the queue for state hand-outs, has rapidly given way to a mood of optimism. The feeling is not just that the worst is over but that the path to recovery is firmly entrenched. Much-improved results are the clearest evidence of the turnround and these, together with the buoyant stock market, have enabled banks to recapitalise by turning to their shareholders and other institutions, rather than relying on the state. All three banks which applied for state aid at the start of the year - Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Foreningsbanken, and Swedbank - had withdrawn their requests by the year-end. The government has reason to congratulate itself over developments, even if the main reason for the upturn is the sharp lowering of interest rates which has followed the humiliating decision to float the krona in November 1992. The measures the government took to tackle the crisis - providing a blanket safety net for the entire banking system, encouraging banks to dig their own way out of trouble, using the 'bad bank' formula for problem loans - have proved effective both in maintaining confidence and securing the recovery. Yet the process has not been without controversy. Nordbanken, the first and biggest casualty of the crisis, has almost certainly been treated too generously by the state to the distortion of wider competition. After nine months it was Sweden's most profitable bank with a SKr2.5bn operating profit  -quite a turnround on the SKr16bn record-breaking loss it recorded for the whole of 1992. Now Nordbanken is to be slung together with Gota Bank to create Sweden's biggest bank in terms of market share with a likely privatisation of the combined entity in 1995. Although presented as the best solution for the taxpayer, it represents something of a defeat for the government's earlier hopes of getting a significant foreign presence into the market to bolster competition. The danger is that the bank crisis will pass in Sweden without a significant increase in the market competition, even though more domestic players - including insurance groups - are entering the field. Now that Gota's problems have been resolved, at a total cost of SKr30bn, the government's biggest banking crisis outlays are behind it. So far, the state has provided a total of SKr92.1bn in support, by way of cash infusions, equity, loans and guarantees, although only SKr71.3bn of the total has actually been paid out. One estimate is that the net outlay will be about SKr50bn once the government has recouped funds from Nordbanken's privatisation and the sale of assets within the bad banks. So is the crisis over? Not if the size of the credit losses and problem loans still being reported is anything to go by. In the first half of this year, credit losses amounted to SKr39bn, compared with SKr74bn in the whole of 1992. The trend should be lower in the second half, but it is clear that full-year losses are going to be in the region of SKr60-65bn. 'Credit losses will still be above normal levels in both 1994 and 1995,' warns Mr Peter Mansson, financial analyst at ABB Aros Securities in Stockholm. Another sign that the market is still thought to be unstable is the fact that the blanket guarantee which the government was forced to place under the entire banking system in late 1992 is still in place, and there are no signs of its early removal. One measurement shows why this is the case: there is still an estimated SKr100bn of problem loans in the Swedish banking system, while banks' primary capital at the end of the third quarter amounted to only SKr67bn. Even allowing for the recapitalisation measures in the final three months, there is still a shortfall. If interest rates went back up again, things could certainly go wrong. But even if they did, the big groups are now far better placed to withstand heavy losses without breaching the 8 per cent minimum capital adequacy level. Capital adequacy ratios at both SE Banken and Svenska Handelsbanken are now above 12 per cent after they raised SKr5.3bn and SKr2.7bn respectively in rights issues during the autumn. Swedbank, the Nordic region's biggest bank in asset terms, will have capital cover of more than 10 per cent if plans to strengthen its capital base by SKr8bn are fully implemented. The recovery undoubtedly leaves a more limited role for the bank support authority, the Bankstodsnamnden, which was only formally set up in May. Its main task will be to take care of Nordbanken; its bad bank, Securum; and Gota's bad bank, Retriva. In general, the authority will act more as a holding company than be active and 'hands-on' in its approach. The 10-15 years envisaged for the sell-off of assets within Securum and Retriva indicate that the legacy of the banking crisis will last into the next century. The fall-out has also led to the scrutiny of SKr37.8bn of loans for evidence of wrong-doing and, in some cases, individual board directors may be held to account for the decisions which they took. One obvious worry is that with many of Sweden's banks so strongly recapitalised, the whole cycle of misery will simply repeat itself in a few years as the leading groups make another grab for market share. The danger is the greater for the fact that Sweden has a small domestic market, which may force banks to push into areas or countries with which they are unfamiliar. For the moment most believe that lessons have been learned and that credit control procedures have been tightened. 'Banks are much more cautious now and I don't believe they will start recklessly chasing volumes again,' says Mr Claes Norgren, head of the country's finance inspection board. Not everyone takes this view, and they back their case by saying that many of the people who took the decisions which brought disaster last time round are still in place.</p>

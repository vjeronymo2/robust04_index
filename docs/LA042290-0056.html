			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PUPPETS HELP KIDS BREAK THE ICE WITH DISABLED CLASSMATES  </P> <P> The sight of the 3-foot-tall puppet wearing crutches and leg braces prompted  many questions from the children at Palm Crest Elementary School in La Canada  Flintridge.  </P> <P> "Do your legs hurt?"  </P> <P> "Did you catch spina bifida, or did you have it when you were born?"  </P> <P> The questions were from a group of about 75 fourth-graders. But when the  puppet's adult operator, Kris Clark, replies, she lets "Valerie" do the  talking.  </P> <P> Valerie is a large puppet for which Clark provides voice and movement. They are  both part of the "Kids on the Block" program. Together with a group of about a  dozen volunteers from the Women's Council of Verdugo Hills Hospital and  Foundation, they are helping schoolchildren make friends with disabled students  in their classrooms.  </P> <P> "This program makes it much more comfortable for everyone," said Clark, a  housewife who is co-chairwoman of the local group. She is not handicapped but  has an 8-year-old daughter with spina bifida, which attacks the legs.  </P> <P> Clark and the "Kids on the Block" characters have been visiting schools two or  three times a month for the last three years. Clark said the volunteers and  their colorful puppets, which depict specific disabilities, perform for groups  of about 60.  </P> <P> The puppets are about the size of a 3-year-old child and are expensive -- $700  to $1,200. Part of the expense lies in the accessories, such as Valerie's  crutches and leg braces.  </P> <P> Alyce Russell, who operates one of the puppets, said: "It's so important for  (the children) to be able to ask questions. That breaks down the barrier."  </P></p>

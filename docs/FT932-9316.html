			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Civil engineers more optimistic THE rate of decline in workloads of civil engineers has reduced substantially and there are signs of confidence starting to return, a survey published today shows. Mr John Hackett, director-general of the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors, described the survey as 'the best set of results we've had in three years, but not good enough for us to be able yet to announce the end of the recession in civil engineering construction'. Contractors' profit margins remained under severe pressure, he said.</p>

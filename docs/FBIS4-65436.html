			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Federal Interior Minister Manfred  Kanther (Christian Democratic Union) has strongly criticized the  decision by the federal states of Rhineland-Palatinate and  Schleswig-Holstein, which are governed by the Social Democratic  Party [SPD], to halt the deportation of Kurds for the next six  months. This "change in policy" is "politically completely  unacceptable", Kanther said in Bonn on Wednesday [18 May]. The  SPD is "obliged for the sake of social peace within Germany" to  continue to put the asylum compromise agreement of 1993 into  practice.    Kanther warned that the behavior of Rhineland-Palatinate and  Schleswig-Holstein is "really an invitation to illegal  immigration".    The impression is being created in the countries of origin  that the German asylum procedure is "meaningless because  deportation will not be carried out anyway." The interior  minister said it is "quite clear" that the Kurds are not  threatened "with persecution in most areas of Turkey." The  Federal Administrative Court has confirmed the possibility of  finding safe havens within Turkey itself.</p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Turkish economic prospects brighter Turkey's economic prospects brightened yesterday after parliament passed passing laws on tax and privatisation, the twin pillars of the government's bid to cut its deficit, John Murray Brown writes from Istanbul. The privatisation law, passed late on Thursday, gives the cabinet powers for three months to sell off state companies by decree. The austerity programme unveiled by Prime Minister Mrs Tansu Ciller envisages revenues of Dollars 3.5bn in 1994 from state asset sales. The new tax charges, which have still to be approved by President Suleyman Demirel, comprise a one-off wealth tax based on net assets of companies and individuals. Officials estimate the tax will realise revenues of TL70,000bn.</p>

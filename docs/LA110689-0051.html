			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUAYLE PLEASED BY BUSH'S VOTE OF CONFIDENCE  </P> <P> Vice President Dan Quayle on Sunday pronounced himself "very pleased" with  President Bush's stated intention to keep him on the Republican ticket in 1992  but said it was too early to speak of his own presidential ambitions.  </P> <P> "There are things that can happen between now and '92, and 1993 and 1996 are a  long, long time away," Quayle said.  </P> <P> In an appearance on the NBC-TV program "Meet the Press," the vice president  said that Bush had not informed him personally of the decision, but he added:  "I am very pleased that the President is pleased with the job that I am doing."  </P> <P> Bush stated his intention during an interview with the Dallas Morning News,  which published the account over the weekend.  </P> <P> Others were also pleased with Bush's pronouncement. Democratic National  Chairman Ron Brown said: "It certainly pleases me. The problem with this  Administration: It's been an Administration of symbols over substance. Dan  Quayle is a good symbol for the Democrats to take a hard look at . . . ."  </P> <P> GOP Chairman Lee Atwater, who appeared with Brown on ABC's "This Week With  David Brinkley," said of Quayle: "I think he's done a good job. He's been loyal  to the President. He's a good man . . . "  </P></p>

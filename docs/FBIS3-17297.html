			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Boris </F> Krivoshey]    [Text] Moscow, 24 Mar -- The situation surrounding the  problem of the DPRK's participation in the nuclear  nonproliferation treaty (NPT) is prompting growing anxiety and  alarm. Acting on the basis of its firm, consistent adherence to  the NPT and its determination to prevent a center of tension --  especially nuclear -- emerging on its borders, Russia is in  favor of a comprehensive settlement to the situation, says a  Russian Foreign Ministry statement, with which Grigoriy Karasin,  director of the Information and Press Department of the Russian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs, acquainted journalists at a  briefing today.    Russia is prepared, the document observes, to support the  resolution now under discussion in the UN Security Council  appealing to the DPRK to meet its commitments to the IAEA  [International Atomic Energy Agency] under the NPT.    Taking account of the fact that the talks have not been  crowned with success, we regard as inadequate attempts to tackle  the problem within a bilateral framework. We propose using a  multilateral approach, which could be centered on an  international conference attended by Russia, China, the United  States, Japan, the DPRK, the ROK, and representatives of the UN  secretary general and the IAEA director general, the Russian  Foreign Ministry statement says.    We are certain, the Russian foreign policy department  stresses, that only such an approach will enable us to find  mutually acceptable, balanced solutions, which will ensure that  the nuclear nonproliferation regime is strengthened and  simultaneously prevent the situation from slipping into  confrontation.    The Russian Federation Foreign Affairs Ministry today issued  a statement, which says:    "The situation surrounding the problem of the DPRK's  participation in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] is  prompting growing anxiety and alarm. Acting on the basis of its  firm, consistent adherence to the NPT and its determination to  prevent a center of tension -- especially nuclear -- emerging on  its borders, Russia is in favor of a comprehensive settlement to  the situation.    "First: We are prepared to support the resolution now under  discussion in the UN Security Council appealing to the DPRK to  meet its commitments to the IAEA [International Atomic Energy  Agency] under the NPT. We will also seek decisive action by the  Security Council in all other instances where threats of nuclear  proliferation emerge, without double standards.    "Second: Taking account of the fact that the talks have not  been crowned with success, we regard as inadequate attempts to  tackle the problem within a bilateral framework. We propose  using a multilateral approach, which could be centered on an  international conference attended by Russia, China, the United  States, Japan, the DPRK, the ROK, and representatives of the UN  secretary general and the IAEA director general. This format  for the conference is the most logical, because the  aforementioned countries are located on the Korean Peninsula or  in the immediate vicinity, and have a realistic ability to play  a special part in a settlement.    "The agenda for the conference must make it possible to  reach  comprehensive solutions that take account of the legitimate  interests of all the parties involved. In particular, subjects  for discussion and agreement could be security guarantees for  the DPRK and the ROK, assistance for the process of  denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula with international  guarantees of its nonnuclear status, including appropriate  international verification [kontrol], and guarantees of  noninterference in the internal affairs of the DPRK and ROK.    "We are certain that only such an approach will enable us to  find mutually acceptable, balanced solutions that will ensure  that the nuclear nonproliferation regime is strengthened and  simultaneously prevent the situation from slipping into  confrontation."</p>

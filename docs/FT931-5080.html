			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Leading Article: The pleas for manufacturing THE PRIME minister has said manufacturing matters and who could possibly disagree? But to leap from that proposition to the belief that manufacturing is more real and reliable than other forms of activity is heroic; to leap to the view that manufacturing should be specially favoured by government could prove disastrous. People who believe that only manufacturing is economically important need to wander about the industrial graveyards of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. People who believe that manufacturing must generate increased employment in the UK need only look at the statistics for virtually all developed economies, including Japan. It is rather more relevant that UK manufacturing output last year was just 1 per cent higher than in 1973. This does seem to be saying something, especially when the economy grew by more than a third over the period and Britain went into deficit on manufactured goods a decade ago. In the long run an advanced country cannot increase its indebtedness to the rest of the world without limit. So demand for and supply of tradeable goods and services need to be roughly equal over the long run. Since manufacturing is the preponderant tradeable element in the economy, its poor performance must say something about the prospects for long-term economic growth. Before deciding what needs to be done, however, one needs to understand why manufacturing has grown so little. The most plausible explanation is that deep-seated weaknesses of the economy show up in parts of the economy most exposed to international competition. If so, the weakness of manufacturing is not a cause of the UK's economic problems, but rather a symptom. Two time scales Possible remedies can be viewed on two different time scales. The worsening position in the 1980s can, for example, be attributed to specific mistakes in economic policy: too high an exchange rate, and too much stimulus to demand. The short-term corrective - a massive real depreciation of sterling  -has already been applied. There may be more to it than that. Professor Nick Crafts, an economic historian at Warwick University, points out that the UK had a 30 per cent share of world trade in manufactures at the start of the century. It now has less than 9 per cent. Germany had 20 per cent then and has 20 per cent now. In Prof Crafts' view, Germany's success can be put down to a policy of accumulating long-term assets such as human skills and research. UK manufacturers are hampered by short-term pressures from their shareholders. The answer is to change company law and make takeovers more difficult. At this point one starts to feel uneasy. It is one thing to argue that the long-term solution for British manufacturers is to establish a more stable and reciprocal relationship with both capital and labour, on the German and Japanese model. But the beneficial effects of any changes in the law would be uncertain, while they would impose substantial costs. International exposure Meanwhile, the government is under pressure to help industry on other familiar fronts, such as export credits and advance corporation tax. On the first, it can be argued that the chief point of export credits is to help companies do business in countries where there is little security of payment. Shipping out goods without payment is not an export but a gift, however financed. As for ACT, the system has anomalies. But the simple answer is to pay less in dividends. This brings us back to short-termism and the need for a more stable relationship between companies and shareholders. But this is a matter best hammered out between the parties themselves. Manufacturing is not self-evidently more important than all other activities. It is just more enfeebled because it is more internationally exposed. Salvation does not lie in schemes in favour of manufacturing as a whole, still less in favour of particular industries. The answer lies partly in government policies that improve the performance of the UK economy. But it also lies in the hands of British industrialists. If the Japanese can make internationally competitive products in the UK, why do their British equivalents find this so difficult?</p>

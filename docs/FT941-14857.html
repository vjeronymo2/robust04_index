			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: China to raise more capital in West China is set for aggressive capital raising in Western markets following its registration with the US Securities Exchange Commission to issue some Dollars 1bn in global bonds. Merrill Lynch, in association with major securities houses and banks, will market the dollar-denominated notes to be issued by China's Ministry of Finance to help finance the country's vast infrastructure requirements. The global bonds will mark the Chinese government's first entry to the US market since the Communist revolution, although a state-owned corporation issued Dollars 250m worth of paper to US buyers last July. China's demand for capital to finance its modernisation drive is almost insatiable, and a successful global bond issue is certain to be followed by further forays into world markets. The country's ability to sell debt securities was recently enhanced by an upgrading of its credit rating. In September Moody's raised its debt rating to A3 from Baa1, while Standard &amp; Poor's rate China's outstanding debt triple-B. China's Ministry of Finance last October tapped the 'dragon bond' market in Hong Kong, issuing Dollars 300m of 10-year bonds, targetted mainly at Asian institutional investors. Earlier the ministry issued Y30bn (Dollars 3bn) of five-year Eurobonds. The China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) showed the way for Chinese institutions seeking to raise capital in the US. Its Dollars 250m issue of 10-year bonds, launched last year, met strong demand. The forthcoming global bond is expected to receive a warm welcome, especially from Asian investors, but also from the US and Europe, where yield-hungry investors are keen to buy liquid bonds offering a substantial yield pick-up. China's dragon bond was launched at an 88-basis-point spread over US Treasuries, and given the liquidity of the forthcoming global bond, some market participants say the deal could offer a slightly tighter spread. The dragon bond widened slightly to 86 basis points on the bid price yesterday as word over the China global bond spread through the market.</p>

			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> JUST A 'LEAP SECOND' MAKES A PERFECT YEAR  </P> <P> Because clocks are more precise than Earth's own rotation, an extra "leap  second" in 1990 will adjust for the difference, timekeeping officials said  Sunday.  </P> <P> The world keeps official time according to "atomic clocks," which operate by  measuring the vibration of a single atom and are accurate within one-billionth  of a second a day. Earth's rotation, by comparison, is off "by a few tenths of  a second per year," the Time and Frequency Division of the National Institute  of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colo., reported.  </P></p>

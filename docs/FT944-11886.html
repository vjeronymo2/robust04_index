			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Vietnamese inflation soars Vietnam has failed in its push to keep price increases in single figures for 1994, the government's statistics department said in its weekly review, when reporting 11.3 per cent inflation in the first 10 months. A big increase in food costs, apparently because of higher prices for rice caused by floods in the Mekong Delta and market fluctuations, fuelled a 1.3 per cent rise in the retail price index in October, The National Assembly again set single-digit inflation as the target when it fixed economic goals for 1995 at its last meeting of a 12-day session on Tuesday.</p>

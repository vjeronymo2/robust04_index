			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CHANG UPSET IN STRAIGHT SETS BY NO. 113-RANKED JASON STOLTENBERG  </P> <P> Top-seeded Michael Chang continued his struggles Wednesday as the French Open  champion was defeated by Jason Stoltenberg, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), in the second round  of the Swiss Army Knife Open at Livingston, N.J.  </P> <P> It marked the second consecutive tournament that Chang, the world's  fifth-ranked player, has played poorly. He looked bad in both his matches here  against players not even ranked in the top 100 in the world.  </P> <P> Chang needed three sets to defeat Scott Warner, No. 199, in the first round  Tuesday and then lost to Stoltenberg, the No. 113 player who was the world's  No. 1 junior in 1987.  </P> <P> "I just couldn't hit the shots I wanted to hit," said Chang, who said he has  not recovered from a two-week vacation after Wimbledon.  </P> <P> The 19-year-old Australian broke Chang twice in the first set and gained a 4-1  lead before eventually serving out the match at love.  </P> <P> In other second-round action, fourth-seeded Jim Courier won 12 of the final 13  points to score a 6-1, 6-1 victory over Alex Antonitsch of Austria.  </P> <P> Courier, 18, has lost only five games in his first two matches.  </P> <P> Chris Bailey, the No. 2 singles player in England, also advanced to the  quarterfinals with a 6-3, 7-5 victory over Rich Fromberg of Australia.  </P> <P> Stefan Edberg, showing the effects of a layoff since losing to Boris Becker in  the Wimbledon final, struggled past Danie Visser of South Africa, 6-4, 6-4, in  the U.S. Hardcourts at Indianapolis.  </P> <P> "I always find it hard to get (back) into it," the top-seeded Edberg said. "I  will feel a lot better (today).  </P> <P> "It's always tough to play a left-hander. I knew (Visser) was going to be  tough."  </P> <P> Edberg took the first set after breaking Visser in the seventh game, and took  command with another break in the ninth game of the second set.  </P> <P> In other matches, second-seeded John McEnroe routed Dan Cassidy 6-2, 6-2; No. 3  Tim Mayotte defeated Jimmy Arias, 5-7, 6-2, 6-2; No. 4 Aaron Krickstein routed  Diego Nargiso of Italy, 6-1, 6-4; Todd Witsken beat Vijay Amritraj of India,  7-6 (8-6), 6-3, and David Pate upset 16th-seeded Richey Reneberg, 6-4, 3-6,  6-2.  </P></p>

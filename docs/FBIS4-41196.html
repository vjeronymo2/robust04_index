			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Spiridonov, recently elected as head </F> of the Komi Republic in May 1994, by unidentified correspondent;  place and date not given -- "Exclusive" report No. 25 of 75]    [Text] INTERFAX: What additional opportunities will you  have due to the new powers that you have received? Experts  believe that if the two republics within the composition of  Russia (Karelia and Komi) refuse from the institution of  presidency, this will restrict activities of their leaders.    SPIRIDONOV: Certainly, the head of the Komi Republic elected  directly by the population will enjoy a kind of additional  immunity in the face of both the federal structures and the  representative bodies in Komi. However, I think that the new  Constitution gives to the State Council (the future parliament)  enough rights for control over the leader.    At the same time, the additional powers will inevitably lead  to additional and rather serious responsibility for the leader.  I will point out that the head of the republic and the  president are not quite the same.    I have repeatedly stated that there must be only one  president in Russia. I still think so since each of the  federation's constituent members is an integral part of the  Russian Federation. The leaders of the republics and regions,  even if they are elected by nation-wide voting, cannot be called  the presidents.    The president in most cases does not head either the  legislative or the executive powers but seems to stand above  both of them. Contrary to the president, the head of the  republic will directly head the government which means that he  has to bear more responsibility than many regional presidents.  That is why I believe that as the Head of the Komi Republic I  will have enough powers but just in order to work more than some  presidents do.    INTERFAX: How will the head of the Komi republic organize  "regional" and "federal" utilization of many resources possessed  by the republic?    SPIRIDONOV: This is right. God really made us very rich  with natural and mineral resources. These resources must be  used. Given the economic crisis it would be a crime just to be  standing on these resources without using them now.    First of all I will speak on the situation in the forestry  complex -- the oldest industry in Komi which is now in a very  poor situation. Success will depend on support which the center  can give to the republic. This is the primary task.    The second point is that we must go back to our economic  origins and organize a good mining industry in this region. We  have all necessary opportunities since a significant part of the  Urals reach with mineral resources belongs to Komi, a kind of  mountain countries.    I believe that we have great opportunities for development  of  this industry. We just should not listen much to various  demagogs covered by "green masks" who are pursuing their selfish  political goals frightening people by ecological threats.  Everything what the republic has must be made of use to people.    INTERFAX: The strike movement of miners is gaining force in  the republic. There are certain suggestions that the Komi  government and the parliament were hoping for the center too  much in what concerned the settlement of this issue. Will you  have more opportunities to influence the Russian government on  this issue since now you have received new powers?    SPIRIDONOV: The point is that the coal industry is managed  by the federal bodies. That is why this issue can be resolved  only through contacts with the federal structures.    The Komi leadership is maintaining permanent contacts with  the center. A resolution of the Russian government on the  problems on the Pechor coal basin was worked out as a result.    The resolution provides for significant investments of  capital into the industry. Unfortunately, some mines will be  closed. However, I strongly believe that today it will better to  create new jobs for specialists living in the North rather than  to close unprofitable enterprises.    Today most of investments into the social sphere must go to  the regions with normal climate. Otherwise, inhabitants of the  North region will be practically condemned to dying.    A special protocol was signed with the Rosugol company. I  have recently met the leadership of the Kaliningrad Region  (western Russia) where the climate is rather favorable and  construction of dwelling places will cost twice cheaper than in  our northern Vorkuta.    When I have to meet with miners, I always tell them on their  political demands, "You are used by various dishonest political  leaders in order to get access to power. You are promised  possible and impossible privileges when you are used."  Recently, miners have been given so many privileges that  sometimes they allow themselves not to work for a half of the  year.    I think that miners, being naive, will be listening to those  who enjoy using the difficulties of Vorkuta and Inta in their  own interests and be backing them. In fact, there are many  difficulties but there will be nothing good out of it.    INTERFAX: You have repeatedly stated that the federal treaty  does not work. Obviously, that is why the bilateral treaty  between the Komi Republic and the Russian Federation.    SPIRIDONOV: I believe that the treaty on establishment of  the federation must be signed by its constituent members.  During the last constitutional conference, in my opinion,  called by the advisors of the president rather than by Boris  Yeltsin himself, there were not more than 20 pct or 30 pct of  the federation's constituent members present.    As a result, the Constitution was adopted, worked out by  mostly irresponsible people from the public and political  organizations, the trade unions, etc. The Constitution includes  only a part of the provisions of the federal treaty.    Since Yeltsin remains practically the only person at the  federal level who understands what the Russian state system is,  he proposed to us that our bilateral relations be legalized. It  is obvious that the present Federal Assembly cannot include the  federal treaty in the Constitution.    Unfortunately, most of current politicians do not realize  the  particularities of the Russian federal state system. That is  what makes the uniqueness of Russia.</p>

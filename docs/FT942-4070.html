			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / International Company News: Ziff family's publishing group put up for sale Ziff Communications, the world's largest publisher of computer magazines and a growing participant in the market for electronic information services, has been put up for sale by the Ziff family. The privately-held group, which has annual revenues of approximately Dollars 1bn and employs more than 4,300 people, could sell for between Dollars 2bn and Dollars 3bn, analysts said. 'We don't know what the price will be, but it appears that there will be a great deal of interest,' said Mr Steven Rattner of Lazard Freres, which has been engaged to find a buyer. Telecommunications companies as well as publishing and media companies interested in the emerging market for electronic information services are expected to be attracted by Ziff, analysts said. Ziff Communications includes Ziff-Davis Publishing, publisher of PC Magazine which has a paid circulation of more than one million. It is the largest business magazine of any kind and ranks ninth among US magazines in terms of advertising revenue. The company also publishes several other magazines, trade newspapers, newsletters and books relating to the computer industry and runs several industry trade events and conferences. The group also includes ZiffNet, an on-line information service about computers, and Interchange, an electronic publishing venture due to be launched commercially later this year. Interchange will carry The Washington Post's new on-line service and electronic versions of several other publications. Mr William Ziff Jr, son of the founder of the family business, retired last year after running the business for 38 years. His three sons, Dirk, Robert and Daniel Ziff, and related trusts own approximately 90 per cent of the business, with the remainder held by other family members. 'Publishing has been at the centre of our family's business interests for two generations,' said Mr Dirk Ziff, co-chairman of Ziff Brothers Investments. 'But since our father's retirement last fall, Robert and I have realised that the company is not where we want to spend our careers. After consulting with our brother Daniel and our father, it was clear that we should focus where our skills and interests lie, in the investment field.' Mr Rattner said that the Ziff family wanted to compete the sale with as few transactions as possible. 'If it can be sold to a single buyer without sacrificing proceeds - that would be a priority.' The Ziff brothers said that the company would not be sold 'to just anybody,' adding that they would not welcome bids from the company's main competitors, International Data Group and CMP Publications. K-III Communications, which owns about 50 consumer and trade magazines, said it was interested in buying some of Ziff's businesses.</p>

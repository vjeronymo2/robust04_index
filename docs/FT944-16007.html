			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Barr brothers seek boardroom changes Two family shareholders of Barr and Wallace Arnold Trust yesterday forced the motor distribution and leisure group to call an EGM over the future of two directors. Nicholas and Robert Barr, whose family owns 25 per cent of the group's shares, called the meeting to unseat Mr John Parker, chief executive, and Mr Brian Small, finance director. Earlier this week the two brothers met their uncle, Mr Malcolm Barr, chairman of Barr and Wallace, to discuss the company's strategy. The brothers are understood to want to separate the group's motor and leisure divisions and reduce central overheads. They want to appoint themselves to the board alongside Mr Helmut Schweimler, a former managing director of Hetzel Reisen, the German holiday company. The two said they did not look upon this as a family feud. However, it is understood that the group sees the brothers' actions as an attempt to return it to family control. Mr Malcolm Barr, who owns 16 per cent of the Barr and Wallace shares, defended the group's strategy. 'The board appointed John Parker and Brian Small earlier this year,' he said. 'Developments since those appointments have confirmed that we made the right decision.' Last month Mr Parker said he was brought in to 'look at changing the culture of the company' but added that the Barr family was being proactive in the process. The company, which was founded in 1911 by Mr Malcolm Barr's father, Robert, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.4m on turnover of Pounds 138m in the year to end-December. Mr Nicholas Barr was previously development director of Barr and Wallace. Mr Robert Barr is managing director of Trust Leasing, which he bought from Barr and Wallace for Pounds 2.15m in July.</p>

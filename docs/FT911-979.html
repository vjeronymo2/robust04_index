			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Problem solved for French group ELF Aquitaine's acquisition of Occidental's North Sea assets neatly solves a financial problem for the French state-controlled group. Elf officials are delighted at being able to pay for part of the purchase with some of the French company's 25 per cent shareholding in Enterprise Oil, Britain's largest independent oil company. This allows the French oil group to transform what had become a purely financial investment into an asset of real industrial value, say Elf officials. The group denies that it was influenced by the UK government's hardened stance against acquisitions by foreign state-controlled companies. Last July, Mr Peter Lilley, the UK Trade and Industry Secretary, announced that he would scrutinise all such acquisitions - a policy designed to 'curb nationalisations by the back door'. Elf has always argued that its investment in Enterprise was purely financial and that it had no desire to seize control. Yet a more stringent UK mergers policy had clearly limited Elf's room for manoeuvre. Only last week, Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission gave Elf clearance to take over the UK refinery and petrol station business of Amoco, the big US oil group. It was the latest of four decisions which ran contrary to the UK government's attempt to curb such takeovers and, as such, a setback for the Department of Trade and Industry. Elf officials welcomed the victory, but stressed that they were keen to avoid a repetition of the months they had to spend on defending their case at the commission.</p>

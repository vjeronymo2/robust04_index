			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROGER &amp; REALITY  </P> <P> Peter Rainer's piece on Michael Moore's "Roger &amp; Me" raises more questions  than it answers, especially about the art of film editing. Anyone who has ever  done it knows how manipulative it is.  </P> <P> If, for example, you juxtapose Roger Smith giving a Dickensian message of  Christmas good cheer with shots of people being tossed out of their homes, what  is the emotional impact likely to be?  </P> <P> And anyone in film or television knows that if you try to interview a tycoon  without an appointment you are likely to be hedged off by flacks -- and that if  you throw sociological questions at a beauty queen as she comes off a parade  the answers are likely to be less than profound.  </P> <P> The biggest questions remain unanswered. Does a corporation or an industry have  any ethical responsibility to the community in which it locates? Does it have  the right to move elsewhere if it can get a better deal? Perhaps these can be  answered with another question: Is Warner Bros. distributing this film out of  idealism or because it thinks there is profit in it?  </P> <P> TONY THOMAS  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 34.43(d) has been relocated from &sect;34.11(d), and describes the requirements for routine inspections of job performance for radiographers and radiographers' assistants. The proposed rule reduces the frequency of these inspections from quarterly to annually. The NRC is proposing to reduce the frequency of inspections of job performance for individuals regularly conducting radiographic operations. For individuals who have not performed radiographic operations for more than six months, an inspection of their job performance would be required at the time of their next participation in a radiographic operation. With several of the other requirements proposed in this rulemaking, such as, certification of radiographers, and having at least two individuals at a temporary jobsite, the Commission believes that the frequency of inspection of job performance can be reduced from quarterly to annually.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;34.43(e) specifies that recordkeeping requirements can be found in &sect;34.79. The requirements for records are unchanged from the current part 34 except for the addition of records verifying the certification status of radiographers. Proposed &sect;34.43(f) contains the subjects currently listed in Appendix A of part 34. Several additional requirements are proposed. These include: Pictures or models of source assemblies; training in storage, control, and disposal of licensed materials; and pertinent Federal regulations, i.e., Department of Transportation. A new &sect;34.43(g) would be added which would allow licensees to continue to permit uncertified individuals to act as radiographers for a 2-year period after the proposed rule becomes final.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;34.45, Operating and emergency procedures, minor changes were made to include procedures for source recovery if the licensee intends to perform emergency source recovery. These were added because many of the steps in a source recovery would be the same in any circumstance and, in the past, a number of personnel overexposures have occurred during emergency source recovery operations because basic radiation protection precautions were overlooked. Additional requirements are proposed for transportation procedures to include placarding of vehicles, and reference to the DOT regulations. A number of violations have resulted from licensees failing to follow DOT regulations in the transportation of radioactive material. Section 34.45(b) is proposed which specifies that the recordkeeping requirements can be found in &sect;34.81. Sections 34.89 and 34.91 specify that copies of current operating and emergency procedures are to be maintained at field stations, permanent installations, and temporary jobsites, to ensure that adequate documents are available where radiographic operations occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 34.46, Supervision of radiographers' assistants, is unchanged from &sect;34.44 of the current rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;34.47, Personnel monitoring, several changes are proposed. The existing requirement specifies that pocket dosimeters have a range from zero to at least 200 milliroentgens. The proposed rule has dropped the term ``at least,'' to limit the range to be only from 0&hyph;200. This is to prevent the use of pocket dosimeters with very high ranges where the users would be unable to properly determine their exposure. Use of pocket dosimeters with a range higher than 200 milliroentgens will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Additional requirements are proposed on the replacement frequency for film and TLDs. The existing regulation does not specify the replacement frequency for film and TLDs. The high intensity sources used in radiography necessitate frequent monitoring. Monthly replacement is judged to be an appropriate frequency to adequately track an individual's exposure. With the new lower limits for occupational dose, less frequent monitoring could result in a worker receiving an overexposure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 34.47(b) addresses the use of pocket dosimeters. A requirement to read dosimeters at the beginning and end of each shift is proposed. This is added to ensure that the dose is correctly estimated. The existing regulation only specifies a daily reading and does not provide sufficient instruction on how licensees should handle any readings which remain on the pocket dosimeter after recharging. Because it is nearly impossible to recharge a pocket dosimeter to zero, licensees must take a reading before and after use and determine the difference to determine the dose accurately. Section 34.47(d) addresses an off-scale pocket dosimeter. The proposed rule would require that, in the case of a pocket dosimeter being off-scale, the individual will not be permitted to work with licensed material until the RSO or a designee of the RSO makes a determination of the worker's radiation exposure. The current rule requires that the worker's film badge or TLD be sent for processing, but does not specify when the individual can return to work. The proposed revision provides the criteria that must be met before permitting the individual to return to work. A provision is included which will permit the individual to return to work when the circumstances are clearly known and justified by the RSO that there was no possibility of overexposure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 34.47(e) is proposed to require that a worker cease work whenever a film badge or TLD is lost or damaged until a replacement is available. This is added to ensure that there is a means to accurately determine the worker's radiation dose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

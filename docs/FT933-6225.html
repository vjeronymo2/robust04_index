			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Books: Storyteller weaves magic with myths THE MARRIAGE OF CADMUS AND HARMONY by Roberto Calasso Jonathan Cape Pounds 19.99, 403 pages ROBERTO Calasso's The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony has been celebrated around the world this year, and it is necessary to ask why. This is not just a retelling of Greek myth, nor even a brilliant evocation of the classical world. It offers itself as much more: a recreation of myth for the modern imagination and so, in some sense, a new myth, composed both of the ancient stories and of the meaning which a 20th century sensibility can make of them. This makes it a formidable blend of two kinds of minds that often exclude each other - the poetic and the analytic - where the gods are both overwhelmingly present and figures for thought. Calasso gives us the original Greek myths and a reflection upon those myths, both story and interpretation, image and commentary, sitting down side by side with each other as once happened with gods and mortals until Cadmus brought the alphabet to humanity and the gods withdrew into our indifference. But why does it work? Primarily because Calasso is an enchanting storyteller, weaving his tales together with all the craftsmanship of the bard in the market place, bewitching his audience with iridescent images and poignant dramas, then drawing them subtly into discussion and, suddenly, secular perspective. For instance, while he is giving us Europa barely lifted above the waves by the shuddering bull, Zeus, in his race to Crete, Calasso mentions in passing the Linear B tablets and the fact that all Cretan stories have a bull at the beginning and the end. As he ranges from Homer through Pindar, Herodotus, Ovid and many others to Nonnus, the little-known 5th century AD Hellenised Egyptian writer, he achieves many fascinating insights into classical myths, and into the nature and persistence of myth in general: as when Harmony, trying but failing to resist marriage to Cadmus, understands 'that myth is the precedent behind every action, its invisible, ever-present lining'. Or, as the fate of Socrates showed, 'we enter the mythical when we enter the realm of risk, and myth is the enchantment we generate in ourselves at such moments.' Yet the book seems to me to contain a danger which is probably inevitable and a flaw which is not. The danger is that this particular style, suspending all our disbelief, invites us to receive Calasso's interpretations as a part of the story, and so to lose the difference between the Greek and the modern eye, which has so much to teach us. When, for example, following the entrancing story of Theseus and Ariadne, we read that 'the heroic gesture of women is betrayal' and find Ariadne classed with Antigone on the grounds that they were both the ruin of their cities, we may wonder wearily if classical heroines are doomed to suffer the same fate as Eve. 'Antigone betrays the law of her city to make a gesture of mercy toward a dead man who does not belong to that city.' On the contrary, Sophocles' emphasis is on the nobility of the sacrifice of her own life for love of her brother against the tyrant Creon, the tragedy of individual value asserting itself against the collective rule of law. Myths of other cultures offer a unique perspective on our own culture and we have always to guard against re-imagining them in the image of our own one-sidedness. Another consequence of this blend of modes of discourse is that we have to take the whole story just as he tells it, as, it might well be argued, we do with any storyteller. But many of these characters are already known to us and have a distinct place in the way we think of things. Without demanding that there be only one version, are we not entitled to pursue these figures independently in the other paths they take in the tales he tells? When only the sources of direct quotations are given, but not the sources of reported speech of which most of the book is composed, we cannot carry our reflections further ourselves. The omission of an index (and a bibliography) also limits the ways we can approach the book: perhaps Calasso is frustrating any use of it as a dispassionate reference book; perhaps he's trying to let the stories live on their own? The flaw is that on occasion he takes the characters out of their separate stories and makes them a composite character, spanning many centuries and embracing incompatible extremes of behaviour, and this confuses the identity of figures we know. He fails at times to honour the integrity of the particular poems and stories which first gave the figures their habitation and their names. In this way, he allows myth to subsume literature, forgetting that it is literature that gives voice to myth. Myth then becomes a generalisation from literature instead of emerging as a certain depth of resonance in poem and painting which allows an opening into the mythic realm. The Homeric Hymn to Demeter, for instance, which he relates beautifully and at length, so that we enter with delight the particular imaginative world of the seventh century BC poem, is suddenly interrupted with the goddess Demeter's giving of herself 'illicitly' to King Celeus, according to an obscure scholiast, Gregory of Nazianzus, a fourth-century AD saint. We have instantly to abandon the Demeter of the Hymn whose awesome presence, when she revealed herself, terrified Celeus and all the sons of Eleusis into building her a temple immediately. Even more disturbing are Calasso's several stories of Odysseus, where he moves from one to the other without indication. But Homer's Odysseus is not the same Odysseus as Ovid's; those yet to read the Odyssey will not be assisted by first learning of Penelope as a 'whorish fox' and the mother of Pan, from Lycophron 400 years later (who he?). This skimming across stories, all apparently of equal weight, may do for a sociology of myth but stops working once we engage with art. These reservations are not intended to diminish Calasso's achievement in bringing the classical world to life. That the book has rapidly been translated into many languages points not just, in the waning of our Christian age, to a release of the old myths, once dismissed as pagan ignorance and excess; nor only to a vital reclaiming of classical culture in a time when Latin is no longer compulsory and Greek is rarely studied. Maybe it has also kindled a recognition that myths, telling a universal story, survive the death of the particular culture which first told them, simply because they belong to our specifically human inheritance. As the American mythologist Joseph Campbell once put it: 'The latest incarnation of Oedipus, the continued romance of Beauty and the Beast, stands this afternoon on the corner of Forty-second Street and Fifth Avenue, waiting for the traffic light to change.'</p>

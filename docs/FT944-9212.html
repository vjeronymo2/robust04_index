			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Producer hedging seen capping gold price above Dollars 400 Rising interest rates are encouraging more gold mining companies to hedge their future production and this appears to be putting a 'cap' on any price rise above USDollars 400 a troy ounce, according to the World Gold Council. North American producers can now lock-in prices of about Dollars 410 an ounce for deliveries one year forward, the WGC points out. In Australian dollar terms, forward premiums look even more attractive, it reports in its latest quarterly Gold Demand Trends publication. Interest rate increases have pushed one-year gold contangos (premiums for future delivery) to above 5 per cent. The WGC also points out that, when the gold price tested the top end of its Dollars 370-Dollars 395 range 'heavy trade selling was encountered and the price fell back'. Countries monitored by the WGC, a promotional organisation financed by some gold mining groups, account for an estimated 75 per cent of world demand. In these areas, third-quarter gold demand was 6.2 per cent above the 1993 level at 593 tonnes. But for the first nine months, demand was down 6.4 per cent at 1,690.9. Mr Roger Murphy of the WGC's gold economics service in Europe, pointed out that demand was very high in the first half of 1993 because the price was perceived to be exceptionally low. There had since been a rise of about 20 per cent and latest figures indicated demand was stabilising. If the third-quarter trend continued for the rest of 1994, gold consumption for the full year would come close to the 1992 record of 2,473.6 tonnes.</p>

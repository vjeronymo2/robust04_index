			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Change looms for Italian politics: And politicians must decide which way to jump ELECTORAL reform in Italy has finally been removed from the level of mere rhetoric. Parliament now has to come up with proposals in the next two months or its hand will be forced by a referendum to be held between April 18 and June 13. In any event the legislation will have to respect the spirit of the referendum proposals approved on Saturday by the country's constitutional court. This is the immediate effect of the court's historic ruling on 13 referendums, of which 10 were approved. But admitting the referendums will have a much broader impact on the whole issue of reforming Italy's institutional structure, put in place by the 1947 constitution. As one commentator said: 'This is the end of the First Republic and the beginning of the Second.' The two most important referendums concern the abolition of the existing system of proportional representation in favour of a first-past-the-post system. Italy's electoral system was geared to a country emerging from fascism into the cold war. Proportional representation was intended to foster minority parties and discourage monolithic groups like the Communists or disbanded fascists. But this has created 52 unstable coalition governments and an unworkable fragmentation of parliamentary parties - with no fewer than 16 represented after last April's general elections. One specific referendum proposal is for 238 of the senate seats to be elected by majority vote and the remaining 77 on the existing method of proportional representation. Another extends the majority vote to municipalities of over 5,000. Although the proposal covers only majority voting for the senate and municipal elections, all parties recognise that the principle extends by implication to the more powerful legislative forum, the chamber of deputies. Equally, the other referendums, which include the abolition of public funding of political parties, will accelerate a general revision of the existing institutional structure. The need for change was emphasised by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro in his inaugural address last May 28 when he took the unprecedented step of calling for a special parliamentary commission. The latter was formed in September from both houses of parliament and was in part intended to head off the cross-party referendum alliance, led by Mr Mario Segni, who already had before the courts his proposals for the Sentae election change. The politicians must now decide whether to work for an agreement in the commission and produce proposals which head off the referendum - or wait until after the referendum result is known. The latter course is most likely. Time is too short, and enough politicians (like Mr Segni, the Christian Democrat leader and Mr Claudio Martelli, the Socialist minister of justice) believe their ambitions will be furthered by riding the referendum wave, which will almost certainly triumph, given the discredit of the traditional parties. Mr Mino Martinazzoli, the Christian Democrat leader, candidly commented: 'We would rather avoid the referendum, although frankly at this stage I fear we cannot. Nevertheless, if the referendum is held we will be protagonists and not be overtaken by the event.' This suggests the Christian Democrats will try to ensure the referendum vote is not a popular judgment on their role in government. Indeed it will be surprising if every political party does not jump on the referendum band-wagon. But if this happens, it will merely speed the process of change and at the same time encourage the nascent cross-party alliances. With electoral reform pushed to the top of the national agenda absorbing all the parties' attention, Prof Giuliano Amato's coalition government should benefit. With the exception of the hardline Reconstituted Communism and the Lombard League, no party now has an interest in ending his fragile coalition until the lines of a new electoral law have been agreed and probably approved by parliament. On this basis the government has until the summer, and then it will be for the politicians to decide whether to call early elections or expand the government to obtain a broader consensus in order to introduce comprehensive constitutional reforms.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, Jan 12 (AFP)--China's top tax official  took pains Wednesday to reassure foreign investors concerned  that sweeping fiscal reforms implemented this year will increase  their tax burden.    The most dramatic changes in China's tax system since 1949  were implemented January 1, and there has been confusion over  the implications of the reforms, principally aimed at boosting  central government revenue.    Foreign firms are mainly concerned with the fate of the  preferential corporate-tax rates they have enjoyed as a result  of China's push to attract foreign investment in recent years.    "The preferential treatment already extended to foreign  investors in terms of their corporate income tax will remain  unchanged," state administration of taxation director Jin Xin  told a news conference here. The preferential 15 percent  income-tax rate is for foreign-funded firms operating in China's  special economic zones, coastal economic and technological  development areas and Shanghai's special Pudong industrial zone.    The new tax reforms abolish the old unified industrial and  commercial tax on sales, replacing it with a unified  corporate-tax rate of 33 percent. A new value-added tax (VAT)  of 17 percent on most products has also gone into effect. Luxury  goods, such as tobacco, alcohol and cars, now carry a stiff 45  percent excise tax in addition to the VAT.    While the reforms will inevitably bring some changes to the  tax bills of foreign-invested enterprises, Jin said, he stressed  that they primarily involved a restructuring of the taxation  system rather than a blanket tax hike. "The majority of  foreign-funded enterprises will have a similar tax burden before  and after the current reform," he said.    Jin also outlined a special policy for refunds to foreign  firms whose tax payments increased as a result of the changes.  While the new taxes are still being levied, any resulting  additional tax burden will be refunded for the duration of those  firms' existing contracts over a maximum period of five years,  Jin said. However, within those five years--or until their  contract expires--"they have to transform their operational  mechanisms, improve their economic efficiency and create  conditions so as to compete with domestic enterprises" at the  same tax rate, Jin said. The special policy will only apply to  foreign-investment projects approved before January 1.    Jin admitted that during the transitional five-year period,  foreign-funded firms that set up in China before and after  January 1 would operate on a different tax scale, but added that  it was normal for a dividing line to be drawn somewhere.    Jin also said there were no immediate plans to introduce  production-related reductions in the amount of VAT paid by  foreign firms purchasing equipment in China. Some foreign  companies have expressed concern that the proposed system makes  no provisions for reducing VAT payments in the long term as  exist in other countries. However, Jin added that such  provisions could be introduced at a later stage if they proved  reasonable and feasible.</p>

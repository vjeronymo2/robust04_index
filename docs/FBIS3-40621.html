Mr. Aftab Sh'aban Mirani, Pakistan's defense  minister, is currently visiting China. Talks were held on the  proposed plan of building MBT-2000 tanks. Pakistani Defense  Minister Aftab Sh'aban Mirani, Chinese Defense Minister Chi  Hutian, and Chairman of the Central Military Commission Liu Ho  Chiang participated in these discussions. Chinese technology  will be used to build these tanks in Pakistan, and these tanks  will be in the same class as Russian T-72 tanks, German  Leopard-2 tanks, and the U. S. Abraham. This plan has been  shelved for several years because of restrictions on Pakistan's  nuclear program.    Mirani also visited a tank factory in Mongolia, where T-85  tanks are built for Pakistan. The Pakistani defense minister is  visiting China at a time when a Chinese military deputation is  holding talks in Islamabad about providing aid to Pakistan. The  Pakistani army is obtaining facts in order to counter  neighboring India. Pakistan is expected to get 200 tanks;  however, no talks have been finalized.</p>

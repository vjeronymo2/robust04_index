			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Report from the Pailin battlefield on 22, 23, 24,  and 25 March:    I. On 22 March, the invading forces of the communist  Vietnamese puppets and the two-headed government struggled to  reach Pailin from the east, that is from Phnum Srang and  Suosdei, with infantry troops after being heavily attacked for  many days.    II. Here is the situation on the Pailin battlefield on 23  March:    1. Major communications lines of the invading forces on the  north from Phnum Kon Damrei to Sala Krau were completely cut by  the people and the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK]  with mines and with attacks to cut off many road segments.  Trucks and tanks were bogged down due to rain. The invading  forces' supplies from the north were completely cut off along  the Mongkolborei River, from Kamping Puoy, and from Snoeng and  Sdau. The invading forces at Sala Krau are running short of  fuel, ammunition, and food supplies. Troops, therefore, have  deserted the battlefield and also have been surrounded and are  constantly attacked by the people and the NADK. They cannot move  forward or retreat.    2. On 23 March, nearly 1,000 soldiers of the invading forces  who reached Pailin deserted the town partly because there is  nothing in Pailin. Furthermore, the invading forces were being  surrounded and constantly fired upon by big and small artillery  pieces.    III. On 24 and 25 March, the new road of the invading forces  from Suosdei to Pailin was completely disrupted by mines and  attack groups who cut this road at many places. This road goes  through dense forest. The invading troops cannot leave the  road, particularly trucks and tanks. The ground is soft due to  rain over the past more than 10 days.    IV. Two strategic and important roads have been cut: the  northern road from Phnum Kon damrei to Sala Krau and the  southern road from Suosdei to Pailin. This is like cutting the  throat or the arteries of the invading forces, similar to  cutting National Routes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 in 1971-74, and  in particular blocking the Mekong River in February, March, and  April 1975. It is similar to cutting transport roads No. 68  from Samraong to Anlung Veng in February and in early March  1994. It is similar to Dien Bien Phu and Stalingrad.    V. Communications and transport routes of the invading  forces have been strategically cut, first of all, by the people  and the NADK. Along with this, attacking and raiding forces  have been set up within Pailin perimeter and Sala Krau. Attacks  have been launched at will against the enemies who are like fish  caught in traps.    Because rats are clever in stealing, bait has been left in  traps to catch them. They are caught in the traps. Rats  trapped in cages will die regardless of the movements and  shrieks they make.</p>

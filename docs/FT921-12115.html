			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / International Bonds: National Bank of Hungary launches DM600m issue THE National Bank of Hungary, the Hungarian government's borrowing conduit, yesterday launched its largest bond offering to date in the international capital markets, a DM600m issue of seven-year bonds. The perception of Hungary's credit in the international capital markets has improved steadily in the past year, allowing the bank, once confined to the Japanese and German markets, to raise funds in a range of sectors. However, the latest offering of 10 1/4 per cent seven-year bonds looked too aggressively priced, compared with a DM500m transaction launched last October which carries a coupon of 10 3/4 per cent and matures in 1998. 'The coupon level is of prime importance to retail investors. There is no reason for them to buy these bonds, if they have 10 3/4 per cent bonds,' one trader said. The National Bank plans a number of transactions in the international capital markets this year. Its borrowing programme consists entirely of refinancing, totalling Dollars 2.4bn. However, about half will be met by funds from agencies such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, leaving around Dollars 1.2bn of funding to be completed in the international capital markets. Interest servicing needs will be covered from Hungary's current account, which is running a trade surplus, according to Mr Bela Sandor, general manager in the international division of the National Bank. 'Fresh money will come from direct capital investment throughout the commercial banking sector,' Mr Sandor said. Hungary has also raised Y30bn through an issue of 7 per cent 10-year bonds in the Samurai market - the Japanese domestic market for foreign borrowers. Hungary's next international offering is likely to be denominated in Ecu or dollars. The government is keen to establish benchmark issues in these sectors, by issuing deals of a reasonably large size - a minimum of Dollars 200m or Ecu200m. However, following the latest financings, Hungary has covered its current funding needs until June and will be able to service its debt without reducing its foreign exchange reserves. In the dollar sector, Chugoku Electric Power, the Japanese electricity utility, launched a Dollars 250m five-year bond via Goldman Sachs. The bonds were considered fairly priced, offering a yield spread of 54 basis points above the comparable US Treasury bond. The dollar sector remains overburdened with paper, and is not being helped by a rather uncertain tone in the underlying US Treasury market. However, the familiar name, coupled with a 7 per cent coupon, attracted firm demand from Japanese investors, according to the lead manager. In the equity-linked market, Hanwa Company launched a Dollars 360m offering of bonds with warrants via Yamaichi. The deal was bid at less 1/2 point, comfortably within 2 1/2 point fees.</p>

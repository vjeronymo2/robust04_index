			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / International Company News: Elkem close to selling subsidiary to US group ELKEM, the Norwegian light metals producer, has almost completed the NKr330m (Dollars 57.2m) disposal of its Elkem Nefelin subsidiary to US-based Unimin Corporation, a minerals and mining company. The sale could return Elkem a profit of over NKr200m. Details will be announced after final approval is received from Norwegian authorities. A final agreement could be signed within three months. Elkem Nefelin produces nepheline syenite, a mineral used by the glass and ceramic industries. It has an extensive domestic distribution network and last year posted a pre-tax profit of NKr32m. The deal also calls for Unimin to acquire Nefelin's debt, estimated at NKr60m at the end of last year. 'The sale will contribute further to strengthen the Elkem group's balance sheet and to free capital,' the company said. Elkem's A shares closed NKr1.50 up at NKr32 and free shares rose NKr2 to NKr39 on the news. Elkem is raising much-needed capital and reducing debt through the disposal of assets and reining in costs through further staff cuts and reductions in output from aluminium and ferrosilicon plants. The company said the Elkem Nefelin disposal, combined with the earlier disposals of its 50 per cent stake in Elkem-Rockwool and its wholly owned Elkem Eiendom real estate subsidiary, would reduce debt by NKr900m. Mr Kevin F. Crawford, Unimin's president and chief executive, will develop Elkem Nefelin and regarded the company as highly competitive. 'Due to the distance from our North American headquarters, we will be relying on the existing management and production workforce of Elkem Nefelin,' Mr Crawford said. For Elkem, the disposal means a further concentration of the group's core business areas of ferroalloys, silicon metal and aluminium.</p>

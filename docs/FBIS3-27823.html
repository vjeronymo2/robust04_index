The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: We must  also vigorously accelerate the technological revolution in rural  areas and, thus, industrialize agriculture.    Industrializing agriculture entails implementing a set of  modern technological processes and carrying out tasks to build  irrigation systems, use electric equipment and chemical  fertilizers in farming, and mechanize farm work.    If we industrialize agriculture, we can develop the rural  economy into a large-scale economy based on modern machinery and  technology and rapidly increase agricultural production; remove  differences in agricultural labor and industrial labor; and  liberate peasants from heavy labor.    Industrializing agriculture is an indispensable task to  ultimately resolve the rural question. First, because this can  meet material preconditions for resolving the rural question.  As the "Theses on the Socialist Rural Question" points out, a  slow increase in agriculture's productive forces is an important  factor that gives rise to backwardness in rural areas compared  to urban areas.    A socialist society is an advanced society based on superior  socialist relations in production and a high material and  technological base. If we are to consolidate the socialist  system and fully display its superiority, we must continuously  expand and strengthen socialist relations in production and  improve the material and technological base to a high level  required under socialism.    A victory of the socialist revolution in urban and rural  areas makes it possible for socialist relations in production to  prevail dominantly in rural areas. A high material and  technological base that can highly display the superiority of  the socialist system does not automatically result from a  victory in the socialist revolution. If we are to further  consolidate the established socialist rural economic system,  fully display its superiority, and achieve a complete victory of  socialism, we must continuously develop the technological  revolution on a higher level and build a strong material and  technological base of the rural economy, even when the socialist  system has been established.    Industrializing agriculture is a fundamental way to build a  strong material and technological base of agriculture to comply  with the innate demands of the socialist rural economic system.  Industrializing agriculture continuously makes it possible to  carry out the technological revolution, equip the rural economy  with modern machinery and technology, widely apply the latest  achievements of agricultural science to farming, and, thus build  a strong material and technological base of the rural economy  and eliminate the slow increase in agriculture's productive  forces compared to the industrial sector.    Today, our country has vigorously carried out the rural  technological revolution under the party's wise leadership, and,  as a result, peasants are farming using science and technology  and working more easily and joyfully.    The work to build irrigation systems and use electric  equipment in farming has already been completed, the work to  comprehensively mechanize farm work and use chemical fertilizers  in farming has been implemented on a high level, and the chuche  farming method has been implemented. As a result, agricultural  production is being developed rapidly based on modern science  and technology.    Agricultural productive forces have improved to the level  of those of the industrial sector, and the gap between  industrial labor and agricultural labor is being narrowed  significantly. These achievements are a material basis for  ultimately resolving the rural question.    Second, industrializing agriculture is an indispensable task  because this will quickly fulfill ideological requirements for  resolving the rural question. The ideological reform of people  is closely related to the material basis. People's ideology and  will are affected by the material conditions of society to a  certain extent. Labor activities are a basic sphere of people's  lives. Eliminating the fundamental difference between peasants'  labor activities and those of workers in other fields and  liberating peasants from heavy labor will make peasants lead  more independent and creative lives and endlessly demonstrate  their positive creativity and revolutionary ardor.    When peasants are liberated from heavy labor and their lives  become more independent and creative, they will more positively  play their role of masters in rural construction and vigorously  accelerate socialist rural construction.    When agriculture is industrialized, all processes in  agricultural production will completely become technological  processes, just like in industrial production. This is a  favorable development that can change peasants' working  conditions and their lives and more rapidly reform their idea  and will into the working class' advanced ideology.    Consequently, industrializing agriculture plays an important  role in promoting an environment for resolving the rural  question. In this way, industrializing agriculture strengthens  a material and technological basis in rural areas, eliminates a  gap between increases in agriculture's productive forces and  increases in the industrial sector's productive forces, and,  consequently, plays an important role in ultimately resolving  the rural question.    We must vigorously carry out the technological revolution in  rural areas and, thus, consolidate the previous achievements and  complete the industrialization of agriculture.</p>

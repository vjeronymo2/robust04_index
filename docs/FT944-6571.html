			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: BT free to choose on fibre Sir, Regarding BT's exclusion from entertainment services and the superhighway, I have yet to read such an ill-informed debate as has raged over this particular technology in your pages and elsewhere. Fibre cables are cheap, passive and they deliver unlimited 'band width'  - the measure of capacity for signals. The cost and speed of laying a fibre network is dominated not by the electronics connected at either end, nor the fibre itself, but by the construction of the underground ducting in which they lie. An entirely new network of ducts is being installed in the UK by the new 'local delivery' franchisees. These ducts bring a fibre to within 600m of every residential home. Nowhere else in the world, to my knowledge, are fibre networks being created at this proximity to the customer, even in the birthplace of the 'superhighway', the US. BT does not have to dig. It inherited its ducts free of charge. BT does not need a law or permission to install fibre into its ducts. BT has the free choice to bring fibre to within 600m of each home and whether to connect its new fibres to you or me. As an aside, BT is the local delivery franchisee for the City of Westminster. It operates a fibre-based entertainment network. In this franchise fibres were laid in existing BT ducts several years ago. Strangely, in the City of Westminster residential customers have a single source of telephone line connection, guess who? Well, it owns the ducts, doesn't it?

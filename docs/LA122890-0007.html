			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PARENTS OF DROWNED BOY SUE OVER BROKEN FENCE;  </P> <P> LAWSUIT: CANAL FENCE BUILT 9 YEARS AGO ON SAN PASQUAL INDIAN RESERVATION AFTER  DEATH OF ANOTHER TODDLER WASN'T MAINTAINED, ACCORDING TO SUIT, WHICH SEEKS $24  MILLION IN DAMAGES.  </P> <P> The family of a 2-year-old boy who drowned in a canal June 15 on the San  Pasqual Indian Reservation filed a $24-million lawsuit Thursday that charged  the city of Escondido and the Vista Irrigation District with failing to  maintain a fence through which the toddler crawled.  </P> <P> Bani Reyes spent 10 minutes under water before a 16-year-old girl squeezed  through a hole in the fence and grabbed him as he floated by. Paramedics tried  to revive the toddler, who died 12 hours later. In 1981, 2-year old Melissa  Varella drowned in the same canal, which flows into Lake Wohlford and Lake  Henshaw.  </P> <P> The lawsuit, filed in San Diego Superior Court on behalf of the boy's mother  and father, Miguel and Oliva Reyes, and brother and sister, Isai and Eonise,  asks for $6 million for each family member.  </P> <P> C. Bradley Hallen, the family's attorney, said officials from the city and  water district put up the 8-foot fence that lines each side of the canal after  Varella's death nine years ago but failed to patch the holes that have since  developed.  </P> <P> John Schell, an attorney for the irrigation district, said he had not seen the  lawsuit and could not comment. A spokeswoman for the Escondido city attorney's  office said the city had not yet been served.  </P> <P> The Reyes family lived in a mobile home on the Indian reservation on a plot  they rented from the San Pasqual Indians. The canal was 25 to 30 feet from  their home, Hallen said.  </P> <P> On the day of the drowning, Bani Reyes was playing with his 6-year-old brother,  Isai, when Bani crawled under the chain-link fence, Hallen said.  </P> <P> Someone called Oliva Reyes, who ran with neighborhood residents to the canal.  Maria Garcia, 16, heard the mother's screams, scrambled to a hole in the fence  downstream and plucked the toddler from the swift-moving current.  </P> <P> "The hole wasn't enough to let an adult through," Hallen said. "So they ran  downstream and the first large enough hole was a half-mile down the canal. They  pulled the child out but he was unconscious and died the next day."  </P> <P> The fence was repaired the day after Reyes died, Hallen said.  </P> <P> In 1981, Melissa Crystal Varella wandered about 150 yards from her home while  her mother was taking a shower and dropped into the canal. U.S. Border Patrol  officers and sheriff's deputies found the girl's body about 200 yards below the  pumping station at Old Juajita Road and Lake Wohlford.  </P> <P> After Varella's death, several bands of Indians on the reservation were angry  with the Escondido Mutual Water Co. and asked that the canal be made safer.  Several people protested what they said was the water company's inaction by  dumping trash in the canal.  </P> <P> The Indians demanded that the canal be covered or a safety fence erected.  </P> <P> "They opted to fence the canal as the least expensive alternative," Hallen  said. "In the years thereafter, they permitted the fence to fall in disrepair  and didn't prevent people from gaining access."  </P> <P> Hallen filed a claim in August with the city of Escondido and the Vista  Irrigation District, which jointly maintain the canal. The claim was rejected.  </P></p>

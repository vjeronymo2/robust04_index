			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Letter: Grand Metropolitan's share price slips on ice Sir, I note that Grand Met's share value closed down 33p on Tuesday. Lex (August 26) attributes this to poor predicted pre-tax profits, the difficulties of Green Giant, and the failure of British beer drinkers to keep up their consumption. But we in North London - with its huge density of share owners and city analysts - know the truth. It is due to the decision to cease production of Haagen-Daz's Swiss almond vanilla ice cream. This was truly the connoisseur's ice cream - its loss could only lead to a plunge in confidence in Grand Met and to Tuesday's bad news. Let us hope Sir Allan Sheppard learns his lesson. Lesley Smith, 52 Etherley Road, London N15 3AJ</p>

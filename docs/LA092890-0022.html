			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GARDEN GROVE LEAGUE;  </P> <P> ARGONAUTS SCREENED OUT BY LA QUINTA  </P> <P> Using the screen pass as if they had invented it, La Quinta High School's  Aztecs rolled over Garden Grove, 27-14, Thursday night in the Garden Grove  League opener for both teams at Bolsa Grande High School.  </P> <P> "It's no secret," said La Quinta Coach Roger Takahashi. "We like the screens  and we use them."  </P> <P> In a game that wasn't as close as the score indicated, the Aztecs (4-0, 1-0 in  league) didn't waste any time going to their favorite play.  </P> <P> With the 1,000 or so in attendance barely in their seats, La Quinta quarterback  Donald Hopkins hit Walter Dawkins with a screen pass on second and eight from  the Aztec 39-yard line, and the senior tailback ran 61 yards along the right  sideline for the score with 8 minutes 33 seconds remaining in the first period.  It was Hopkins' second pass of the game.  </P> <P> The Aztecs padded their lead to 10-0 four minutes later on a 46-yard field goal  by Mike Berg.  </P> <P> By the end of the quarter, though, Garden Grove (1-3, 0-1) began to show signs  of recovery when it marched 70 yards on 10 plays to cut the La Quinta lead to  10-7 on a Bob Ioja one-yard run with 11:59 left in the second period.  </P> <P> The Argonauts' hopes were short-lived, however.  </P> <P> Hopkins, who completed 18 of 25 passes for 238 yards and two touchdowns, hooked  up with wide receiver Dusty DePree on a 20-yard pass play with 5:51 to play in  the quarter, and Berg added a 34-yard field goal with time running out in the  half to increase the Aztec lead to 20-7.  </P> <P> The teams traded touchdowns in the second half, the Aztecs scoring on a  five-yard run by George Sanchez in the third period and the Argonauts scoring  late in the fourth quarter on a 25-yard pass play from backup quarterback Simon  Fuentes to wide receiver Brian Swogger.  </P> <P> Dawkins, with 100 yards in five receptions, and DePree, with 77 yards in five  catches, were the primary beneficiaries of Hopkins' passes.  </P> <P> The Aztec defense neutralized Garden Grove's highly touted junior tight end,  Adrian Ioja, who caught only one pass from his brother, Bob, for an 11-yard  gain. Bob Ioja finished the game with seven completions in 16 attempts for 106  yards.  </P></p>

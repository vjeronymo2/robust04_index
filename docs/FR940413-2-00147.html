			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal will not restrict personal volunteer work by municipal finance professionals in political campaigns other than soliciting or coordinating contributions. However, if resources of the dealer are used or expenses are incurred by the municipal finance professional in personal volunteer work, the value of the resources or expenses must be included in determining whether the dealer is restricted from future negotiated underwritings involving that issuer or whether the municipal finance professional exceeded the $250 limitation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Solicitation Restriction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal also will prohibit dealers from soliciting contributions on behalf of officials of issuers with which the dealer is engaging or seeking to engage in municipal securities business. <FOOTCITE>47</FOOTCITE>  This will prevent dealers from engaging in municipal securities business with issuers if they engage in any kind of fund-raising activities for officials of the issuers that may influence the underwriter selection process. This prohibition on solicitation and coordination also applies to municipal finance professionals. The proposal prohibits municipal finance professionals from soliciting contributions to an official of an issuer with which the dealer engages or is seeking to engage in municipal securities business and from coordinating contributions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 47 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The term ``seeking to engage in municipal securities business'' means dealer activities including responding to requests for proposals, making presentations of public finance capabilities, and other soliciting of business with issuer officials. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Disclosure and Recordkeeping <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal would establish disclosure and recordkeeping requirements to facilitate enforcement of rule G&hyph;37's ``pay to play'' restrictions and, independently, to function as a public disclosure mechanism to enhance the integrity of and public confidence in municipal securities underwritings. Thus, although the disclosure and recordkeeping provisions will generally supplement the ``pay to play'' restrictions, the purposes served by these provisions are distinct from, and not dependent on, the business disqualification or solicitation restriction provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Rule G&hyph;37 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed rule G&hyph;37 will require dealers to disclose to the MSRB on Form G&hyph;37 certain information about political contributions, as well as other summary information, to facilitate public scrutiny of political contributions in the context of the municipal securities business of a dealer. Contributions to be reported include those to officials of issuers and political parties of states and political subdivisions made by the dealer, any municipal finance professional, any executive officer, and any PAC controlled by the dealer or by any municipal finance professional. <FOOTCITE>48</FOOTCITE>  Only contributions over $250 by municipal finance professionals and executive officers are required to be disclosed. The proposal does not require dealers to disclose the names of individual municipal finance professionals and executive officers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 48 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal does not require dealers to maintain a list of contributions by other employees, affiliated companies and their employees, spouses of municipal finance professionals, or any other person or entity unless the contributions were directed by persons or entities subject to the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal requires that dealers report on Form G&hyph;37 by state: (1) The name and title, (including any city/county/state or other political subdivision) of each official of an issuer and political party receiving contributions; (2) the total number and dollar amount of contributions made by the dealer, dealer controlled PACs, and associated municipal finance professionals, and (3) other identifying information as required by Form G&hyph;37. Dealers also will be required to disclose issuers with which the dealer has engaged in municipal securities business during the reporting period, along with the type of municipal securities business and the name, company, role and compensation arrangement of any person employed by the dealer to obtain or retain municipal securities business from the issuers. The reports are required to be made on Form G&hyph;37 and to be submitted to the MSRB in accordance with rule G&hyph;37 filing procedures, quarterly, by dates determined by the MSRB. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

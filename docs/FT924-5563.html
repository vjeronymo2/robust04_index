			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / MPs told of risk to BR routes in south SEA CONTAINERS, the Bermuda-based shipping, ferry and hotel group, warned yesterday that 5 per cent of British Rail's routes would have to close if railways were to become profitable after privatisation. Mr James Sherwood, Sea Containers' president, told MPs that early candidates in the Network SouthEast area would include the North Downs line between Reading and Tonbridge and the Sussex Coast line between Brighton and Hastings. Sea Containers has told the government that it is interested in taking on the franchise for the operation of Network SouthEast's passenger train services between London and the south coast after privatisation. Mr Sherwood told the Commons transport committee that three conditions would have to be fulfilled if costs and revenues were to make the operation viable: Sea Containers would want control of the tracks as well as the trains because it would need to secure reductions in track costs. Mr Sherwood calculated that there was scope for savings of Pounds 50m a year. Double-decker trains would have to be introduced to increase revenues because existing track and train capacity was full and higher fares would result in loss of traffic to road transport. Under-used lines would have to close because they were losing too much money. 'At the moment, British Rail is spending tens of millions of pounds a year running services that no one wants,' Mr Sherwood said. He added that if the government wanted loss-making services to run, it would have to subsidise them. But he said he believed the government intended to phase out subsidies. Three other prospective train operators appearing before the committee lent some much-needed support for the government's privatisation proposals, but each wanted adjustments to the proposed regime. Mr Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Group, said he was interested in providing inter-city services on routes similar to those now operated by short-haul aircraft. The biggest single issue facing his company and other train operators was how much they were going to be charged for the use of the tracks. Mr Branson said rail could not compete with road at present because train oper-ators had to pay very heavy track costs while road users enjoyed free access to the highways. 'Are they going to continue to subsidise road at the expense of rail or are they going to balance the books?' he asked. 'If they are going to balance the books, it will make entry that much easier.' Two bus companies, Stagecoach and Yorkshire Rider, broadly supported the government's proposals but wanted Railtrack, the track-owning authority, to be decentral-ised so that its boundaries matched those of the franchise areas. Stagecoach said it wanted that to be a transitional step leading to the eventual takeover of the tracks by franchisees.</p>

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Technology: Home and dry - Worth Watching A heated towel rail which switches itself on before you get into the bath, or shutters that automatically close at sunset are the promises of a home automation system developed by the French consumer industry company Groupe Moulinex. Scenario uses the domestic electric wiring system to send signals from a control unit, just the size of a telephone, to appliances which are plugged in around the house. Each appliance is wired to an 'intelligent' plug, which acknowledges orders and sends back a message to the central console to confirm that the order has been carried out. The system can also be activated by telephone. Groupe Moulinex: France, 1 49 20 72 00.</p>

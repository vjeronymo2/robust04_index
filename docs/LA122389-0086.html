			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA AND SUNSHINE EXPECTED IN SOUTHLAND  </P> <P> It's going to be a blue Christmas in Los Angeles. Blue skies, that is.  </P> <P> While gloomy, gray skies and freezing temperatures plague most of the nation,  the three-day holiday weekend in Los Angeles will feature sunshine and warmer  than normal high temperatures.  </P> <P> "I'm not expecting a whole lot of changes through the holiday weekend," said  Dan Bowman, a meteorologist for WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for  The Times. "The high-pressure system, which has been the same here for weeks,  isn't showing any signs of budging."  </P> <P> Bowman said that high temperatures over the holiday weekend in the Southland  will range from the upper 60s along the coast to the 70s inland. Overnight lows  will range from the upper 30s inland to the upper 40s along the coast.  </P> <P> Gusty winds may blow below canyons and passes, but should reach no more than 10  to 20 m.p.h.  </P> <P> On Friday, the high temperature at the Civic Center was 74 degrees, seven  degrees higher than average. The overnight low was 49 degrees, one degree above  average.  </P> <P> The Rocky Mountains, Bowman said, have saved the West Coast from the Arctic  front that has been delivering record cold temperatures to the Eastern  two-thirds of the nation. Just east of the Rockies in Colorado, temperatures  were hovering at around 0 degrees Friday afternoon. West of the Rockies in  Utah, temperatures were 40 degrees warmer.  </P> <P> The warmest temperatures in the nation Friday were in Southern California, with  the thermometer hitting 80 in Montebello and 81 in Escondido and Fallbrook.  </P> <P> That trend should continue until well after Santa has dropped off his presents.  The only thing missing for Christmas in the Southland will be -- as usual --  snow.  </P> <P> "It's going to be a real nice weekend," Bowman said.  </P></p>

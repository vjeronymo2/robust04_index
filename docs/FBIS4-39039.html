			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow June 3 TASS -- A spokesman for the Russian  Foreign ministry protested today against anti-Russian statements  of the Turkish military chief.    Turkish media recently cited Gueres as saying that Russia is  an even bigger threat to Turkey now than it was during the cold  war. The general accused Moscow of expansionist desires in  relation to the Caucasus region, Ukraine, and even the Balkan  states.    Such statements "fundamentally contradict the agreement  reached between the Russian and Turkish higher leadership that  their relations have entered a new level of friendly  partnership", the spokesman said on Friday.    He mentioned the many announcements made by Turkish  President  Suleyman Demirel, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, and other Turkish  leaders, which expressed satisfaction that Russian-Turkish  relations have entered a new era and are now based on mutual  interests and the spirit of cooperation.    "The Russian side would like to hope that the statements  made  by Gueres do not reflect the point of view of Turkey's political  leadership, and Russia bases its policy on the assumption that  Ankara is just as interested as Moscow is in the further  development of Russian-Turkish relations and multilateral  cooperation", the Foreign Ministry spokesman declared.</p>

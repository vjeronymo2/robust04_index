			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Tilbury to shut down property division SHARES in Tilbury Douglas jumped 20p to 505p as the UK construction firm unveiled steady pre-tax profits of Pounds 15m for 1992 and announced that it intended to close down its loss-making property div- ision. Mr Michael Bottjer, chief executive, said Tilbury Douglas, formed after Tilbury's Pounds 85m takeover of Midlands-based Robert M Douglas in 1991, would be out of the depressed English property market in five years. The properties were valued at Pounds 50m, he said, and about Pounds 30m-Pounds 35m was expected to be raised by about 1995. Tilbury Douglas intended to retain its small but profitable Scottish housebuilding operation. There was an Pounds 11.3m extra-ordinary charge to cover the costs of the withdrawal. During the year, the company increased sales by 59 per cent to Pounds 381.6m. This was largely due to the full year inclusion of the Douglas businesses, Mr Bottjer said. Construction was the strongest performer, with record profits on the back of strong orders from the water, transport and petrochemical industries. Profits rose 22 per cent to Pounds 13.5m, on sales 68 per cent up at Pounds 321.5m. Mr Bottjer said the group intended to focus on niche construction businesses such as heavy electrical contracting. Net margins for the group as a whole were down from 6.3 per cent to 3.9 per cent, because of pressures in the construction sector and property losses. The property division had incurred a Pounds 333,000 deficit against a profit of Pounds 3m last time. Mr Bottjer defended the group's decision to pay an uncovered dividend of 33p, including a proposed final of 22.5p, the same as last year, as a sign of the group's strength in a generally depressed sector. He said that the group had strong net cash balance of Pounds 6.9m, down from Pounds 19m after dividend and tax payments, and cash generative businesses. Earnings per share, depressed by the enlarged share capital after the Douglas takeover, fell from 46.9p to 31.1p.</p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Markets The past week in the London market has confirmed the feeling of solidity about the post-election rally. It is not just that the FT-SE ended the week almost exactly where it started, after a run of heavy trading sessions. There is a growing sense that the economic recovery, however feeble, is definitely established. The switch from defensive stocks to cyclicals continues accordingly. A year ago, the p/e on the consumer goods sector was 3 1/2 points higher than on capital goods. In the run up to the election the graph crossed, for the first time since 1985. The gap has since widened, so that the capital goods p/e is now higher by a full point. Granted, this is as much a matter of shrinking earnings as of rising share prices. But from the viewpoint of investor psychology, the effect remains the same. The spirit of optimism is the more striking in that investors have plainly accepted that UK interest rates are not about to be cut after all. Indeed, it has become all too clear that it is in the government's interest to keep a tight hold on monetary policy on political grounds. The last thing that is wanted now is a boom that may turn to another slump in five years' time. As the jargon has it, the economic and electoral cycles have to be brought back into line. And with inflationary pressure still detectable in the domestic economy - to say nothing of Germany - the government is quite able to defend its conduct on the grounds of sound money. An anaemic recovery, in short, is not only likely; it may be a matter of policy as well.</p>

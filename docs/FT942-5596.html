			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Chance of an all-embracing bid - Why RJB Mining is optimistic about its prospects / British Coal, The Bidders If British Coal is to stay in one piece after privatisation - and many mining executives believe that would be the surest means of preserving a large industry - then its best hope may lie in Mr Richard Budge and his RJB Mining company. With Hanson apparently not interested and RTZ unlikely to make a bid, RJB is one of the few UK companies that combines the desire and belief in its capability to operate all five British Coal regions. Whether it has the financial and political clout to mount five successful tenders is open to question. But the fact that it can contemplate an all-embracing bid is testimony to the significant progress it has made in the two years since Mr Budge split off the mining operations from AF Budge, the contracting group set up by his older brother Tony. By the time AF Budge went into receivership in late 1992, its former mining arm, rechristened RJB, was thriving as a separate company and on its way to the Stock Exchange. Investors have warmed to RJB. In spite of a slow start, the company's shares have outperformed the market by nearly 30 per cent since its flotation last June. Mr Budge is a big factor in the rating. Although his initials provide the company with its name, Mr Budge says he dislikes the cult of the personality, and tells investors and journalists that his company's success is based on its 1,400 employees and its executives. 'I may be chief executive but I am just one of a team.' Colleagues say he is a good delegator but not all outsiders are convinced. 'RJB is not a one man band - it has some reasonable executives,' says one British Coal executive. 'But I get the impression that when Budge says jump then everyone jumps. He can sometimes seem rather high-handed.' It is just as well for RJB, then, that Mr Budge is highly regarded. A tall and athletic-looking man of 47, Mr Budge has achieved success in several walks of life. In his teens he made money from painting landscapes; in his 30s and early 40s he became one of the country's most successful amateur racing drivers. But he has put most of his efforts into mining. After joining his brother's company as a 19-year-old, he was the driving force behind it becoming one of the biggest opencast coal producers in the country by the late 1970s. The company won a reputation for innovation. It was, for example, the first to bring in the 170 tonne Caterpillar dumper trucks. 'Everyone else said the British industry was too small for them,' says one British Coal executive. 'Budge led the technical scaling up in the industry.' This helps to explain why RJB's reputation remained relatively untarnished when its former parent went into receivership. Mr Budge's initial difficulties in persuading the City of the value of his company may have been more to do with the grand plans he had for expansion. The market was weary of an industry which had been incurring losses for years; companies associated with mining had long ago fallen out of fashion. Yet RJB was seeking money to develop under licence up to 11 mines that British Coal had closed because it could find no markets for them. It has ended up with three, Calverton and Clipstone in Nottinghamshire, and Rossington in Yorkshire. 'They are not gold mines but they will make very reasonable rates of return,' says Mr Budge. RJB can succeed where British Coal failed, he says, because it is more responsive to household and industrial markets and because it will get far more productivity out of a smaller workforce at each mine. 'We give our miners more responsibility and accountability than British Coal and they have responded well.' Mr Budge says early production from the mines has been better than expected. But none of the three have been operating under RJB for more than six months; other mining companies say a much longer test is needed before any realistic assessment can be made. Most believe the core British Coal assets which the government is selling in five regional packages are a better bet because they have guaranteed contracts with the electricity generators until 1998. The problem for potential bidders, RJB included, is that they will require a heavy initial outlay. Estimates as to the combined value of the successful bids vary enormously but it is likely to run into several hundred millions of pounds. In addition, working capital requirements could easily reach Pounds 300m. These are large sums for a company that last year made pre-tax profits of Pounds 12.2m on sales of Pounds 74.8m and is already thought to have gearing of about 50 per cent. Politics provides an even larger hurdle to RJB taking over all of British Coal's assets. Ministers have not ruled out selling all five regions to one bidder but their desire to inject competition into privatised markets makes it likely that they will want to split British Coal up if possible. Nonetheless, Mr Budge and RJB have shown that they are among the most optimistic about the industry's prospects and have yet to make a serious mistake in their mining operations. It would be surprising if they do not end up with at least one of the regions. Previous articles in this series appeared on May 30, June 1 and June 2. Further articles will appear next week.</p>

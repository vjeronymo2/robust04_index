			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 9 KYODO -- The main opposition Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] will defer a decision for some time on  whether to field its own candidate for prime minister in a  parliamentary election, LDP officials said Saturday [9 April].    The LDP, which ruled for an uninterrupted 38 years until  last  August, reached the accord at a meeting of top party officials.  Yohei Kono, president, and Yoshiro Mori, secretary general,  attended the session.    Instead of naming its candidate immediately, however, the  LDP  will continue to monitor moves by the ruling coalition, the  officials said.    The seven parties in the ruling coalition are now scrambling  to pick a successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who,  dogged by persistent allegations over his personal finances,  abruptly announced his resignation Friday.    The senior LDP executives also decided to respond to a  coalition proposal to open debate on the fiscal 1994 state  budget at the House of Representatives at an early date, the  officials said.    Meanwhile, the LDP's Diet Affairs Committee chairman said  the  party will continue efforts to shed light on suspicions over  Hosokawa's finances.    The inquiry resolves around allegations that Hosokawa failed  to repay a 100 million yen loan from Sagawa Kyubin, a  scandal-tainted trucking business group, as well as a new  suspicion that Hosokawa unwittingly entrusted an old friend with  managing his money in a way that might have involved some  illegalities.    During the Friday news conference at which he announced his  resignation, Hosokawa described the Sagawa money as a loan he  had repaid and also raised the topic of the "new suspicions"  without disclosing any additional details.    Sadatoshi Ozato, LDP Diet Affairs Committee chairman, told  reporters, "We need to clarify and explain (Hosokawa's)  scandals, including the new problem which Hosokawa himself  raised."    "However, the investigations into these scandals must take a  rational form that would not obstruct Diet deliberations on the  budget," he said.    In a related development, LDP legislator Koichi Kato, who  served as chief cabinet secretary in the cabinet of Prime  Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of the LDP, proposed throwing the LDP's  weight behind a candidate to be recommended from among the ranks  of other parties.    "The Liberal Democratic Party should first decide not to  field its candidate for premiership and then consider what moves  it could take," Kato said during a nationally-televised news  program on the Tokyo Broadcasting System.</p>

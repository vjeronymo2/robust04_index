			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MCNALL WORRIED AS KINGS FALL AGAIN;  </P> <P> HARTFORD WINS, 5-4; GRETZKY NOW NO. 2 ON NHL POINT LIST  </P> <P> After watching the Kings lose their third straight game Saturday night, owner  Bruce McNall was looking for help wherever he could get it.  </P> <P> "We need another tough winger. Can you be ready?" McNall asked Gordie Howe  after the Kings came from 2 goals ahead to lose, 5-4, to the Hartford Whalers.  </P> <P> "It might take a couple of hours," said Howe, a Hall of Famer who is two months  shy of his 61st birthday.  </P> <P> It may take longer than that to straighten out the Kings, who loaded all their  big guns on one line but still fired a blank in the end, even though Luc  Robitaille (2 goals), Wayne Gretzky (1 goal, 3 assists) and Bernie Nicholls (1  goal, 2 assists) accounted for all of their scoring.  </P> <P> The loss put a damper on a milestone night for Gretzky, who moved into second  place on the all-time National Hockey League point list, one point ahead of  former King Marcel Dionne, now with the New York Rangers. Gretzky, who has  1,771 points, trails only Howe, with 1,850.  </P> <P> Is McNall -- who has accompanied the team on the entire trip and was joined  Saturday by General Manager Rogie Vachon -- concerned about his team?  </P> <P> "Absolutely, I am," said McNall, who reiterated his desire to make another deal  before the March trading deadline.  </P> <P> A strong, grinding forward would be ideal. And if the asking price were more  reasonable, McNall said he would be interested in Bob Probert, the tough  Detroit wing, who is a handful on the ice but even more so when he's off it, as  indicated by a string of alcohol-related offenses.  </P> <P> "I would take the risk if the price came down," McNall said, "but they (the Red  Wings) aren't even in the ballpark yet."  </P> <P> And, McNall said, neither are the Kings at the desperation stage, even if they  have won just 3 games in their last 11 and are in danger of losing 4 in a row  for the first time this season.  </P> <P> "We played a lot better tonight than (in) the other two games," he said. "I'm  not panicked about it. We've had a lot of injuries. It's a typical midseason  slump."  </P> <P> Two more injuries occurred Saturday. Wing Igor Liba bruised a shoulder on his  first shift, and during a first-period fight with Hartford hit man Torrie  Robertson, King swing man Marty McSorley aggravated the shoulder injury he  suffered in the New Year's Eve exhibition against the Soviets.  </P> <P> McSorley wasn't hurt by Robertson, but by the linesman, who refused to let go  of his right arm. McSorley didn't play the rest of the night. "I'll be all  right," he said. "But I don't understand the referee's logic. It was two  against one, and he made it three against one."  </P> <P> Talk of a slump might easily have been silenced except for a dreadful giveaway  by King defenseman Tim Watters that led to the game-tying goal by rookie Jody  Hull of the Whalers at 11:24 of the third period.  </P> <P> Watters, who sat out the last game with a strained neck, collared a loose puck  and headed unhindered toward the back of the King net. The puck, however, took  a detour, hitting off the side of the net and right out front to Hull (no  relation to Bobby). Hull merely had to tip it past a stunned goalie Glenn Healy  to make it 4-4.  </P> <P> "I lost it in the snow," said Watters, sounding a little like a baseball  infielder saying he lost a grounder in the sun. It was a bad spot to lose it, a  major league giveaway. Obviously, it changed the momentum of the game."  </P> <P> How badly did Watters butcher the play? "I don't know how he (Hull) got the  puck so fast after I chopped it up into so many pieces," he said.  </P> <P> The Whalers finished carving up the Kings a bit later, after referee Dan  Marouelli whistled Gretzky for a hooking infraction of a highly dubious nature  with 4:48 left to play.  </P> <P> Hartford, which already had scored twice on the power play, clicked for the  game-winning goal seconds after Gretzky had finished serving his penalty.  </P> <P> Defenseman Dave Babych kept the puck in the zone at the left point and flicked  it to wing Kevin Dineen -- who had scored his 28th goal to make it 4-3 in the  second period -- at the top of the left circle.  </P> <P> Dineen took advantage of a traffic jam in the slot to walk in on Healy, who got  a piece of Dineen's shot but couldn't keep Babych -- who had circled to his  other side -- from tipping the puck into the net.  </P> <P> That goal spoiled a splendid effort by the Gretzky line, notably Nicholls, who  now has 101 points -- surpassing his previous career high of 100 -- and 47  goals in 48 games, leaving him 3 goals short of becoming the sixth player in  NHL history to score at least 50 goals in 50 games.  </P> <P> Would Nicholls like the line to stay together? "Oh, sure," he said, "the  opportunity to play with Wayne is a great thrill. I think (Coach Robbie Ftorek)  wants us to play together. He tried us some against the Islanders (Thursday),  but nobody went on the other side of the blue line to help the defense. We  can't do that. But if we take care of our own end, I think we can be a good  line."  </P> <P> Nicholls made exceptional plays on three of the Kings' goals. He got up after  being knocked down by a defenseman to take a pass from Gretzky and beat rookie  goalie Peter Sidorkiewicz with a slapper from the right circle. The goal, at  the 3-minute mark of the second period, tied the score at 2-2.  </P> <P> Then, in perhaps the most spectacular play of the night, he picked the puck  cleanly off the stick of Dineen and fed it to Gretzky, whose skimmer from the  left circle beat Sidorkiewicz at 14:01.  </P> <P> Fifty-six seconds later, Nicholls fought off Sylvain Cote's check to advance  the puck behind the net to Gretzky, who threaded a pass to Robitaille that  resulted in the left wing's 32nd goal and a 4-2 lead.  </P> <P> But the Whalers came back, which means there's no guarantee that line will  remain intact.  </P> <P> "We didn't get the W," Ftorek said.  </P> <P> And Howe.  </P> <P> NHL CAREER SCORING LEADERS  </P> <P> The top 10 career scoring leaders in the National Hockey League since 1927.

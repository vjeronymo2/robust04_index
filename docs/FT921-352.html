			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / People: API wraps up new team API, the packaging group beset last year by management changes and a hostile bid, has found a new chief executive in Mike Smith who joins from Irish packaging multinational Jefferson Smurfit. 'This is a great recovery opportunity' says chairman Moger Woolley, who took up his assignment at the beginning of last month. Eric Holroyd, a former director of Bowater Packaging and a friend of Woolley's since the latter was chief executive of DRG, has been acting chief executive since last year. Smith, 45, is chief executive of the print, packaging and converting division of Jefferson Smurfit. While that is a bigger business than API, Smith is English and may have felt the top job at API offers greater scope than staying with Smurfit. 'While the products are different, some of the end customers are the same. Smith knows his way around the marketplace ' says Woolley. API last year fought off a bid by NMC which surfaced when the previous senior management resigned last March.</p>

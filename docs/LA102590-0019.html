			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILSON, FEINSTEIN ON TERM LIMITS  </P> <P> Feinstein is perplexing. She's running against Wilson, a man of strong  19th-Century views, who, for example, has voted again and again to finance the  murderous regime in El Salvador.  </P> <P> Yet, Feinstein chides him for absenting himself from votes in Washington -- a  cause, rather, for rejoicing. Dianne, get with it.  </P> <P> ANTHONY SAIDY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Look east - but don't touch: Victor Mallet says Vietnam is still out of bounds for US companies as their competitors clean up For a country concerned about perennial trade deficits with Asian countries, the US has been assiduous in depriving itself of commercial access to one of the region's fastest-growing economies. President Bill Clinton's decision on Monday to maintain the US economic embargo against Vietnam has again frustrated the hopes of American companies as they try to exploit Vietnamese business opportunities not yet grasped by Asian and European rivals. The timing of the announcement - 6pm on the day that Israel and the PLO signed their historic peace agreement in Washington  -showed clearly how reluctant Mr Clinton remains to seize the Vietnamese nettle. The continuation of an embargo dating from the end of the Vietnam war in 1975 is particularly galling for the dozens of US executives poised to start work in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon), because Vietnam had kept aside some projects - in the oil industry, for example - in the expectation that sanctions would be lifted. 'I can look at her but I can't kiss her,' said Mr Kent Accord, a Mobil vice-president, on a visit to Hanoi. He was referring to the Blue Dragon, an offshore Vietnamese oil concession that Mobil is bidding to assess and exploit. Vietnam's eagerness to welcome Americans stems partly from the communist government's desire to counter the expanding regional political power of China and the commercial influence of Japan. It is also a side-effect of the Vietnam war, during which the South Vietnamese who lived and sometimes fought alongside US soldiers became accustomed to American cigarettes, soap and trucks. Everything from Coca-Cola and tinned ravioli to Hollywood videos and pirated computer software is imported or smuggled into Vietnam from its neighbours. Many of the trucks from the war era are still running. American goods still have cachet in a country described by US businessmen in Hanoi as 'by far the most attractive new market in the world' or, alternatively, 'one of the most dynamic and promising markets in Asia'. Last year Vietnam's economy grew by more than 8 per cent in real terms, and is forecast to grow by as much again this year as the country tries to emulate the export-led achievements and industrialisation of its Asian neighbours. Since 1986, the government has undertaken a programme of reform known as doi moi (renovation), aimed at changing a communist command system into a market-driven economy. The government says it needs foreign investment of Dollars 20bn to modernise its economy by the end of the century, of which it expects about Dollars 12bn from foreign direct investment and a further Dollars 8bn from foreign government and institutional aid. Foreign companies have already been granted licences for more than Dollars 6bn-worth of projects. Singaporean enterprises are building hotels and changing the skylines of the capital Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's commercial centre. The Taiwanese are constructing industrial estates where exporters can locate factories. Japan is investing in food processing and manufacturing. The French and the Australians are building telecommunications networks. The Americans, however, are languishing on the sidelines. A few companies, including Coca-Cola, signed contracts in the hope that Mr Clinton would lift the embargo, but at the moment they are prohibited from fulfilling them. Some US executives ascribe the continuing ban to the political clout wielded in Washington by pressure groups representing the families of US servicemen missing in action during the Vietnam war. The lobbyists believe Vietnam is hiding information about 100 or so unresolved cases, although the Pentagon says progress is being made on this issue. American executives find little comfort in Mr Clinton's decision to allow US companies to compete for contracts funded by international agencies such as the World Bank. 'Most US business would still be effectively closed out of the Vietnam market,' said a position paper prepared by US companies and handed to visiting congressmen recently. 'In most cases, the areas where US business has a comparative advantage are high technology and are generally not infrastructure projects of the sort funded by international institutions.' Oil exploration and banking are two sectors where US companies feel vulnerable to delay, because only a limited number of openings is on offer to foreigners in each industry. Mobil and Amoco have already watched one important oilfield contract go to BHP Petroleum of Australia, which is leading a consortium to exploit the Big Bear field off the south coast. A decision on the Blue Dragon concession nearby is expected to be made by early next year. 'They are getting closed out of lease after lease,' said one US businessman. In computers, IBM is itching to service foreign companies in Vietnam - many of them already IBM customers elsewhere - and to develop the local market. Mr William Howell, IBM's chief representative in Vietnam, said international banks were waiting for IBM to be allowed to install its equipment in their Vietnam branches, but 'it's only a matter of time before they are forced to buy from other suppliers', he said. In telecommunications, France's Alcatel and others are establishing mobile telephone and paging systems while Motorola executives twiddle their thumbs. 'Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi need these systems,' said Mr Greig Craft of American Service Co, a consultancy which represents US companies. 'They can't wait.' The same is true for owners of the ageing, black Russian Volga cars used in Vietnam, who are now replacing them with Toyotas and Hondas. Chrysler has been fighting a rearguard action to try to ensure access for US carmakers, especially for four-wheel-drive vehicles. To its dismay, the job of preparing a master plan for the development of the entire Vietnamese auto industry has gone to Mitsubishi of Japan. The tragedy for the US, according to Vietnamese businessmen and officials and the growing US business community, is that the Americans are shutting themselves out of the last significant market in south-east Asia. 'The Vietnamese have demonstrated this willingness to leave the door open to US participation in key sectors,' said Mr Craft, 'and were encouraged when they saw that contracts could be signed (following an earlier easing of the embargo). They have done this at the expense of equally qualified Asian, Australian and other companies. And now they can't wait any longer.' Since the US lifted its objections to multilateral funding for Vietnam in July - which the country needs to repair ports and roads to support its economic recovery - the US business community rather than the Vietnamese government has made the loudest pleas for ending the embargo. Some western diplomats and businessmen believe sanctions may be eased further by the end of the year, when Mr Clinton may have cleared his desk of more pressing legislative issues such as healthcare reform and the North American Free Trade Agreement. By then, they fear US corporations may have lost the advantages they once had. For almost two decades the Vietnamese have accused the Americans of using the embargo to punish them economically for having won the war; these days, as Vietnam's economy grows without them, many Americans are asking why they are punishing themselves for having lost it.</p>

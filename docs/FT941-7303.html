			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / People: Mann's long stint at Logica comes to an end David Mann, deputy chairman of Logica, the UK computing services company, is leaving the group he has served for 25 years. His departure will sever one of the few remaining unbroken links with the earliest days of the UK software industry. Mann joined Logica in 1969 a few weeks after its formation by Len Taylor and Philip Hughes and was a member of the small group, including the late Pat Coen and Steve Feldman, which gave the company its distinctive character. Managing director and chief executive from 1987 to 1993, he steered Logica through some of its best times and some of the worst. He remembers with a shudder the trauma of 1991 when financial services customers simply stopped spending money. 'There is never a good time to leave a company you have been associated with for so long,' he said yesterday, going on to point out that his decision was made simpler by the ease with which new chief executive Martin Read has slid into the role. Not yet 50, Mann says he has no fixed plans and an open mind about the future: 'I would be interested in non-executive directorships; there was never time for that before.' He is also keen to spend more time on information technology-related activities including the British Computer Society. He will miss Logica colleagues and customers, he says, but not the daily trek into London from his tree-bound retreat in Theydon Bois.</p>

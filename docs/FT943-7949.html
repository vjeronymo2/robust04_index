			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Buba keeps rates steady The Bundesbank council's decision yesterday to keep rates on hold unnerved interest rate markets and put renewed pressure on the dollar, writes Philip Gawith. At its first meeting after the summer recess, the central bank left the discount rate at 4.5 per cent and the Lombard rate at 6 per cent. It also fixed the repo rate for a further two weeks at 4.85 per cent. Markets were disappointed, since the earlier news that German M3 had grown at an annualised rate of 9.9 per cent in July, below expectations, had boosted hopes of a rate cut. The US currency later came under further pressure when Commerce Department figures showed that the June trade gap with Japan had widened by 25.8 per cent to Dollars 5.52bn, reminding the market that the trade dispute with Japan remains a potent, unresolved issue. For the first time in a number of weeks, the dollar closed in London below Y100, finishing at Y99.025 from Y100.26. Against the D-Mark it ended at DM1.5456 from DM1.5603. In New York it finished lower at Y98.595 and DM1.5436. The D-Mark was again the beneficiary of generalised strength, closing higher against most European currencies. The lira slipped back to L1,025 from L1,018 and the French franc closed at FFr3.436 from FFr3.430. Sterling was also a victim of D-Mark strength, finishing at DM2.3889 from DM2.4009. It was firmer against the dollar, closing at Dollars 1.5457 from Dollars 1.5388. The dollar fell prey to a combination of concerns about inflation and the trade dispute with Japan. Whatever the cause, there was little doubt at the end of the day that the 50 basis-point rise in US rates earlier this week has had little, if any, lasting impact. The dollar's problems started with the Bundesbank's decision to keep rates on hold, which simply added momentum to recent D-Mark strength. Matters were aggravated in the afternoon by the release of June trade figures, and the Philadelphia Fed index. The jump in the trade deficit with Japan, coupled with US commerce secretary Mr Ron Brown's comments that it remained unacceptable, reminded the market that this problem area remains an ongoing source of conflict, and prompted further dollar sales. To aggravate matters further, the prices component of the Philadelphia Fed index rose sharply. This unnerved US bonds, and the dollar weakened in sympathy. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London, said: 'The currency market clearly feels that the Fed is still a bit behind the game in terms of controlling inflation pressures.' He said the market appeared unhappy with the current wisdom that the Fed will not act again before November, when the mid-term congressional elections are out of the way. With US asset prices under pressure, Mr Hannah said it was also a fine decision whether higher interest rates outweighed the problem of potential capital losses. Although the trade weighted sterling index finished only slightly lower at 78.7, from 78.8, analysts said the pound's fall below DM2.40 was beginning to unnerve the market. 'More and more people are worrying that the pound is drifting in rather an ominous way against the D-Mark,' said Mr Hannah. Recent good news, he added, in the form of firm growth and low inflation, had ironically been bad news. 'There have been too many excuses for politicians to avoid doing the evil deed of raising interest rates.' Mr Peter Luxton, economist at Barclays in London, echoed the point, commenting: 'The market almost wants bad news to see whether the Bank (of England) will raise rates.' Sterling appears to have been caught in the backwash from last week's rise in Swedish and Italian rates. Until recently the general assumption was that the UK would be the first European country to raise rates. Now that it has been beaten to it, the fear has again arisen of doing too little, too late in combatting inflation. 'The UK is running the risk of getting a little too far behind the game,' said Mr Hannah. 'The longer you delay, the more likely the market is to conclude: if you are not prepared to give way on interest rates, we will give way on the currency.' He noted that the Fed had lifted interest rates five times this year, in spite of good headline inflation figures. Australia also raised rates this week, by 75 basis points, against the background of better than expected inflation numbers. The Bundesbank's decision unnerved interest rate markets, reflected in the poor performance of short sterling and Euromark futures. The December short sterling contract fell five basis points to 93.31, while the equivalent Euromark contract closed at 94.83 from 94.86. Traders said that the short sterling market remained very nervous, with any good news almost immediately discounted. The Bank of England provided Pounds 624m assistance, at established rates, to UK money markets after forecasting a Pounds 600m shortage.</p>

They discussed matters pertaining to trade and economic  cooperation between the two countries, in particular the  Iran-Armenia gas pipeline, construction of the Megri bridge,  organization of border trade, road and air transportation,  coordination of customs activities, and investments.    The sides expressed satisfaction at the constructive  measures  taken by the governments of the two countries in these fields,  and noted that there are real opportunities to substantially  expand the economic ties between Armenia and Iran in 1994.    Mutual understanding was displayed on the Karabakh problem.  They considered unacceptable the use of force which, by further  deepening the conflict, is preventing the establishment of peace  in the region.    The prime minister highly assessed Iran's efforts for the  peaceful solution of the problem.    Armen Khachaturyan, coordinator of Armenian Government  affairs, and other officials were present at the meeting.</p>

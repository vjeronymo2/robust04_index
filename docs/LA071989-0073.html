			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH'S VISIT TO POLAND  </P> <P> The speech by President Bush before the newly elected Polish Parliament was  both encouraging and practical (Part I, July 11). It set the tone for our  potential involvement in the development of other Eastern Bloc nations seeking  an independent direction from that of the Soviets. As the President noted,  these are indeed exciting times, but not without peril.  </P> <P> Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev seem to be accommodating the need for  new strategies in the face of economic pressures. The road to general  disarmament is slowly being paved. It might be interesting for both NATO and  the Warsaw Pact members to consider evolving from instruments of military  balance to ones of economic stability.  </P> <P> As the arduous process of diminishing both conventional and nuclear forces  continues, it seems that the NATO countries and the Warsaw Pact might utilize  their manpower, their machinery, and their vast facilities to support the  concepts of Gorbachev's initiatives and our own aspirations for a peaceful and  prosperous Europe. The process of Marxist determinism emerging into systems  based on free enterprise will be tough enough on all of us. What is to say that  once Hungary and Yugoslavia are independent entities that they will not  rekindle historic rivalries and start their own little war?  </P> <P> For all their abrasive effect, NATO and the Warsaw Pact gave two large areas of  the world a certain, if not altogether desirable, stability. Disarm? Certainly.  Pull out? Maybe not altogether. Let us redeploy our huge military investment  into a force for economic growth while building bridges of trust and preventing  ancient intolerance from impairing our efforts.  </P> <P> IVAN LADIZINSKY  </P> <P> Marina del Rey  </P></p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / UK Company News: British Vita expands in eastern Europe BRITISH VITA, the polymer, fibre and foam company, is to expand further into eastern Europe through construction of a new foam products factory in Poland. The Manchester-based company said yesterday it had bought land 20kms from Wroclaw, near the Czechoslovakian border, and will initially invest Pounds 4m to build a factory to serve the local furniture and bedding markets. The move follows modest expansion in the last two years into east Germany, where the group has cutting and conversion plants. It has been supplying the local Polish market with exports from Germany and the Netherlands. Mr Rod Sellers, chief executive, said Vita Polymers Poland would make its own foam as well as importing it in block form. At a later stage, the company might also export to neighbouring countries and sell its other products like fibres into the local market. 'This will be a bridgehead,' said Mr Sellers. 'It will be a trading organisation capable of importing.' Further down the road, Mr Sellers said Vita Polymers Poland might expand to serve the German vehicle market. 'There is a trend for German auto makers to put more labour intensive operations into Poland,' he said. The local Polish market is likely to demand products towards the lower end of British Vita's range, but margins are likely to be satisfactory once local labour is used and there is no longer a need for high transport and import costs. Much of the raw material can be supplied from the local Polish chemicals industry. The expansion into Poland further extends British Vita's dependence on the continental European market. With the German economy turning down and tightness in a number of other countries, British Vita's stock market rating has suffered recently from this exposure. Mr Sellers said yesterday that while the German market was turning down, domestic consumer demand was holding up relatively well.</p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Portrait sold for pounds 1.7m at Christie's A portrait by El Greco, the only one by him of a woman that is likely to appear on the market, sold for Pounds 1.7m at Christie's yesterday, Antony Thorncroft writes. The price was double the estimate and a record for the artist. The portrait was painted in the 1580s and the sitter is believed to have been his daughter-in-law. It sold at Christie's in 1851, with another picture, for three guineas, and was sold at an Old Master auction yesterday by the estate of the late Mary, Viscountess Rothermere.</p>

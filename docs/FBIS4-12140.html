			<p>BFN     [Text] Khartoum, 4 Apr (MENA)--The Sudanese authorities  today suspended AL-SUDANI AL-DUWALI newspaper. The decision was  taken under the emergency laws.    A statement by the Sudanese Presidency, carried by Omdurman  radio today, said that the paper cast doubt on the struggle of  the Sudanese Armed Forces and called for separation and  abandoning the unity of the country and disintegrating national  unity. It also dealt lightly with the prestige of the  revolution and its symbols without any justification.</p>

			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / International Company News: Tonen chief resigns over clash with US partners A clash of US and Japanese management approaches has led to the resignation of the head of Tonen, a Japanese oil refiner partly owned by Exxon and Mobil. Mr Nobuyuki Nakahara, Tonen president, is to resign at the end of March, Tonen announced yesterday. It is understood that his departure is due to differences over recent large dividend increases requested by the US partners. Exxon and Mobil, which each hold 25 per cent of Tonen's shares, are alleged to have taken joint positions to obtain board agreement on dividends and other important matters, such as capital spending. The remainder of the equity is split among a group of Japanese institutions, speaking for an estimated 40 per cent of the equity, and private investors. Tonen and its US partners have denied there is a dispute. Mr Nakahara was leaving because 'he wanted to become free to pursue personal interests,' said Tonen. This is an unusual reason for a Japanese management resignation. Mr Nakahara will stay on as honorary chairman, a symbolic position, and be replaced as president by Mr Tamehiko Tamahori, who currently heads a Tonen subsidiary and has the backing of the US shareholders. The contrast between US and Japanese approaches first became apparent when Tonen nearly doubled the 1992 payout to Y50 per share, easily exceeding earnings of Y28.7 per share. That attracted attention in Tokyo, because the payout of 174 per cent of 1992 earnings, represented just over 4 1/2 times Japanese companies' average dividend of about 38 per cent of earnings that year. Tonen's Japanese management at the time said Mobil and Exxon had requested the increase and said they would have preferred to bolster capital investment reserves. However, the dividend increase was agreed unanimously by the board, said Mr Haruo Gotoh, manager of Esso Sekiyo, Exxon's Japanese unit. The 3 per cent yield on Tonen's shares is still low by US and UK standards, he said. The US partners successfully obtained an increase in the interim payout from Y12.5 per share to Y20, and have pushed for a maintained 1993 dividend. The dividend is likely to be uncovered by earnings again, despite a sharp rise in profits from Y32.77bn to a market estimate of Y38bn. However, Tonen's balance sheet is strong, with debts of just under 51 per cent of shareholders' capital.</p>

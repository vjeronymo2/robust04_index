			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / EC coal meeting likely next week MR MICHAEL Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is likely to visit Brussels next week to present draft plans to the European Commission for keeping open some of the UK's threatened coal mines. The trip will add to speculation, already growing in the coal and electricity industries, that the government will not now publish its white paper on coal before the end of the month. The government has previously said that it wanted to bring out the white paper as early as possible in February. Documents leaked last night demonstrated that the government is some way off securing a deal with generators to take on extra coal, the main plank in its draft white paper. Even if it can secure an agreement, it will then have to clear its proposals with Brussels. Although the rescue plans involving the generators should receive broad approval from Commission energy officials, Mr Karel van Miert, the EC competition commissioner, will insist that subsidies to UK pits should be scaled down after 1995. According to draft plans circulating in London, coal subsidies would be eliminated by 1998. If Britain decided to subsidise coal beyond 1995, Mr van Miert has said he will press for a reduction in the level of indirect aid granted to the British nuclear industry. That could present problems for the government, which wants to change present plans for the nuclear industry as little as possible. British and Commission officials in Brussels said yesterday that a firm date had not been fixed for Mr Heseltine's visit. Much will depend on the generator talks and whether he wants to consult the Commission before or after presenting his draft plan to the UK cabinet. Mr van Miert and Mr Abel Matutes, EC energy commissioner, are jointly responsible for approving the British plan. Mr Matutes is anxious to avoid penalising the EC's most efficient pits by hampering rescue efforts. The Commission competition authorities are also believed to have considered reviving anti-trust probes into medium-term contracts in the UK electricity industry as a means of putting pressure on the British government over subsidies. British officials dismissed such threats this week, saying that the liberal thrust of UK energy policy was in line with Commission thinking. 'Everything (the Commission) has said to us suggests there will be no problem (with the Heseltine plan),' said one. Commission energy officials argue that Brussels could not formally block a five-year state aid plan for the British coal industry, because UK pits would qualify for subsidies under current EC rules. The new coal subsidy regime - which is supposed to take effect from next year - has not yet been approved by member states. The government yesterday played down the prospect that it might decide to transfer a portion of the nuclear levy to coal as part of a pits rescue package, David Owen writes. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said such a step only 'makes sense' if it was assumed Nuclear Electric's liabilities were not 'genuine liabilities.' This, he said, had not yet been established. A High Court judge is expected to rule today on union claims that British Coal is failing to comply with a previous ruling on consultation over 10 pits earmarked for early closure.</p>

The Korea Securities Dealers Association decided at a  meeting  Thursday morning to lift the ban imposed on selling short in May  1990, when the market was depressed.    To sell short is to sell shares borrowed from a broker and  then repurchase them for return at a fixed future date.    This is an expansion of margin transactions, where investors  buy stock on credit.    Selling short will be limited to shares of companies listed  in the first section of the exchange, and a broker may lend no  more than 20 million won of shares per investor provided that  its total on loan is no more than 50 percent of its equity  capital and that the total lending by all brokerage houses is no  more than 10 percent of the total listed shares.    The securities industry has long considered reviving short  selling in preparation for opening a stock futures market, an  event that no longer lies in the distant future.    Institutional investors such as banks, and securities,  short-term finance and investment trust firms, must now deposit  at least 20 percent of the purchase price with a broker before  bidding to buy stock.    Since real-name financial transactions were introduced last  August, institutional investors have carried a greater weight in  the stock market, and some are suspected of manipulating stock  prices by abusing their no-deposit privileges.    Individual investors must deposit 40 percent of the purchase  price.</p>

The hospital has an internal treatment department, a  surgical  department, a pediatric department and other specialized  departments equipped with modern medical facilities, a  laboratory, a dispensary and sick wards.    Doctors take charge of all people under the section doctor  system. Doctors frequently call at farmers' houses to prevent a  disease and take measure for patients.    As soon as children were born they are under the care of  doctors and undergo regular medical examination, preventive  inoculations and other systematic medical care.    The hospital has created thousands of acres of herb fields,  produced different tonics to supply them to people.    Before the liberation of the country, Migam-ri was a place  far behind from modern civilization. In those days there was no  doctor. Endemic disease and other contagious diseases took a  heavy toll of lives. But this has become the past thing forever.    Today Migam-ri has turned into a paradise of longevity where  all the farmers are leading a happy and civilized life in good  health. This represents all the rural villages of prospering  Korea.    The policy of turning ri clinics into hospitals put forward  by the great leader President Kim Il-song at the fifth congress  of the Workers' Party of Korea (November 1970) was implemented  across the country during the six-year plan.    There are hospitals and medical networks with modern medical  equipment and apparatuses in all places, a solitary islet as  well as a mountainous village, where the people live and they  protect the health of the people.</p>

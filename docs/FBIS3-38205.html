The main beneficiaries will be the Russian Central Bank and  the new Interstate Bank, which is charged with establishing  clearing houses for bank transactions throughout the  Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).    The EC official said interbank transfers and payments were  painfully slow in CIS countries, hindering trade. Citing one  example, he said that a bank transfer from Vladivostok to Saint  Petersburg could take weeks.    The EC's executive European Commission plans to send a team  of high-level finance and banking specialists to Russia,  Ukraine, and Belarus to counsel banks there.</p>

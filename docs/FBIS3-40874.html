			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] As a result of a lack of business ethics, which are  the basis of doing business, big businesses have grabbed all of  the business opportunities which should have been available to  medium and small businesses. Business ethics can be upheld if  anticorruption legislation and the oath of office are really  upheld by firm and strict sanctions.    This is a summary of the opinions expressed by Michael V.  Haribowo, vice president of the Modern Group, and by Priasmoro  Prawiroardjo, deputy president director of Lippo Indonesia's BNP  [expansion not given], when they were contacted separately  yesterday in Jakarta, in response to Minister of Finance Mar'ie  Muhammad's statement that a stop must be put to the degradation  of business morals (KOMPAS, Wednesday 22 December).    At the same time, Prof. Dr. Sri-Edi Swasono, general  chairman  of the Indonesian Cooperative Board (DEKOPIN), believes that the  gap in control over the economy makes for a very shaky harmony  in Indonesia.    Michael thinks that although the business ethics of big  businesses are not noticeably fading away, in a real sense we  are feeling this. "We don't notice them caring about giving  smaller or even midsized companies room for business  opportunities," he said.    In fact, what we're seeing is greed and a constant struggle  for opportunities, and these attitudes are more in the forefront  than those of wanting to provide others with the same  opportunities. As a result, every area of business activity  which should provide the smaller members of the business world  with business opportunities is now closed off or obscure. Little  by little the businesses which have become big because they were  given the chance by the government have taken over all the  opportunities.    The warning suddenly expressed by the minister of finance,  said Michael, appears to be a signal about this situation. At  the very least his words reflect the government's wish to ask  the conglomerates to slow down and to give some of the  opportunities to medium and small businesses.  <H5>  Depends on the "Conductor" </H5>   However, said Michael, it is up to the "master conductor" to  change the rhythm of what was playing. Whether or not the  situation can be changed depends on the capabilities of the  maestro. "The problem is that we must realize that changing the  rhythm is not an easy task. But to do so requires perseverance  and a firm attitude".    On the other hand, he said, the conglomerates themselves  must  begin to realize themselves that the opportunities which they  have been given and which have made them grow can be used to  help others. At the very least they must move forward and open  up access to a wider market while the small-scale domestic  market can be given over to small and medium businesses.    However, the excuses given up to now--the need for  consolidation and the lack of antimonopoly legislation--have  just been self-serving.    "The only question now is whether all the parties concerned,  including the minister of finance, are capable of giving a  warning, without needing to damage all of the parties concerned,  but by appealing to the innermost self that all human beings  possess to help and to give all parties an opportunity," he said.  <H5>  Upholding the Oath of Office </H5>   Priasmoro believes that we can put a stop to the moral  degradation of the business community and office holders, which  is now raging through society, by implementing anticorruption  legislation and by upholding the oath of office. Upholding  morality can also be accelerated by the political will and firm  discipline of the parties holding the keys to government office.  If we don't start from that line, urging people to uphold  morality will only be laughed at by the business community.    He thinks that the minister of finance's statement about the  need to put a stop to the moral degradation of the business  community is well based. "That statement comes from someone who  certainly has a lot of experience with corruption, especially  since he once was the director general of taxation, which is  also a problem area for corruption," he said.    Priasmoro said that there must be a core of bureaucrats who  are prepared to begin to uphold those ethical principles. "The  minister of finance himself, who has dealt with a lot of  agencies which had corruption problems, can first put those  initiatives into effect within the Department of Finance. If  upholding ethical principles goes well over there, it will  automatically become an example for other agencies," he said.  <H5>  Economic Harmony Is Shaky </H5>   In a separate statement, Sri-Edi Swasono thinks that it is  everyone's duty to create a connection between big and small  business communities so as to narrow the present gap between  them and, at the same time, guarantee business harmony.    He revealed these thoughts yesterday in a conversation with  a  reporter in Ceper, Klaten. Edi Swasono is in Central Java to  attend the ceremony transferring the liquidity credit facilities  of the Bank of Indonesia (KLBI) to the 11 members of the Batur  Jaya Cooperative via the Universal Bank.    Abdul Rachman Ramly, chairman of the board of Astra  International, accompanied by Palgunadi T. Setiawan, chairman of  the Astra Yayasan Dharma Bhakti [Charity Foundation] (YDBA),  explained that Astra is committed to involving small and medium  businesses in its activities. "We have planned and been  committed to those steps since 1980," Ramly affirmed.    To implement that commitment, every year Astra sets aside 2  percent of its net profits to help small and medium businesses.  "Giving money to the partnership is not enough. We also help  with management, apprenticeships and education. All of Astra's  facilities are open for study to the businesses that enter  Astra's partnership program," Ramly said.    Palgunadi, who is also the managing director of Astra Mitra  Ventura, added that besides setting aside that 2 percent, which  is spent on helping small and medium businesses, Astra also sets  aside 2 percent of its net profits for venture capital. These  funds are provided for helping with the capitalization of those  small and medium businesses which are considered suitable, and  Astra's participation in this cooperation is limited to a  maximum of 10 years.    Up to the present time, Palgunadi said, Astra Mitra Ventura  has about 7.5 billion rupiahs in funds. Only about 1.4 billion  rupiahs of those funds have been used so far. "We hope that the  small and medium businesses getting that funding are not limited  to the nine companies getting it now. However, choosing the  proper companies for the program is not a simple matter,"  Palgunadi explained.    Edi Swasono thinks that the steps taken by Astra  International Inc to set aside some of its profits for fostering  cooperatives and small industries are positive steps. He does  not see many big businesses which have the kind of program that  Astra has for fostering other companies. Big businesses often  believe that it is enough to give small businesses and  cooperatives something material, such as stock.</p>

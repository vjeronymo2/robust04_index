			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Russia faced with radical budget: Austere approach aimed at reducing inflation to 1% a month Russia's most important economic ministries will today urge the cabinet to adopt a 'big bang' approach to fiscal reform, marking a sharp shift away from the previous gradual approach. The finance ministry and the ministry of the economy are proposing a draft budget aimed at bringing down the level of inflation to 1 per cent a month in the second half of next year. Cabinet discussions on the budget start today. The plan requires the government to cease taking credits from the central bank. It will meet strong opposition from some of the most powerful ministries - including defence, agriculture and energy. However, the finance and economy ministries have broadly agreed the approach, and expect to push it through the cabinet meeting by arguing that the country has no choice. Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister for the economy and one of the architects of the budget, said yesterday that to continue the present policy of gradual reform might mean stabilisation in two or three years - 'but it would mean periodic crises like the one we had last week when the rouble fell'. The budget debate comes at a time of heightened tensions between Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, and President Boris Yeltsin. On Tuesday there were rumours that Mr Chernomyrdin had resigned but he and the government denied this. Mr Shokhin said: 'There are forces around the government who try to profit from the absence of the prime minister.' Mr Chernomyrdin returned from his holiday last night and is scheduled to present the budget to a special session of the Russian parliament next Thursday. According to finance ministry figures, the draft budget forecasts an income of Rbs131trln and expenditure of Rbs208trln - that last figure slashed back from around Rbs260trln in earlier drafts. The budget deficit would be around 8.3 per cent of gross domestic product. Mr Shokhin made clear that the success of the new strategy would require strong support from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. He said he hoped for loans of some Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5bn) from the IMF in the form of a standby agreement and the addition of a third tranche to an economic reform loan of which Dollars 3bn has been drawn down. If the strategy proved successful, he hoped for a further Dollars 6bn loan to stabilise the rouble. Editorial Comment, Page 25</p>

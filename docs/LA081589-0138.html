			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH AGREES WITH DARMAN CALL FOR FED TO CUT INTEREST RATES  </P> <P> President Bush said today that he agrees with comments by Budget Director  Richard Darman suggesting that the Federal Reserve is jeopardizing economic  growth by holding interest ratestoo high.  </P> <P> "I thought his comments were very balanced. I can feel very comfortable with  his sallying forth and saying that," Bush said at a White House news  conference.  </P> <P> "I don't know of any President, now or in the past, who doesn't favor lower  interest rates," Bush said in answer to a question about the unusually critical  remarks by Darman.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Privately Critical  </P> <P> Administration officials have been privately critical of the Fed's interest  rate policies, but they have avoided publicly criticizing the independent  central bank.  </P> <P> On a conciliatory note Bush added, "You also have to be concerned about  inflationary pressures."  </P> <P> Darman said in a television interview Sunday that the Fed, which until recently  had been pushing up interest rates to slow growth and bring inflation under  control, would be to blame if the economy falters.  </P> <P> "I'm fearful that they may have been a little bit too concerned that things  have been going well and that they may have been a little bit too tight,"  Darman said.  </P> <P> "If we do have a recession, I think it will be because they erred on the side  of caution," Darman said.  </P> <P> Bush said he would take under advisement a reporter's question on Darman's  remarks about blaming the Fed, saying he did not recall that aspect of his  budget chief's remarks.  </P> <P> He promised to let reporters know the answer to that question "at a later  date."  </P> <P> The Federal Reserve pushed rates up by a sharp three percentage points for a  year beginning in March, 1988, to curb inflationary pressures in the economy,  but the central bank has since eased credit on signs that growth has slowed  down.  </P> <P> In June, persuaded that inflation was no longer a pressing danger, the Fed  reversed its credit tightening and eased the key federal funds rate, the  interest banks charge one another for overnight loans, by about three-quarters  of a point.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Caution Planned  </P> <P> Although the Fed is concerned about the risk of a possible recession, Chairman  Alan Greenspan has told Congress that the central bank intends to act  cautiously in lowering interest rates.  </P> <P> The Federal Reserve influences the economy by controlling the money supply and  interest rates. The central bank is independent from the Administration, and in  the past there have been clashes between the two groups over interest rate  policies.  </P> <P> Some economists say public criticism of the Fed could backfire for the  Administration because it might prompt the central bank to demonstrate its  autonomy by keeping rates slightly firmer than it would otherwise.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY ROUNDUP: DATAPRODUCTS SELF-TENDER ATTRACTS TOO MANY SHARES  </P> <P> Dataproducts Corp. said its self-tender offer of $10 a share for 4 million  shares, or 20%, of its stock was oversubscribed.  </P> <P> The Woodland Hills-based maker of computer printers said about 17.8 million  shares were tendered to the company.  </P> <P> As a result, Dataproducts will buy about 22% of the shares that were tendered  by each stockholder.  </P> <P> Dataproducts launched the offer as part of a major restructuring that included  the sale of its headquarters property. The $40 million in net proceeds from  that sale are being used to pay for the self-tender offer. After the stock is  purchased, Dataproducts will have 15.8 million total common shares outstanding.  </P> <P> Despite the buyback, Dataproducts' remaining stock fell sharply Monday. The  stock closed at $4.875, down $1, in American Stock Exchange composite trading.  </P></p>

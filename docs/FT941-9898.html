			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei boosted by late arbitrage buying Late afternoon arbitrage buying left Japanese equities higher at the end of the day, although many investors stayed on the sidelines, and others were cautious in adjusting their positions ahead of the long weekend, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average showed an improvement of 149.32 at 19,990.70 after a day's low of 19,787.28 and high of 20,007.00. The Topix index of all first section stocks closed 10.12 up at 1,608.14. Prices fluctuated narrowly throughout the session due to uncertainty over the Hosokawa-Clinton meeting in Washington today. Reports of tough rhetoric by US trade negotiators dampened sentiment; a breakdown of the US-Japan bilateral framework talks could mean upward pressure on the yen, which would be a blow to Japanese exporters. Volume came to 350m shares, against 452m, with increasing caution also expressed over next Monday's listing of Nikkei 300 stock futures contracts on the Osaka stock exchange. Advances outscored declines by 647 to 370, with 140 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index added 3.86 at 1,333.48. Foreign buying supported multimedia linked issues, including leading consumer electronics companies at the end of the session. Sony moved ahead Y100 to Y6,290 and Matsushita Electric Industrial Y50 to Y1,720. Brother Industries, the sewing machine maker, gained Y55 at Y565. Environmental shares were up on expectations that the US president and the Japanese prime minister will address environmental problems during their meeting. Tabai Espec, a meteorological environmental testing equipment maker, rose Y130 to Y1,200. Steels were lower on profit-taking. Kawasaki Steel slipped Y6 to Y351 and NKK Y4 to Y256. Mining issues, which had been higher on firm gold prices, lost ground. Sumitomo Metal Mining shed Y21 to Y879 and Dowa Mining Y4 to Y518. Telecommunications linked stocks were stronger. Fujitsu, the most active issue of the day, put on Y10 at Y1,050 and Nitsuko added Y60 at Y1,600. Zexel, a car parts maker, jumped Y60 to Y640 on reports that it will supply car navigation systems to General Motors, of the US, on a original equipment manufacturing basis. In Osaka, the OSE average firmed 74.78 to 21,779.62 in volume of 47.1m shares. Roundup The lunar new year closed several markets in the region. Elsewhere, although there was some response to Wednesday's Wall Street rally, some investors were in two minds about the Dow. AUSTRALIA fell on nervousness, a wavering futures market and weaker resource stocks, the All Ordinaries index closing 36.6 lower at 2,234.3. A fund manager said Sydney was still in profit-taking mode, destabilised by the 96-point fall in the Dow six days earlier. Among resource stocks, North Broken Hill was 24 cents down at ADollars 3.60 after the Robe River iron ore project said it would take a 14.5 per cent price cut for ore to Japan, in return for guaranteed tonnage. NEW ZEALAND drifted in the absence of holidaying Asian investors, the NZSE-40 index finishing 4.34 off at 2,364.82 after an intraday high of 2,377.50. MANILA celebrated the Chinese new year by staying open and breaching the 3,000 level, the composite index ending 18.43 higher at 3,013.76. Brokers said there was renewed foreign buying. Philippine National Bank gained 20 pesos at 605 pesos and PLDT 10 pesos at 2,190 pesos. BANGKOK and JAKARTA closed firmer in dull trading, the SET index rising 6.90 to 1,410.53 in turnover of Bt9.1bn and the JKSE composite index putting on 2.82 at 583.47. The latter saw buying in selected issues; Sampoerna continued to capitalise on its optimistic 1994 net profits forecast, adding 6.2 per cent at Rp16,400 in thin volume. KARACHI rose on government incentives for the textile industry announced yesterday, the KSE 100 index finishing 15.50 ahead at 2,339.70. BOMBAY ended higher, although early sharp gains were eroded by profit-taking by the Unit Trust of India, as well as by other Indian financial institutions. The BSE index was finally 20.98 up at 4,039.90, after touching 4,203.70.</p>

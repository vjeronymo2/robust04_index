			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Lamont optimistic about recovery MR Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has expressed optimism that next year would be one of progress for the economy. But yesterday he faced a call for a more balanced economic policy over the medium term and further supply-side measures to increase Britain's growth potential, Emma Tucker and Ralph Atkins write. Mr Lamont writes in The House Magazine, the Commons publication, that the scene is set for recovery and growth. The right environment is in place for a restoration of confidence. He admits that recovery has failed to take root so far, but adds: 'In Britain we face a growing threat to activity from the slowdown in the world economy. At the same time, the risks from inflation are diminishing. That is why the balance of macroeconomic policy overall has been tilted to give more weight to growth.' However, in its latest journal, the Society of Business Economists criticises economic management in the 1980s for relying on single policy measures rather than on a balanced and consistent economic package. Although the decade saw some supply-side improvements in the economy, other difficulties were ignored, including the weakening of the manufacturing base and the tendency to use too many resources for consumption rather than investment, it says. Mr Richard Freeman, chief economist at ICI, writes: 'The UK needs a strategic vision which is capable of changing attitudes throughout society about the economy's performance and particularly attitudes to manufacturing industry. . . It has to include a realistic commitment to Europe and certain institutional changes.' Sir Peter Walters, the chairman of Midland Bank, today becomes the first of the clearing bank chairmen to meet Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to discuss the government's review of banks' interest rate policy.

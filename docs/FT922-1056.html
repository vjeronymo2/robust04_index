			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / UK Company News: BUPA claims 85% of Murrayfield THE BRITISH United Provident Association (BUPA) has reached agreement to acquire the 71.4 per cent of Murrayfield, a hospital in Edinburgh, which it does not already own. The offer, 394p in cash for each Murrayfield share, values the 79-bed purpose-built hospital at Pounds 13.8m and the balance of the shares at Pounds 11m. The shares are being acquired by BUPA Investments, an offshoot of BUPA. Irrevocable undertakings to accept the offer have been received in respect of 56.2 per cent of Murrayfield's equity taking BUPA's interest to 84.7 per cent in aggregate. The board of Murrayfield and its financial advisers, Noble Grossart, consider the terms to be 'fair and reasonable.' BUPA said the offer was final and would not be increased.</p>

			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE WAYNE FAMILY;  </P> <P> LIFE IN THE SHADOW OF THE DUKE  </P> <P> He was the biggest box office attraction in motion picture history, his heroic  screen image already gaining mythic proportions when John Wayne and his family  moved to Newport Beach in 1965.  </P> <P> Harbor tour boats would regularly stop in front of the sprawling Wayne house,  passengers straining to catch a glimpse of the aging Ringo Kid sitting out on  his patio. And while he would privately grouse, "Hell, I have to wear my wig --  I can't even come out in my front yard," he'd always wave and shout hello.  </P> <P> Although he was a member of Hollywood royalty, the Duke never lost the common  touch. Contrary to his tough-guy image, he would often take his young children  -- Aissa, Marisa and Ethan -- to school and pick them up.  </P> <P> Or he'd take them for drives along Coast Highway in his olive-green station  wagon with the custom roof raised to accommodate his 6-foot-4 stature,  frequently stopping at a Sav-On drugstore where, as always, he would graciously  oblige requests for autographs as he shopped.  </P> <P> A decade after his death in 1979 at age 72, the man eulogized as a genuine  American folk hero still casts a bigger-than-life shadow -- a shadow that  hovers over the lives of the Wayne family, the keepers of the legend.  </P> <P> It's the allure of the Wayne name that caused the international media to focus  on Aissa Wayne, 33, when she and her then-boyfriend, millionaire financier  Roger Luby, were brutally attacked by two gunmen who threatened to kill them  inside Luby's gated Newport Beach home in October, 1988.  </P> <P> The media undoubtedly will turn out in force again in March when Aissa Wayne is  scheduled to testify at the trial of her ex-husband, Dr. Thomas A. Gionis, who  is accused of ordering the attack.  </P> <P> She and Gionis, a Pomona orthopedic surgeon, were embroiled in a bitter custody  dispute over their young daughter at the time. The unusual nature of the crime  -- "hit men" in Newport Beach -- and the draw of the Wayne name also prompted  "several people" to approach her about writing a book about the attack. But,  she insists, "there is no way I'd ever write about that."  </P> <P> Ethan Wayne, 27, who is following in his father's profession, must endure the  inevitable comparisons with him that his half-brother, Patrick Wayne, faced  early in his acting career.  </P> <P> And it's the attraction of the Wayne name, in part, that prompted publicity-shy  Ethan Wayne, currently co-starring in a remake of the "Adam 12" television  series, to elope to Prescott, Ariz., in December with his longtime girlfriend,  flight attendant Gina Rivadeneyra.  </P> <P> "We didn't want any sort of news coverage," he said. "I mean it's not like Sean  Penn and Madonna, but we didn't want it to even be in the paper."  </P> <P> Marisa Wayne, 23, the child of John and Pilar Wayne who maintains the lowest  public profile, abandoned her acting after five years of on-and-off study and  is now married to former Olympic skier Jace Romick. They live on a 42-acre  ranch in Steamboat Springs, Colo., where he owns a small furniture company and  she is a health and fitness major at Colorado Mountain College.  </P> <P> And then there's Peruvian-born Pilar Wayne, the late actor's third wife, who  amicably separated from her husband in 1973 after 19 years of marriage, a  relationship she chronicled in her 1987 book "John Wayne: My Life With the  Duke."  </P> <P> Although Pilar's house is now the primary Wayne home in Newport Beach, tour  boats continue to stop at the old "John Wayne house," which has changed hands  twice since it was sold in 1980.  </P> <P> It is, as one tour boat captain said, "still probably the most popular point of  interest in Newport."  </P> <P> She calls it La Roca (the rock), from a biblical passage referring to the  importance of living life with a solid foundation of faith.  </P> <P> Pilar Wayne's opulent two-story French country home, complete with a tennis  court reached via a spiral staircase, sits at the end of a cul-de-sac  overlooking upper Newport Bay, a bird sanctuary with a primeval look despite  the expensive homes ringing its steep cliffs.  </P> <P> Framed family pictures, many of John Wayne with his children, accent the  spacious living room, which overlooks a spa and narrow lap pool. But it is the  oak-accented den off the home's grand, marble-floored entry where friends and  family usually gather.  </P> <P> Dressed in a leather skirt and bright yellow blouse, Pilar Wayne entered the  den with Gucci, her talkative green Amazon parrot, perched on her hand. She put  the bird in an ornate antique brass cage near a window and sat down next to the  marble and oak fireplace to talk of her family.  </P> <P> At least she tried to talk. Gucci, who has cages in nearly every room of the  house and follows "mommy" everywhere, immediately began talking non-stop in the  background.  </P> <P> "He wants to join in the conversation," Pilar said, no sooner scolding the bird  when Thor, her 3-month-old Norwegian elkhound, padded into the room and started  yapping.  </P> <P> "I can't live without a dog," she said, digging into a tin on the glass coffee  table and dropping a handful of popcorn on the floor for Thor. "Sometimes, Duke  and I had four."  </P> <P> References to her husband turn up constantly in Pilar Wayne's conversation, and  the den is filled with various John Wayne mementos: a portrait of him in his  trademark cowboy garb, a bronze bust, and a commemorative John Wayne Winchester  rifle and Colt revolver.  </P> <P> Even the game table in the den's windowed alcove, where Pilar plays bridge with  friends twice a week, is a reminder of Wayne, who taught her how to play  shortly after they moved to Newport.  </P> <P> When he wasn't working, John Wayne loved to play chess, bridge and backgammon.  He also liked to watch football on television and, true to legend, drink with  cronies. His widow, however, downplays his reputation as a carouser.  </P> <P> "Duke was the kind who would love a good argument, a good cognac and a good  cigar," she recalled. But at that stage of his life he mostly enjoyed the kids,  she said. "He was a very good family man."  </P> <P> An old-fashioned husband -- in her book she calls him her "beautiful  19th-Century man who couldn't adapt to the '70s" -- John Wayne loved making  movies and often made one after another, usually in distant locations. It was  his insistence that his wife and children accompany him on location, despite  being uprooted from their home and friends, that led to their separation in  1973.  </P> <P> Pilar Wayne moved out of the waterfront house in the exclusive Bayshores  section of Newport Beach, which she likened to "living in a fishbowl," and into  a condominium they owned in nearby Big Canyon.  </P> <P> Although they lived apart the last six years of John Wayne's life, she makes a  point of saying "there was not a legal separation or anything, and we were  certainly friends until the bitter end."  </P> <P> She is, she acknowledged, proud of the Wayne name.  </P> <P> "Oh, yes, absolutely," she said. "It meant more to me not that he was big and  famous and everything else, but he was such a wonderful human being. That man  maybe was not perfect, but he was about 80% perfect. I liked the way he handled  himself. I liked the way he treated people."  </P> <P> Still a key figure in the society columns, Pilar Wayne lends her name to  numerous charity events.  </P> <P> Although not as politically active as her notoriously outspoken late husband,  she agreed to let the Republican Party of Orange County use her home for a  $1,000-per-couple, fund-raising cocktail reception last night for U.S. Sen.  Pete Wilson in his campaign for governor.  </P> <P> "Duke and I have always supported the Republican Party, like most of Orange  County, I guess," she explained. For their part, local Republicans were not  about to miss a chance to make political hay from the enduring appeal of the  film star's name, announcing that the reception would be held "in the beautiful  upper Newport Bay home of Mrs. John Wayne."  </P> <P> With income from the interest on a trust established for her during their  marriage, she doesn't need to work. But staying active is important to Pilar  Wayne, who owned a small restaurant in Corona del Mar for five years in the  '70s and has written one cookbook and is working on two more.  </P> <P> She was married briefly in 1984 to Municipal Judge Stephen Stewart (a "two-week  mistake," she has called it) but is not currently dating anyone steadily.  "There's nothing serious in my life right now except Thor and Gucci," she said.  At this point in her life, she has no intention of marrying again.  </P> <P> "No way," she said with a laugh. "I really don't think marriage for me is  necessary. I had a wonderful marriage with the Duke and he was a complete  gentleman. It was a long marriage. We have three very beautiful children.  They're great kids."  </P> <P> She visits Marisa in Colorado frequently, and both Ethan and Aissa, who have  homes within a mile of their mother, stop to see her several times a week.  </P> <P> Pilar, who revealed that her son eloped shortly after all three of her children  -- and 200 friends -- gathered at her house for a Christmas party last month,  admits that she was "really hurt" when he didn't tell her that he was getting  married. "But he married a beautiful girl, so we're very happy for him," she  said.  </P> <P> "All kids have to find themselves. I've been very lucky with all my three kids.  </P> <P> "Marisa is married and very happy. Ethan, I never knew what he was going to do,  but he is 27 years old now and he has settled down. He cares about the family  and he comes over and he calls. Then my oldest daughter went through that thing  -- that Gionis thing, which is still pending. She came through that very  nicely, very strong."  </P> <P> Pilar describes the 1987 attack on her daughter and Roger Luby as "terrible,  terrible. I can't imagine anybody doing a thing like that."  </P> <P> During the attack inside Luby's garage, the two gunmen struck Luby in the head  with a handgun, bound him and slashed one of his Achilles tendons. Aissa  Wayne's forehead was bashed against the garage floor, her hands bound behind  her and a gun held to her head.  </P> <P> After the attack, Aissa Wayne moved into her mother's house and stayed with her  for three months. "I wouldn't leave her alone for a second," Pilar Wayne said.  </P> <P> Police originally speculated that the attack was a warning directed at Luby. It  wasn't until six months after the incident that Gionis was arrested,  investigators maintaining that his intense fear of having to give up his and  Aissa Wayne's daughter, Anastasia, drove him to direct the attack as a warning.  At his arraignment, Gionis entered a plea of not guilty.  </P> <P> Ironically, Gionis, who had proposed to Aissa under her father's statue at John  Wayne Airport, had been granted custody of his daughter a few months before his  arrest. Since the arrest, he has been granted monitored visitations with  Anastasia, who now lives with her mother. Custody of the child will be reviewed  after Gionis' criminal trial.  </P> <P> Aissa Wayne, who shares custody of her two older children from a previous  marriage to tennis pro Lornie Kuhl of Del Mar, said she experienced nightmares  and sleepless nights after the attack and has talked to a therapist "about the  fear part of it." She said she wasn't "really scared" immediately after the  incident, "but as time has gone on I'm more and more scared. I don't know why.  They say it sometimes takes a while for something to really hit you."  </P> <P> Aissa, who is studying to renew her real estate license, said her mother has  been "my best support in the whole world. She's real strong."  </P> <P> But Aissa said that throughout the ordeal she often wondered what it would have  been like if she still had her father to turn to. She said that at times "when  I really want to talk to him," such as when "the judge gave Anastasia to her  dad and I was just lost," she has visited her father's unmarked hilltop grave  in Pacific View Memorial Park in Corona del Mar.  </P> <P> Aissa said that as she was growing up "he was always the one that got us out of  jams and protected us and everything. He was security for all of us and if we  needed help at school or something, my dad always had good, sound advice."  </P> <P> Aissa remembers that when she was a teen-ager her father was strict. "He sat  down and really talked to us, but he wasn't so unreasonable that you couldn't  even talk to him about something.  </P> <P> "He was a real support day-to-day, so you never got too out of line," she  laughed, "because he was around.  </P> <P> "One thing my dad used to say was, 'I worked 50 years for my reputation,' so I  was always really scared if we'd go out and sneak a beer or something. I would  be really scared (and say) 'we've got to make sure the cops aren't going to  come.' "  </P> <P> Ethan said that when he was a teen-ager his father "knew if we had been  drinking or doing something. I did a lot of stuff -- you just do silly things  when you're a teen-ager.  </P> <P> "But I think he knew it was like a phase you were going through. He'd come in  and look at me and say, 'God, kid, you're a mess.' . . . He didn't have to say  much more than that. He got his point across."  </P> <P> The "Adam 12" star, who has done several public service announcements against  drugs and alcohol, said his father's way of getting the message across worked:  "I'm certainly not involved in anything like that. I'm pretty  health-conscious."  </P> <P> Although Ethan made his screen debut at 8 playing his father's kidnaped  grandson in "Big Jake," he never considered an acting career until after his  father died and stuntman friends of his father, who knew Ethan raced  motorcycles, asked him to work on a picture.  </P> <P> From stunt work he slowly made the transition into acting, and after appearing  in several low-budget films he landed a recurring role in the soap opera "The  Bold and the Beautiful." Last fall he began filming "Adam 12."  </P> <P> Although Pilar Wayne said she sees some of her husband's screen mannerisms in  her son, Ethan doesn't view his career as a case of following in his dad's  sizable boot steps.  </P> <P> "We're very different," he said. "I don't know how many people compare Lloyd  Bridges with Jeff Bridges. They're just different."  </P> <P> Having grown up witnessing the great attention his father received wherever he  went, Ethan wants nothing to do with that aspect of celebrity. He remembers  times when his father couldn't buy a tube of toothpaste without being stopped  repeatedly for autographs.  </P> <P> And he remembers the tour boats that would pull up to their house.  </P> <P> "If he was outside he'd wave, but I sit here and start to think: 'Man, it's  ridiculous what people do. I don't know how they (celebrities) put up with it.'  With me, it's on such a small scale. I'm still kind of a private person. I  don't go out a lot. It's hard to get me to talk even.  </P> <P> "I like the acting business, but that's the hard thing. I want to be famous for  making good movies, not for having people hang around."  </P> <P> Now that he's older and involved with "people that are in an upward race to  make money and have a Porsche or Mercedes or some bull like that, I think back  and my dad could have had whatever he wanted.  </P> <P> "But he'd have been just as happy on a farm or ranch -- or on the boat. He was  just down to earth. He loved that green station wagon that was so ugly. He  didn't get involved in any of the hype. He knew he was a good person, and he  was comfortable with that and he didn't need to have the first spot at the  (Balboa) Bay Club. He didn't let himself get caught up."  </P> <P> Although Ethan stayed with Patrick Wayne last fall while working on "Adam 12,"  and Patrick has visited Marisa in Colorado, John Wayne's four older children  from a previous marriage seldom get together with his three children by Pilar.  </P> <P> While John and Pilar Wayne's children said they are grateful that they can  still see their father in his old movies, it is the man, not the legend, that  they remember.  </P> <P> "He was a great dad," said Marisa, recalling times that he would take her to  the Balboa Fun Zone to ride the Ferris wheel and bumper cars.  </P> <P> Although she was 13 when he died, she said that "the 13 years I had with him  were great years and good memories. A lot of people think because I was so  young I wouldn't remember him. But I think in the back of his mind he realized  that he might die when I was young and compensated by spending more time with  me."  </P> <P> When Ethan remembers his father, he usually thinks of the times that the family  would take trips to Alaska and Mexico on the Wild Goose, John Wayne's 136-foot,  converted World War II minesweeper.  </P> <P> "He was just so happy, just to be able to relax," Ethan recalled. "He had to  put up with so much in town, it was his place he could be himself."  </P> <P> Ethan said his fondest memories are of standing on the bow of the Wild Goose,  his arm around his dad.  </P> <P> "We'd just stand out there, going out on the ocean," he said. "The ocean looked  like 'Victory at Sea.' We'd just hang out there and look around. I miss that."  </P></p>

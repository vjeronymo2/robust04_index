			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Life insurers win concessions in SIB's new disclosure rules THE Securities and Investments Board, Britain's chief investment watchdog, announced new concessions to the life insurance industry yesterday. But the conclusions to the SIB's 13-month review of disclosure and standards of advice for investment companies will still, if enacted, administer a rigorous shake-up to the UK's life insurance and investment industry. Subject to ministerial consent, the SIB proposals will be enacted by the end of this year. Insurance companies would then be given a two-year transitional period to implement most of them. Two changes, lobbied for by insurers, have been made since the last SIB consultative document was published in March: For endowment policies, the SIB will no longer require product providers to reveal the 'break-even year' at which the proceeds investors would receive on surrendering a policy would exceed the premiums they had already paid in. On some 25-year policies, this takes 10 years. The 'reduction in policy proceeds' which companies were required to publish to show the effect of costs on investment returns from life policies may now be renamed the 'reduction in benefits'. The SIB has also dropped plans to force companies to use their own charges in projected illustrations of future performance, and to force independent intermediaries to disclose the commission they receive at the point of sale. It felt they would be put at a disadvantage if forced to reveal commissions when directly employed sales agents were not. Sir David Walker, the SIB chairman, in his last briefing before retiring from the post to become deputy chairman of Lloyds Bank, said he disagreed with Sir Gordon Borrie, director of the Office of Fair Trading, on the issue. He said 'Ultimately, if he persists in his view, and I persist in mine, then we will have to leave ministers to decide.' Ms Jean Eaglesham, of the Consumers' Association, said: 'We don't agree with the SIB on commission disclosure. They are more concerned to protect the independent sector than with protecting investors, and we very much hope the OFT will step in.' Apart from this, the association broadly welcomed the proposals. The Association of British Insurers welcomed some of the proposals, including the transitional period. Fimbra seeks to improve standards Page 8</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Apple ranks third in Japan PC market APPLE Computer, the US company, has overtaken Toshiba as the third-largest supplier in the Japanese personal computer market, according to Dataquest, the market research group. Apple has concluded sales agreements with distributors including Minolta Camera and Mitsubishi Corp, the trading house. It has worked closely with third-party software developers to localise software applications. In 1992, it increased its share of the Japanese market by 2.9 points to 8.3 per cent, against a share of 7.6 per cent for Toshiba, Dataquest stated. This puts it in third place, after NEC, which took a 53.4 per cent chunk of the market and Fujitsu with 9.8 per cent. Apple was significantly ahead of IBM Japan, which has made a big effort to increase its presence in the Japanese market with the launch of bilingual software. IBM ranked fifth with 6.1 per cent of the market, according to Dataquest. In a separate study, IDC, another high-technology consultancy, ranked Apple second after NEC. Apple's stronger showing in the Japanese market comes as the market has suffered a drop in demand, with PC shipments down by 5.8 per cent in 1992 to 2.23m units. In value terms, this represents a 11.5 per cent fall to Y552bn (Dollars 4.8bn). Apple has seen its market share in Japan grow over the past three years and Dataquest said its success stems from the visually appealing output available from an Apple machine. Dataquest said the Japanese PC market would recover in 1993 due to the growing range of low-cost PCs, new software and replacement demand.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Adjustments for Case-Mix Change_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The fiscal year 1995 PPS update should be adjusted to account for the net effect of case-mix change during fiscal year 1994. The net adjustment in this year's update is zero percentage points and reflects the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A 0.9 percentage point reduction for the estimated change in the CMI, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A positive allowance of 0.7 percentage points for real case-mix change across diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A positive allowance of 0.2 percentage points for within-DRG case-complexity change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Adjusting for these factors allows payments to increase due to real changes in the resources required to treat an average Medicare patient. At the same time, it removes the effect of changes in medical record documentation and coding practices that are unrelated to patient resource requirements. (See Appendix A for a more detailed discussion of case-mix change.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Differential Adjustments to the Standardized Amounts_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ProPAC supports the provisions of OBRA 1990 and OBRA 1993 that eliminate the difference between the standardized payment amounts for rural and other urban areas in fiscal year 1995. This year's update would complete a process begun in 1991 that has provided higher updates in each year to rural hospitals. The Commission estimates that the differential would be eliminated if the rural update were 3.1 percentage points higher than the urban update for fiscal year 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the beginning of PPS, the ratio of Medicare payments to costs has been higher for urban hospitals than for rural institutions. This is primarily the result of two factors. First, urban hospitals have benefited more from the PPS payment adjustments_particularly the effects of CMI change and the IME and DSH adjustments. In addition, rural hospitals have had large declines in inpatient volume, raising fixed costs per case. However, as indicated in ProPAC's October 1991 report to the Congress,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rural Hospitals Under Medicare's Prospective Payment System <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , several recent policy changes have improved the relative performance of rural hospitals under PPS. This trend promises to continue. The Commission will monitor and analyze the further effects of these policies as additional data become available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Recommendation 10: Update Factor for Capital Payments to PPS Hospitals <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For fiscal year 1995, the Commission recommends that a formula-based approach be used to update capital payment rates. The capital update should include the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The projected increase in a capital market basket index that measures one-year changes in a fixed basket of capital goods hospitals purchase, currently estimated at 3.4 percent; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An adjustment of zero percentage points to correct for past forecast errors; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An adjustment of zero percentage points to reflect changes in financing costs; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A positive adjustment of 0.9 percentage points for scientific and technological advances; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A negative adjustment of 0.7 percentage points to encourage hospital productivity; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A net adjustment for zero percentage points for case-mix change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission's recommendations would result in a 3.6 percent increase in the Federal capital payment rate for both urban and rural hospitals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ProPAC believes the capital update should be for future capital purchases. It is designed to provide Medicare capital payments reflective of future capital replacement prices. It would provide updates appropriate to maintain hospital capital stock adequate to provide efficient and effective care to Medicare beneficiaries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The components of the update recommendation are summarized in Table 2&hyph;2; a discussion of each of these components follows. (See Appendix A for more information on the capital update.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Capital Market Basket_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ProPAC's capital update recommendation reflects projected increases in a market basket index designed to measure changes in the prices of capital assets hospitals purchase. This index, developed by the Commission, provides a measure of the increase in capital input prices analogous to that used to update PPS operating payments. (See Recommendation 9.) It also measures annual change in the price of a fixed mix of capital goods. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The recommended market basket includes three price components: building and fixed equipment, movable equipment, and other capital-related costs such as insurance. The market basket weights reflect hospitals' patterns of capital acquisition. In the absence of accurate and current information on actual capital purchases, the Commission believes that shares of depreciation expense, adjusted for other capital-related costs, are the best available measures of future purchases. Therefore these shares, combined with annual outlays for capital-related costs, are used as weights in the market basket. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2(,0,),p0,8/9,i1,s50,6 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Table <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  2&hyph;2._ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Recommended Update Factor for Capital Payments, Fiscal Year <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  1995 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank;  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 --> Components of the Update <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=2 --> Fiscal year 1995 capital market basket <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=5 f=1 --> a <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 3.4% <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Correction for fiscal year 1993 forecast error  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=5 f=1 --> b <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> ) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Financing policy adjustment  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 0.0 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Allowance for scientific and technological advances  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 0.9 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Adjustment for productivity improvement  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> ^0.7 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Adjustment for case-mix change <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=5 f=1 --> c <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 0.0 <!-- PJG 007 0162 intable --> n,s <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=02 g=1 f=1 --> Total capital update  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 3.6 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=02 g=5 f=1 --> a <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=02 g=1 f=1 --> Market basket estimate developed by ProPAC using forecasted data supplied by the Health Care Financing Administration, Office of the Actuary, January 1994.

The Commission's financing policy adjustment addresses the issue of interest rate change in the update framework. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The capital market basket proposed by the Secretary uses a complex structure of weighted average changes in economywide price proxies and measures of interest expense. Its value is largely determined by historical values of its components. In ProPAC's view, a straightforward market basket that reflects the change in the price of hospital capital purchases and other capital-related costs in the coming fiscal year is more appropriate. The recommended market basket would provide Medicare capital payments reflective of future capital purchase prices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ProPAC studied a range of alternative capital price measures. In its March 1993  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Report and Recommendations to the Congress <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the Commission recommended using two price proxies especially relevant to hospital industry capital purchases: for hospital building and fixed equipment capital costs, the Boeckh building cost index subindex for apartments and office buildings (institutional construction); and for movable equipment capital costs, the Marshall and Swift hospital equipment index. Changes in other capital-related costs would be measured by the consumer price index for residential rent. Components would be weighted as discussed above. The market basket would be used to prepare single-year projections of price change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As of January 1994, the projected increase in ProPAC's market basket index for fiscal year 1995 is 3.4 percent. This forecast may change as more up-to-date data become available and methodologies for estimating the components of the market basket are refined. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Forecast Error Correction_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes the correction of past market basket index forecast errors should be part of the update framework. This correction protects both hospitals and the Federal government by adjusting the payment rates so that the effects of past forecast errors are not perpetuated. Because a capital market basket has not yet been used to increase capital payment rates, a correction factor is not needed this year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] There has been a new influx of Rwandan refugees,  most of them Hutus, across the border with Tanzania. Reports  from there say about 13,000 people had set up temporary homes  which are believed to be about 40 km from the main Rwandan  refugee camps.    Many of the Hutus are said to have fled from atrocities  committed by the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] which is mostly  Tutsi. The reports add that RPF soldiers were killing many  people and burning down houses during the advance. The RPF,  which now controls much of eastern Rwanda, has denied the  systematic killing of civilians.</p>

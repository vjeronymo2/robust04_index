			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 30 Jun -- Interaction between the State Duma  and the legislative assemblies of the Far Eastern and Siberian  regions will reach a new and more specific level of law-making  activities now that a delegation of the lower chamber of the  Federal Assembly led by State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin has  concluded its five-day working trip there. Rybkin said this to  an ITAR-TASS correspondent at Vnukovo-2 airport today on the  parliamentarians' return to Moscow.    Ivan Rybkin noted that a plan will be drawn up on the  results  of the trip to enable the deputies who were members of the  chamber's delegation to start work on new laws needed by the  regions visited.    He stressed that some regions of Siberia and the Far East  have drawn up draft laws dealing with problems most topical for  them and have sent them to the Duma as a legislative initiative.  In particular, Ivan Rybkin reported, in the very near future a  draft law on the status of Maritime Kray may be submitted to the  Duma.    Ivan Rybkin also noted that the State Duma -- jointly with  the Russian president and government and the regions of Siberia  and the Far East -- will tackle the issue of railway and  electric power tariffs. He stressed that now this is one of the  most serious factors affecting the economic emergence of Russian  territories. The Duma speaker said: "It is absolutely obvious  that these issues need to be settled by the state."</p>

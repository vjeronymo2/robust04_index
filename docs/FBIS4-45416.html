The decision was  adopted at a meeting in the Dominican Republic. Here is a  report by Chelo Garcia: [begin recording]    Garcia: There is concern that the ties between  Latin American drug traffickers and gunrunners are increasingly  getting closer. They work in teams and support each other.  Sophisticated long- and short-range weapons of every caliber,  mostly from Europe, are flooding the Latin American black  markets. The narcotics chiefs of Latin America decided to make  efforts to break this deadly alliance during the drug summit  held in the Dominican Republic.    Colombian counternarcotics chief Colonel Leonardo  Gallego: The most important things were the plans for new  methods and means to strengthen this struggle against drug  trafficking.    Garcia: It was also proposed at the drug summit  that the Latin American countries form a single bloc of support  to control drug cultivation, production, processing, and  trafficking. They will also work shoulder to shoulder to  prevent the use of aircraft, vessels, and ground transportation  to supply materials that Latin American drug traffickers need to  produce drugs.

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM warns of 'danger' in Scots secession - News in brief THE prime minister last night expressed confidence that Scots would reject independence if the option were put to them at a referendum. He warned that the prospect of an independent Scotland would be 'immensely dangerous'. Questioned in an interview on BBC radio about a recent surge in support for secession, Mr John Major reiterated his belief in the union with England and Wales, saying that some Scots failed to recognise how much independence would cost them. When his interviewer argued that some 70 per cent of Scots now favoured some form of devolution, Mr Major referred back to the surge in nationalism that led to the plebiscite in 1979 on the creation of a national assembly. 'We had a referendum once before,' he said. 'But when faced with the reality, it melted away.' The prime minister also rejected any comparisons between support for the aspirations of newly independent states in eastern Europe and opposition to Scottish nationalists. The Act of Union had been entered into voluntarily and had been beneficial for all parts of the UK, he said. ***** RPI: New methods are being considered for the calculation of the retail prices index to take account of the council tax when it replaces poll tax, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said in a written Commons reply last night. The poll tax is included in the index with food prices, mortgage rates and prices of leading goods. Mr Lamont said the RPI advisory committee would also look at modifying the index to take account of holiday expenditure and changes in new car prices, and how it might be brought into line with similar indices in other European countries. ***** THIRD WORLD: The Conservative manifesto will include a warning that aid will be cut for developing countries which failed to practice 'good government', Mrs Lynda Chalker, overseas development minister, said yesterday. She added: 'Where human rights are systematically abused, or where aid is feeding corruption rather than mouths, we shall have no alternative but to cut it.' ***** BRITISH RAIL: Mr John Prescott, Labour transport spokesman, said last night that if the government did not change BR financing arrangements so it could buy new rolling stock, ministers would risk killing off Britain's rail manufacturing industry.</p>

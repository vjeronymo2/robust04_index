			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / People: Sketchley names Jackson as chief executive John Jackson, 47, who led Richard Branson's unsuccessful bid for the UK National Lottery project, has been appointed chief executive of Sketchley, the dry-cleaning and film processing group with around 800 retail outlets. Sketchley, which was losing Pounds 800,000 a month when it was rescued by Tony Bloom and John Richardson in 1990, has been looking for a chief executive for some time. Richardson, 51, former chief executive of Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa, is returning to Hong Kong at the end of the month to work for BZW and Bloom, 55, a former chief executive of South Africa's Premier Group and Sketchley's other deputy chairman, intends to become non-executive after next year's annual meeting. Jackson, an accountant, worked for Bristol-Myers for 14 years before joining Chesebrough Pond's. In 1986 he was recruited by Virgin's Richard Branson to be his special project director. Two years later was appointed managing director of Body Shop International. In May 1993 he quit Body Shop and rejoined Branson to mastermind Virgin's bid for the UK National Lottery project.</p>

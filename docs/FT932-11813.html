			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of European Offshore Centres (8): Triple shock for principality - Liechtenstein THE normally tranquil Alpine principality of Liechtenstein has been rocked by three shocks in the past year or so. Revelations that some of the large frauds perpetrated by Mr Robert Maxwell were executed through secretive Liechtenstein-based foundations severely battered the principality's image as a reputable tax haven. Then, just as the blaze of publicity surrounding the Maxwell shenanigans died down, the people of Liechtenstein themselves upset their financial community, voting in December to join the European Economic Area (EEA). The EEA is the new expanded free trade area being established between the European Community (EC) and the seven countries of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) except Switzerland. While tax matters are specifically excluded from the terms of the EEA treaty, the signatories are committed to respecting EC laws, both those that exist and those that will be passed in the future. And it would be rash to assume that the EC will not some day require all member countries to co-operate in tax matters. Also, after a three-year transition period, Liechtenstein will have to allow foreign banks and legal firms, up to now prohibited, to establish offices in the principality. The latest blow has been the publication of a substantial book* written in English by a Zurich banker, Mr Uri Ramati, on how its trusts and foundations work. The title, Liechtenstein's Uncertain Foundations, betrays its emphasis on some of the potential dangers for users of the principality as a refuge for capital, an emphasis not universally welcomed in Vaduz. Financial leaders have taken these shocks largely in their stride. Lessons have been learned, reforms have been made and others are in the works and the government is working hard to align its financial laws and practices wherever possible with those of the EC. Liechtenstein is an unusual tax haven anyway. For one thing, it is an industrialised country, with a very high standard of living among its 29,000 inhabitants. The principality's main economic problem is a chronic shortage of labour. Consequently, while it is content to operate an offshore financial centre, it does so on its own terms. Its stock in trade is total secrecy and non-co-operation with other governments, but only on tax matters. It will not tolerate any other form of financial criminality. Whether in the Maxwell case or in others involving fraud or insider trading, Liechtenstein has always been eager to co-operate with foreign governments' investigators, and they try hard to prevent wrongdoing. Although the government believes its legal structures have been largely adequate to fight financial crime, it has continued to improve them. Insider trading, for example, is now a criminal offence as is drug money laundering. A reform to the banking act last year has obliged auditors to pass on their reports on banks to the Banking Commission. The due diligence treaty between the government and the five local banks is considered adequate, even though it allows beneficial owners of bank accounts to hide behind lawyers. It may be brought in line next year with the Swiss convention, which requires bankers to know the identity of beneficial owners, because of Swiss pressure. Mr Hubert Buchel, secretary of the Banking Commission, says a general money laundering law is needed, but the government would rather wait until Austria, which has a similar legal system, has developed its legislation in this area. In the area of trust law too, reform is in the works. Trustees and bankers have formed a new association and Mr Werner Keicher, its head, hopes to have a first draft of a new law ready by 1994. Mr Keicher, a director in the trust firm Allgemeines Treuunternehmen and the director of the Maxwell Foundation, was not specific about what reforms would be made, but he acknowledged some of the criticisms made in Mr Ramati's book were fair. The principality's most popular trust products for non-residents are anstalts (establishments) and stiftungs (foundations). The typical user of these entities is someone who wants to be able to stand up in a court in his home country - for whatever reason - and deny ownership of assets other than those registered at home. Legally speaking, the denial is usually accurate. The typical ownership of an anstalt is in bearer form, with the identity of the owner left blank, while the so-called 'founder' of the stiftung is usually a Liechtenstein trustee or lawyer. Mr Ramati points out that in the case of the anstalt there is always a risk that the ownership document can be misplaced or fall into unfriendly hands, and a recent legal case arose over who actually owned the assets in an anstalt because of this problem. In the case of the foundation, Mr Ramati says the risk is that the Liechtenstein-based 'founder' or director may take a more restrictive view of how to disburse funds to heirs than the real founder intended. And if, as in most cases, he is the sole director, there is no possible appeal. Mr Ramati's recommendation is that someone thinking of forming a Liechtenstein foundation should not do so unless he has a close family friend who can be appointed as a director to represent the family interest. Mr Keicher said that he often recommended to clients that they select the person who is to succeed the Liechtenstein founder rather than leave it to the Liechtenstein trust firm. He also wanted to see the taxation of foundations of non-residents move away from a simple capital tax to a more normal system. As foundations do not have to file financial statements, many now only pay the minimum SFr1,000 required by law. He said he recommended that clients agree to have their foundations pay on the full capital amount as this helps in proving that the assets belong to the foundation. Mr Keicher said the main lessons from the Maxwell case were personal rather than professional. 'For our firm, the mandate was far too big. It was impossible for us to keep up with 400 different subsidiaries.' Liechtenstein's Lilliputian dimensions also mean that its membership in the EEA could cause problems. The country does not want to become another Monaco, teeming with tax exiles and offices of foreign banks. Mr Buchel doubts that many foreign banks will set up offices, simply because it would be difficult to staff them. Mr Rene Ott, deputy managing director of Bank in Liechtenstein, the principality's largest bank with SFr39bn under management, hopes some do come. 'The more competitors you have, the more seriously you are taken as a financial centre,' he says. * Liechtenstein's Uncertain Foundations, Anatomy of a Tax Haven, UE Ramati, Hazlemore Ltd Tax Publications, Dublin.</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / The conversion of Mr Chernomyrdin: Russia's so-called conservative prime minister has become dedicated to reform Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, long regarded as a conservative, is enjoying a second career - as a reformer. 'There is no doubt he's serious,' said a senior US Treasury official this week. The evaluation marks an apparently extraordinary turnabout. The 55-year-old premier has been in office for a little over a year, since taking over from Mr Yegor Gaidar at the end of 1992. Instantly seen as a conservative from the energy lobby, the spoilt object of state investment - he was formerly a Soviet oil and gas minister and head of the Gasprom gas monopoly - he spent much of last year appearing grudgingly to go along with reformist plans driven by deputy prime ministers like Mr Anatoly Chubais (privatisation), Mr Boris Fyodorov (finance) and Mr Gaidar (economy). Since the last two of these resigned in January, it has gradually become clearer that Mr Chernomyrdin, and his first deputy prime minister Mr Oleg Soskovets, wish to emerge as reformist figures and to be seen as men who are as convinced of the necessity for the adoption of market principles as their former colleagues. The evidence includes: A continued insistence by Mr Chernomyrdin on a tight credit policy, of the kind which brought down inflation to a low of 10 per cent last month. Mr Chernomyrdin took exception two weeks ago, during a meeting of ministers, senior officials and regional leaders, to a speech by Mr Victor Gerashchenko, central bank chairman, in which his one-time ally said inflation was less important than the maintenance of employment: for the first time, in public, Mr Chernomyrdin underscored his difference of principles with the bank chairman. Perhaps because of this, Mr Gerashchenko has also kept the lid on credit expansion this year: financial officials say that credit is running at only 40 per cent of the level permitted by the government's Credit Committee. A commitment to radical measures - including land privatisation. Mr Chernomyrdin went to Nizhny Novgorod last week and there enthusiastically endorsed auctioning of land to the members of state and collective farms - saying that he would ensure that the Nizhny model became a federal programme. Nizhny Governor Boris Nemtsov, the symbol of regional reform, was delighted. The testimony of those close to him - notably that of Mr Peter Castenfelt, a respected Swedish financier with a long record of working with Russia, who last month was appointed adviser to Mr Chernomyrdin and Mr Soskovets on enterprise reform. Mr Castenfelt last month pressed Mr Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, to accept the Russian premier's reformist credentials. 'Mr Chernomyrdin is absolutely determined to keep to the budget,' said Mr Castenfelt, now in Moscow. 'He's a real boss, and now he means business. He's much more market-oriented than he's been represented - but he's been burned by the criticism of him as a conservative and he feels isolated from western opinion.' However, Mr Chernomyrdin must be at least as tough - in fact, tougher - than were Mr Gaidar or Mr Fyodorov, if his newly-minted credentials are to stand the test. Yesterday he told the parliament's upper house that he had signed the 1994 budget and passed it to parliament for consideration. That 'consideration' will be the first real test of the parliament's mood on the economy. It will, at the least, not be an easy ride: the Rbs183,000bn expenditure envisaged has been greeted with threats of social explosion from all the lobbies, especially from the army, and lobbies are well represented in both houses of parliament. On the income side, the envisaged Rbs120,000bn is unlikely to materialise: poor tax collection and declining profits have meant that income is running at little more than half that annual rate. If parliament rejects the budget, a very hard choice must be made. The options are to bow to its will and print vast sums of money to cover a budget even more in deficit than the proposed one; to resign; or to bring the budget in under presidential decree - an option under the constitution. Mr Chernomyrdin has stood with President Boris Yeltsin for the past year and he stands or falls with Mr Yeltsin. For the moment, that means he stands for reform.</p>

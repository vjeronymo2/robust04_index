Upon his return  from the airport, Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris  Silajdzic, who led our delegation, stated the following about  the content and results of today's talks. Here is a report by  Senada Cumurovic:    [Begin recording] [Cumurovic] Head of the ICRC  [International  Committee of the Red Cross] for former Yugoslavia Andre Collomb  also attended the talks today. What was the reason?    [Silajdzic] Collomb was there to point at the serious  situation and express deep concern felt by the Red Cross due to  the deterioration of the situation. Their concern is justified.  We, of course, accepted that as it was. On the other hand, he  [words indistinct] to initiate the process of POW exchanges. In  brief, we agreed that what was possible to do in the  humanitarian sphere should be done, what is impossible to do now  should be left for later. [words indistinct] We shall try to  speed up work on that as every day is important for these  people. This is as regards Mr. Collomb's participation.    After that we had bilateral talks. Of course, as regards the  humanitarian situation, we first had talks on convoys in  general, and then on a particular convoy which has been waiting  in Zenica for a long time to pass through to Maglaj. If you can  recall those two parallel convoys from Croatia which [Croatian  Foreign Minister] Granic and myself agreed for Nova Bila and  Maglaj. A part of the convoy is still waiting in Zenica to pass  through; today we learned that the Serb side would not make  problems for the passage of the convoy through the Serb-held  territory. Of course, we have to obtain consent of the Croat  side. We need not stress the importance of it. I think that  the situation in Maglaj and Tesanj is dramatic. In addition to  convoys, we shall try to parachute the aid there.    [Cumurovic] The impression of our delegation members who  took  part in the talks is that the political negotiations were held  in a more favorable atmosphere. Why do that feel that way?    [Silajdzic] Simply because there was readiness to view all  options equally. Certain specific agreements have been reached,  and when concrete agreements are present the situation is always  easier and it is possible to discuss everything in a different  way.    I will say it straight away. It was agreed to form a joint  commission to go to Gorazde in order to spread the atmosphere  concerning measures for building confidence; in Gorazde, Foca,  and Cajnice. [We discussed] especially the supplies of water and  electricity, therefore, the repair of power lines and, of  course, the most difficult topic is always the exchange of  prisoners (?on that side).    The second topic which we seriously discussed are the  possibilities of improving the communications between Sarajevo  and other areas via Visoko or Hadzici. We held talks in  principle, but they were held in an atmosphere which could lead  to an agreement on improving communications links, on leaving  and entering Sarajevo, the return to (?northern and) southern  parts of the republic.

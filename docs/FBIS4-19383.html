			<p>BFN     [Text] During the most recent National Security Council  [NSC] meeting, which was to be devoted to the economic package,  the latest political and military developments in Greece, South  Cyprus, Bosnia, and Macedonia were also discussed. It was  reported that the Balkan developments were discussed in  connection with the internal problems of Turkey. In particular,  it was concluded that Greece "is intensifying its policy of  exploiting the Kurdish problem to weaken Turkey."    A diplomat serving at the NSC General Secretariat said: "The  public is not aware of it, but Turkey is rapidly being dragged  into the Balkans clashes. Turkey is involved in the bargaining  over Bosnia. In return for the joint decision to send troops to  Bosnia, a promise has been made to Turkey. It certainly does  not concern concessions in Bosnia. It may be a promise to help  Turkey gain the initiative in the Middle East, or of U.S.  support for Turkey against the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan].  Political circles are talking about the wresting of a  concession from Ankara during the U.S.-Turkey Joint Defense  Council meeting in Ankara. The United States has no dispute  with Turkey regarding the Kurdish problem. Though the Bosnian  situation has attracted the public's attention, the most  important issue for Turkey is the recent tension with Greece."  <H5>  "Tension Could Develop With Greece" </H5>   Speaking to AYDINLIK, the diplomat continued by indicating  that there is a possibility of a small-scale clash in the  Aegean, and said: "The tension between Turkey and Greece will  reach its climax during the Papandreou administration. A  frightening tension has developed in recent days. The Turkish  Foreign Ministry is extremely nervous about Greece, and a  small-scale clash in the Aegean cannot be ruled out. Greece is  doing everything to provoke such a development. Papandreou has  launched an intense campaign against Turkey in south Cyprus for  the past four months. They have reestablished EOKA [National  Organization of Cypriot Fighters], and Greece has incorporated  Cyprus within its defense zone. The Enosis [union of Cyprus  with Greece] initiative, launched by a bloody coup in 1974, is  now being promoted with velvet gloves. They have armed the  Greek Cypriots excessively, and the army has been put on alert.  In the meantime, Greece has stepped up pressure on the Turkish  minority in Thrace. With the decision to dispatch Turkish  troops to Bosnia, Greece launched an intensive counteroffensive.  The dispatch of Greek Cypriot volunteers to Serbia is being  organized in Cyprus and Greece. They are being sent there `to  kill Turks.' Serious problems will arise if the soldiers of the  Turkish contingent in Bosnia come under such attacks."  <H5>  PKK Promised Government in Exile </H5>   In addition to the international developments, the NSC  meeting also discussed Greece's support for the PKK. It  reportedly examined allegations that the PKK's anti-tourism  bombings in Turkey are being planned in south Cyprus. A report  submitted to the NSC states that the PKK has been promised it  can open official missions in Athens and south Nicosia, and that  they will open soon. The report adds that the Greek government  has promised the PKK it can establish "a government in exile"  in Athens or Nicosia.    Reportedly Turkey will be making preparations to counter  these developments in the coming days.    The NSC feels that intervention in Greece would not elicit a  strong reaction from the West.    An NSC expert pointed out that a crisis with Greece would  promote national reconciliation inside Turkey.</p>

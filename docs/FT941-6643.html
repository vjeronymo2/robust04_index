			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Business and the Law: A taxing task for partners - How to cope with the move to self-assessment The 1994 Finance Bill contains what accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand calls 'the most wide-ranging reforms of personal tax and compliance this century'. The introduction of self-assessment for the self-employed and the changeover from taxation on a preceding-year basis to a current-year basis from the 1997-98 tax year, with a transitional year in 1996-97, will affect 9m people in the UK. Among those most affected will be partnerships. For partnerships in existence on April 5 this year, taxable profits arising in any year of assessment after April 5 1997 will be calculated as though the firm were an individual, and then divided among the partners in the same way actual profits are shared in the period in which they arise. Partners will be required to include their share of the taxable profits in their own personal tax returns for 1997-98 and calculate or 'self-assess' the tax due on their total income and capital gains. Each partner will be responsible for payment of his or her own tax. Tax returns must be filed with the Inland Revenue by January 31 in the year following the year of assessment. Payments on account - tax paid before the final amount has been agreed with the Inland Revenue - will be due in two instalments, the first on January 31 in the year of assessment and the second on July 31. Interim payments will normally be based on the preceding year's tax liability. Final balancing payments, like the tax return, must be made by January 31 in the year following assessment. Thus a firm with an accounting period ending on June 30 1998 will pay tax in the financial year 1998-99 (the tax year in which its accounting period ends), and partners will have to make interim payments on January 31 and July 31 1999 and file completed returns and make balancing payments by January 31 2000. To encourage compliance and prompt payment, tax paid 28 days late, ie on February 28, will attract a 5 per cent surcharge and, if it is still outstanding six months later, another 5 per cent. Although the new regime treats partners as sole traders, making each of them responsible for his or her share of the profits, partnerships will still submit returns of adjusted profits and the allocation of them among the partners to the Revenue. Negotiations on the profits will also still be handled centrally with the partnership. To encourage compliance, late partnership returns will also attract an automatic penalty of Pounds 100 per partner and a similar penalty if still outstanding six months later. There are similar penalties for late personal returns. For partnerships in existence on April 5 this year, 1996-97 will be a transitional year. Under the transitional provisions, tax paid in 1996-97 will be a 12 months' average of the tax payable on the profits arising in the two years to April 5 1996. Thus for a partnership with a year end of April 30, the relevant accounts on which tax will be assessed for the transitional year 1996-97 will be for the periods May 1 1994 to April 30 1995, and May 1 1995 to April 30 1996. Tax will be payable on 12/24ths, or half, of those results. According to Denise Catterall, a tax partner of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, this creates a significant, one-off tax-planning opportunity for partnerships. If a firm is anticipating any large or unusual items of income, it should try to ensure payment is made during the transitional assessment period, as it will effectively be halved for tax-averaging purposes. Equally, large one-off items of expenditure, such as refurbishment or redundancy costs, should be kept out of the assessment period, because a firm will effectively get tax relief on only half. With May 1 not far away, firms should be planning now to take advantage of the transitional regime, either bringing forward exceptional items of expenditure or delaying receipt of exceptional income, she says. But there is one caveat. The Revenue has said it will introduce a narrowly targeted anti-avoidance provision, details of which may not emerge until next year, so caution is required. Mrs Catterall believes that, provided firms stick to what can be classified as ordinary commercial decisions, the Revenue will find it hard to object. The trick, she says, will be to avoid anything that is too obviously designed to cash in on the transitional regime. The same is also true of partnership borrowings. If a firm has partnership borrowings and is likely to pay an unusual amount of loan interest in the transitional period, it will effectively only receive tax relief on half. If, on the other hand, the borrowings are rearranged so that they are expressed as loans to each partner individually, then full tax relief on the interest will be available to partners as individuals. Again, the Revenue may target this as an avoidance measure, but Mrs Catterall believes it should be possible for firms to argue a commercial justification for rearranging their finances. The start of the transitional period is not far off, so it is vital that partnerships clear their arrears with the Revenue if they are to avoid problems in finalising their first partnership and personal returns under the new system. For firms with a financial year ending March 31, the problem is acute: once the new regime is in place, they will only have until the following January 31 to file their returns and pay their tax. Ten months is a short time for even the most efficient partnership to sort out its tax system. If a firm is years behind in its tax affairs, as many partnerships are, any tax return filed within such a tight timescale will inevitably contain estimates. With a period of only 12 months after the statutory filing in which amendments can be made, partnerships may lose out if they do not take steps quickly to ensure their tax affairs are up-to-date, to eliminate excessive reliance on estimated figures. Within certain limits, partnerships will be able to change their financial year end, and the difficulty of filing returns within 10 months may be one reason for moving the year end to a date after April 5. An April 30 year end would give the firm considerably longer to file returns and statements of profits. But against that must be balanced the effect of paying tax on 'overlap profits' - profits taxed in successive years for firms with year ends straddling the fiscal year - and, in particular, the impact of this on retiring and new partners. Whatever the effect of the new rules on individual partnerships, the change to a current-year basis of taxation will accelerate the payment of tax, making tax provision more difficult - particularly in times of falling profits. Whereas a tax bill amassed and waiting to be paid could be used as working capital under the old regime, under the new rules that 'fund' will no longer be available, says Mrs Catterall. She believes most partnerships will continue to provide for tax, but the acceleration of the payment of tax may mean they will have to find other means of raising working capital. Partners may be asked to contribute more, or the deficit may be made up by billing earlier and chasing up payment. These changes in personal taxation will have a significant impact on all lawyers, architects, surveyors and other partnerships. For those who have not yet taken proper advice, time is running out.</p>

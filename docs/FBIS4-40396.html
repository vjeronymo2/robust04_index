			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Supreme Council Chairman Babken Ararktsyan </F> by Liana Minasyan in Moscow under the "Peacekeeping" rubric;  date of interview not given: "Loss of Momentum by Peacekeepers  May Lead to Escalation of Karabakh Conflict. Chairman of  Armenia's Supreme Council Babken Ararktsyan on Parliamentarians'  Role in Settling the Crisis"]    [Text] [Minasyan] Does the situation in the national  parliaments affect the work of the Interparliamentary Assembly  [IPA], from whose sitting you have come to Moscow? Is it going  to be a sort of a supra-parliamentary organ or will it remain in  its present capacity?    [Ararktsyan] The IPA Council is indeed a "speakers' club" of  sorts. But during plenary sessions it is not just the speakers'  own points of view that clash, because the Armenian delegation  and the other delegations represent all the political forces.  Clashes are natural under these circumstances. Besides, inside  the "speakers' club" itself there are very many different  approaches, but since decisions are reached through consensus,  proposals that cannot be accepted at once have to be given a  "blander" form. I am going to speak about the question that was  before the latest IPA Council in St. Petersburg. The Bishkek  protocol recorded Shumeyko's and Sherimkulov's initiative that  the parliaments of the CIS-member countries should approve the  idea of creating CIS peacekeeping forces. The IPA Council was  also asked to support this proposal, but Azerbaijan blocked it.    [Minasyan] Was anyone else against?    [Ararktsyan] Clearly not. Moldavia [Moldova] had some  doubts, but had it come to voting, they would not have vetoed  it, I think. Azerbaijan was against, and the decision was not  made but will be taken up again in the autumn.    [Minasyan] What caused Mr. Guliyev's doubts?    [Ararktsyan] This is a very important question politically  -- the presence on Azerbaijan's territory of peacekeeping forces  of the CIS or Russia. They have either made no final decision  or are against.    [Ninasyan] Maybe the whole thing would boil down to giving  the Russian forces the flag of the CIS coalition?    [Ararktsyan] The peacekeeping forces are not only the  subunits that are going to participate in peacekeeping  operations. Many CIS countries are ready to give them material  assistance, say, to supply technical equipment -- this is also  participation. I know that some countries are ready to also  provide military contingents. Thus, one should not identify CIS  peacekeeping forces with Russian troops -- this of course causes  anxiety in the political quarters of different countries. No  one, Russia included, objects to the presence of international  forces. But the CSCE has no peacekeeping subunits, only the  United Nations does. The fears are that getting the mandate and  finances may take time while the fragile truce that now holds in  the conflict region may be broken at any time. Therefore the  loss of momentum may amount to an escalation of the conflict.    [Minasyan] As a regional organization, can the CIS give its  mandate to these troops?    [Ararktsyan] It can. International organizations, too, can  give their own mandate -- no one objects to this.    [Minasyan] What caused Shumeyko's appearance among the  mediators?    [Ararktsyan] Shumeyko was elected chairman of the IPA, the  decision on the creation of a peacemaking group for Nagorno  Karabakh was made back last year, and he was naturally supposed  to join in this work. He also played a great role in the  signing of the Bishkek protocol.    [Minasyan] How can this problem be solved at the level of  parliaments?    [Ararktsyan] I, of course, realize very well that this is a  job for the executive. Parliaments can only recommend these or  other steps -- the Bishkek protocol also contained  recommendations of this sort. But sooner or later, when  agreements have been signed, they have to be ratified by the  Supreme Council. And ratification will be made easier if  parliament joins the effort at an early stage.    [Minasyan] Did the quadripartite meeting on Karabakh take  place in St. Petersburg after all?    [Ararktsyan] There was a very exciting exchange of views  between Shumeyko, Guliyev and myself, and Baburin. The very  fact that this meeting was attended by the chairman of the  Karabakh parliament shows that there is progress in the talks.  Undoubtedly, that was an informal conversation that entails no  obligations.    [Minasyan] Can the implementation of the Russian  peacekeeping plan meet with opposition in the Armenian  parliament?    [Ararktsyan] The plan suggested by Armenia's leaders for two  years -- the establishment of a guaranteed peace with the  bringing in of peacekeeping forces followed by talks on the  political status of Nagorno-Karabakh -- is being backed in  general forms by almost all political forces. The mechanism for  carrying it through, of course, causes differences. Some  radical forces have their own stance on the fundamental question  -- they believe the status of Nagorno-Karabakh should be defined  immediately. However, making haste on the question of status  could deadlock the current preliminary round of talks.    [Minasyan] Does the possible presence of Russian troops in  Karabakh cause displeasure?    [Ararktsyan] It does not. There are no important  differences on this question.</p>

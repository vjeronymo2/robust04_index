			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Warning on Greek economy Greece's socialist prime minister, Mr Andreas Papandreou, has warned that the country's economy is not expected to recover before 1996. He said his government would maintain tight austerity policies over the next 12 months. The opening of the Thessaloniki trade fair at the weekend, Mr Papandreou said inflation would be held at 11 per cent this year, close to the government's target of 10.5 per cent. 'Next year's budget is being prepared in a spirit of austerity so that borrowing needs can be further reduced, but it will be a difficult year that will decide the economy's future course,' he said. Public sector wage rises are to be held at 6 per cent next year, below the projected 8 per cent inflation rate. Growth in gross domestic product is forecast at 1.2 per cent, against 0.8 per cent this year. Mr Papandreou's remarks, coming a few days before Greece's economic convergence plan is submitted for approval by European Union finance ministers, appeared intended to reassure European Commission officials suspicious that Greece's commitment to reducing fiscal imbalances may start to weaken.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Pact of the Left: `Everyone United </F> in Opposition'"]    [Text] Rome -- Votes of confidence, budget, and  parliamentary reforms and appointments. These are the four  themes which have given birth to the "pact of permanent  consultation" signed by the three parliamentary groups to which  213 progressive deputies belong. The document, launched by the  left-wing groups with the intention of setting up a common  opposition on the topics of greatest importance, was presented  yesterday at a press conference at the Chamber of Deputies by  Luigi Berlinguer, Famiano Crucianelli, Giorgio Bogi, Gianni  Mattioli, Diego Novelli, and Fabio Mussi.    The progressive deputies "commit themselves in the form of a  permanent consultation pact aimed at common parliamentary  behavior on questions of: votes of confidence and  no-confidence, government finance and the budget, constitutional  and electoral reforms, and parliamentary appointments." When it  comes to "questions of conscience" and matters relating to  ethical subjects and religious convictions, the pact permits  "freedom of behavior" for each individual parliamentarian. The  accord's signatories, freely inspired by the "joint declaration  of intent" signed between the progressive allies at the time of  the 27 March parliamentary elections, undertake in the document  to "ensure the growth of, to consolidate, deepen and extend this  unity."    With the "pact," the progressive deputies also undertake to  maintain and strengthen the joint electoral committees in their  respective constituencies, which will be linked by regional or  constituency-level coordination committees. Additionally,  permanent coordination bodies and working groups will be created  in the parliamentary committees. This document shows, Luigi  Berlinguer, PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] floor leader in  the lower house, stated, that the progressive's united path has  not ended, even if three distinct parliamentary groups have been  born. We will present an opposition without adjectives, firmly,  and without agitation. Communist Renewal floor leader  Crucianelli presented the document as an instrument "to give  life to a united battle by the opposition on contents, taking  into account that an attempt is being made to set up a system,"  and indicated as the first joint engagement the national  manifestation on schools on 29 May. For Giorgio Bogi, the pact  is a "gesture of loyalty toward the electorate," while for  Greens deputy Gianni Mattioli the agreement is the fruit "of a  strong united effort coming from the periphery."</p>

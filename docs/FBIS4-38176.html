			<p>BFN     [Text] Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert says he accepts that  Yasir 'Arafat in principle has the right to visit Jerusalem, but  he objects to such a visit because of 'Arafat's role and for  fear that it might cause unnecessary friction between Jews and  Arabs. The mayor of Jerusalem believes that 'Arafat would not  be coming to pray, but to make declarations. Our correspondent  Aviv Bushinsky reports that Olmert made these remarks in a  special meeting with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. Mr. Rabin  summoned the meeting following complaints about a lack of  communication between him and the mayor. The two men agreed to  go on meeting in the future to promote various issues, including  the development of the city.    In a meeting of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense  Committee earlier today, Rabin said that the government was  looking for every possible way to expand the Jewish population  of Jerusalem. However, Rabin noted, it is difficult to locate  land and the government is awaiting the High Court of Justice  ruling on the issue.    Meanwhile, Jerusalem Municipality sources told our  correspondent that they have been holding legal deliberations  with regard to illegally built houses in East Jerusalem and  their possible demolition. The sources noted that two such  houses in East Jerusalem, over which legal proceedings were  completed, were demolished in the last two days.</p>

			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / The Week Ahead RESULTS DUE BET, the business services conglomerate, is likely to report pre-tax profits sharply down today at about Pounds 110m after an extremely tough year in joinery, personnel and plant hire. The market is expecting a halved full year dividend of about 6.25p, just covered by earnings. It is likely to be surprised by exceptional charges that could be as much as double the level analysts had been expecting. The results season for the electricity utilities begins in earnest with three of the regional supply companies and one generator set to report substantially increased profits. Today, analysts expect East Midlands Electricity to announce a historic cost pre-tax profit of around Pounds 145m, up 37 per cent. Norweb, expected to show the biggest rise in profits of the 12 regional companies, reports tomorrow. Its profit is expected to more than double to Pounds 128m. On the same day, National Power, the largest privatised generator, should announce a profit of around Pounds 510m, from Pounds 434m last year. On Thursday, Manweb's profit is expected to increase by around 75 per cent to Pounds 95m. As the reporting season for the privatised water and sewage companies trundles on, Severn Trent is the only company to announce this week, and is expected to reveal on Thursday a 6 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 263m for the year to 31 March. Although profits from water and sewage are expected to be well ahead, attention will focus on Biffa, the waste management company acquired last year from BET for Pounds 212m. Hazlewood Foods, the Derby-based food manufacturer, is expected to reveal flat profits of between Pounds 50m-Pounds 52m for the year to March 31 in its results tomorrow. This is despite the Pounds 34.7m agreed offer for its rival Sutherland at the end of July. The group had a tough second half - hit by pricing pressure from the multiples and Dutch problems. Cable and Wireless, the UK-based international telecommunications group, is expected to announce on Wednesday that pre-tax profits for the year end to March increased from Pounds 609m to Pounds 640. But a higher tax charge is likely to be primarily responsible for a fall in earnings per share to around 29.8p from 31.3p the previous year.

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Country is exhorted to 'set its sights high again' In an optimistic assessment of the long-term prospects for the economy Mr John Major told the Conservative conference yesterday that the British people had the opportunity to double their standard of living in the next 25 years. He won a 5 1/2 -minute ovation for a wide-ranging speech in which he promised to hold to Conservative principles in facing the challenge from Mr Tony Blair's new model Labour party. Mr Major reaffirmed his determination to oppose federalist developments in the European Union and to ensure that any political settlement in Northern Ireland was acceptable to the people of the province. The economy The prime minister said that the progress already made in achieving sustainable growth coupled with low inflation provided the opportunity for the country to 'set its sights high again'. Recalling the target set by Mr RA Butler when he was Conservative chancellor in 1954, he said: 'With the right determination, with the right policies, we have the chance once again to double our living standards in the next 25 years.' Mr Major reinforced the earlier warning by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, that prudence must govern the timing of tax cuts and insisted that there must be no return to the 'boom-and-bust cycle' of earlier years. For this reason it was sometimes necessary to be a 'bit puritanical'. European Union Looking forward to the inter-governmental conference in 1996 Mr Major pledged that if he was not satisfied he would 'just say no' to changes which would harm Britain. But he hoped to secure an acceptable agreement because that would be in the best interests of Britain. In the wider context of foreign affairs he cited the speed with which the latest crisis in the Middle East had blown up, and said: 'Isolationism is a luxury Britain simply cannot afford.' Northern Ireland Mr Major said he would take his 'own time' in responding to the decision by the loyalist paramilitaries to maintain a ceasefire for as long as that declared by the IRA. While other people called for speed he had to ask the 'hard questions'. Mr Major said: 'For as long as is necessary, as many policemen and troops as are necessary will stay on duty in Northern Ireland to protect all the people of Northern Ireland.' Nursery education Proposals would be 'worked up' by Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, to provide places for all four-year-olds whose parents wished to take them up. Health Denying that the government intended to privatise the National Health Service, Mr Major said that the security of mind it provided would not be taken away 'while I live and breathe'. Crime While rejecting criticism of Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, the prime minister acknowledged the need for a more stringent regime in prisons. Prisons should be decent and Spartan and their role was to 'punish and not pamper'. Mr Major said the home secretary was in agreement with him that where this was not the case it would have to change. Details are to be announced next week of the most comprehensive campaign against drug dealers and traffickers yet launched in Britain. Labour's tax targets Stressing the difference between Labour and the Conservatives on personal taxation, Mr Major said: 'People who have earned well, people who have saved, people who have inherited the fruits of a parent's lifetime work are not the 'undeserving rich'.'</p>

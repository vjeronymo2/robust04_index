			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Wellcome puts its trust in a software remedy - The corporate plans to combat complications surrounding the Pounds 3bn global share offer AT 8.30 this morning the international tender offer of 330m or so shares in Wellcome Trust will begin. By the time the offer closes at 5pm on July 24 the success or failure of the largest non-privatisation share sale ever seen will be known. Over the following weekend a price will be set according to the level of demand and the trust will decide exactly how many shares to sell and allocations will be made. From a low, black leather and chrome sofa, Mr Roger Gibbs, chairman of the Wellcome Trust, will be able to watch the progress of the Pounds 3bn global sale of about half the charity's shares in the drugs group. The sofa has been installed in a small, dark room on the third floor of Robert Fleming's offices in the City of London. The rest of the room is bursting with computer screens and banks of files, and an illuminated map of the world has been fixed to one wall. Should Mr Gibbs find all this too oppressive, a fridge full of cooling drinks has been brought in. Fleming has thoughtfully provided a bowl full of variously-shaped wooden blocks for Mr Gibbs to manipulate in moments of tension. The room has been built to handle the first global book-building exercise of the size of the Wellcome sale. Mr Ian Hannam, who is heading the book-building team, has designed entirely new software to drive the computers which will not only record and update bids entered by potential investors, but which will also help allocate the shares. He is coy about how much Fleming has spent on the system - if only because he has already received offers from American banks keen to buy it from him. Fleming has organised the sale into nine regional syndicates - two for the UK, institutional and retail, the US, Japan, France, Germany, Switzerland, Pacific Rim and Rest of the World. Mr Hannam says that Fleming itself is in every syndicate, so that there are no surprises for him. Institutions interested in buying the shares must put in a bid to their local syndicate. The bids are 'good till cancelled' but can be changed up to the last day of the tender period. Bids put in will name the buyer - if the order is for over Pounds 100,000 worth - the amount they want to buy, and a price they are prepared to pay. The price can be on one of three bases, the strike price - accepting the price set by the tender - a fixed price in pence, or a price set in terms of the existing market price of Wellcome's shares. By the end of the tender period any market price bids will have to be converted into either fixed price or strike price bids. Buyers will be categorised not only by size and price of the offer but also by the quality of the bid and the bidder. This is perhaps the most controversial aspect of the way the sale is being handled. But Mr Hannam believes that bidders who are helpful to the sale should be rewarded. For example, bidders who put in a tender early have a better chance of getting shares. Although every successful bidder will eventually pay the same strike price, a bidder which has been more aggressive on price will be treated more favourably. And bidders will be categorised as types of investor ranging from 'existing shareholder' through 'flagship investor' to 'good', 'moderate' and 'other'. Existing shareholders will get priority. Bidders can buy shares during the tender period to join the ranks of existing holders, so long as they can prove they have bought shares. In the 'other' category will be placed bidders who are not regarded as likely long-term holders of the shares, or any which play around - for example by selling shares in advance in an attempt to push down the Wellcome price and then buy cheaper in the tender. All bids will be timed, and bidders will keep their place in the queue so long as the bid is maintained or increased. But says Mr Hannam, the system is designed to identify anyone who decreases a bid. Such a bid would go to the bottom of the queue again. The idea is to encourage people who are conservative at the start but become more aggressive during the period - the ideal for building a book. Mr Hannam also says that Fleming is only concerned with getting the best deal for the trust. Unlike some UK houses it is not worried about repeat business - it will not 'look after its friends'. Mr Hannam says: 'If he comes in late he can be the Prudential and he will not get any'. At the end of each working day the regional syndicate computers will upload that days bids to the central Fleming computer. And every morning at 11.30 Mr Hannam will head a meeting to discuss how the book building is going. Mr Hannam can sit and play with the computer allocation model as the book begins to build. The computer can draw a demand curve, showing how much interest there is at each price so that Fleming can decide where to set the price to achieve the best balance between the number of shares sold and price maximise the money raised. But the computer can go much further than that. It can also work out how to allocate shares between different bidders on the various criteria of earliness, aggressiveness and quality. For instance, a top quality bidder could be rewarded with 100 per cent of the stock he has put in for, while bids from 'others' could be cut to a low percentage or excluded all together. Fleming can override the computer, for example to look after UK retail investors. Once the allocations have been set the computer will print them all out on a regional basis. It is a far cry from old-fashioned placings, where a stockbroker's sales team with a list of clients would sell substantial chunks of shares in a morning. But a deal the size of Wellcome cannot use such simple methods, when as Fleming can say, 'we have the technology'.</p>

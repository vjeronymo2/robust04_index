			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed KV: "GATT Agreement Will Not Lower Consumer </F> Prices -- European Consumers Unions Lament `Missed  Opportunities'"]    [Text] The European Consumers Unions (BEUC) consider that  the GATT agreement being signed today in Marrakesh represents a  missed opportunity. The agreement will barely affect consumer  prices, it claims. According to the BEUC, the future World  Trade Organization (WTO) will have urgent work to do regarding  international rules on competition and the environment.    At a press conference, BEUC President Jim Murray pointed out  that his organization has always been in favor of the GATT  agreement. "However, some parts of the agreement are not as good  as we would have liked," he said. Indeed, he believes that the  GATT agreement does not go far enough, especially in the  agricultural and textile sectors.    Consumers will also continue to pay too much for their food  when the agreement has taken effect. After all, the price  reductions in which the agreement will result will go no further  than the reductions already generated by the reform of the EU's  common agricultural policy. In addition, the BEUC claim that  subsidized exports of agricultural produce will continue,  despite all the damaging consequences this will have for world  trade. The BEUC fear that taxes may go up if the pressure on  the EU agricultural budget is maintained.    Moreover, the GATT provisions regarding clothing and  textiles  do not meet expectations, according to the BEUC. The Multifiber  Arrangement that offers the industrialized nations the  possibility of imposing quotas on imports of specific textile  products from developing countries, must be abolished within the  next 10 years. The BEUC maintain that this will result in trade  in sensitive textile products only being liberalized after that  period has elapsed. Consequently, 50 percent of the textile  trade will continue to be subject to restrictions until 2005.    The Consumers' Unions fear that the product standards  elaborated in the GATT agreement will lead to less stringent  standards being implemented in many countries. The BEUC also  assert that the developing countries are receiving precious  little in exchange for the agreement on intellectual property.  The agreement on services will, the BEUC claim, barely have any  repercussions for consumers. The BEUC are satisfied that the WTO  is being set up. However, the WTO will have to do everything  within its power to ensure that environmental and trade-related  concerns are integrated better. International agreements on the  environment must be able to compare with GATT rules, the BEUC  say. At the same time, the WTO will have to ensure that there  is greater transparency in decisionmaking procedures.    However, clear rules for international competition are also  required. The WTO will have to draw these up and implement  them. In this context, the BEUC are thinking of, say, an  international approach to dealing with export cartels.</p>

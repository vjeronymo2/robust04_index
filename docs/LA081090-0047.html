			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: STAGE / NANCY CHURNIN: GASLAMP ANNOUNCES PLANS TO RESUME  ITS 1990 SEASON  </P> <P> The Gaslamp Quarter Theatre Company is about$31,000 away from resuming -- and  concluding -- its 1990 season in November at the Hahn Cosmopolitan Theatre,  with the long-planned San Diego premiere of Terrence McNally's off-Broadway  hit, "Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune."  </P> <P> That was the figure given this week by the Gaslamp's managing director, Kit  Goldman, and its board of trustees president, George Saadeh.  </P> <P> Even earlier, in mid-October, the company intends to resume the 1990 season at  its second, smaller space, the Elizabeth North Theatre, as a co-producer of the  Ensemble Arts Theatre production of "Dusk to Dawn at the Sunset" by Terry Dodd.  </P> <P> The Gaslamp, which is in its 10th season, suspended operations in May when a  long-accumulated financial deficit reached a critical state. During the  intervening months, the organization has rented out both its venues, providing  revenues that, along with fund raising, have replenished the theater company's  coffers sufficiently to schedule the reopenings, Saadeh said.  </P> <P> The Gaslamp has also been helped by a reduced rental fee negotiated with the  limited partners that own the Hahn. Until this summer, the Gaslamp paid a  back-breaking $10,146 a month for the 250-seat facility; it now pays half that.  </P> <P> It is unclear, however, whether resuming the season at the smaller venue will  influence the outcome of a dispute with former patron Elizabeth North, who  pledged $75,000 in exchange for the Gaslamp naming the theater after her. When  operations were suspended last spring, North withheld the final $35,000  installment of her pledge, saying she would not donate the money until the  theater resumed operations.  </P> <P> The theater is also studying a restructuring plan written by Harris Goldman (no  relation to Kit), a consultant who was the former executive producer at  Starlight Musical Theatre. He would not comment on the plan except to say that  he is "very optimistic in terms of the Gaslamp's future."  </P> <P> "We have most of the money in hand," Saadeh said, referring to what is needed  for the two upcoming productions. "But we like to do everything very cautiously  now. The bottom line is that the theater has to run like a business. It may not  come back like a boomerang. It is going to come out slowly but wisely."  </P> <P> The lion's share of the money needed for the 1991 season -- a figure no one is  willing to name -- still needs to be raised, but Kit Goldman and Saadeh hope  the fund raising will be easier when the theater is producing.  </P> <P> "We're in a chicken-and-egg situation," Goldman said. "Two of the things major  funders want to see is that we can do quality work and sell tickets."  </P> <P> Consequently, investors are likely to be looking closely at the Gaslamp's  choices. The theater has acquired a reputation for bland, monochromatic period  pieces during the past few years. Although its plays invariably have been  skillfully done, they failed to bring in ample audiences, dropping to about 50%  at the Hahn last season.  </P> <P> While Goldman said she is not sure whether she will be changing her title, she  is, however, changing her job. The board of trustees is interviewing managing  director candidates to handle the business matters that used to be Goldman's  responsibility. And Goldman, who this spring fired her original artistic  director and co-founder, Will Simpson, will continue to make artistic choices.  </P> <P> Both Saadeh and Goldman said the Ensemble Arts Theatre production of "Dusk to  Dawn at the Sunset" is the sort of production they hope to be known for in the  future.  </P> <P> "It's a slice of life from the Southwest, exploring the relationships between  families," Saadeh said. "It fits in well with what we want to offer our  subscribers." Ensemble Arts Theatre is now touring "Dusk to Dawn at the Sunset"  at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in Scotland.  </P> <P> Goldman said that, more than a change in content, the significance of "Dusk to  Dawn at the Sunset" may be that it is a new show and a cooperative venture with  another company. She predicted more co-productions of new works at the  Elizabeth North and less at the Hahn. And, with the possible exception of  "Tales From Tinseltown," a new musical under consideration for the Hahn in  1991, most of the work there will already have a track record even if it is new  to San Diego.  </P> <P> Along with "Tales From Tinseltown," proposed to the Gaslamp by New York  producers Celso Gonzalez-Falla and his wife, Sondra Gilman, other shows under  consideration are "Oil City Symphony," canceled last season, and "The  Debutante," a black Pygmalion story set in turn-of-the-century Philadelphia and  commissioned by Goldman for her own independent production company.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the fund raising and rentals continue. The Gaslamp's next celebrity  staged reading stars Harold Gould at the Hahn Cosmopolitan on Sept. 24.  Upcoming rentals at the Hahn include the new musical "I Wanna-Be," Aug.  17-Sept. 9, and the Oct. 11-Nov. 4 run of "Family Secrets," a one-woman show  starring Sheri Glaser and directed by Robyn Samuels. At the Elizabeth North,  rentals include the San Diego Actors Theatre, which will produce  "Eleeomosynary" beginning tonight, and "Party Favors," a new play by local  playwright Mark Melden, opening in September.  </P></p>

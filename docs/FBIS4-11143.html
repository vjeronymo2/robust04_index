			<p>BFN     [Text] After meeting with Planning Minister Beni Veras and  Mines and Energy Minister Alexis Stepanenko on 18 April,  National Privatization Program Director Andre Franco Montoro  Filho reported that the privatization of electricity industry  companies will not be made during President Itamar Franco's  administration.    According to Montoro Filho, the process' complexity made the  privatization commission and Ministers Veras and Stepanenko  decide to divide the sector into three areas -- electricity  generation, transmission, and distribution -- under the  coordination of one self-financed public company. The government  concluded that by simply selling the electricity industry  companies, it could leave regions that have no commercial appeal  without electricity.</p>

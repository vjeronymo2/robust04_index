			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(popi)": "They Have Concluded a Contract To </F> Reconstruct the V-1 Blocks"]    [Text] Bratislava--The tender process for a contract to  supply the project to gradually reconstruct the Jaslovske  Bohunice V-1 power plant--that is, its first two blocks with  their V-230-type reactors--was completed recently at the nuclear  power plant.    Engineer J. Sidor, press secretary of the Slovak Energy  Enterprise (SEP), has told us that the enterprise has concluded  a contract in this connection with the German Siemens company.  In it, it respects the conclusions reached by the recent  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) mission and also the  decision made by the Slovak Republic Nuclear Inspection Office  on the criteria for increasing nuclear safety for these blocks.  An undertaking by the supplier to ensure that the costs of the  reconstruction do not exceed 5 billion korunas forms part of the  contract. The completion deadline is 1997. The reconstruction  will take place in tandem with the block's operation. The SEP  official added that, despite the fact that the V-1 should cease  operating in the year 2000 (under the condition that the first  and second blocks of the Mochovce nuclear power plant are  operating reliably), it is worth investing in the reconstruction.</p>

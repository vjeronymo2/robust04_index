			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Construction Contracts: Access to Glasgow Airport BALFOUR BEATTY has been awarded by The Scottish Office what is believed to be the largest design and build road construction project in Britain. Valued at Pounds 28m the St James Interchange improvement is designed to relieve traffic congestion at the bottleneck to the west of Glasgow Airport. The award followed several months of intense tendering by Balfour Beatty's Edinburgh office, working closely with its designers Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick &amp; Partners, based in Glasgow. During the tendering period, Royal Fine Arts Commission approval had to be obtained by the contractor. The St James Interchange improvement will involve the construction of two flyovers linking the A740 with the M8, each almost 800 metres long and consisting of a total of 14,000 cu metres of reinforced concrete and 4,000 tonnes of structural steel. Associated works include a railway bridge, extensive piling and six adjoining slip roads which will involve complex traffic management. Also included are extensive areas of settlement embankments, vertical drains and various other ground treatment measures, together with motorway lighting and traffic control systems. Balfour Beatty aims to have the interchange open within 98 weeks of the start of construction. Balfour Beatty is also working for The Scottish Office within the Strathclyde region on the construction of a major section of the new M74 motorway between Millbank and Abington.</p>

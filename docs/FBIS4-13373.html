			<p>BFN     [Text] Turkey has turned down a political asylum  application from General Dostam, head of the militia. This  point has been disclosed in a report of the MUJAHED newspaper,  Jami'at-e Eslami's [Islamic Society of Afghanistan's]  publication organ, in its recent issue. The report says that  after consecutive defeats in Kabul and in northern areas of  Afghanistan, General Dostam asked for political asylum in  Turkey, which turned it down. The report adds that he has  bought a house in Germany in preparation for an escape. A  Bakhtar Information Agency political commentator in this respect  writes: General Dostam attempted a coup d'etat on 11th Jadi [1  January] at the instigation of foreign countries and in  cooperation with Golboddin Hekmatyar. He now seeks ways of  escaping. The report says Dostam and Golboddin believed at the  outset they would do away with the islamic state in two hours.  But four months later the putschists increasingly receive  crushing blows.</p>

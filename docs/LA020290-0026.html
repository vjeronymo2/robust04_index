			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FISHING NOTES;  </P> <P> GIANT BLACK SEA BASS BACK ON THE LOCAL SCENE  </P> <P> Hopes for black sea bass are rebounding.  </P> <P> Juvenile giant black sea bass are making appearances again.  </P> <P> The fish were in danger of extinction until the state Department of Fish and  Game put them on the prohibited keeper list in 1982.  </P> <P> Not a day passes but that someone on a party boat catches a bass and releases  it.  </P> <P> When these fish come to the surface in a bloated condition and are unable to  submerge, there is a safe method to deflate them. The fish suffer from bloating  of the gas bladder. Fish and Game personnel have deflated bloated rockfish  successfully during tag and release programs.  </P> <P> Anglers on private boats who hook black sea bass can penetrate the skin just  behind the pectoral fin with a thin blade. The gas will be removed and the fish  can submerge unharmed.  </P> <P> These fish can grow to 500 pounds and live 70 years if they can evade a hook.  </P> <P> There could be a full return to fishing these giants if the small ones are  returned to sea.  </P> <P> Paul Gregory of Fish and Game said fishermen should remember the survival of  the sea bass or any undersized fish is an important factor to the fishing of  the future.  </P> <P> The King Harbor Marlin Club held its 16th annual awards banquet Saturday night.  A club record was set in 1989 when club anglers caught 40 marlin, releasing and  tagging 28.  </P> <P> Trophy winners were Jerry Austin for largest marlin, Ray Hawkes for first  albacore and Stan Austin for junior-member award.  </P> <P> A special award went to Syd Whitaker for catching a 6-pound, 4-ounce halibut  using two-pound test line.  </P> <P> Gary Klein, 31, the 1989 bass angler of the year, has won $300,000 fishing for  bass.  </P> <P> Klein, from Montgomery, Tex., has been called the "Fishing Professor" because  of his analytical approach to the sport.  </P> <P> While most anglers have a special technique -- spinner baits, flippin, etc. --  Klein has adapted a number of techniques into his game plan. He has gained a  reputation as a proponent of flippin. He has proven he can catch bass on deep,  clear lakes as well using plastic worms and grubs as part of his arsenal.  </P> <P> He has been a "bassmaster" finalist seven times.  </P> <P> Klein will be sharing techniques with participants in a bass institute at El  Camino College on Saturday and Sunday.

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / International Company News: Promotion and research hold down net at Intel INTEL, the leading US semiconductor manufacturer, yesterday reported an 8 per cent drop in second-quarter net income as heavy marketing and investment programmes ate into record revenues. The company, which is facing increasing competition from chip 'cloners' such as Advanced Micro Devices, has been spending heavily on advertising to set itself apart from the crowd on a new generation of chips. Intel reported net income of Dollars 213m, or Dollars 1 a share, compared with Dollars 231m, or Dollars 1.10, in the second quarter of last year. Revenues rose 5 per cent from Dollars 1.25bn to Dollars 1.32bn. The figures were broadly in line with market expectations. For the first quarter of this year, Intel produced net income of Dollars 184m, or 86 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 1.24bn. It said business conditions were strongest in the US and Europe. Japan and the Asia-Pacific region, which had been relatively sluggish in recent quarters, improved from first-quarter levels. It said its overall microprocessor business was 'quite strong' in the second quarter, particularly in its newer products. Revenues from the company's older 'first wave' 386 DX and SX chips continued to decline as a result of the personal computer market's switch to more powerful 'second wave' systems. Revenues of standard semiconductor products and system-level products exceeded expectations for the quarter. The book-to-bill ratio for the period exceeded 1.0.</p>

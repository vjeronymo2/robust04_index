			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By AZERTAC correspondent Alla Baula for TASS] </F>   [Text] Baku May 24 TASS -- "Azerbaijan intends to look into  the problem of expanding cooperation with foreign companies in  the development of oil," said Azeri President Heydar Aliyev  during a meeting with the British Energy Minister Timothy Eggar  who arrived in Baku in connection with an international  exhibition devoted to oil and gas extraction on the Caspian Sea,  which opens here on May 24.    Aliyev expressed satisfaction over the fact that agreements  on cooperation between the two countries reached during his  recent visit to Great Britain, and in particular, in the field  of electric power engineering, were further developed. Aliyev  said that such cooperation has good prospects, taking into  account Azerbaijan's huge energy potential.    Aliyev said that another round of talks on the development  of  the "Azeri" and "Chyrag" deposits jointly with foreign partners  had been successfully completed in Istanbul on May 20, which  brought nearer a possibility of signing contracts.    For his part, the British minister said that London realises  the advantages of cooperation with Azerbaijan not only in the  sphere of oil and gas development, but in other fields,  including in telecommunications and metal industry.    On May 24, Aliyev and Eggar will take part in the opening  ceremony of an international exhibition organised by British oil  companies and the Azeri Chamber of Commerce and Industry. On  display there will be exhibits made by 160 foreign companies  specialising in the production of equipment for extracting oil  at sea.</p>

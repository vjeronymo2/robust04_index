			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Guest commentary by Rauno Sairinen: ``Finland's Forestry </F> Strategy Faulty'']    [Text] The German magazine, DER SPIEGEL, has initiated a  discussion on Finnish forestry. The Finnish representative in  Greenpeace, who was interviewed as a result of the article,  criticized our forest products industry with some very frank  words. Defenders of our forest products industry were irritated.    The reaction indicates that at least the level of our  discussion on environmental issues has not kept pace with  Central European standards. We accept Greenpeace's highly  visible campaigns against Norwegian whaling and Russian dumping  of nuclear wastes in the sea. But when our own methods of  dealing with our forests were critically focused on, our  attitude changed. The esteemed environmental organization  instantly became the irresponsible destroyer of Finland's forest  products.    One article in a large circulation periodical and hysteria  takes over in the country's industry. What's going on here?  Researcher Ilmo Massa wrote in the opinion page of the HELSINGIN  SANOMAT that the Central European environmental criticism has  the marks of the environmental imperialism practiced by the  prosperous industrial nations.    It is true that Greenpeace is not always interested in  conditions dictated by local economies. It would, however, be  overly simplistic to equate the DER SPIEGEL article with the  publicity on the Amazon rain forest. There is a difference in  scale between these issues. The environmental movements of  industrial countries have not systematically attacked Finland's  forest products industry. Further, Finland is itself an  industrialized country, and it is good that the environmental  criticism hits us once in a while, instead of always the  impoverished countries.    The DER SPIEGEL discussion reveals the frailty of Finnish  industrial and forestry strategy. The arguments of the forest  products industry are characterized primarily by a  self-enveloping defensiveness. The situation is not analyzed  self-critically but the reaction is like that of an offended  little boy.    For a long time the possibility of making conservation of  the  environment the trump card in Finnish competition with others  has been a topic of discussion. The government's Forest Service  has, however, retreated only in tiny steps on northern  environmental disputes. The state has not consented to  significant cuts in production objectives of the Forest Service.  The silvicultural practices have been modernized slowly and the  forest products industry has not accelerated the process, but  has retarded it. The results of the failed strategy are evident  from the DER SPIEGEL publicity.    The forestry doctrine serves one lord, the paper and  cellulose industry. The mechanized forest industry of ours that  proliferated in earlier years has faded away. This kind of  condition has long been accepted as being for the common good.    Now this common good and acceptance is becoming fragmented.  It appears that, in the long term, the forest products industry  will not be able to even maintain its image advantage. The  ecology of the forest has undergone drastic changes even though  the forest has long meant many things in Finnish minds. It  serves more than the cellulose boilers. There is more out there  than rows of seedlings of one tree species and hard-to-traverse  ploughing scars.    Hunting, berry picking, fishing, orienteering, capturing  pictures of nature, hiking in familiar and unfamiliar forests  are all important things. The forest is also utilized by  tourism, sawmills, the furniture manufacturers, artistic  handicrafts, food products industry etc. New forest products  could be developed, but sufficient variety of tree and plant  species can no longer be found.    There has been much positive progress in our forest  management practices. But the clamor over the DER SPIEGEL  article shows that our forest management discussion is plagued  by a reality-ignoring polarization. As long as the  confrontational attitudes between the forest products industry  and environmental movement, as well as between employment  concerns and ecological priorities remain, the discussion will  be stuck on a naive level.    Finland needs defending of multiple use of the forest.  Should  yet one more group interested in the forest be organized in  Finland, a group that would be based on local enterprises and  know-how, as well as cultural priorities that consider the  forest valuable?

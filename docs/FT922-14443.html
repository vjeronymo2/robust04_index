			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / World Trade News: GKN establishes foothold in Asean markets GKN, the UK-headquartered components and industrial services group, is establishing a foothold in the fledgling motor industry of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean), seen as one of the world's main growth areas for cars and trucks. It is doing so through a joint venture in Malaysia, from which it expects to supply constant velocity driveshafts - an essential component of all front wheel drive cars - to vehicle assemblers throughout the regional grouping. Asean comprises Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Brunei. The venture is small in financial terms, but is seen by GKN as an important strategic move. It forms part of a matrix of joint ventures set up by GKN within the past few years, and which are now contributing nearly Pounds 50m to its annual turnover. They include ventures in eastern Europe, regarded by GKN as the world's other main region offering the best prospects for medium-term growth. GKN's Malaysian partners are Permodalan Nasional Perhad (PNB), a Malaysian government investment fund, and AAE-Holdings, a Penang-based development company. The venture is to be known as Asian Driveshaft and initially, GKN will own 50 per cent, PNB 37.5 and AAE the remainder. However GKN, which is investing up to Pounds 2m in the company, eventually is to reduce its own holding to 40 per cent with the expected participation of other, non-Malaysian Asean shareholders. The plant is to begin production in mid-1993. With the venture, GKN stands to benefit from Malaysian government legislation requiring the country's current 10 assembly plants, producing a total of 18 different makes of vehicle, to raise the value of locally made components Initially, 'local' content must comprise 30 per cent of the completely knock-down (CKD) value of the imported kit of parts from which most vehicles are assembled. Output is expected to rationalise around Malaysia's own 'national' car project, Proton, making around 100,000 vehicles a year, and a handful of Japanese manufacturers. Honda, Toyota and Nissan, the current market leaders, assemble 7,000-11,000 units each. The Malaysian market, at just under 200,000 units, is the largest in Asean. However, the full market potential for GKN lies in the quasi-free-trade arrangement for motor components being worked out within Asean which would give it access to the five other Asean states,</p>

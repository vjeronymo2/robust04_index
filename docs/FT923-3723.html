			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan rises 1.7% on privatisation hopes MILAN was cheered by signs that the government was finally coming to the market's rescue, while Nordic markets remained under a cloud, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN rose on hopes that, later in the day, the government would announce which state-owned companies would be privatised first. There were also rumours that fiscal measures to boost equities, such as the abolition of the unpopular capital gains tax on share transactions, were under consideration. After the close, ministers leaving yesterday's weekly cabinet meeting indicated that Credito Italiano and Eni's engineering unit, Nuovo Pignone, were the two likely privatisation candidates. The Comit index rose 6.15 or 1.7 per cent to 371.63 in turnover estimated at L150bn after L171.3bn on Tuesday. Shares in Credito Italiano were suspended for excessive gains after they jumped 28 per cent early in the session. They were eventually fixed at L1,390, up L170 or 13.9 per cent. Banca Commerciale Italiana rose L110 or 4.5 per cent to L2,585. The state food group, Sme, was fixed L236 or 6.9 per cent higher at L3,650. STOCKHOLM fell 2.2 per cent to a year's low for the second consecutive session after another big rise in the key lending rate. The central bank raised its marginal lending rate to 75 per cent from 24 per cent to reverse the capital outflow and relieve pressure on the krona due to Finland's currency crisis. The Affarsvarlden General index dropped 15.7 to 712.5 in turnover of SKr430m after SKr456m. Trygg-Hansa, Skandia and Gota requested a temporary suspension of trading in their shares ahead of information on anticipated losses stemming from Svenska Kredit and Gota. Svenska Kredit, controlled by Skandia and Trygg-Hansa, said later that it was suspending payments to creditors. Skandia's free shares closed unchanged at SKr58 after the suspension was lifted. HELSINKI rose another 0.8 per cent after a 5 per cent gain on Tuesday, the Hex index closing 4.6 higher at 473.0. But analysts pointed out that Tuesday's effective devaluation of the markka meant a sizeable loss for foreign investors. After first day of the float, a 4.3 per cent gain for the FT-Actuaries Finland index in local currency terms reversed into a 8.2 per cent drop in dollar terms. FRANKFURT reacted badly to news of a DM17bn draining of money market funds by the Bundesbank in its latest securities repurchase tender. The DAX index closed 19.29, or 1.3 per cent lower at 1,525.26 in turnover down from DM5bn to DM4.2bn. Leading share prices fell further after hours in London. Kaufhof fell DM14 to DM416 on a market newsletter which estimated a particularly big drop in the company's turnover. Klockner-Werke dropped another DM4.60 to DM75, taking its fall this week to DM8 after news of a prospective DM180m loss in its steel division this year. PARIS came off the day's low to close just below the day's high, as the CAC-40 index finished 6.90 down at 1,756.77 in moderate turnover of FFr1.7bn. BSN dropped FFr28 to FFr936 with 117,760 shares traded following its interim results. Although the headline figure was in line with expectations, James Capel said the operating margin fell from 11 per cent to 10.3 per cent and that the rise in earnings came essentially from a fall in net financial costs and in the tax rate. The insurer UAP added FFr13 or 3.5 per cent to FFr390 while L'Air Liquide fell FFr15 to FFr726. Carrefour and Accor were also weaker, losing FFr8 and FFr15 to FFr2,092 and FFr517 respectively. ZURICH got a modicum of balance from easier Swiss money market rates and a firm bond market. But the SMI index still fell 8.4 to 1,779.7 as EMS tensions and weak bourses elsewhere dampened sentiment. BBC Brown Boveri ended SFr70 lower at SFr3,560 as selling pressure on Asea, its Swedish partner, spread to BBC. Ascom bearers fell another SFr80 to SFr1,380 after the telecoms equipment company said that profits could fall this year. BRUSSELS fell back at the close as Delhaize, the most active issue, finished BFr15 lower at BFr1,500 after an intraday high of BFr1,530. The Bel-20 lost 2.61 to 1,066.05 in low turnover of BFr550m. BBL gained BFr80 to BFr3,275 on reports that ING, the Dutch insurer, was about to increase its stake in the bank. BBL is due to release a statement today. AMSTERDAM remained cautious with the CBS Tendency index easing 0.5 to 108.5. Ahold, the supermarket group, put on 80 cents to Fl 73.50 after forecasting strong profits growth by 1997 and a possible US acquisition next year. Grolsch fell Fl 9 or 4.1 per cent to Fl 210 on disappointing second-half earnings forecasts.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - SEP 9                            Hourly changes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Open    10.30am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm    close 1027.21  1026.65  1024.46  1020.61  1022.43  1022.25  1021.59  1021.42                 Day's High  1027.61    Day's Low  1020.07           Sep 8      Sep 7      Sep 4     Sep 3      Sep 2          1029.38    1032.28    1029.27   1031.46    1011.19  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

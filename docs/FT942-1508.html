			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Metallgesellschaft to sell HQ Metallgesellschaft, the heavily indebted German metals, mining and industrial group, has entered negotiations to sell its headquarters site in the centre of Frankfurt. The move follows the sale last week of an 80 per cent stake in its Buderus engineering subsidiary, which raised DM1.2bn. The Frankfurt site could have a market value of DM750m (Dollars 460m), Metallgesellschaft said, but cautioned that not all the proceeds would flow to its coffers as the land is jointly owned with a company controlled by Dresdner Bank. The group said it had entered into negotiations to sell the land as it made no business sense to have administrative offices, a car park and research laboratories on so valuable a site. The planned sale of the land and the disposal of the Buderus stake come against the background of continuing business problems at MG Corp, the group's New York-based trading subsidiary, whose speculative trading in oil derivatives brought Metallgesellschaft to the brink of collapse in January. MG Corp was still a 'machine for losing money', Metallgesellschaft's chairman Mr Kajo Neukirchen warned yesterday in an interview in the employees' magazine. Problems in the US represented the biggest challenge to Metallgesellschaft's recovery plans, he said. MG Corp has become entangled in the affairs of Castle Corporation, a US oil refinery with which MG Corp has entered into a number of what Mr Neukirchen called 'inexplicable' contracts. The contracts oblige MG Corp to supply Castle with crude oil and help it finance the oil purchases. Then MG Corp is obliged to buy back the oil from Castle - 40 per cent owned by MG Corp itself - at above the market price until the year 2000. Mr Neukirchen said he was trying to extricate MG Corp from the contracts but he could not predict when a solution might be found. These contracts have required Metallgesellschaft to set up fresh provisions to cover risks arising from the north American operations. The scale of the provisions has not been disclosed but they are thought to be at least DM1bn. Mr Neukirchen insisted that the sales of land and assets were not a direct result of the north American problems, although earlier in the year the sale of the Buderus holding had been ruled out. Analysts had suggested that the change of heart implied that the Buderus disposal was a 'forced sale'. Metallgesellschaft had total debts of more than DM9bn at the end of March.</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (19): Loving and hating the dead - Present-day attitudes to the Jews TODAY, there are barely 10,000 Jews in Poland. These last remnants of one of the largest and most vibrant Jewish communities in the world, a community which in 1939 numbered 3.5m, are mostly elderly and it will be an extremely difficult task to ensure the survival of Jewish life in Poland for another generation Yet, the impact on Polish life of the consciousness of this community, whose traces can be found everywhere - in buildings, in cultural life and in peoples' memories - is enormous. As in so many other aspects of life, the Poles seem mesmerised by the past and still preoccupied by the issues which dominated it. On the Jewish issue, sharply divided and contradictory opinions can be encountered among Poles, sometimes even in the same individual. On the one hand, there has been, since the late 1970s, a revival of interest in the Polish-Jewish past. Partly this is the result of nostalgia, in the largely mono-ethnic and mono-religious Poland of today (though its homogeneity should not be exaggerated), for the more colourful Poland of the past, with its mixture of religions and nationalities. Partly, too, it is the result of a growing awareness that it is impossible to give a coherent account of Polish history and culture without taking into account the contribution of the national minorities, in particular the Jews. Above all,it is the product of a desire to come to terms with the less attractive features of the Polish past, principally chauvinism and anti-Semitism. This preoccupation, strong among a section of the Polish intelligentsia, was stimulated by the higher sense of self-esteem created by the emergence of Solidarity, which seemed to negate the western stereotype of the Poles as impractical and incompetent dreamers. It was best articulated by the literary critic Jan Blonski, who wrote in a widely discussed article in 1987: 'We did take the Jews into our home, but we made them live in the cellar. When they wanted to come into the drawing-room, our response was, Yes, but only after you cease to be Jews, when you become 'civilised' . . . There were those among the Jews who were ready to adhere to this advice. No sooner did they do this than we, in turn, began talking of an invasion of Jews, of the danger of their infiltration of Polish society. Then we started to put down conditions . . . that we shall accept as Poles only those Jews willing to co-operate in attempts to stem Jewish influence in our society . . . 'Eventually, when we lost our home, and when in its premises the invaders set to murdering Jews, did we show solidarity towards them? How many of us decided it was none of our business? There were also those (and I leave out of account common criminals) who were secretly pleased that Hitler had solved for us 'the Jewish problem'. We would not even welcome and honour the survivors, even if they were embittered, disorientated and perhaps somewhat tiresome. I repeat: instead of haggling and justifying ourselves, we should just consider our own faults and weaknesses. This is the moral revolution that is imperative when considering the Polish-Jewish past. It is only this that can gradually cleanse our desecrated soil.' At the same time, the end of communist rule in Poland has been accompanied by a great increase in the expression of anti-Semitic sentiments. Partly this is the result of the end of censorship. These views were probably always present but now can be uttered openly with impunity. Partly, too, it is the result of the dislocations caused by the difficult transition to a market economy and a plural political system. The temptation to blame present hardships on a 'hidden' Jewish or masonic hand has a long tradition in Poland. The belief that communism in Poland was a Jewish phenomenon and the protracted conflict over the Carmelite convent in Auschwitz concentration camp also fuelled anti-Semitism. The political conflict within the Solidarity camp was a bitter one with many characteristics of a family feud. President Walesa is certainly no anti-Semite. But in his presidential campaign he failed clearly to condemn those of his supporters who attacked the Mazowiecki government as being too subject to Jewish influence. He also described himself as 'a full-blooded Pole with documents going back to his great-grandfathers to prove it'. Before the campaign began he argued that 'persons of Jewish origin should not conceal this', a statement he justified during the campaign on the following grounds: 'Chauvinistic and anti-Semitic views and manifestations . . . appear because the present political set-up lacks clarity. There is confusion . . . as to whose interest the administration represents. The personal configurations and the question of responsibility are unclear . . . The functioning mechanism of the state structure must be made transparent, cliques smashed, and competence - not mafia arrangements - be relied on. Then this suspiciousness (about Jews in government) will disappear.' The conflict between the two sets of views about the Jews' role in Poland is really an argument over the future of the country. Attitudes towards the Jews are a touchstone for more fundamental views. What is at issue is whether the Poland of the future will be inward-looking, prey to conspiracy theories of politics and chauvinist, or pluralistic, western-oriented and tolerant. A number of recent developments give grounds for cautious optimism. The pastoral letter of the Polish bishops of January 20, 1991, was the first unequivocal condemnation by the hierarchy of anti-Semitism. Similarly, President Walesa has gone out of his way to repudiate his own behaviour during the presidential campaign. He has repeatedly attempted to reassure the Jewish world of his hostility to anti-Semitism and has set up a high-level commission to improve Polish-Jewish relations. Speaking to a visiting Jewish delegation shortly after his election, he affirmed: 'Anti-Semitism has been a serious problem here. We need to build a pluralistic society. We must do this and we will do it.' Let us hope he and his compatriots succeed. The author is professor of international history at the London School of Economics</p>

			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Letter: Education in wealth creation Sir, The enthusiasm of business and industry for closer links with education (Management, July 29), is fully endorsed by The Engineering Council which is mobilising a nation-wide army of engineers and technicians to work with secondary schools through the Neighbourhood Engineers initiative. Under this scheme more than 1,600 engineers are currently working with teachers, pupils and parents to deliver the curriculum in more than 6,000 schools. Also, girls are encouraged to consider a career in a technological field through visits to schools by specially equipped buses and trailers, sponsored by industry, through our WISE (Women Into Science and Engineering) campaign. Since the launch in 1984 of this campaign by the council and the Equal Opportunities Commission, the number of women studying engineering in higher education has increased from 7 per cent to more than 15 per cent. Only through closer links with schools, and helping with the curriculum, can industry hope effectively to influence education of its significance to wealth creation and to the economic success of the nation. Denis E Filer, The Engineering Council, 10 Maltravers Street, London WC2R 3ER</p>

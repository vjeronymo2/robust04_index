			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : The Secretary anticipates that some eligible borrowers may have completed qualifying service in previous years that would not be immediately preceding the time in which they apply for this program. In this situation, the Secretary envisions that a borrower would need to indicate the begin and end date of the year of service, as all other eligible borrowers are required to do. Loan forgiveness, if funding is available, would be at the level based on which year the borrower last received forgiveness. For example, a borrower who qualified and received the benefit for the first year of service, but not the second year, who now qualifies for forgiveness for the third year of service would receive the benefit as a second year participant in the forgiveness program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Change <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : The final regulations have been revised to clarify that a borrower must apply each year to obtain loan forgiveness under this demonstration program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.215(h)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : Some commenters asked whether all Federal Stafford loans are eligible for loan forgiveness. They recommended that if all Federal Stafford loans are eligible the Secretary should specify how the holder should apply the forgiveness amounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : The Secretary clarifies that unsubsidized, subsidized and nonsubsidized Federal Stafford loans are eligible for this forgiveness program and that the holder should apply the forgiveness amounts first to the unsubsidized portion, followed by the subsidized and then the nonsubsidized portion of the loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Change <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : The final regulations have been revised in both &sect;682.215(a) and &sect;682.215(h) to incorporate this clarification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : Some commenters are worried that holders and servicers do not link individual loans to the specific academic years when the borrower was in school and will therefore be unable to identify which years constitute the borrower's last two years of undergraduate education or two-year period when the borrower was obtaining a post graduate teaching or additional teaching certificate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : The Secretary believes that holders and servicers are able to track loan amounts for this purpose because numerous existing program requirements already require such tracking. Loans are made based on statutory annual loan limits for applicable undergraduate and post baccalaureate academic levels. This data is available on a loan-by-loan basis for each borrower in lender and guaranty agency systems and should be sufficient for purposes of implementing these provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Change <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.215(h)(5)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : A commenter objected to the provision in the NPRM that states that payments eligible for forgiveness under this program that were already repaid by the borrower will not be refunded. The commenter noted that a prudent borrower may choose not to risk the additional costs of forbearance given the questionable funding for this program and continue to repay the loan, perhaps resulting in paying a loan amount that could have been forgiven but is now not eligible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : The statute does not authorize the refunding of any repayment of a Federal Stafford loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Change <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

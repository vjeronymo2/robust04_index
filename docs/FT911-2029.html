			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Shell in big Gulf of Mexico find SHELL OIL, the US arm of the multinational Royal Dutch/Shell group, announced an important oil discovery yesterday in the Gulf of Mexico which could contain as much as 1bn barrels of oil. The discovery is the biggest made in the US for 20 years, opening up the potential of the Gulf region which the industry believes could become another North Sea. The Mars discovery is at a depth of 3,100 feet which will make it one of the deepest commercially-viable oilfields in the world if the decision is taken to develop it. The only other field of this depth under development is Shell's Auger operation nearby. Shell said that further engineering studies are required before it can estimate the full size of the find, but industry observers believe it to rank among the world's 'giant' finds which contain 1bn barrels of oil or more. The largest oilfield in the UK's sector of the North Sea is the Forties field which is estimated to contain 2.5bn barrels. Oil could come into production at Shell's Mars discovery within five years of starting development, the company said yesterday. British Petroleum has a one-third interest in the Mars field and the company said it was 'potentially the biggest prospect in which the company has participated since the discovery of its major North Sea fields'. Mr John Browne, head of exploration at BP, said the find 'obviously has great significance for the industry because it is the first time an operator has announced a discovery at these depths'. The depth of the water in the Gulf of Mexico - North Sea fields are 600 to 700 feet deep - makes it a more complicated and expensive discovery to develop, requiring the latest oilfield technology. One industry expert estimates that costs could be double those of the North Sea where it costs about Dollars 3.40 to produce a barrel of oil. But tax rates on oil revenue in the US are much lower than those in the UK and the discoveries will be more profitable. The development of deep-sea technology to exploit these oil finds has implications for the so-called 'frontier' area of the North Sea, west of Shetland, where exploration could begin in several years time.</p>

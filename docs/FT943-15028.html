			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Pearson chief warns at delay on multimedia law The government was yesterday accused of squandering the momentum behind a multi-media revolution by delaying legislation for the foreseeable future. Mr Frank Barlow, group managing director of Pearson, the media and entertainment group which owns the Financial Times, warned that a couple of years or more could be lost. Speaking in the context of existing cross-media ownership rules, Mr Barlow said the UK had a chance to lead the world in the media if the government acted quickly and positively. Existing rules prevent newspapers owning more than 20 per cent of broadcasters. If the government did not act 'it could be hard for even the best players in the industry to go forward as they would like to', Mr Barlow told a Media Society lunch in London. The danger was that even before a final set of recommendations had gone to ministers from a committee looking into cross-media ownership rules, the word in Whitehall was there would be no time for legislation. If there was no time in the 1994-95 legislative programme real changes in the 1995-96 parliamentary session could not be guaranteed because an election would then be looming. 'So by squandering the momentum now, the government could be losing a couple of years at least, perhaps more,' Mr Barlow said. He added that he wanted to see the media treated like any other industry in terms of ownership, subject to the normal rules of competition and concentration of ownership. Mr Barlow said he thought the barrier for individual ownership could be set at 25 per cent of the whole market including newspaper sales and revenues and television advertising and subscription revenues. Such a suggestion if implemented would allow a much greater concentration of media power than is permitted under existing legislation.</p>

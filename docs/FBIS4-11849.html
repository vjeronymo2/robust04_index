			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, April 2 (AFP) -- Israel and the PLO are close  to agreeing on the deployment of up to 10,000 Palestinian  policemen in Gaza and Jericho, chief PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'th  said Saturday [2 April].    "An accord on the number of policemen should be concluded  during meetings of the PLO and Israeli security committee" which  begin here on Sunday, Sha'th said.    The talks would also focus on "preparations for the  deployment" of the police and security arrangements for the West  Bank town of Jericho and the Gaza Strip.    "I don't think there is currently a problem on the number of  policemen, which will be around 10,000," Sha'th said after talks  here Saturday with Palestinian officials to prepare for the  deployment.    Under a security accord signed in Cairo Thursday Israel and  the PLO agreed that 160 foreign observers would be deployed in  the mosque massacre town of Hebron, and a first contingent of  Palestinian police would be sent to Gaza.    Sha'th added that the talks on transferring civilian powers  would be held here on Monday, while negotiations on the size of  the Jericho autonomous area would be conducted by PLO chief  Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin.</p>

			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> EXECUTIONS: WHO DIES AND WHY?;  </P> <P> DISCRETIONARY JUDGMENTS AFFECT THE WAY CAPITAL PUNISHMENT LAWS ARE IMPOSED  STATE TO STATE AND COUNTY TO COUNTY. INCONSISTENCIES ABOUND.  </P> <P> In striking down capital punishment laws as unconstitutionally cruel and  unusual 18 years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the statutes were being  arbitrarily and capriciously enforced.  </P> <P> As a practical matter, only one in 100 killers was -- and still is -- being  chosen to die.  </P> <P> For the late Justice Potter Stewart, figuring out which one was about as easy  as predicting who was going to be "struck by lightning."  </P> <P> But the court refused to endorse state laws that would have solved the problem  by rigidly requiring that all killers who acted with premeditation be put to  death. Instead, it backed laws that left room for mercy and provided only vague  guidelines for prosecutors and jurors.  </P> <P> Discretionary moral judgments have remained at the core of the Death Row  selection system and have led to inconsistencies. These inconsistencies have  been viewed by death penalty supporters as inevitable and tolerable, and  compared by opponents to a "cruel lottery" or "crap shoot."  </P> <P> Anecdotes abound of killers in California and elsewhere who have committed  horrible crimes and been sentenced to life imprisonment, while others who have  committed arguably less horrible crimes have been sentenced to die.  </P> <P> Consider, for example, Hillside Strangler Angelo Buono, who was convicted of  kidnaping, torturing and killing nine young women, and given a life sentence.  </P> <P> Then consider Robert Alton Harris, who kidnaped and shot to death two teen-age  boys, and may become the first person executed in California in 23 years. A  federal judge has stayed Harris' execution indefinitely, but the state has  asked the U.S. Supreme Court to allow the execution to go ahead as scheduled on  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Who was worse -- Buono or Harris?  </P> <P> Harris, at one point, raised such a question in an unsuccessful appeal to the  U.S. Supreme Court, asking that it order lower courts to systematically compare  the cases of those who were sentenced to die to the cases of those who were  not.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court declined, declaring in 1984 that "any capital sentencing  scheme may occasionally produce aberrational outcomes. Such inconsistencies are  a far cry from . . . major systemic defects."  </P> <P> The Supreme Court was not unanimous in its decision, however. Justice William  Brennan, a death penalty foe, said the court was "simply deluding itself." He  said the death penalty was being administered in as arbitrary a fashion as  ever.  </P> <P> But some death penalty advocates say "So what?" They argue that it is  irrelevant if some murderers happen to get a break and are spared death.  </P> <P> Brennan said the gravest inequity was racial discrimination.  </P> <P> By the time of Harris' challenge, the court had already struck down the chief  instrument of this kind of discrimination -- laws of some Southern states that  permitted the death penalty for rape and which were overwhelmingly applied to  black men in rapes of white women.  </P> <P> But a report released in February by the General Accounting Office, the  investigative arm of Congress, showed that discrimination persists. The GAO  reviewed 28 academic studies, conducted in different parts of the country from  1972 to 1988, and found "a pattern of evidence indicating racial disparities in  the charging, sentencing and imposition of the death penalty."  </P> <P> Almost all of the studies, the GAO said, found that "those who murdered whites  were . . . more likely to be sentenced to death than those who murdered blacks.  This finding was remarkably consistent . . . across states."  </P> <P> One of the few studies the GAO considered that did not find racial disparities  applied to California and was conducted by RAND Corp. researchers working under  contract to state and county prosecutors. "It may be that California is  somewhat different than other places," said research psychologist Stephen  Klein, one of the RAND study's authors.  </P> <P> Overall, researchers say, there are about 20,000 killings a year in the United  States, about 10,000 convictions and 300 sentences of death. Not all states  have capital punishment.  </P> <P> The death penalty is reserved for certain types of killers -- generally those  who kill on purpose and under "special circumstances," such as for financial  gain, or while lying in wait, or during the course of a robbery, burglary or  rape.  </P> <P> Still, the death penalty could be applied much more often than it is.  </P> <P> In robberies where murders occur, for example, there is often more than one  criminal involved and thus more than one person who may be eligible for the  death penalty. But for a prosecutor, "what's important is that you score one  touchdown" in the form of a death sentence, said Franklin R. Zimring, UC  Berkeley law professor and a capital punishment expert.  </P> <P> Frequently, a race ensues in which the robbers try to be the first to point the  finger at an accomplice and make a deal with the prosecutor to testify in  return for leniency.  </P> <P> Sometimes, Zimring said, it never becomes clear whether the person who got  leniency or the person on trial for his life actually pulled the trigger.  </P> <P> Zimring said 80% of all killings involve acquaintances or intimates, but that  the 20% involving strangers tend to dominate the nation's Death Rows.  </P> <P> He said that characteristic reflects society's greater fears of strangers: "If  a guy gets killed by his wife, we're not worried, because we're not married to  his wife."  </P> <P> In California, as in most of the 37 states that now have the death penalty,  district attorneys have virtually unfettered discretion in deciding whether to  charge a first-degree murder defendant with one of the 19 "special  circumstances" that is almost certain to apply to his case. These special  circumstances would make him eligible for the death penalty or life in prison  without possibility of parole.  </P> <P> However, prosecutors say they are reluctant to overdo it.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Asst. Dist. Atty. Curt Livesay decides who is charged with  special-circumstances offenses. He said his office files murder or manslaughter  charges in about 1,200 killings a year, but most of these are "at the low end  -- friends killing friends or relatives killing each other."  </P> <P> In 13 years, Livesay said, his office has filed only 1,200 special-circumstance  murder cases, pursued only 600 of those, sought the death penalty, as opposed  to life without parole, in 240 of those, and persuaded juries to impose a death  sentence in only 80 cases.  </P> <P> Livesay, who said that his own deliberations are complex, described one simple  rule of thumb: If a 19-year-old with no previous record robs a liquor store,  struggles with the proprietor and kills him, perhaps because the teen-ager's  gun discharged accidentally, it is probably not a death penalty case. On the  other hand, if the 19-year-old robber had an extensive criminal record, had the  proprietor kneel and then shot him in the head, it probably would be a death  penalty case.  </P> <P> Outside of Los Angeles County it is typically the elected district attorney,  rather than one of his assistants, who makes the final decision, and standards  differ widely from county to county, according to California Supreme Court  Justice Allen E. Broussard.  </P> <P> In upholding the death sentence in a Tuolomne County case of a 20-year-old who  shot a fisherman in the back of the head while robbing him, Broussard warned of  a problem. "We have in effect 58 death penalty laws," or one for each county,  he said.  </P> <P> "Under the guidelines established in most of the urban counties, (this) murder  . . . would not have been prosecuted as a capital case," he wrote.  </P> <P> A Death Row inmate from Merced County has based his pending appeal to the  California Supreme Court in part on a survey of scores of arguably more  horrible cases in which murderers were sentenced to life imprisonment.  </P> <P> California is not alone in having difficulty distinguishing which murderers  should get life and which death.  </P> <P> Tommy Morris, a death penalty advocate and member of the Georgia Board of  Pardons and Paroles, spoke of the problem in a 1987 interview with the Atlanta  Constitution. "Any rational, reasonable person," he said, "ought to be able to  take 100 life and 100 death cases and shuffle them, and come back and place  those cases back in the category they originally came from. And I'm saying it  can't be done. . . . When you look at death versus life cases, there's not a  heck of a lot of difference in most of them."  </P> <P> There are even more dramatic inconsistencies between states. The late John  Kaplan, a Stanford University law professor, once observed that John  Spenkellink, the first man to be put to death in Florida since that state  resumed executions in the late 1970s, could have been convicted only of  second-degree murder or voluntary manslaughter had he been tried in California.  </P> <P> "The bottom line point," said New York lawyer Ronald J. Tabak, a death penalty  foe who chairs an American Bar Assn. committee on capital punishment, "is that  your chances of getting selected for the death penalty depends to a large  extent on who the prosecutor is, how close to the election the prosecutor is,  how white or otherwise prominent your victim is, and a variety of other factors  that don't have to do with how terrible you are, or how terrible your crime is,  compared to other crimes."  </P> <P> But Kate Canlis, director of the California Dist. Attys. Assn. said she is  unsympathetic to that point of view.  </P> <P> "I don't believe standards vary greatly," she said. "All of the people who are  tried as capital murderers are the worst of the worst," selected by prosecutors  who "sort of know intuitively . . . who to single out."  </P> <P> "I know the kind of case when I see it," she said, explaining that it generally  involves a defendant with a violent history who deliberately chooses to kill in  an especially "cold and callous" manner.  </P> <P> The fact that prosecutors or juries have decided to show mercy and spare the  lives of others convicted of similar crimes is irrelevant, she said. The  relevant factor, she said, is whether the death penalty is a legally suitable  punishment for any individual crime.  </P></p>

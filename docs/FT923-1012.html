			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Vance and Owen to fly to troublespot PEACE mediators Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen today fly to Banja Luka, seat of the self-proclaimed Serbian Republic of Bosnia, to investigate reports of growing tension and intimidation of Moslems and Croats. The two said they were 'deeply concerned' about reports 'indicating a build-up of tension, bomb incidents, and intimidation with the potential threat of violence and the development of an ethnic cleansing campaign'. They urged both the Bosnian Serbs and the rump Yugoslavia to take immediate steps to reduce tensions in the area. Mr Fred Eckhard, spokesman for the two mediators, said Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, had agreed to join Mr Vance and Lord Owen in Banja Luka. Mr Dobrica Cosic, president of the rump Yugoslavia, had pledged his 'complete co-operation' with the investigation. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees and the International Committee of the Red Cross, both of which have staff in Banja Luka, said yesterday that tension in the town had been rising for some weeks. Mr Fernando del Mundo of the UNHCR said a bomb had exploded at the Banja Luka hotel last Monday and there had been another bomb incident on Tuesday. He had no information on casualties. Many non-Serbs had already left Banja Luka for Croatia, often under duress. Mr Claude Voillat, spokesman for the ICRC, said the town was 'very tense'. The ICRC has a 10-strong delegation in Banja Luka which is trying to negotiate the evacuation of Serb-run camps in the area, including Manjaca and Trnopolje with about 4,000-5,000 prisoners. Aircraft flying out of Banja Luka, the main airbase, have recently been used to bomb the eastern city of Visegrad, the northern town of Brcko, on the Croatian border, and the eastern Bosnian town of Tomislavgrad. When the Yugoslav federal army withdrew from Bosnia in May it left 24 aircraft. Bosnia's Serbs also have 24 helicopters which are used for re-supplying Serb forces. The helicopters can carry anti-tank missiles.</p>

			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IMPORTERS' GROUP LAUNCHES PALM OIL DEFENSE  </P> <P> Importers of palm oil -- one of the so-called tropical oils accused of  contributing to heart disease in America -- launched an expensive  counter-offensive Wednesday urging American food manufacturers and consumers  "not to be intimidated by scare tactics which are not based on scientific  evidence."  </P> <P> The Malaysian Oil Palm Growers Assn., which has suffered a 44% decline in oil  exports to the United States since 1986, said in a full-page advertisement in  the USA Today newspaper that palm oil is a "healthy" and "nutritious" vegetable  oil. The ad said the oil has not been proven to raise blood cholesterol levels  as implied in recent negative campaigns.  </P> <P> The ad is scheduled to run later in the Los Angeles Times, the Wall Street  Journal and the New York Times, said John Phipps, a spokesman for Hill &amp;  Knowlton Inc., the public relations firm coordinating the campaign for the  Malaysians. The initial ads will cost $205,000, Phipps said, but the Malaysians  have established a palm oil promotion fund with about $10 million available  over the next three years to respond to attacks on the oil.  </P> <P> The Malaysian exporters said they are responding to an attack initiated two  years ago by the American Soybean Assn. and a series of high-profile newspaper  ads placed late last year by the American Heart Savers Assn. One of the effects  of the campaign was that major food processors said they would no longer use  tropical oils.  </P> <P> Although tropical oils are cholesterol-free, they are high in saturated fats,  which help to form cholesterol in the blood. High levels of cholesterol in  individuals are a factor in heart disease.  </P> <P> In many cases, tropical oils have been replaced in food formulas with soybean  oil, which is low in saturated fats. However, as used in food formulas, soybean  oil is often hydrogenated -- a process that health experts warn has the effect  of markedly increasing the saturated fatty acid content of the oil, leaving the  consumer not much better off had he consumed the straight saturated fat.  </P> <P> Health experts have expressed concern about the escalating advertising  campaigns because they view them as misleading to the public. They said that  tropical oils are such an insignificant contributor to the total fat in the  American diet (less than 3.5% of the total fat, according to the Food and Drug  Administration) that a total elimination of the oil would have no effect on the  problem of excessive saturated fats in the American diet.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Battle for Market Share  </P> <P> In response to the new Malaysian campaign, the soybean group, which represents  U. S. soybean farmers, hastily convened reporters Wednesday to complain that  the reputation of its members "has been grossly maligned by foreign interests."  Highlighting the "foreign funding" of the palm oil exporters campaign, James  Lee Adams, a Georgia farmer who is president of the soybean association, said  the Malaysian industry "is making a desperate effort to save its U.S. market."  </P> <P> Although the soybean association said its initial campaign was to highlight a  health issue, this controversy has all the markings of a simple battle for  market share. In this case, at issue is who gets what share of a U.S. vegetable  oil market worth more than $1 billion a year. Tropical oils are relatively new  to the U.S. market -- and never gained significant market share -- but as  imports of palm oil in the United States increased rapidly in the early 1980s,  the soybean association seized upon the saturated fat content of tropical oils.  Phipps said the association sent "fat fighter" kits to soybean farmers accusing  tropical oil importers of trying to put American farmers out of business. At  the urging of the association, a letter-writing campaign to legislators and  food manufacturers was begun, Phipps said, complaining that the campaign's  misleading claims contributed to a drop in palm oil imports.  </P> <P> In defending its campaign, the soybean association said Wednesday that it  provided information only to its members and did not go directly to consumers  as the Malaysian campaign has.  </P> <P> Soybean growers also tried to get federal legislation that would require  labeling of tropical oils as saturated fats. But the Food and Drug  Administration, citing the small amount of tropical oils in the American diet,  testified against singling out the oils. Supporters of tropical oils argue that  the more widespread use of hydrogenated soybean oil is more of a contributor to  the saturated fat problem in the United States than tropical oils.  </P> <P> "This is a battle between the soybean manufacturers and the Malaysian  government," said Dr. David Heber, an associate professor of clinical nutrition  at the UCLA School of Medicine. "From a public health standpoint, this is a  tempest in a teapot."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Source of Hidden Fat  </P> <P> Moreover, Heber said, the fuss loses sight of the real issue, which is that  Americans consume too many calories and particularly too many calories from fat  of all kinds. Consumers exposed to these campaigns should keep in mind that the  healthiest choice is to reduce total oil consumption, he said.  </P> <P> "Cooking oils are the No. 1 one source of hidden fat in the American diet. . .  . Increased fat and calories contribute to the risk of heart disease and many  forms of cancer," he said.  </P> <P> Criticisms of tropical oils gained widespread publicity late last year after  the Heart Savers, organized by a wealthy Omaha businessman, sponsored a series  of newspaper ads accusing food manufacturers of "poisoning America" by using  tropical oils in their food formulas. The American Council on Science &amp;  Health denounced the ads as "a disservice to the American consumer." But  several food manufacturers responded swiftly to the ads in announcing that they  would remove tropical oils as well as animal fats such as lard from their  formulas.  </P> <P> Asked Wednesday if its concern was the health of the American public, why it  did not also campaign against lard at the same time it criticized tropical  oils, soybean association officials responded that many of the association  members are livestock producers. "I don't think any organization would work  against its own industry," Adams said.  </P></p>

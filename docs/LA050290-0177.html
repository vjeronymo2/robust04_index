			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ENGEL FACES 2ND COUNT OF SHOPLIFTING BASEBALL CARDS  </P> <P> National League umpire Bob Engel has been formally charged with a second count  of shoplifting packs of baseball cards.  </P> <P> An attorney entered pleas of not guilty for Engel in Bakersfield Municipal  Court Tuesday on both petty theft counts and on one count of commercial  burglary stemming from Engel's arrest on April 21.  </P> <P> After reports of the episode, the manager of Costco Warehouse told police that  Engel tried to conceal 50 packs of baseball cards in his pockets last January.  He was questioned after another customer tipped security officers, but Costco  officials did not report the incident to police at that time.  </P> <P> The incident that led to his arrest involved seven boxes of Score baseball  cards, containing more than 4,000 cards worth $143.98, that were displayed in a  store. Police said that Engel, a resident of Bakersfield, took the cards to a  corner of the store and put them in a brown paper bag he pulled from the  waistband of his pants. A security guard stopped Engel as he left.  </P> <P> Engel, who has been a National League umpire since 1966, was indefinitely  suspended by the league after his arrest, with the explanation that the  suspension would allow him to devote full time to the charges. The league said  the umpire agreed with the action.  </P> <P> Engel has made no public comment since his arrest. His listed telephone has  been disconnected.  </P> <P> The Bakersfield Californian reported that investigative reports filed in  Municipal Court in the current cases state that Engel admitted to police that  he was arrested for investigation of shoplifting videocassette tapes in 1986.  However, the newspaper found no court record of that case and said law  enforcement officials explained that records can be expunged if a misdemeanor  offender completes a diversion program.  </P></p>

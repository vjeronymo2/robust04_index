			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iii) Exception: When all employees required to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitored daily are equipped with supplied-air respirators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operated in the positive-pressure mode, the employer may dispense  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the daily monitoring required by this paragraph. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees performing Class I work using a control method which is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not listed in paragraph (g)(4) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section or using a modification of a listed control method, shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to be monitored daily even if they are equipped with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplied-air respirators. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)(i) Termination of monitoring. If the periodic monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by paragraph (f)(3) of this section reveals that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employee exposures, as indicated by statistically reliable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measurement, are below the permissible exposure limit and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excursion limit the employer may discontinue monitoring for those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees whose exposures are represented by such monitoring. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Additional monitoring. Notwithstanding the provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of paragraph (f) (2) and (3), and (f)(4) of this section, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employer shall institute the exposure monitoring required under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (f)(3) of this section whenever there has been a change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in process, control equipment, personnel or work practices that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may result in new or additional exposures above the permissible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure limit and/or excursion limit or when the employer has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any reason to suspect that a change may result in new or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional exposures above the permissible exposure limit and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excursion limit. Such additional monitoring is required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regardless of whether a ``negative exposure assessment'' was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously produced for a specific job. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Observation of monitoring. (i) The employer shall provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected employees and their designated representatives an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity to observe any monitoring of employee exposure to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asbestos conducted in accordance with this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) When observation of the monitoring of employee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure to asbestos requires entry into an area where the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protective clothing or equipment is required, the observer shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be provided with and be required to use such clothing and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment and shall comply with all other applicable safety and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Methods of compliance_(1) Engineering controls and work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practices for all operations covered by this section. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employer shall use the following engineering controls and work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practices in all operations covered by this section, regardless  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the levels of exposure: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Vacuum cleaners equipped with HEPA filters to collect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all debris and dust containing ACM or PACM; and, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Wet methods, or wetting agents, to control employee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposures during asbestos handling, mixing, removal, cutting,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application, and cleanup, except where employers demonstrate that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the use of wet methods is infeasible due to for example, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> creation of electrical hazards, equipment malfunction, and, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> roofing, slipping hazards; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Prompt clean-up and disposal of wastes and debris  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contaminated with asbestos in leak-tight containers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section above, the employer shall use the following control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods to achieve compliance with the TWA permissible exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit and excursion limit prescribed by paragraph (c) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Local exhaust ventilation equipped with HEPA filter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dust collection systems; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Enclosure or isolation of processes producing asbestos  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dust;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Ventilation of the regulated area to move  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contaminated air away from the breathing zone of employees and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toward a filtration or collection device equipped with a HEPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> filter;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Use of other work practices and engineering controls  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the Assistant Secretary can show to be feasible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Wherever the feasible engineering and work practice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controls described above are not sufficient to reduce employee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure to or below the permissible exposure limit and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excursion limit prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employer shall use them to reduce employee exposure to the lowest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels attainable by these controls and shall supplement them by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the use of respiratory protection that complies with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of paragraph (h) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

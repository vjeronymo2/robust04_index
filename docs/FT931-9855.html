			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Stronger Franco-German links urged FRANCE could consider narrowing the franc's present margin of fluctuation against the D-Mark but only if it got some right to 'co-manage' such a 'D-Mark zone', a French opposition leader said yesterday. Addressing a conference on 'Europe: the Way Ahead', sponsored by the Financial Times and Les Echos, Mr Edmond Alphandery said the joint programme of the UDF-RPR opposition parties, which are ahead in the polls for the March election, was designed to reinforce Europe's integration and its monetary system. 'This will necessitate without doubt a new Franco-German dialogue in the monetary domain,' said Mr Alphandery, a UDF deputy who is tipped as a possible finance minister if the opposition wins in March. Mr Alphandery stressed there was no chance of any new centre-right government devaluing the franc. It would, instead, seek to take monetary policy out of the political arena by speedily introducing legislation to make the Bank of France independent. But the inherent 'instability' of the EMS, conceded by Mr Alphandery, led Mr Peter Sutherland, chairman of the conference and of Allied Irish Banks, to urge an immediate move to monetary union by a smaller number of EC countries rather than waiting for 1997, the earliest date foreseen in the Maastricht treaty. France, Germany, the Benelux countries, Denmark and Ireland, Mr Sutherland said, 'could be ready to go ahead now. So why are we waiting? There is nothing to suggest that conditions in 1997 will be any better than they are now.' Caution about rapid moves to economic and monetary union (Emu) came from Mr David Band, chief executive of Barclays de Zoete Wedd Holdings. The lesson of turbulence on the foreign exchanges was, he said, that 'economic convergence has to precede exchange rate convergence'. He objected that the pursuit of Emu had made the EMS too brittle. Mr Jean-Pascal Beaufret, deputy director of the French Treasury, said that, with Emu, capital markets would converge in the Community. But he suggested this would stop short of the concentration that had taken place in the US, with New York becoming the only major financial marketplace. He said equity markets would remain largely national and he vaunted the merits of Paris. Mr Gilles Menage, president of Electricite de France, said there was effectively a single EC market in electricity already, with his own state-owned utility exporting 13 per cent of its output. He called for Brussels to take a 'less dogmatic' approach in introducing greater competition.</p>

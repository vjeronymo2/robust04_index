			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: Girobank to sell 51% stake GIROBANK, the state-owned bank, has confirmed that 51 per cent of its shares are to be sold through an issue to the public before the end of the year. Terms were not disclosed. The flotation will be the first important privatisation sale in Denmark for several years. A minority stake in TeleDanmark, the monopoly telecommunications group, will be sold within the next year. Girobank was formed in 1991 from the post office giro operation. It ranks as the country's fifth-largest bank with assets at the end of last year of DKr44.7bn (Dollars 6.9bn). The shares to be issued will have a face value of DKr255m. At the average ratio of share prices to net asset value for banks listed in Copenhagen, an issue of DKr255m would yield about DKr800m. As a consequence of its past as the post office giro payments operation, the bank is heavily biased towards transactions business. It has one main advantage over the commercial banks, in that it does not have the large portfolio of bad loans which have troubled the commercial banks over the past two years. Girobank made a pre-tax profit of DKr75m in 1992, making it one of the few banks to be in the black. Its provisions were a modest DKr47m. The four big banks, by contrast, all reported hefty losses, varying from DKr919m at Jyske Bank to DKr4.6bn at Unidanmark, with loss provisions varying from DKr1.2bn to DKr6.2bn.</p>

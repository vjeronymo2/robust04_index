			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 23 (YONHAP) -- The Defense Ministry has  denied as "unfounded" the foreign press report that South Korea  had decided to purchase a large amount of American-made  sophisticated weapons.    A Ministry official said on Friday that there were no talks  at all on the possible purchase of Apache helicopters, Patriot  missiles and other high-tech weapons from the United States  during the recent visit to Seoul by U.S. Defense Secretary  William Perry.    THE WALL STREET JOURNAL of the United States reported that  during Perry's visit to Seoul, South Korea agreed to buy a host  of American-made high-tech weapons.    "Apart from Perry's visit, we had partially modified the  Yulgok arms procurement program in a way that places a more  emphasis on building up our anti-artillery and night-time battle  ability," the official said.</p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / EU jobless total heads for 18m UNEMPLOYMENT in the European Union will continue to rise until mid-1995, with little hope of a rapid or consumer-led recovery, according to the latest economic forecasts by the European Commission published yesterday. More than 18m people are expected to be out of work in the next two years, amid high interest rates, weak output, and only a modest improvement in budget deficits, which are at the highest average level since 1945. Mr Henning Christophersen, economics commissioner, called for an early reduction in interest rates, particularly in Germany. 'It's not the size or the volume which matters, it's the speed,' he said. The Commission's forecast assumes that Germany will continue to lead the way on interest rate cuts, with countries such as France and Belgium sticking to their policy of shadowing the D-Mark in an effort to maintain exchange rate stability. Overall, it expects short-term rates to drop by 2 percentage points to an average 6.4 per cent in 1994. But it warns that inflationary pressures could prove more resistant, particularly in Germany. In this case, 'the assumed monetary easing could occur later and to a lesser extent'. Despite the bleak outlook for jobs and growth, Mr Christophersen said the timetable for European monetary union by 1997 or 1999 was still realistic. He insisted that countries could still meet the tough budget deficit targets set down in the Maastricht treaty. Germany is expected to grow by only 0.5 per cent next year, with all the growth coming from former east Germany, and only by 1.6 per cent in 1995. France, the other economic motor, is likely to stutter along at 1 per cent growth in 1994 and 2.1 per cent in 1995. The UK, which left the exchange rate mechanism in September 1992, is expected to outperform most of the EU, with growth of 2.5 and 2.7 per cent expected in the next two years. Ireland and Denmark also figure strongly, with the Irish expected to be the only European country registering more than 3 per cent growth. The Commission is sticking to its earlier EU growth forecast of 0.4 per cent and 1.3 per cent in 1993 and 1994 respectively. while output is expected to rise by 2.1 per cent in 1995. Unemployment is forecast to rise from 10.6 per cent in 1993 to 11.2 per cent and 11.3 per cent in 1994 and 1995.</p>

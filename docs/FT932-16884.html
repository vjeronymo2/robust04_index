			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Clinton waters down energy tax THE Clinton administration has altered its plans for a new energy tax, bowing to pressure from influential members of Congress for modifications that would ease the tax's impact on their constituents. The revised tax will still be levied in general at a rate of 25.7 cents per million British thermal units, with a surcharge of 34.2 cents per million BTUs on refined petroleum products. But the Treasury's new proposals for the tax would exempt ethanol and methanol, offering a sop to congressmen from agricultural states who have complained that the Clinton budget would hurt farmers more than other groups. It also exempts home heating oil from the surcharge levied on petroleum products, a concession to senators from the New England region, which is a heavy consumer of heating oil. One other exemption would be bunker and jet fuel used in international transportation, a measure that will save money for US airlines, which complain that they are already on the brink of financial catastrophe without an additional cost. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury Secretary, said the administration's aim was that the tax should be 'borne fairly and equitably across the country and that the tax promote conservation as well as increased reliance on domestic energy, not foreign oil.' To achieve this goal, he said, the administration was exploring ways of making sure that companies would be able to pass the cost of the new tax on to the final consumer. Treasury officials said the changes to the structure of the tax should not greatly affect the revenue it will raise, estimated at Dollars 71bn over five years. While the changes will make the tax more palatable to many members of Congress, some supporters of President Bill Clinton's package worry that they represent yet another fissure in the relatively unified front the Democrats have so far managed to present. President Clinton asked Congress, when he presented the plan, to treat it as a whole, and not pick away at individual elements. While the House of Representatives has largely taken him at his word on this, in the Senate several Democrats have whittled away at components of the plan. This week, the president had to give way on proposals to charge market rates for grazing and mining rights on federal land, after opposition from western senators. Mr Clinton is particularly vulnerable in the Senate, where the Republicans are presenting a solid show of hostility to his proposals. They have enough votes at least to hold up consideration of legislation, and need only a handful of Democratic defectors to inflict a defeat on the president. Although the White House was able to win passage earlier this week for a budget resolution containing the broad outlines of Mr Clinton's taxation and spending proposals, it has been unable to prevail against Republican tactics to block the Dollars 16bn stimulus spending package that the president insists is needed to prevent the economic recovery from stalling. Democratic congressional leaders are now threatening to keep Congress in session through the traditional Easter recess in an effort to make the Republicans back down.</p>

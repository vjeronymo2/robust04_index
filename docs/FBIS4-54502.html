			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Answering a question about the  possibility of the creation of a Balkan confederation, president  of the republic of Kosova Dr. Ibrahim Rugova said at today's  news conference that every people should first enjoy freedom and  independence in its own country and then think about a  confederal connection with other peoples and countries according  to reciprocal interests. At this news conference, president  Rugova presented the very grave situation in Kosova, due to the  continuous violence and repression of Serbia against the  Albanians. For more details, Mehmet Haziri reports from  Prishtina:    [Haziri] At today's meeting with reporters, president Rugova  expressed his concern over the intensification of the Serbian  repression against the Albanian population in Kosova, which was  manifested during this week with raids on the pretext of  searching for arms, maltreatments, violent recruitment of  Albanian youngsters into the Serbian Army, raids on private  firms, and convictions of Albanians in trumped-up trials.    The Serbian army and paramilitary forces are being more and  more incorporated into this wave of police repression.    President Rugova condemned the application of violent  measures of the installed Serbian power in the Dodona Children  and Youth Theater in Prishtina, which has been developing an  intensive cultural and artistic activity for a long time.    President Rugova said that the intensification of the  Serbian  violence and state terror aims at threatening and provoking the  Albanian population. He also greeted the statement of U.S.  President Bill Clinton, who expressed sorrow over the status of  Kosova, and that of Vice President Al Gore who highly assessed  the peaceful resistance of Albanians, who were not provoked by  the violence exerted on them.    Rugova hailed the statement of French Foreign Minister Alain  Juppe, who warned that Kosova will be included in the package  for the global solution of the crisis in former Yugoslavia.  However, he attracted the attention that Kosova cannot be  compared with the Knin province, as it had its own constitution  as a federal unit of former Yugoslavia, ethnic territorial  compactness, and the expressed political will of the people.    Even this time, president Rugova asked for international  protection for Kosova.    Answering a reporter's question about Albania's diplomatic  commitment and that of President Berisha toward the solution of  the Kosova problem, Rugova pointed out that the common  denominator of the diplomatic commitment of Kosova and Albania  at the present moment is to prevent conflict in this area.    Commenting on some statements and articles in Serbian  circles  and media on the possibility of the creation of a new  confederation in the Balkans, president Rugova said that the  ideas for such confederations have yielded no results so far,  and it is too early to talk about them.    First, ethnic problems should be solved in the Balkans --  everyone be placed in his own land -- and then discuss the  possibility of any relationship of interest for all sides. The  confederation cannot exist with the domination of one over the  other, president Rugova said among other things at today's  meeting with reporters.</p>

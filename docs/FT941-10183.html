			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: SA casinos group 16% up at halfway Sun International Bophuthatswana, owner of 12 casino resorts in the South African homeland, reported a 16 per cent gain in pre-tax profit in the half-year to December 31 to R158.3m (Dollars 46m), from R136.6m the previous year. The group enjoyed the first full contribution from its newest resort, the Lost City, which lifted sales by nearly one-third to R717.6m from R556.4m. Mr Sol Kerzner, chairman, said a sharp increase in the number of overseas tourists at its Sun City complex was 'a breakthrough in the international market place', with occupancy rates at more than 70 per cent despite the expansion of facilities and the completion of the Lost City. Operating margins held steady on improved operating profit of R178.8m against R141.7m, but interest costs rose sharply to R20.5m from R4.6m, reflecting the debt incurred in funding new projects. Long-term borrowings were trimmed to R276.5m from R351.5m. Slightly lower tax ensured attributable earnings climbed to R134.5m from R110.6m, equivalent to 113 cents and 93 cents a share. A 17 per cent improved interim dividend of 75 cents, against 64 cents, is declared.</p>

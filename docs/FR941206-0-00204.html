			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (d) Each control device used in accordance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of &sect;265.1088 of this subpart shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspected and monitored by the owner or operator in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with the procedure specified in &sect;265.1033(f). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) The owner or operator shall develop and implement a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written plan and schedule to perform all inspection and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring requirements of this section. The owner or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator shall incorporate this plan and schedule into the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility inspection plan required under 40 CFR 265.15.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Inspection and monitoring of a cover in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The cover and all cover openings shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initially visually inspected and monitored for detectable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organic emissions on or before the date that the tank,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surface impoundment, or container using the cover becomes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the provisions of this subpart and at other times  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as requested by the Regional Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) At least once every 6 months following the initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> visual inspection and monitoring for detectable organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions required under paragraph (f)(1) of this section,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the owner and operator shall visually inspect and monitor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the cover and each cover opening except for following cover  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> openings:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) A cover opening that has continuously remained in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a closed, sealed position for the entire period since the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> last time the cover opening was visually inspected and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitored for detectable emissions;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) A cover opening that is designated as unsafe to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspect and monitor in accordance with paragraph (f)(5) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) A cover opening on a cover installed and placed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in operation before December 6, 1994, that is designated as difficult to inspect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and monitor in accordance with paragraph (f)(6) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) To visually inspect a cover, the owner or operator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall view the entire cover surface and each cover opening  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a closed, sealed position for evidence of any defect that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may affect the ability of the cover or cover opening to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to operate with no detectable organic emissions. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> visible hole, gap, tear, or split in the cover surface or a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cover opening is defined as a leak which shall be repaired  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in accordance with paragraph (f)(7) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) To monitor a cover for detectable organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions, the owner or operator shall use the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Method 21 in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A to test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each cover seal and cover connection for detectable organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions. Seals on floating membrane covers shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitored around the entire perimeter of the cover at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> locations spaced no greater than 3 meters apart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) For all cover connections and seals except for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the seals around a rotating shaft that passes through a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cover opening, if the monitoring instrument indicates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detectable organic emissions (i.e., an instrument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration reading greater than 500 ppmv plus the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> background level), then a leak is detected. Each detected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leak shall be repaired in accordance with paragraph (f)(7)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) For the seals around a rotating shaft that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> passes through a cover opening, if the monitoring instrument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicates a concentration reading greater than 10,000 ppmv,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> then a leak is detected. Each detected leak shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repaired in accordance with paragraph (f)(7) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) An owner or operator may designate a cover as an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unsafe to inspect and monitor cover if all of the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions are met:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The owner or operator determines that inspection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or monitoring of the cover would expose a worker to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dangerous, hazardous, or other unsafe conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The owner or operator develops and implements a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written plan and schedule to inspect the cover using the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitor the cover using the procedure specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (f)(4) of this section as frequently as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practicable during those times when a worker can safely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> access the cover.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) An owner or operator may designate a cover  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installed and placed in operation before December 6, 1994, as a difficult to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspect and monitor cover if all of the following conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are met:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Resilient Argyll advances by 25% THE continued resilience of food retailers to recession was yesterday underlined by Argyll Group, which runs the Safeway, Lo-Cost and Presto chains, as it posted a 25 per cent gain in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 364.5m. These followed similar substantial profits increases in recent weeks from two other big food retailers, Tesco and J. Sainsbury. However, the market was worried that cost increases were currently outstripping same-store sales gains and Argyll's shares fell 10p to 357p. Sir Alistair Grant, chairman, said as a result of the low-inflation environment in the 1990s, far more attention had to be paid to increasing productivity. 'We will have to industrialise the way we run our stores,' he said. Efficiencies would come from better management of its supply chain. The company is testing sales-based re-ordering systems. This year saw the extension of sales scanning equipment to all Safeway stores. In the year to March 28, Argyll's sales breached the Pounds 5bn mark for the first time climbing 6 per cent to Pounds 5.04bn. Operating profits climbed 16 per cent to Pounds 331m as a result of the widening of operating margin from 6.3 per cent to 7 per cent. Capital expenditure was Pounds 442m as Argyll opened 17 Safeway stores. This year 25 stores are due to open with spending projected to increase to Pounds 550m. Interest income - including Pounds 2.5m in dividends from its shareholdings in two mainland European retailers, Ahold and Casino - was Pounds 33.5m. This was considerably higher than the previous year's Pounds 5.5m income because of the cash inflow from last June's Pounds 387m rights issue. The company received Pounds 78.3m in extraordinary income from the settlement of its legal claim against Guinness over the Distillers bid. The taxman took Pounds 19.8m of the Pounds 100m settlement while Pounds 1.9m disappeared in legal costs. Earnings per share grew 12 per cent to 24.2p. A final dividend of 6.55p will lift the annual payout by 15 per cent to 9.75p. This set of results marked the fifth year since Argyll acquired the Safeway supermarket chain. Under its ownership, Safeway's sales have increased threefold and profits sixfold. 'We are quite proud of what we have achieved,' said Mr David Webster, deputy chairman. Lex, Page 22</p>

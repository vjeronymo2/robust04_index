			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, June 3 (YONHAP) -- China will stop  supplying food and oil to North Korea as well as halt border  trade if the United Nations imposes economic sanctions on  Pyongyang, a Chinese-language newspaper published here reported  Friday.    The report by TA KUNG PAO, which is supported financially by  Beijing, attracted keen attention since it is the first detailed  mentioning by a daily widely reputed to be a "virtual Chinese  official paper" of China's possible joining in U.N. sanctions  against Pyongyang.    In a six-column article titled "Situation on Korean  Peninsula  Becomes Tense Again," the newspaper said, "If the United Nations  decides to impose economic sanctions, China will stop supplying  food and oil to North Korea together with border trade involving  all other commodity goods."    The newspaper pointed out that, upon a U.N. decision in  favor of economic sanctions, the United States will undertake a  naval blockade of North Korea while Tokyo stops remittances by  pro-communist Koreans in Japan. "North Korea cannot cope with  such extensive economic sanctions by China, America and Japan,"  warned the newspaper.    Urging North Korea to accept outside nuclear inspection, the  paper said this would help clear up international suspicions  over Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions and improve North Korea's  relations with South Korea, the United States and Japan.    North Korea's devastated economy cannot bear any massive war  expenses, the paper explained. Should it become engaged in war,  its domestic economy would worsen and therefore it should  refrain from provoking South Korea.    Should war break out on the Korean peninsula, Russia would  not support North Korea as the Pyongyang-Moscow friendship  treaty is to be scrapped in two years, the paper said. South  Korean President Kim Yong-sam, who is currently visiting Russia,  had a series of discussion on the nuclear issue when he met with  Russian President Boris Yeltsin, it noted.    However, TA KUNG PAO urged South Korea, the United States  and  Japan to negotiate with Pyongyang and hold off on the  much-talked-about threat of sanctions.    A Hong kong-based expert on China said the newspaper's  report  deserves special attention in that it appeared at a time when  U.N. sanctions against North Korea are imminent.    The newspaper previously reported that China was persuading  North Korea to solve the nuclear problem.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Switzerland has reacted strongly to the French  decision to deport two Iranians to Iran. Berne has said that it  was very surprised and that it regretted the French decision.  The two men are suspected by the Swiss authorities of having  assassinated Kazem Rajavi, Iranian opposition figure and brother  of the leader of the People's Mujahidin. Behzad Naziri,  spokesman of this movement, has also protested to the French  authorities and spoke to (Olivier Dalage):    [Begin Naziri recording] Above all, we would like to  register  a strong protest, which was in fact addressed by Mr. Mas'ud  Rajavi, leader of the Iranian resistance, to the French Foreign  Ministry, for not handing over the murderers of his brother,  Professor Kazem Rajavi, to the Swiss authorities, and sending  them back to Iran. This is a very great concession to the  mullahs in power in Iran. The Swiss magistrate investigating the  murder of Mr. Kazem Rajavi, representative of the Iranian  resistance at the United Nations, was seeking 13 terrorists who  had been dispatched by Iran. Out of these 13, these two were in  prison in France. This decision is a flagrant violation of the  decision of the French courts, which had decided to approve the  extradition, and of the Swiss courts, which had requested the  extradition of these murderers to bring them to trial. [end  recording]    Former Iranian President Bani Sadr has also reacted. He has  expressed his shock and indignation at the decision. He accused  Interior Minister Charles Pasqua of being, I quote, hand in hand  with the Iranian mullahs.</p>

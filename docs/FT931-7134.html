			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Bundesbank in 'solidarity pact' appeal THE German Bundesbank yesterday called for urgent action to conclude the drawn-out negotiations in Bonn between the government, the federal states and the opposition on a 'solidarity pact' to revive the east German economy. In its most outspoken intervention to date, the central bank stepped up pressure on the politicians to bury their broad differences over the size and shape of extra taxes needed to finance soaring spending in the east. 'It is imperative that the phase of controversial discussions does not last much longer,' said Mr Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the Bundesbank. 'Business needs clarity about what the whole package of measures means, and it needs it soon.' His call suggests a growing concern in Frankfurt at the prospect of weeks if not months of further negotiations, causing uncertainty in the financial and currency markets, and reducing the room for the Bundesbank to cut further its lead interest rates. It came as the opposition Social Democrats in the German parliament unanimously approved proposals, including sharp increases in taxation from July 1, and excluding any cuts in social spending - in broad contradiction to the government's plans. Mr Tietmeyer said public spending cuts should be no less than those proposed by the Finance Ministry, amounting to some DM20bn (Pounds 8.4bn) a year. He warned that the scope for further tax increases was slim from an economic viewpoint, and that the burden of taxes and other contributions was already high in Germany in comparison to other countries. 'A further substantial increase (in the tax burden) could damage the long-term competitive position of German business,' he warned. On the positive side, he said that wage developments this year had been a victory for good sense, referring to the 3 per cent settlement for public sector workers. Referring to the outlook for further cuts in interest rates, Mr Tietmeyer said that money supply growth was showing signs of the desired slowdown. Broad money, M3, fell by 2.3 per cent in January on a seasonally adjusted, annualised basis. Mr Tietmeyer said that the figure had ben distorted by special factors and over 6 months January M3 had grown by 6.5 per cent.</p>

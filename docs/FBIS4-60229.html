			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Selim Yassine] </F>   [Text] Qasr Naba, Lebanon, May 21 (AFP)--Israeli commandos  met with no resistance as they kidnapped a Moslem fundamentalist  guerrilla chief in a slick pre-dawn raid on his home on Saturday  [21 May], his brother said.    "There were around 25 men all dressed in Israeli military  uniform," said Subhi al-Dirani, the brother of Mustafa al-Dirani  who was snatched by the helicopter-borne commandos from his home  in Syrian-controlled eastern Lebanon.  "They did not meet with any resistance when they grabbed Mustafa  in front of his family," and no one was hurt, he said.    Mustafa al-Dirani, 46, is held responsible by Israel for the  capture of airman Ron Arad whose plane was shot down over south  Lebanon in 1986. The abduction is seen as a bargaining chip in  the release of the pilot.    "No one in the village heard the helicopters which brought  the commandos.  The soldiers stormed the house out of nowhere and immediately  went into the bedroom where my brother and his wife were  sleeping," Subhi al-Dirani said.    "They handcuffed me with cuffs made in England and pointed  their guns at my father, my sister-in-law and her three  children, grabbed my brother and fled on foot. The whole thing  lasted 10 minutes," the 26-year-old added.    He said the commandos spoke in Hebrew with each other "but  they spoke to us in Arabic."    Lebanese army troops threw a security cordon around the Niha  hills, which overlook Qasr Naba, five kilometers (three miles)  away where the two helicopters used by the commandos had landed.    Witnesses said the commandos drove by jeep from the hill to  al-Dirani's house, which is located on the edge of the village,  and drove back to the waiting choppers. Some villagers said  they had seen an exchange of light signals before the operation,  suggesting that the commandos had accomplices inside the village  who gave them the all clear.</p>

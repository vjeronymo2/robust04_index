			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Portugal and China -- what good friends we are.  On this the third day of his visit to the People's Republic,  Prime Minister Cavaco Silva announced that Portugal advocates  the lifting of sanctions imposed on China over human rights  violations. He stated this at a news conference in Beijing.  Our special correspondent Marina Pimentel was there:    [Begin recording] [Pimentel] The Portuguese Government has  offered to help Chinese businesses find markets in the EU, and  has called for the lifting of sanctions imposed on China by the  EU after the Tiananmen massacre.    [Cavaco Silva] We think the continuation of sanctions still  being enforced by the EU is no longer justified.    [Pimentel] This announcement helps one understand why Li  Peng  has thanked Cavaco Silva for the role played by Portugal in the  rehabilitation of China's international image. When asked by  reporters whether the Portuguese Government is not guilty of  double standards on the human rights question, Cavaco Silva  implies that the moderation of his criticism of human rights  violations in China has already enabled him to secure Beijing's  support on the East Timorese question. [passage omitted]    After 1999 the Beijing authorities will not be imposing  Chinese nationality on the so-called Macanese -- a community of  some 10,000 people born in Macao but of mixed Portuguese and  Chinese descent. The Macanese will be free to choose their  nationality. Cavaco Silva stated at the news conference that he  has received this pledge from the Chinese authorities. So the  fears of the Macanese over their future when Macao is handed  over in five years' time have in principle been removed. This  is so far the most significant political result of Cavaco  Silva's visit to China. [passage omitted]</p>

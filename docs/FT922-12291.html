			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Letter: Crisis is no fault of Free Democrats Sir, Mr Bryan Cassidy is profoundly mistaken (Letters, April 14) in attributing the current German crisis to 'Chancellor Kohl's having to depend upon the support of the Free Democrats in coalition'. It is the Free Democrats who advocate faster privatisation and a reduction in subsidies. But for their presence in the government the slow response of which Mr Cassidy complains would be slower still. No doubt some coalition governments can lead to stagnation and mutually imposed vetoes. But coalition partners can equally easily act as spurs, as has been the case more than once in post-war Germany.

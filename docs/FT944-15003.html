			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Observer: Show jumper Pity poor old Malcolm Barr, chairman of Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold Trust, who is currently besieged by his two rebellious nephews. Young master Nicholas and master Robert are calling for the heads of no less than the chief executive and finance director, and claim they have the backing of a majority of the shareholders of the leisure and motor distribution group. For uncle Malcolm, 68, the prospect of losing his chief executive is an uncanny reminder of his other job as chairman of Leeds Permanent building society. He has been searching for a chief executive since February 1993, when Mike Blackburn escaped to run the Halifax building society. After 22 years on the board of the Leeds, Malcolm retires in January - an event which may in itself speed up one of the longest running CEO searches in recent times. But the question remains whether Barr &amp; Wallace will still be his nice little earner in retirement. After all, to lose one chief executive may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose two might look like carelessness. Perhaps he should take a few tips from his loyal son-in-law, show jumper John Whitaker, on how to stay in the saddle.</p>

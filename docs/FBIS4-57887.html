			<p>BFN     [Text] Merida, 24 May (NOTIMEX) -- An official source  disclosed here today that the Mexican Government hopes the  current Haitian problem can be resolved peacefully and that  peaceful options are exhausted in an effort to preclude the use  of armed intervention.    Carlos Ferrer Argote, Caribbean Affairs director of the  Foreign Relations Secretariat, pointed out that Mexico will not  interfere in the conflict "because our constitutional principles  on foreign affairs are based on self-determination and  nonintervention."    Nevertheless, he said the Mexican Government will in no way  abstain from raising its voice in favor of the Haitian people's  will being respected. Once the situation in Haiti has been  normalized, the Mexican Government will direct its international  cooperation efforts toward the reconstruction of the country.    On 21 May, the United Nations implemented a complete embargo  against Haiti after the expiration of the two-week deadline  granted to coup leader Raoul Cedras to step down from power and  allow the return of deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.  The trade embargo is the most sweeping package of sanctions  directed against any country on the continent.    Within the framework of the 19th Caribbean Studies  Association, Ferrer Argote stressed that Haiti's problems or the  conflicts taking place in other countries in the region will  undermine the integration of the Caribbean States Association.  He also indicated that Mexico has "definitely" encouraged the  integration of the Caribbean States Association because there  must be an ever-growing sense of belonging to the region. The  Caribbean Affairs director also recalled that 750 km of Mexico's  coastline faces the Caribbean.    The official concluded by indicating that the aforementioned  integration process has traditionally been hampered by  inadequate channels of communication. Moreover, he called for  the construction of a deep draft port in the Caribbean to  encourage the development of navigation, maritime activities,  trade, and tourism.</p>

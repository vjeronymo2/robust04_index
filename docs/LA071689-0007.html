			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: THE DEVIL, YOU SAY  </P> <P> Author-writer-director William Peter Blatty, currently completing Morgan  Creek's "Exorcist: 1990," insists that his sequel will be "the last serious  word on the subject." Meanwhile, his next project, "Demons 5, Exorcists 0,"  will send up the subject that made him a household name.  </P> <P> "The script's completed, and Fox (which released '1990') has first refusal,"  said Blatty. "It's about a convention of priests beset by an evil presence."  </P> <P> Then there's producer Steve Wizan's tentatively titled "Repossessed," a spoof  written and directed by Robert Logan. It's about a woman -- played by  "Exorcist" star Linda Blair, no less -- once possessed by a demon, who now  seeks help when she feels that ole black magic returning. Leslie Nielsen is an  off-kilter priest, Ned Beatty an evil evangelist and Morton Downey Jr. cameoed  as a disbeliever.  </P> <P> Wizan claims, "It's not an 'Exorcist' spoof. We're sending up all horror  pictures. . . ."  </P> <P> Blatty said he's aware of Wizan's project: "I hope it's fun. And I'm sure it's  not at all like the film I'm preparing."

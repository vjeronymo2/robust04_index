			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by S. Beric: "Karadzic's Warning to the Muslims"] </F>   [Text] Borovo Naselje, 14 Mar -- The first constituent  session of the convention of the Serbian Democratic Parties  [SDS] of the Serbian Lands, which was attended by members of the  SDS of the Serbian Lands from east Slavonia, Baranja, and  western Srem, who adopted with acclamation the convention on the  unification of all SDS into one party that was signed in Pale on  7 November 1993, was held in Borovo Naselje yesterday. The  membership accepted with acclamation that the SDS of the Serbian  Lands cease work and transfer their powers to President Radovan  Karadzic and a main committee.    Radovan Karadzic, president of the SDS of the Serbian Lands,  presented the program aims of the united party. According to  Karadzic, which is something he insisted on throughout his  speech, the aim of the SDS of the Serbian Lands is not to win  power, but to realize its program in the interest of the people  -- "winning power is the means to accomplish this." One of the  main tasks of the party is reinstate the traditional values of  the Serbian people.  <H5>  State Unity -- The Basis of Everything </H5>   On our path to realize the program, Karadzic said, there are  several priorities. The first priority is to overcome the  divisions in the Serbian nation in every respect, especially  tribal divisions.    "The state unity is left for the end and this unity is in  fact the beginning of everything," Karadzic said. The state is  a guarantee for the survival of a nation. The time has come for  the Serbs to finish what Karadjordje had started. The phrase  frequently misused in the world is "great Serbia." Russia is  big, and Serbia is as big as it is. Once all Serbian lands are  incorporated, they will make up some 150,000 square meters.    The Serbs in the Serbian Republic, Karadzic said, have their  territory and are controlling it; they have their own nation and  effective authorities. These are the elements needed for the  existence of a country, which was also admitted by UN  representative Akashi. However, the military victory is only  one step and this military victory should be turned into a  political and diplomatic victory. After that we should seek the  recognition of sovereignty.    After the constituent session and the speech by President  Karadzic on the party's program, the delegates held a meeting  behind closed doors at which they discussed the new program and  the statute of the party. Dr. Karadzic then held a news  conference.    Regarding the opening of Tuzla airport, Karadzic said that  he  had reached an agreement with a Russian diplomat on the  conditions needed to be met for the opening of the airport.  These are the guarantees that the airport will not be used for  military purposes. However, the Muslims have started the spring  offensive on Mount Ozren in an attempt to capture Modrica and  Doboj, which, according to Karadzic, is the first stage of  breaking through the corridor.    "We will say very clearly, and I am saying this to you now,  that if the Muslims do not stop their offensive, we will not  make any territorial concessions. The Muslims cannot be  guaranteed 30 percent of the territory and allowed to continue  fighting against us. Since they have opted to fight, they will  then get as much territory as they win. Had they opted for  political talks in time, we would have come to certain  arrangements in a peaceful way."    The statement by Alija Izetbegovic that 64 percent of the  territory will belong to the Muslim-Croat federation, according  to Karadzic, is simply a provocation directed at the Serbs to  reject this idea. This would then be used as the reason to  reject the Washington agreement. Karadzic claims that neither  the Croats nor the Muslims want the agreement, which they were  forced to sign. They are looking for reasons and motives to  break the talks and the agreement. Radovan Karadzic then  confirmed that the talks with the Russians were difficult  because, "contrary to the erroneous belief in the world, the  Russians are not our protectors in the sense the that Americans  are the protectors of the Muslims."   <H5>    Secret Signals to Serbs </H5>   "Russia is playing a constructive role and we must clearly  say that Russia is not partial toward the Serbs. Russia is  trying to be objective and it is in its interest that a solution  be found as soon as possible. Whether this solution is  favorable for the Serbs or not, they are not asked about it that  much. However, we are here to say that such a solution is not a  solution for us. Nevertheless, I think that Russia has a  correct view on all this and that the Russians will realize that  it is in their interests that the Serbs realize their aims,  because these aims could not be against Russia's interests."    Answering the question as to whether Russia had prevented  NATO's military intervention in the Serbian Republic, Karadzic  expressed the view that NATO was relieved when Russia entered  the game. According to Karadzic, in this game with NATO, the  European Union ejected itself from the game.    The Serbs are now receiving secret signals from certain  European capitals. They now want to achieve through the Serbs  the kind of results achieved by Churkin. They missed their  chance and we no longer have reason to deal with European  capitals. If Russia and the United State are here, we will deal  with them, with those that can bring about a solution, Radovan  Karadzic said.  <H5>  [Box, p 11] </H5> <H5>  Karadzic on Churkin's Statement in Zagreb </H5>   The most interesting remark was certainly Karadzic's view on  the statements by Vitaliy Churkin in Zagreb on the possibility  of the Serbs entering the federation with the Croats and the  Muslims in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina.    "This is possible but not probable," Dr. Karadzic said. "We  are allowing for the possibility of discussing all this and do  not want to spoil what the Croats and the Muslims are doing.  This is their right, as long as it does not affect the Serbs in  the Serbian Republic and the Serbian Republic of Krajina. I ask  myself somewhat naively: Why would it be natural for the Serbs  to live with the Croats and the Muslims and not with the Serbs.  I have no answer to this simple question."</p>

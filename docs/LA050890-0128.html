			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFING PAPER ;  </P> <P> THOSE VITAL AMERICAN BARGAINING CHIPS IN THE PHILIPPINES  </P> <P> The News:  </P> <P> U.S. and Philippine negotiators will meet next Monday in Manila for what are  called "exploratory talks" on the future of six U.S. military facilities in the  country. . . . They include Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base, two of the  Pentagon's largest overseas bases. . . . President Corazon Aquino's government  has asked for the talks before any renegotiation of current leases, which  expire in September, 1991.  </P> <P> The Background:  </P> <P> Relations between Washington and Manila are unusually strained. . . . In  December, U.S. Air Force jets from Clark helped save Aquino's government by  pinning down attacking rebel planes near Manila during an attempted military  coup. . . . But after critics said she was thus "beholden" to Washington,  Aquino abruptly canceled a meeting in February with visiting U.S. Defense  Secretary Dick Cheney, angering the Bush Administration.  </P> <P> Philippine politicians, meanwhile, are furious that Congress has refused to  appropriate $96 million pledged under the current two-year, $962-million lease  agreement. . . . Despite the shortfall, the United States claims that aid to  Manila has exceeded commitments over the last five years.  </P> <P> At Issue:  </P> <P> The bases are considered crucial for U.S. military operations in the Pacific  and Indian oceans. . . . Clark is headquarters for the 13th Air Force, with  tactical fighter and airlift wings. Subic is home for the 7th Fleet and is a  giant training, supply and repair depot. . . . About 12,000 U.S. troops are  stationed in the Philippines; with civilian employees and families, the number  rises to 40,000. . . . U.S. officials say the bases also provide jobs for  68,000 Filipinos and pump $1 billion into the economy.  </P> <P> Manila says the money isn't enough. Also, opponents see the bases as a vestige  of the time when the Philippines was a U.S. colony. . . . They blame the bases  for spreading AIDS, prostitution and other social ills. And they argue that the  bases make the Philippines a more likely target for nuclear attack.  </P> <P> Forces:  </P> <P> The debate over the bases dominates Manila's newspapers, campuses and coffee  shops like few other issues. . . . Although polls have shown that a majority of  Filipinos support the bases, prominent politicians, church leaders and  editorial writers are calling for the United States to pull out or sharply  reduce operations. . . . Anti-base sentiment is strong in the 23-member  Philippine Senate, which must ratify a new agreement.  </P> <P> The White House faces other pressures at home. A budget-strapped Congress,  increasingly sour on Aquino's government, is unlikely to up the ante for  Manila, given competing demands from new democracies in Eastern Europe. And as  the Soviet Union cuts its military forces worldwide, Pentagon strategists are  re-examining the U.S. role in the Pacific. . . . Military officials who long  insisted that the bases were vital to hold communism in check now say they are  necessary to protect shipping lanes for Japan.  </P> <P> Personalities:  </P> <P> President Aquino says she is keeping her "options open" on the bases. Her hand  is strengthened since she insists she won't run for reelection in 1992, thus  reducing domestic political pressure. . . . Her foreign minister, Raul  Manglapus, will lead the talks. He is a smooth, savvy diplomat who has written  an anti-bases musical called "Yankee Panky."  </P> <P> Longtime Asian defense specialist Richard Armitage has been named special  negotiator to head the U.S. team. . . . Armitage, 45, is a former assistant  secretary of defense for international security affairs. . . . Embassy  officials said the talks may last several months; a joint review, rather than  renegotiation, of the agreement in 1988 took seven months.  </P> <P> Scenarios:  </P> <P> * The leases will simply be extended with no changes; this is considered very  unlikely.  </P> <P> * There will be more joint use of the bases, as in NATO countries and Japan.  </P> <P> * U.S. forces will partially redeploy, particularly from Clark Air Base. The  Pentagon has already studied possible alternatives for the Air Force in  Singapore, Guam, Saipan and Tinian.  </P> <P> * The United States will carry out a phased withdrawal, spread over five to 10  years.  </P> <P> * In a combination of some of the above steps, the United States will slowly  cut back its presence.  </P> <P> Big Stick in the Philippines  </P> <P> A look at personal figures, both military and civilian, for America's two  biggest bases in the Philippines.  </P> <P> Clark Air Base  </P> <P> U.S. Military: 8,300  </P> <P> U.S. Civilian: 2,000  </P> <P> Filipinos: 38,000  </P> <P> Subic Bay Naval Base  </P> <P> U.S. Military: 5,800  </P> <P> U.S. Civilian: 720  </P> <P> Filipinos: 37,000  </P></p>

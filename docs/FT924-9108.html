			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / British visa Catch-22 stifles hopes for Bosnia's refugees A CONSULAR Catch-22 has been set up for Bosnian war refugees seeking passage to the UK. Enquiries were already flowing in to the tiny British embassy located above a clothes shop in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, yesterday after the announcement of visa requirements for most citizens of the former Yugoslavia. Holders of Croatian - or Slovenian - passports are not affected by the measure. But Croatia currently has on its hands an estimated 332,000 refugees from the seven-month old war in Bosnia-Hercegovina, more than any other country outside Bosnia itself. The problem is that the British embassy is not being authorised to issue visas. Those who missed the deadline by not starting their journeys before midnight last night are recommended to apply for visas in Vienna or Budapest. And the problem with that is that the Austrian and Hungarian authorities, themselves finding it difficult to cope with the large number of displaced people, now require that entrants should be in possession of a visa to a third country to gain admission. Some hopefuls evidently thought the issuing of UK visas might provide an extra possibility for overland travel, but they were rapidly disabused. The measure was announced on Thursday by Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK home secretary, in order to stop an 'uncontrolled flow' of migrants. Britain is however offering to take 150 detainees, a figure which, including dependants, could increase to about 600. A UN official said this was 'not all that good, either' in comparison with some other countries' efforts. According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, some 7,000-10,000 heads of families need to be moved from camps in Serb-held areas of Bosnia.</p>

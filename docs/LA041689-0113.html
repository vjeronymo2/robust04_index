			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> VIRGINIA SETS UP POLICE LIBRARY OF GENE PRINTS  </P> <P> Virginia is going to have the first state laboratory in the nation with a data  bank of genetic prints, which enable police to identify criminals from scanty  physical evidence, such as saliva left at a crime scene.  </P> <P> The Virginia Division of Consolidated Laboratory Services will provide DNA  testing for the state's police and sheriff's departments beginning May 1.  </P> <P> DNA testing is "the most significant development for law enforcement since  fingerprinting, and that dates back about 100 years," said Paul B. Ferrara,  director of the state Bureau of Forensic Science.  </P> <P> The lab will develop a computerized library of DNA prints from known sex  offenders in the state.  </P> <P> A state law passed last month requires sex offenders to give blood samples.  DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is found in the chromosomes of cells from  saliva, hair, blood, semen, tissue and bone marrow. Only identical twins can  have the same DNA pattern, or genetic blueprint.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Genetic Blueprint  </P> <P> Scientists in recent years have developed technology for taking DNA from body  fluids or from tissue left at a crime scene, and matching it with the genetic  blueprint of a suspect.  </P> <P> "If a rapist leaves seminal fluid at the scene . . . he might as well be  leaving his Social Security card," Ferrara said.  </P> <P> He said DNA testing already has helped to solve one case in Virginia. Timothy  Spencer, of Richmond, was convicted of three capital murders on the basis of  genetic printing.  </P> <P> "I'm not a lawyer, but, based on what I've been told, Timothy Spencer probably  never would have been convicted without the DNA testing," Ferrara said. The  case is under review by the state Supreme Court.  </P> <P> Ferrara said DNA testing also could serve as a crime deterrent. He said  criminals can be careful not to leave fingerprints, as Spencer was, but the  chances of committing a violent crime without leaving any source of a DNA  sample are slim.  </P> <P> Previously, analysis of body fluids, tissue or hair left at crime scenes  consisted of examining enzymes and blood types -- processes that could  eliminate a suspect but could not positively identify the guilty party.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Like Fingerprints'  </P> <P> "Conventional serologic evidence was always circumstantial," Ferrara said. "You  could say that a particular sample could have come from, say, 13% of the male  population, but with DNA testing you can say this sample definitely came from  that person. It's just like fingerprints in that respect."  </P> <P> DNA is inherited, half from each parent. For about 10 years, scientists have  used DNA testing to determine paternity and to study genetically related  diseases.  </P> <P> About three years ago, DNA testing was first used to solve a rape in a small  town in England, Ferrara said. The technology has since been used to solve  several crimes in the United States, but Virginia is one of the first states to  begin collecting samples on a broad scale.  </P></p>

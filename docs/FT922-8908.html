			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Observer: The Paris club If the Governors of the big central banks can use their regular monthly meetings at the Bank for International Settlements in Basle to get to know each other socially, why can't the other ranks do the same? It seems that some of them are planning to do just that, but in less formal surroundings. Observer hears that the top economists of the Bank of England, the Banque de France and the Bundesbank have decided to break with tradition and inaugurate regular get-togethers. Mervyn King, Andre Icard and Otmar Issing are kicking off with a cosy dinner in Paris tonight. Of course, there is a fairly heavy menu. The trio will be debating the outlook for German interest rates after last week's German public sector pay deal. Additionally, they will be discussing prospects for harmonising the central banks' monetary policy instruments ahead of moves towards monetary union. If they have any time over fruit and cheese, they might get around to discussing the chimeric question of where the European central bank should be sited. Naturally, the Bundesbank's Issing is keen on Frankfurt, while the Bank of England's King has a sneaking suspicion that Bonn might be the compromise candidate to back.</p>

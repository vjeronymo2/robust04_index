			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 14 (YONHAP) -- Seoul will refer to the  UN High Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR) in screening North  Korean loggers fleeing from Siberian camps to determine whether  they are criminal offenders before settling them in South Korea,  officials said Thursday.    The government will try to find homes in third countries for  those seeking settlement outside South Korea but focus on  blocking their repatriation to Pyongyang, also in cooperation  with the UNHCR, the officials said.    An inter-ministerial meeting is planned for Friday, when the  government is expected to confirm the principle of accepting  North Korean loggers escaping from Siberian gulags that  reportedly violate human rights.    The South Korean Embassy in Moscow said over 170 escapees  have asked to be resettled in Seoul.    President Kim Yong-sam had earlier said his government would  not accept the escapees, lest it anger North Korea and aggravate  their already strained relations. But he changed his mind and  Kim's spokesman announced Wednesday that he has ordered a  thorough study on bringing the loggers to the South.    Friday's meeting will discuss various possibilities,  focusing  on how to screen the escapees to sort out those fleeing  punishment for criminal offenses, according to the officials.    One option is to have Moscow perform the screening, but the  best method is referral to the UNHCR, one official said.    "Moscow would have a tremendously difficult time in  screening  the escapees since most of them do not have any form of  identification," he said. "For all we know, they may not even be  from the logging camps but North Koreans who are in flight in  China, or even spies."    "The best way is to have the UNHCR do the job. It would be  the most objective, and be less tough than Moscow in screening  procedures since it would place humanitarian concerns above  political implications," he said.    If some did turn out to be criminal offenders, Seoul would  arrange to have them serve time before they are considered for  resettlement in South Korea, the official noted.    Seoul will start negotiations with the UN Commissioner soon,  including resettlement in countries other than South Korea, he  said.</p>

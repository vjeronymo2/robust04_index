			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Piet Muller] </F>   [Excerpts] A lack of funds accounts for why the ANC is  urgently looking for at least 500 posts for its officials in the  civil service. After the election the party's funds are  apparently running dry and other jobs must be found urgently for  its officials. This week RAPPORT was alerted by informed sources  that the ANC officials "will be in Pretoria soon." In civil  service circles it is being described as "nepotism under the  cloak of affirmative action."    State departments recently received orders from Minister of  Public Services and Administration Dr. Zola Skweyiya to inform  him -- before last week Friday -- which vacancies existed in  their departments. Some departments had to work through  Thursday night until the early hours of the morning to prepare  their lists.    Over the past week the minister also issued a statement that  approximately a thousand vacant posts in the civil service would  be advertised by 15 June. A large number of these posts are  senior management posts. The Transitional Executive Council has  frozen these posts and have placed a moratorium on new  appointments or promotions.  <H5>  Posts `Multiplying' </H5>   RAPPORT was informed that these 1,000 posts being sought for  "affirmative action" had "multiplied to 3,000" by Friday.    There has been talk of an "undignified haste" and experts  point out that the Civil Service Commission will complete its  task within six weeks on the rationalization of the civil  service from 11 services to just one service. It would have  been more logical to halt the proposed appointments to these  posts until this process has been completed.    Meanwhile, it appears that the various provincial  governments  are appointing new personnel left and right. These appointments  could "lead to chaos" and even to serious tension between the  black state officials and government. The interim constitution  guarantees the job of every civil servant. They should,  therefore, enjoy first preference with the appointment of new  personnel, but the process could drag on until early next year  before officials are fully integrated into the various  provincial governments. At that stage officials might find  their posts being filled by political appointments.  <H5>  ANC Members Appointed </H5>   In the Eastern Cape former ANC officials have already been  appointed in all provincial state departments as "executive  managers," apparently to promote the affirmative action program.  Nobody knows exactly what their status is, not even whether they  are just "embryonic directors general" who will later be  appointed above other officials. Dr. Skweyiya says that these  appointments are part of "temporary transitional measures made  by the various governments. These appointments are not being  done in accordance with the civil service rules and regulations.  Neither I nor the Civil Service Commission are involved in  these arrangements. It is not possible to speculate on the  possible later inclusion of these officials in the civil  service."    Also in the PWV Province "there are offices full of  officials" who have been appointed in the interim.  <H5>  `Old Extras' </H5>   It was revealed to RAPPORT that there are "just more old  extras" in the offices of the various premiers -- people who  have come from somewhere and for whom posts will have to be  created. "It seems that civil service regulations will not be  followed in the new government. A moratorium on new  appointments apparently does not exist any more." [passage  omitted]</p>

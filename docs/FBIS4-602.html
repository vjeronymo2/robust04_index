			<p>BFN     [Text] The Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] says it  may still be possible to reprint the ballot papers for  kwaZulu-Natal. However, South African printers may not have  sufficient time for this, and IEC spokesman said the  organization is going ahead with the planning of elections in  kwaZulu-Natal because the IEC could not presume that election  day would be impossible.    But in the kwaZulu capital of Ulundi finance minister D.  Madide said it was too late to enable the IFP [Inkatha Freedom  Party] to take part in the poll. He said if the mediators  accepted Inkatha's arguments and ruled that the interim  constitution was not advisable, the new government should call a  second election within weeks or months. He said failing  international mediation, a guerrilla war- like specter, as was  the case in the Middle east, would loom in the country.</p>

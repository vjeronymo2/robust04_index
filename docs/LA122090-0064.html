			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-SUSPECT IN MOLEST CASE SUES PRIEST;  </P> <P> JUSTICE: FORMER YOUTH MINISTER WHOSE SEX TRIALS ENDED IN HUNG JURIES SAYS  PRIVATE REMARKS TO AN EPISCOPAL PRIEST SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN TAPED.  </P> <P> A former youth minister whose three trials for molesting a teen-age boy ended  in hung juries has sued an Episcopal priest who tape-recorded a confession  allegedly concerning the sexual allegations.  </P> <P> David Rickard, 40, former youth pastor at St. Jude's Church in Burbank, claims  in the lawsuit that the church's rector, Father Michael T. Flynn, violated  Rickard's privacy and the confidentiality of confession.  </P> <P> The suit asks that the tape be turned over to Rickard, of Sierra Madre, or  taken by the court. Also named in the suit, filed Nov. 28 in Burbank Superior  Court, are St. Jude's and the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> On Dec. 6, Judge Thomas J. Murphy sealed the court record and ordered all those  involved in the case not to talk about it.  </P> <P> Confession is a church rite under which a person admits wrongdoing to a priest  for the purpose of forgiveness. Such conversations are protected under  California law, as are conversations between doctors and patients or attorneys  and clients.  </P> <P> Rickard has denied engaging in a sexual relationship but admitted feelings of  attraction for the youth. He said Flynn urged him to confess, then misconstrued  his words.  </P> <P> Flynn, 50, rector at St. Jude's for nine years, declined to comment. Canon  Bruce MacPherson, a spokesman for the diocese, said that he was unfamiliar with  details of the case but that tape-recording a confession does not violate  church policy.  </P> <P> Rickard was tried in 1989 in Redding and in 1989 and 1990 in Pasadena Superior  Court on 120 charges of oral copulation with a 15-year-old boy who was in  Rickard's Bible study class.  </P> <P> The youth, now 20 and married, spent time with Rickard in Sierra Madre and  later, with his parents' permission, moved with Rickard to Northern California  in 1985.  </P> <P> The parents learned of the alleged sexual relationship in 1987 and notified  authorities. Charges were dismissed this year in both places after the third  jury deadlocked in Pasadena in August.  </P> <P> Flynn wrote Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert de Carteret on Nov. 20 about the tape,  saying it "was probably not admissible in a court of law, but it will be held  secure for other use should Mr. Rickard's future behavior require its  utilization."  </P> <P> De Carteret at first said Rickard may have waived his right to confidentiality  by filing the suit. But he said later that the gag order prevents further  action by prosecutors.  </P> <P> Bill Rodiger, vice chancellor of the diocese and an attorney, said the diocese  and the bishop will probably have little role in the lawsuit because Episcopal  churches are independently run. Each church elects its own clergy, Rodiger  said.  </P> <P> Rodiger said the lawsuit could center on the legal difference between a  "confession" and a "conversation." A similar case about 10 years ago in  Northern California made such a distinction, he said. A woman convicted of  stealing church money sued her priest, who had reported the theft because he  interpreted her admission to him as a conversation. She lost.  </P> <P> The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages. Rickard has said previously that he  spent more than $90,000 defending himself.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interviews by staff reporters He Jiazheng (0149 </F> 0502 2973) and Zhou Hongyang (0719 3126 3152): "How To Carry  Out Comprehensive Agricultural Development?--Interview With Li  Yanling, Vice Finance Minister and Director of the State Office  for Comprehensive Agricultural Development"]    [Text] Comprehensive agricultural development, a huge  project with an influence on the whole country, has already been  implemented for five full years. The project has entailed a  total investment of 20 billion yuan, has transformed 100 million  mu of medium and low-yield fields, and has added 17.16 billion  kg of grain over the past five years....    Nevertheless, many people do not have a good idea of what  the  project is, what goals it supposed to achieve, and how it is  being carried out. Some confuse it with ordinary agricultural  development, as we usually call it. For this reason, we called  on Li Yanling, vice finance minister and director of the State  Office for Comprehensive Agricultural Development.    [RENMIN RIBAO] What is the distinction between  "comprehensive development" of agriculture and ordinary  development, as we usually call it?    [Li Yanling] Comprehensive agricultural development is  distinguished by its "comprehensiveness." Comprehensive  agricultural development has a special meaning. It is a real  engineering project with fixed sources of funds, clear  principles of development, strict management methods, and  special organizations for its organization. Its use of  resources is comprehensive. It emphasizes the transformation of  medium and low-yield fields while increasing the area of  farmland at the same time. Its main contents are to increase  production of grain, cotton, edible oils, meat, and sugar, and  to carry out the comprehensive management and development of  hills, water, level fields, afforestation, and road construction  with high starting points and high standards. It carries out  project management in development areas with reference to  industrial management methods. The State Office for  Comprehensive Agricultural Development coordinates planning,  finance, and banking, as well as agriculture, forestry, and  water works. It is specifically in charge of selecting and  deciding on projects in various development areas and is in  charge of project development, examination, and acceptance as  well as the achievement of targets. Development funds are  shared by the center, the local authorities, and the banks. The  center's financial expenditures on this now comes to 2 billion  yuan or so each year, while the province, prefecture, and county  contribute one-third each and banks extend loans in keeping with  the proportion of the center's financial appropriations. These  funds, plus the deposits of vast numbers of peasants, form a  huge development force. Over the past five years, we have  invested a total of 20 billion yuan in various project areas and  have obtained very obvious comprehensive efficiency.    [RENMIN RIBAO] Such a large investment, with 20 billion yuan  spent over five years on land development, is rare. Could you  tell us what the main direction for development is?    [Li] This large-scale, comprehensive agricultural  development set up as a project by the state is an important  measure by the state to increase agricultural investment and  enhance the comprehensive productive capability of agriculture.  Since the measure has integrated an appropriate scale of  operation with the contract responsibility system on a household  basis with remuneration linked to output, integrated the state's  macroscopic regulation and control with the full utilization of  incentives for peasants, and integrated an improvement of basic  conditions for agricultural production with increasing peasants'  incomes; this has produced remarkable achievements. Development  areas have taken on a rural look where one can find tracts of  fields, rows of trees, and networks of canals and roads are  linked and bridges and dams are linked and matched. Conditions  for production have improved, peasants' incomes have increased  accordingly, and agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry,  sideline occupations, and fisheries are developing in an  all-round way. Practice over the years shows that the  investment direction is clear and the input-output ratio is very  high, and that financially speaking, capital returns on  comprehensive agricultural development are good as well.    [RENMIN RIBAO] Where do you think the success of the "method  of project management" adopted for comprehensive development  lies as far as the procurement, use, and management of funds is  concerned?    [Li] Carrying out comprehensive agricultural development in  line with project management is a World Bank-aided project  carried out with reference to industrial management methods. It  is also managed by employing these methods. The most  distinctive characteristic of project management is that we  invest funds right into these projects, rather than "scattering"  them everywhere without a definite goal. With state investment  taking the lead, all localities now have the incentive and can  choose projects in their own areas according to the requirements  of the projects. After deciding on these projects, and when the  funds from the center arrive, they can attract the same amount  of funds as supporting funds. Most of this portion of the funds  is used to improve the conditions for agricultural production,  while a small proportion is used to develop diverse economic  sectors, thus stabilizing grain and cotton production and  increasing incomes simultaneously. As for bank loans, a small  proportion of them is used to improve production conditions and  the main proportion is used to develop high-yield, high-quality,  and high-efficiency agriculture and diverse economic sectors so  as to ensure that peasants' incomes will increase after  development.    There is a regulatory mechanism which provides a very high  incentive to all localities and ensures projects are done well.  If your project proceeds well and is passed in keeping with  requirements, then the center and the banks will continue to  pump in funds. If it does not proceed well, then they will  withdraw the funds. The better a project proceeds, the more  funds will be pumped into it. These investments are directly  made in the land of the localities and conform to local  interests. The state has also achieved government control  [zheng fu xing wei 2398 1650 5887 3634] over land development by  means of macroscopic regulation and control.    As for the use and management of funds, since development  areas have various levels of responsibility systems or  contractual restrictions for comprehensive agricultural  development at all levels, the effective use of development  funds is guaranteed. Zhejiang has done very well in the  procurement of agricultural development funds. They have  reached the financial ratio of 1.47:1, exceeding the ratio of  1:1 demanded by the center. In keeping with the principle that  "whoever borrows the money repays it, whoever lends the money  gets it back, and whoever profits assumes responsibility,"  repayment measures for the repayable funds are practical.  Despite the fact that the amount of funds invested by the  center is not very large at the present time, since 50 percent  is used with compensation, it can form a revolving investment  mechanism when this is retrieved.    [RENMIN RIBAO] At present, some of the funds for  comprehensive agricultural development must be repaid. Could  you tell me what specific contents this has?    [Li] This is also a question I wanted to talk about. In the  course of establishing a socialist market economic structure, it  is necessary to renew concepts, improve our understanding, and  change the traditional idea that "the state finances while the  peasants farm." The partially compensated use of the  comprehensive agricultural development funds was confirmed right  from the very beginning. The specific arrangements are: 50  percent of investment is made by the center in projects without  compensation, while the other 50 percent must be repaid in due  time. The funds retrieved can be reinvested for revolving  investment purposes. The compensated use of agricultural  development funds is a great reform in agricultural-support  funds. On the one hand, it can enhance the sense of  responsibility of the funds user and improve the efficiency of  funds use. On the other hand, it is possible to gradually  alleviate the long-standing shortage of agricultural funds  through revolving use.    [RENMIN RIBAO] In interviews, we mostly heard calls to  initiate projects and ask for funds, and this shows the great  appeal of comprehensive development to all localities. We would  like you to talk about how the funds are invested in this area.    [Li] Comprehensive development funds are divided into three  parts, which I have mentioned previously. The main source of  funds or the original main channel was agricultural development  funds, which included proceeds taken out of budget regulating  funds, farmland use tax, tax levied on special agricultural and  forestry products, and others. Since the introduction of some  reform measures, some of the original funds channels have  disappeared and others channels have no funds coming in.  Following the continuous development of comprehensive  agricultural development, investment will surely be increased in  the future. At present, the center directly makes provisions  for these funds in its budget each year. Moreover, it is going  to increase this year by year. The net land value-added tax  portion of the property value-added tax recently levied by the  state should be included in the investment plan for  comprehensive agricultural development by all possible means.  Moreover, the portion of tax levied excessively on special  agricultural and forestry products in previous years should  mostly be used for comprehensive agricultural development. Bank  loans should be increased year by year on the present basis.  The strategic consideration is that funds for comprehensive  agricultural development should gradually tilt toward the  central and western regions. On the whole, funds used for  comprehensive agricultural development can only be increased,  but not the other way round.</p>

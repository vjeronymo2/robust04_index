			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Bosnian peace efforts falter Moslem forces yesterday tried to push forward around Tuzla, the biggest Bosnian government stronghold in the north-east, as an upsurge of fighting defied renewed international efforts to end the war in Bosnia. Sarajevo radio said the Bosnian army had advanced on Mount Majevica, high ground overlooking Tuzla, one of six UN 'safe areas' in Bosnia. The radio also said the centre of Tuzla and the north-west part of the Tuzla airfield came under Serb fire. Serbian radio, quoting military sources, confirmed heavy fighting in the region. The Bosnian army push is seen as a move to strengthen the land links between Sarajevo, Tuzla and Zenica, the three main government strongholds in Bosnia. Some European observers felt the international community's failure to come out clearly in favour of a specific peace plan has fuelled the renewed fighting.</p>

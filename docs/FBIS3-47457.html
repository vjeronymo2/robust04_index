			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Hosokawa has announced plans to move  up the review of the "Guideline for the Defense Buildup Plan"  one year and to reflect the review's results in the 1995 budget.  In response, the Defense Agency [DA] is now examining the  possibility of ending the Midterm Defense Buildup Plan (1991 to  1995) in 1994. No decision, however, has been made about how to  proceed with the review in the future because a coordination of  views has yet to be carried out between the DA and the prime  minister on the review, and DA is at a loss over how to deal  with the review.    Prime Minister Hosokawa intends to inaugurate his private  advisory body this spring with the mandate to study a new  defense guideline to replace the current guideline and to come  up with conclusions on the new defense guideline. The DA will  start working on the new guideline after this summer in line  with the conclusion. Because the current Midterm Defense Buildup  Plan is designed to formulate the guideline, "The DA considers  it natural to launch a new midterm defense buildup plan in 1995  after ending the current Midterm Defense Buildup Plan in 1994"  to reflect the new guideline in the 1995 budget (says a DA  source).    It will be hard for the DA to get the cabinet to decide on  the new guideline and the new midterm defense buildup plan  during 1994 because of procedural difficulties and a heavy  workload. As a last resort, the idea is surfacing that the new  midterm defense buildup plan should be launched in 1996 as  scheduled.    Nonetheless, the prime minister has yet to give the DA  clear-cut instructions, including on the way to handle the new  midterm defense buildup plan, and this appears to be heightening  the irritation in the DA. DA Administrative Vice Minister  Shigeru Hatakeyama told a news conference on 10 January that  "(the prime minister's remarks) are his personal opinion, and  his remarks cannot be considered to be his instructions."</p>

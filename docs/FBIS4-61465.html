			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the heading "Panorama": "Letter </F> by Hasan Hasanov to Leaders of a Number of International  Organizations"]    [Text] Minister of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan Hasan  Hasanov has sent a message to the leaders of a number of  authoritative international organizations. As the ANS-PRESS  agency was told by the press service of the foreign policy  department of the Republic, in the letter Hasan Hasanov stresses  that such an appeal has been necessitated by numerous  declarations by the leaders of Armenia to the effect that their  republic has nothing to do with the Armenian-Azeri conflict. In  conjunction with this, the minister of foreign affairs of  Azerbaijan refers to certain facts that testify to the direct  participation of official Yerevan in the armed aggression  against the Republic of Azerbaijan. In his letter the head of  the diplomatic department of the republic gives a chronology of  combat actions in the zone of the conflict, the response to them  on the part of international organizations, and facts testifying  to the direct participation of Armenia in the aggression. "The  war is being fought on the territory of Azerbaijan by the armed  forces of Armenia with the use of the separatist forces of  Nagorno-Karabakh. The Armenian side is using in combat actions  heavy materiel covered by the CFE Treaty, under which the  materiel should be located on the territory of Armenia," says  the letter. According to the assertions of the head of the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan, the facts given  indicate that Armenia has acted from the very beginning as the  originator, organizer, and key participant in the armed  aggression against the sovereign state of Azerbaijan.</p>

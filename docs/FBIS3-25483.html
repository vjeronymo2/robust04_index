			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Mangosuthu  Buthelezi has denied reports which quoted him as saying he would  not take part in the April election even if his demands were met  by the government and the ANC [African National Congress]. In a  telephone interview from Ulundi, Dr. Buthelezi accused the media  of malicious and irresponsible reporting:    [Buthelezi] I would like to say that that is absolutely  false. I take this as part and parcel of the propaganda that is  being mounted by certain sections of the media against me,  against the IFP, and against the Freedom Alliance, because I  would be mad to talk like that. Because, after all, even today  there was a meeting between my colleagues and members of the  government. They were seeking ways of trying to find a way  which would make us participate if our concerns, as expressed in  the document of the 19th of December which we gave to both the  ANC and the government, were met. All I said when one of the  journalists was putting the question is that in fact it seems to  me that the government and ANC were deliberately stringing us  along until we were left without any time to campaign.    Dr. Buthelezi was allegedly misquoted after he spoke to  local  and foreign journalists at Johannesburg's Jan Smuts Airport  following a meeting with Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af  Ugglas.</p>

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Compliance is expensive for Japanese banks - A look at the rising number of floating rate note issues THE search by Japanese banks for regulatory capital that will push them comfortably ahead of minimum international levels is becoming increasingly expensive, as floating rate note issues by two leading banks yesterday demonstrated. Tokai Bank and Sanwa Bank both launched issues of perpetual floating rate notes in the international bond markets, adding to a growing wave of such paper in recent months. In what is believed to be the first yen issue by a Japanese city bank (or commercial bank) other than the Bank of Tokyo, Tokai raised Y40bn (Dollars 330m), while Sanwa raised Dollars 200m to add to a similar Dollars 300m issue of last week. Access by Japanese banks to the yen bond markets has until now been restricted to a restricted list including the country's long-term credit banks, the Bank of Tokyo and Norinchukin Bank. It is a privilege which has long been expected to crumble as long-term credit banks such as the Industrial Bank of Japan have themselves extended into areas like securities. Both of yesterday's note issues carry what are widely seen as high margins over market interest rates, reflecting the shrinking band of investors prepared to buy subordinated debt issued by Japanese banks. The notes were reported to have been sold mainly to domestic investors. They also have a step-up interest rate structure, making them increasingly expensive to finance after the first five years. A call option after five years allows the issuers to redeem them at that stage, making them effectively five-year bonds - although for regulatory reasons they are treated as perpetuals, making them eligible as tier two capital under Bank for International Settlements rules. Tokai's notes pay a yield 10 basis points below the Japanese long-term prime rate - at present 5.2 per cent, but widely rumoured to be about to fall to 4.9 per cent. After five years, the rate jumps to 10 basis points over long-term prime, and after 10 years to 60 basis points. The Sanwa paper carries a margin of 75 basis points over three-month Libor, jumping to 125 and then 175 basis points. The search for tier two capital reflects a concern by the banks that Tokyo share prices may not hold at current levels. With the Nikkei stock index held up at around 17,000 by government support operations, most of the country's banks are likely to clear the 8 per cent minimum capital to risk assets ratio required by the BIS. However the banks say they need greater certainty that their capital levels meet these rules, which come into effect formally at the end of March. Both Tokai and Sanwa were comfortably above the 8 per cent level at the end of last September (8.7 per cent and 8.81 per cent respectively, according to Ibca, the specialist bank credit rating agency.) Perpetual debt has a further advantage. Other forms of tier two debt do not count towards regulatory capital once they exceed the level of tier one capital (paid-up equity and retained earnings). This limitation does not apply to perpetual loans or securities. Sanwa raised Dollars 800m through similar issues last year, and has raised Dollars 500m so far this year. At those levels, the bank says, it should have no difficulty in refinancing the notes after five years (or in the case of one issue, seven years) - although if the level of borrowing rises, the refinancing burden may be greater. Given their need for capital, however, this will not be the first consideration of the banks.</p>

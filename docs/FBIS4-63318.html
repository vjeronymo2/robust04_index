			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] </F>   [Text] Vladikavkaz May 21 TASS -- The situation in parts of  north Ossetia under the state of emergency remains tense,  according to reports from military sources.    Shooting broke out five times in the Prigorod district last  night. On the whole, the situation is under control of the  Russian army and local law enforcement bodies.    Head of the temporary administration Vladimir Lozovoy said  in  his address to the population that "attacks on civilians and  police and army check points and hostage taking continue in the  zone of the state of emergency. It is outrageous when members  of local administrations become organisers of and accomplices in  unlawful actions. Heads of bodies of power and power structures  who are unable or unwilling to carry out their duties to ensure  law and order will be called to account. I call on the citizens  of North Ossetia and Ingushetia to resist provocations of  extremists who use any means to thwart the settlement of the  conflict."</p>

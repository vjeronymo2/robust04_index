			<p>BFN     [Text] France will not resume its nuclear tests even after  1995. This sentence uttered by Francois Mitterrand at the  Elysee sounds like a promise, a determination and a political  testament. The head of state this afternoon extended an  invitation to all French figures concerned with defense affairs  and nuclear issues. Addressing his guests, among whom were  Defense Minister Francois Leotard and the chiefs-of-staff of the  three armed services, the president, standing between the French  and European flags, thus made the promise that nuclear tests  would no longer be carried out in France: [begin recording]    Mitterrand: No other tests will take place before  May 1995, that is before a year from now. I know that a good  dialectician... [pauses] It is said that this is not very  important because this decision is not dangerous if taken within  a year; the decision will be taken as soon as Mitterrand is  gone! Let me say this to you, ladies and gentlemen: Nobody will  do it after me! Nobody will do it, unless of course, another  nuclear power starts its tests. I have already said that we  will not do it because France would not like to see the French  people and the whole world come to harm by re-launching a  nuclear arms race, thus holding the third world and all the poor  countries up to ridicule. Nor would France like to be the  country that puts nuclear war on the map again. [end recording].  [passage omitted]</p>

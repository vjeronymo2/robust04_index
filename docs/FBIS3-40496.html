(Shinichiro Torii, president) has succeeded in greatly  increasing antibody production capability by combining serum  globulin and an artificial vaccine, which poses no danger of  infection but does little on its own to stimulate antibody  production. When researchers tried to produce antibodies against  the AIDS virus in mice, they found that not only did antibody  production begin rapidly, but the amount produced was double  that produced by previous methods. This discovery brings us one  step closer to creation of an AIDS vaccine. This method is  expected to be effective in the case of other diseases such as  malaria for which vaccines have not yet been developed.    The artificial vaccine is called a peptide vaccine, and it  consists of many artificially synthesized antigenic amino acid  sequences from proteins on the surface of the virus. This kind  of vaccine is different from a vaccine in which the virus has  been attenuated, so although the peptide vaccine poses no danger  of infection, it is very small as vaccines go, and the white  blood cells (macrophages) that produce antibodies do not readily  take it up. Therefore, it is not effective in stimulating  antibody production and its practical application has been  delayed.    Professor Ikai and researchers from Suntory made use of the  fact that macrophages easily take up _a_2-macroglobulin  (_a_2M),  a serum globulin, so they combined the peptide vaccine with  _a_2M to solve the problem. _a_2M is a serum globulin that  binds  to receptors on the macrophage surface. The researchers used  _a_2M purified from human blood. Suntory researchers  synthesized  a peptide sequence of 23 amino acids that plays a major role in  infection by the AIDS virus, and they used this to make the  vaccine.    When researchers repeatedly injected mice with the vaccine  and checked the amount of antibody production after three weeks,  they found that although the peptide alone hardly caused any  antibody production, when it was linked to _a_2M the effect was  dramatic, and the mice produced twice the amount as previous  methods that do spur antibody production but require the use of  toxic, oil-based adjuvants.    Combining the artificial vaccine with _a_2M increases its  rate of uptake by macrophages roughly fifty times, which also  greatly shortens the time before antibody production begins.    Vaccines in general use are made with attenuated virus. They  stimulate high antibody production, but because the major genes  of the virus still remain, there is always a chance of  infection, which means they cannot be used for an AIDS vaccine.  With the artificial vaccine there is no fear of infection, and  safety will be enhanced even more if the essential portion of  the _a_2M is also synthesized.</p>

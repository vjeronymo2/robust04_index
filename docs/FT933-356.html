			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Boosey &amp; Hawkes little changed at Pounds 1.41m - Tough conditions in mainland Europe and Japan BOOSEY &amp; HAWKES, the instrument maker and music publisher, reported a small decline in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.44m to Pounds 1.41m for the first half of 1993. Mr Richard Holland, chief executive, said the group had been glad to maintain profits in view of tough conditions in mainland Europe, and particularly in Japan. He expected the group to maintain its position for the rest of this year and then to resume slow growth. Sales of instruments to Japan, mainly woodwind, were down 15 per cent by volume and 10 per cent by value in the half, while sales in Europe remained flat. However, the instruments division, which last year accounted for just over a third of operating profits, was benefiting from production efficiencies after action taken last year, including the movement of woodwind production from the Frankfurt area to eastern Germany. Total turnover increased from Pounds 26.5m to Pounds 29.4m. The rise reflected sterling's devaluation, Mr Holland said, adding that in real terms turnover had been flat. The publishing division was making steady progress, Mr Holland said, with significant strength in the US. He expected royalties from the best-selling third symphony by the Polish composer Gorecki to start arriving in the second half. The group was also delighted that the EC looks set to adopt a copyright term of 70 years from July 1995. This would give an enhanced income stream in future years. By the end of this year Rakhmaninov's music will not be covered under the UK's present 50-year copyright rule, and Bartok's comes out of copyright in 1995. Net borrowings were Pounds 21m, giving gearing of 98 per cent at the end of the half, compared with Pounds 14.2m at the end of the year when gearing was 70 per cent. Mr Holland said that because of the nature of its business the group was 'not unhappy with gearing at this level'. About 75 per cent of its instrument sales are made in the second half. Earnings per share were 18.5p (18.6p) and an unchanged interim dividend of 6p is proposed.</p>

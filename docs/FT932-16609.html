			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Next stage for the franc fort The French franc has been granted a stay of execution by the currency markets following the formation of a pro-EC government after the parliamentary elections. But it will only receive a full reprieve when it becomes clear that a politically acceptable method has been found of maintaining the franc fort into the future. Essentially this means that German interest rates must continue to fall, not too slowly, and with them the risk premium attaching to French rates. The new prime minister Mr Edouard Balladur has lost no time in underpinning the policy and the relationship with Germany on which it rests. He has arranged the earliest practical meeting with the German chancellor Mr Helmut Kohl and he may depart from protocol to meet the Bundesbank president Mr Helmut Schlesinger. Some insight into the portfolio of ideas available to him can be obtained from a report, A French Perspective on Emu, published by the Commissariat General du Plan, just published in English. Since the demise of old-style French planning the Commissariat has continued as a semi-official think-tank, licensed to go beyond the government line of the day. Last autumn's crisis, says the report, 'demonstrated the volume and irresistible weight of capital movements that an expected currency depreciation could generate'. These events risked making monetary union, the arrival of which had been previously taken for granted, 'seem a very remote and not very credible goal'. With that prop taken away, it becomes questionable, say the authors, how far the strategy of maintaining the exchange rate mechanism for four to six years before the full transition to European Monetary Union can be maintained. The authors therefore fly the kite of a 'monetary Schengen' - named after a group of hard-core EC countries which agreed to dismantle their frontier formalities before other members were ready. The authors are careful to say that this would not affect the formal undertakings of the Maastricht treaty. Four concrete steps are proposed for the countries on the fast track: Formal commitment to ERM central rates and a possible reduction of fluctuation margins from 2 1/4 to 1 per cent; All central banks to hold reserves denominated in the currencies of partner countries; Strengthening of mutual support mechanisms for intramarginal intervention; Central bank independence. Mr Balladur has made a good start by announcing in his first week his intention to make the Banque de France independent by the summer. This is a move which the Bundesbank can only applaud. The suggestion about reserves is mainly cosmetic and should not be allowed to become a focus of controversy. The Bundesbank cannot be expected to cheer from the rooftops the idea of more extensive intervention to support partner currencies. But the Commissariat legitimately points out that the Bundesbank has given just such support to the franc in the crises of the past few months, even when it did not suit immediate German interests. Indeed there could be a time when the D-Mark will require support itself. The biggest Bundesbank opposition will be to any early narrowing of margins. It is possible to sympathise both with the Bundesbank's secret preference for wider margins and the French preference for narrower ones. For the present margins are too narrow for a managed exchange rate system and too wide to inspire confidence in permanently fixed rates. The heart of the matter, however, is the Commissariat's suggestion that Germany should 'agree to internationalise the formulation of its monetary policy' in advance of 1997. This is not outrageous so long as it does not conflict with price stability. Central bank independence implies freedom to implement monetary policy, not to chose the geographical area over which that policy applies. The practical weight of Bundesbank objections will be much less once it is clear that further big reductions of German short-term interest rates will not stoke up inflation in Germany itself. The underlying rate of monetary expansion is believed to be within the 4 1/2 per cent to 6 1/2 per cent target corridor, but nearer the upper end. This, in practice, leaves a good deal of discretion about how far and how fast to reduce interest rates. Facts such as the unexpectedly severe recession, modest pay settlements and the belated but welcome resistance of some German employers to unrealistic wage parity commitments in the east, are all signs that the battle against inflation is being won and that no loss of credibility need be involved if German monetary policy were to take a slightly more international and long-term approach.</p>

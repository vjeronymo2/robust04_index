			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / International Company News: Japanese ministry inspects housing loan groups JAPAN'S Ministry of Finance has started to inspect the country's eight housing loan companies, which face an increase in bad loans due to the slump in the property market. The move reflects increasing worries at the ministry over the companies' deteriorating property-related loan portfolios, which include funds extended to resort and golf course developments. Japan's housing loan companies were set up in the 1960s to finance housing and property projects for individuals. However, the companies sharply increased their exposure to high-risk developments during the years of loose credit in the late 1980s. Financial problems at the housing loan companies will burden the commercial banks, which lent heavily to the loan companies. According to Teikoku Data Bank, a Japanese credit agency, loans extended by the eight housing loan companies to corporations which failed last year totalled Y90.7bn (Dollars 737m). Teikoku added that since the housing loan companies were not required to book defaulted loans until more than a year after a borrower had stopped making payments, the underlying amount of non-performing loans could be very large. Last year, Chigin-Seiho Housing Loan asked its creditors and shareholders to co-operate with its restructuring plan. The company had lent to Nanatomi, a property developer and stock speculator which went under with outstanding debts of Y286.3bn. Nippon Housing Loan, a leading housing loan company, said it received a request from the ministry for a special inspection. Nippon Housing Loan had outstanding loans of Y2,028bn as of last July. The company procured funds through Industrial Bank of Japan, Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank, and Sanwa Bank, commercial banks, which had outstanding loans over Y500bn as of last September.</p>

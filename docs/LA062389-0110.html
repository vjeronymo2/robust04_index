			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> The British rock group the Who launched a 25th anniversary tour of North  America Wednesday night before an audience of about 5,000 at Glens Falls Civic  Center in Upstate New York, playing 40 songs during a three-hour show. Dressed  in a baggy gray suit with his hair in a ponytail, lead guitarist Pete Townshend  leaped in the air and banged power chords on his instrument with his trademark  windmill motion. But in a concession to age and hearing damage caused by years  of loud music, Townshend strummed an acoustic guitar for most of the show. The  quartet was supplemented by 11 musicians, including a five-piece horn section,  and played on a huge stage with gleaming mirrors as a backdrop. Except for two  indoor performances of the rock opera "Tommy" in New York and Los Angeles, the  24-city tour will play in outdoor stadiums. The band tonight will be in  Toronto, the city that hosted the Who's last performance before their breakup  in 1983. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

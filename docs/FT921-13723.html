			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / International Company News: French water group sees net earnings tumble 20% LYONNAISE des Eaux-Dumez, the water distribution and construction group, estimates that net profits fell by up to 20 per cent to FFr1.13bn (Dollars 209m) last year, compared with FFr1.4bn in 1990. The fall comes after heavy provisions for the impact of the economic slowdown on the group's hotel and leisure industry construction businesses, and for its part in the Channel tunnel, where a dispute over extra costs is believed to be nearing settlement with Eurotunnel, the operator. However, a large part of the provisions have been compensated for by capital gains on asset sales over the past year, part of the strategy of group chairman Mr Jerome Monod in focusing on the group's core businesses. This meant the overall profit decline was less than the market had expected. Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez expected net profits in the current year to recover slightly, to at least equal the 1990 result. Final 1991 results, due to be published in the next few months, will also be hit by the poor performance of Westburne, the Canadian building materials and electrical equipment distribution subsidiary, the group warned. The Australian subsidiary of Paris-based bank Societe Generale has joined the Sydney Futures Exchange as a floor member, Reuter reports. Societe Generale Australia Futures joins 28 other Australian and international financial institutions as a floor member.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, June 12 (AFP) -- Moshood Abiola, the Nigerian  opposition figure who proclaimed himself president Saturday [11  June] a year after the cancellation of his apparent electoral  victory, announced he had named a government in defiance of the  country's military leaders.    "From this moment, a new government of national unity is in  power throughout the length and breadth of the federal Republic  of Nigeria, led by me...as president and commander-in-chief,"  Abiola told a crowd of nearly three thousand people at a  clandestine meeting.    A copy of the speech was obtained by AFP during Saturday  night.    "My government of national unity is the only legitimate  constituted authority in the federal Republic of Nigeria, as of  now."    He provided no details on the government's composition but  said that from now on all democratic institutions dissolved by  military ruler General Sani Abacha after he seized power in  November had been re-established.    "I call on the usurper, General Sani Abacha, to announce his  resignation forthwith, together with the rest of his illegal  ruling council.    "We are prepared to enter into negotiations with them to  work  out the mechanics for a smooth transfer of power. I pledge that  if they hand over quietly they will be retired with all their  entitlements and their positions will be accorded all the  respect due to them."</p>

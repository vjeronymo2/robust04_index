			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Exceptionals slow growth at Border BORDER Television, the Carlisle-based ITV company, reported profits of Pounds 1.25m pre-tax for the 12 months to April 30 - a rise of just over 2 per cent on the comparable Pounds 1.22m. Turnover fell from Pounds 11.8m to Pounds 11m. The outcome, however, was struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 501,000 related to redundancies; profits at the operating level showed a 44 per cent jump to Pounds 1.75m. Mr Melvyn Bragg, chairman, said that while the early weeks of the current year matched the previous period, 'there are signs that the economy has stabilised which leads to an expectation of real growth in the second half'. A recommended final dividend of 2p brings the total for the year to 3.3p (2.7p), covered 2.5 times by earnings of 8.3p (7.6p).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] While Kresimir Zubak was blaming the Muslim-Bosniak  side for obstructing the Washington agreement, representatives  of the Croat National Council [HNV] of Bosnia-Herzegovina  stressed today at a news conference in Zagreb that the  [Washington] agreement is being obstructed by those who have so  far pursued the HDZ's [Croatian Democratic Union] policy toward  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Bosiljka Bucan reports.    [Bucan] As the HNV was one of the original initiators of the  Washington agreement, it is our desire to have it materialized  as soon as possible, [Franciscan] Brother Luka Markesic said on  behalf of the HNV. He went on to explain this.    [Begin Markesic recording] The Washington agreement is the  true articulation of the political will of the Croatian people  in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is a realistic political alternative  to the carving up of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the war and ethnic  cleansing there, the so-called humane resettlement, and the  persecution of people. This is, after all, common knowledge.    This is why this agreement was welcomed with so much joy and  why our people have immediately embraced it. I can really speak  for our people as a whole. [end recording]    [Bucan] Yet, Brother Luka Markesic added, we are coming  across attempts to obstruct it. This is why we believe that it  cannot be implemented by those same people who until yesterday  opposed the unity of Croats and Muslim-Bosniaks and an  indivisible and united Bosnia-Herzegovina. In this sense, he  sharply criticized the HDZ leadership of this republic.    Speaking about some other issues raised at the conference,  he  mentioned Bosanska Posavina and the Serb corridor through this  area.    [Begin Markesic recording] We want once again to express our  determination and resolve to oppose the corridor through  Bosanska Posavina. [end recording]    [Bucan] Our reasoning is simple. The corridor only supports  the materialization of greater-Serbian policies. Brother Luka  Markesic also said there is only symbolic care for the return of  refugees. He therefore demanded that the HNV's work and  activities be given more coverage in the Croat media.</p>

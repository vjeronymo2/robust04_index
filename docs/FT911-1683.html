			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Old county names may return to Welsh map THE government has rejected calls for an elected assembly for Wales as part of proposed local-government reform in the principality - and opted instead for a reorganisation bringing back many of the old county names. The assembly idea, which is supported by the Labour party, has been rejected by Mr Nicholas Bennett, the Welsh Office junior minister with responsibility for local-government matters. Instead, the government is proposing to reorganise the eight counties and 37 districts into 19 unitary authorities. Under the proposals, some old county names such as Pembrokeshire, Breconshire and Anglesey will return. The Welsh county and district authorities agree on the need for single-tier authorities to replace the present two, but there is little common ground on which tier should be the foundation of the new structure. At a meeting last month with Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, each proposed the abolition of the other. Mr Hunt is now suggesting that the capital, Cardiff, and the three main towns - Swansea, Newport and Wrexham - should in effect revert to their status before the 1974 reorganisation. He is also proposing that the vast county of Powys, which covers the whole of largely rural mid Wales, should be covered by six authorities. In the north, Gwynedd would be abolished, with Anglesey reverting to its pre-1974 position and the remainder called Caernarfon. Clwyd would remain as a name, but it would lose Wrexham. The present county of Mid Glamorgan would remain as a unit, but it would lose Merthyr Tydfil, which would revert to its pre-1974 borough status. In the west, Dyfed would be abolished, part going to form Ceredigion and the rest returning to the old names Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire. Mr Hunt is to hold meetings with the local authorities in the next few weeks and further fine tuning is possible.</p>

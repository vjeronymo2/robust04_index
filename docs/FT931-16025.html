			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Christmas bonus for credit cards SPENDING on credit and debit cards reached an unexpectedly high Pounds 2bn over Christmas. Mr John Eaton, managing director of Barclays Merchant Services, which has 45 per cent of the plastic card processing market, said that, although some of the increased use of cards was due to a bigger market share, the figures still indicated higher-than-expected spending. The largest rise in spending was on computers and games which increased by 67 per cent. The use of direct debit cards increased by 54 per cent to Pounds 550m but much of that was due to the move away from writing cheques. Boots forecast, Page 10</p>

BTA's  correspondent in Blagoevgrad (southwestern Bulgaria) said Prof.  Stankushev cited this figure at a conference organized by the  town council and sponsored by a private company. Drug abuse is  most widespread in Sofia and other cities. Prof. Stankushev  also said 90 percent of addicts take hard drugs which, in his  view, makes "the heroin country" an apt description of Bulgaria,  the correspondent reported. [passage omitted]</p>

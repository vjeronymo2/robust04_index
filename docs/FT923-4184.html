			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Survey of Mobile Communications (1): Telephones lose strings  -The emerging generation of advanced digital equipment and services promises alternatives perhaps even to the hard-wired telephone itself UNTIL RECENTLY, the telephone had changed little since Alexander Graham Bell invented it more than a century ago. For the majority of business and residential customers, it remained an impersonal piece of equipment, inconveniently tethered to the wall by a cable. Beginning in the 1980s, cellular mobile telephone services began to add a new, more flexible dimension to telecommunications and proved so successful with business customers in some markets, particularly newly deregulated environments like those in the US and UK, that network operators could barely keep pace with demand. To date however, these pioneering cellular systems, built around analogue technology, have been too costly for all but the most affluent domestic users, and in some markets have suffered from problems such as dropped lines and interference - the effects of traffic congestion and capacity constraints. Now a new generation of advanced digital mobile communications equipment and services is emerging which promises secure, interference-free, cost-effective and feature-rich alternatives not only to older analogue cellular systems, but perhaps also to the hard-wired telephone itself. Despite the recession which has slowed growth in some markets, including the UK, mobile communications is one of the fastest-growing and most profitable telecommunications sectors. Fuelled by advances in technology, competition and economies of scale, equipment prices are coming down. By the end of the decade most consumers in wealthy nations will be able to afford a mobile telephone - heralding the possibility of a mass market for cellular telephony for the first time. The introduction of digital networks, coupled with the opening up of new markets in Asia, eastern Europe and South America, is expected to help boost the worldwide total of cellular subscribers from about 15.5m at the start of this year to more than 50m by the mid-1990s. Already the expansion of analogue networks and the building of new digital systems are generating a surge of infrastructure and end-user equipment orders. By 1996 EMCI, a Washington-based telecommunications consultancy, estimates that cellular telephone handset sales worldwide will reach nearly 19m units, valued at Dollars 11bn. Cellular systems have managed to establish themselves as a vital part of the telecommunications profile of many countries. In the developed western nations mobile telephony has proved an important business tool, particularly for small businesses, while governments have discovered that licensing private sector mobile communications operators can be a useful way to introduce competition into a market previously controlled by state-owned monopolies. For example, in Europe most governments have licensed private sector operators to provide mobile telecommunications services including digital cellular networks, although in every country except the UK, fixed wire telephone services are still a state-controlled monopoly. Meanwhile developing nations, including those in eastern Europe, have found that cellular systems can provide a quick and relatively low-cost alternative to inadequate, unreliable or non-existent conventional fixed telephone networks. Last year, despite slower subscriber growth rates in some countries, the worldwide cellular customer base grew by about 5m or nearly 50 per cent, according to EMCI. The introduction of digital networks in North America and Asia, particularly Japan, should help fuel continued cellular subscriber growth over the next few years. At present Asia accounts for just 17 per cent of world subscriber numbers but this is expected to rise to nearly 25 per cent by the mid-1990s. However, much attention is focused on western Europe where the first digital cellular networks based on the pan-European GSM (Groupe Special Mobile or Global System for Mobile communications) standard began commercial operation earlier this year - about 12 months after what many consider to have been an over-ambitious target launch date. Growth is expected to be particularly strong in Germany and France, where proprietary analogue systems and lack of competition have kept prices high and demand low. Over the next few years GSM services will roll out in 18 European countries and by the turn of the century the European Commission estimates that half the continent's 100m telephone extensions will be cordless. The delay in the start-up of GSM services reflects several technical and administrative factors including the design complexity of a sophisticated digital network together with wrangles over issues like equipment-type approval. In the process, some significant compromises have had to be made and some of the most important features of GSM, like the ability of subscribers to use their handsets anywhere in Europe where there is a GSM network, have yet to be implemented because of administrative delays in negotiating 'roaming' agreements between network operators. As a result, it is unlikely that there will be more than a handful of roaming agreements before the end of this year. It could be two or three years before GSM can be marketed as a pan-European service. Initially, GSM handsets are expected to be more bulky and more expensive in most markets than their analogue equivalents. However, these disadvantages are unlikely to persist for long. Mr Gordon Aspin, responsible for mobile communications product development at the UK-based Technology Partnership consultancy, says: 'We are developing hand-portable equipment for our clients which will compete with any analogue cellular telephone on the market today in terms of size, weight, talk-time and manufacturing cost.' The key to achieving this lies in silicon chip integration, improving power consumption and new battery technology. Although Mr Aspin accepts that the development costs for GSM products are substantially higher than for analogue cellular - costs which manufacturers will try to recover in the initial price of terminals - he adds: 'In the longer term GSM, with its large market in Europe and increasingly elsewhere, holds out the promise of very low cost terminals.' The introduction of GSM services will also provide network operators with opportunities for delivering 'value-added' services. For example Sema Group, which has developed a number of products for GSM networks including the database software for locating, tracking and authenticating subscribers on a network, has designed a 'short message service centre' for digital networks. Mr Martin O'Byrne, Sema Group communications division managing director, says this will allow cellular operators to provide voice mail services on their GSM networks. Each GSM subscriber will also have a 'subscriber identity module' - a smart card which stores customer information and plugs into any GSM handset to make it work. This smart card, rather than the telephone, contains the subscriber's number and provides the network with other information, for example where to send bills. Some industry analysts already predict that by separating the sale of service from the sale of equipment the GSM smart card could turn the cellular service provision industry on its head and allow credit card companies and others to enter the field. Other important changes could also be on the way. The introduction of digital cellular services such as GSM and PCNs (personal communications networks) in the UK which are aimed specifically at mass consumer markets, is resulting in a proliferation of mobile communications services and tariff structures. Analogue system operators in Scandinavia and the UK have already responded to the imminent arrival of digital networks by repackaging their services around different tariff structures designed to attract new customers. For example Cellnet, one of the two analogue network operators in the UK, is to launch a service called LifeLine targeted at low-use customers after its research showed that about 1m people would consider using a mobile phone in the very near future if the pricing package was right. In some markets, including the UK, there is a risk that cellular customers will face a bewildering array of service offerings. 'It is a confused market as it is and it is going to become even more confusing,' warns Mr David Savage, chairman of the Cellular Service Providers Committee within the UK Federation of Communications Services. Meanwhile, some people are already looking towards the development of a truly global mobile communications standard - a third generation of mobile communications systems which would be based on a single common standard. The prospect for the introduction of FPLMTS (future public land mobile telecommunications systems) early next century was given a boost earlier this year when the World Administrative Radio Conference agreed to designate a common band of frequencies around the world for the next generation of mobile communications services. In the meantime several organisations and private sector groups have announced plans for satellite-based global mobile communications systems. Among them is Motorola's Dollars 2bn Iridium project, which is intended to go into service in 1996. It involves the launch of 77 low-orbit satellites and would bring satellites into direct competition with terrestrial mobile communications technologies. Whether future mobile communications needs are met by terrestrial or satellite-based systems, the day when children ask whether it is really true that telephones used to be attached to the wall by wires moves ever closer.</p>

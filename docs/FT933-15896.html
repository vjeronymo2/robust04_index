			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Jobless total up again in west Germany THE unemployment rate in western Germany edged up to 7 per cent last month as recession continued to plague the economy and the summer lull took its toll. This compared with 6.9 per cent in May and 5.6 in June last year. People drawing benefit rose by an unadjusted 18,300 to 2.17m. Seasonally adjusted the increase was close to 30,000. But the official jobless total was also reduced by tighter controls on registration. While some 315,000 people were newly registered as unemployed during the month, a further 297,000 'ended their unemployment', according to an official statement. However, vacancies were down 8 per cent on June last year. Separate figures from the Federal Labour Office showed that in May 482,000 (1.7 per cent) fewer people were in work in the west than in the same month last year. Pressures on the labour market were also illustrated by a reduction in new apprenticeships from almost 44,000 in June last year to 24,000. Meanwhile, numbers working short-time in the region during June fell 41,500 to around 897,000. There was also a modest increase in joblessness in the east, where the rate was unchanged on the month at 14.4 per cent, although slightly down on the 14.7 per cent recorded in June last year. Although there are some signs that the recession is bottoming out, unemployment is expected to continue increasing as industrial employers slim down their operations to restore lost competitiveness. Diesel engine and plant maker Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz, for example, yesterday announced that a further 2,000 jobs would have to go.</p>

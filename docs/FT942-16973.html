			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / UK Company News: Hogg confirms bid approaches Hogg Group, the medium-sized insurance broker, confirmed yesterday that it had 'received preliminary approaches from a number of parties which may or may not lead to an offer'. HSBC Holdings last week announced the acquisition of a 6 per cent stake  - worth about Pounds 6m - in Hogg Group, prompting speculation in the City that a takeover bid was in the offing. Mr Anthony Howland-Jackson, chairman and chief executive of Hogg, said HSBC had shown interest in the past but that no formal approach had been made recently. Yesterday's announcement prompted further upward movement in Hogg's shares which closed up 23p at 205p. See Lex</p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Books: A tilt at the New Testament THE EVOLUTION OF THE GOSPELS by Enoch Powell Yale University Press Pounds 16.99, 224 pages Enoch Powell courts controversy. That is no bad thing, except that he seems to have a Quixotic talent for picking fights he is bound to lose badly. In this book - a new translation, with commentary, of the gospel according to St Matthew - he does so by returning to his roots as a classical scholar, to tilt at the windmills of New Testament scholarship by proposing a radical new thesis about the Gospels. There are a number of accounts of the life and teachings of Jesus, of which four were made official by the early Church. One of these, the gospel called 'John', is a sophisticated theological work written much later than the others. The others, known as the 'Synoptic' gospels, are more historical in character. If the vehement world of biblical scholarship has a standard view about these writings, it goes somewhat as follows. The earliest is 'Mark'. It was written in the late fifties AD, in Rome, perhaps under St Peter's supervision. It seems originally to have contained neither the nativity nor resurrection stories. 'Mark's' purpose was to persuade Roman converts that Jesus's crucifixion - a Roman punishment for terrorism - was the result of a plot by Jewish leaders, who were too afraid of the populace to stone him for blasphemy. 'Matthew' and 'Luke', the standard view continues, were written independently of each other at least two decades after 'Mark', and were based both on 'Mark' and a separate source of anecdotes and sayings, now lost, which scholars call 'Q'. Any discriminating reader of the gospels will notice furtherpoints. 'Mark' is a crude work, a record of miracles and deeds, with little of Jesus's teachings in them. 'Luke' is a skilful literary work, whose author explores motivation in his characters and crafts a coherent narrative. 'Matthew' is clumsy, a poorly edited compilation from unordered and overlapping materials. But 'Matthew' has the virtues of its vices; alone among the gospels it records great tranches of ethical teachings, as if its writer (or compilers) had simply transcribed much of 'Q'. Powell's controversial disruption of this standard picture is that 'Matthew' is the original gospel, and 'Luke' and 'Mark' both derive from it, and from it alone. Matthew itself is a composite work, Powell claims, consisting of an early document with later additions and changes. The early document justifies Peter's mission to the Gentiles, the later changes were made to please Peter's opponents, the Christians who wished to remain within Judaism. In thus witnessing doctrinal struggles in the early church, says Powell, Matthew is uniquely important. To establish his theses Powell uses techniques of textual criticism. Although singularly brief, his argument cannot - alas] for it is fun to delve among such arguments - be rehearsed here. But one does not have to be a Greek scholar to see that it fails. For everything Powell says is consistent with the standard view that 'Matthew' and 'Luke' derive from 'Mark' and 'Q' - with Luke perhaps adding something of his own. On the second thesis - that 'Matthew' is a heavily emended text - Powell is less dogmatic, and more plausible. There is little doubt that the gospels were doctored as Church politics required, and 'Matthew' seems worst affected. But this too is consistent with the standard view; it would only be significant if 'Matthew' were indeed the first gospel. Powell ignores the standard view, and he also ignores an even more important matter, which is that the real first gospel is actually Paul's epistles, written - the standard view again - two decades before 'Mark'.</p>

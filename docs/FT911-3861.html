			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Observer: Nipped in bud After excellent vintages for three years running, Bordeaux faces a black year in 1991 as a result of a sharp bout of frost over the weekend. In itself, frost is not all that unusual at this time of year. But the attack last Saturday night fell in parts as low as - 7 deg C, and it followed a particularly mild spell which had brought on the vegetation of the vines unexpectedly early. In consequence, the total Bordeaux vintage this year is already expected to drop by around half, from 800m to 400m bottles. Moreover, not merely will the quantity be down, the quality will also be jeopardised. Some vineyards will be much worse hit than the average; the harvest in Medoc may be down by 70 per cent, and the vintage in some individual vineyards in St Emilion, Graves, Entre-Deux-Mers and Pomerol may be completely wiped out. Wine experts, who last year were groping for superlatives to describe the recent run of superb vintages, are now groping for comparisons for an equally disastrous frost.</p>

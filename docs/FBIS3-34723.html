			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Mushahid Hussain] </F>   [Text] Within the first week of February, senior officials  of the American State Department have come out with policy  statements regarding South Asia which provide some insights into  the Clinton Administration's emerging view of a region that has  assumed great strategic importance in the post-cold War world.    There were two statements by Assistant Secretary of State  for  South Asian Affairs, Robin Raphel, the first on February 4  before the Senate Foreign Relations Sub-Committee on  Near-Eastern and South Asian Affairs and her second was an  address to the Asia Society. The other was a statement from the  US Under Secretary of State for International Security Affairs,  Lynn Davis, who said on February 7 that in regards the nuclear  issue, the United States "will be looking at India and Pakistan  equally and together as we seek to craft a non-proliferation  strategy" for South Asia, thereby publicly accepting that  American policy cannot be selective or discriminatory.    Robin Raphel's two statements are the first from her as  public policy pronouncements regarding American perceptions of  South Asia. Three aspects of the American view of South Asia are  instructive. First there is acceptance by the United States of  the reality that both major South Asian countries, India and  Pakistan, are "nuclear capable and each is also apparently  intent on acquiring ballistic missiles." There is a greater and  more realistic view of security perceptions in South Asia when  Robin Raphel stated before the Asia society that "large  constituencies in both countries firmly believe that their  nation's security is best assured through a nuclear capability."  The American official also recognises in the statement that  neither India nor Pakistan can be "easily persuaded" to forego  the nuclear option.    The second major tenet of American policy towards South Asia  pertains to the announced objective of "launching a multilateral  process to promote arms control non-proliferation and regional  security" and in this regard, the American official discloses  that "both India and Pakistan already accept the mulitlateral  approach in principle but details must be worked out."    The third important aspect of the Raphel policy statement  was  in equating what she described as the "civil war in Afghanistan"  and the "insurgency in Kashmir." In equating the two, a civil  war with a genuine liberation movement whose problem requires  resolution under a United Nations administered plebiscite to  which America is also formally committed at least to the extent  that it is a party to those resolutions, the United States is  viewing both Afghanistan and Kashmir as sources of instability  and violence that need to be defused and contained rather than  Kashmir as a dispute requiring resolution under universally  acknowledged principles of self- determination. This  distinction is important because the approach of the United  States will then be different since containing a problem and  resolving a problem are two different sets of machanisms.    The American policy statement also is specific in the  context  of Pakistan, particularly since it is the first public official  Washington view of this country following the October 1993  elections. Some insights into the American perspectives on  Pakistan as enunciated by the US top policy-maker on South Asia.    -- There is sigh of relief that the "forces of moderation  continue to prevail" since expectations before the elections  about the "triumph of extremism" or that Islamic fundamentalist  parties were predicting big gains have been proven wrong.    -- The October 1993 elections are handled as "the first and  fairest in many years and it is specifically cited that these  elections were "closely supervised by the military under Chief  of Army Staff Waheed" thereby acknowledging the Pakistan Army's  "honest broker" role in national politics.    -- Without saying so in so many words, the American official  seems to be enclosing the ending of "a period of divided  government in Pakistan" with Presidency going to Farooq Leghari  a PPP [Pakistan People's Party] leader who in her words. "was  selected to be President".    -- There is a word of advice to the PPP government with the  formulation that "we are hopeful that the new leadership will be  able to work with the Opposition led by former Prime Minister  Nawaz Sharif to overcome political gridlock".    -- As was to be expected, the American State Department  official lauded Moin Qureshi as providing "an excellent example  of statesmanship and dedication of good government for the  region and the world".    Interestingly, on India the accent of the policy statement  is more on economic ties than a strategic military connection  which was what the Indians were expecting and desperately  wanting after the end of the Cold War. For instance, the US  official stated that "there was more investment by American  companies in India in 1993 than in all the years since  independence, 20 per cent of all Indian exports come to the  United States, the US is the largest source of foreign  investment and commercial technology for India and the US  Commerce Department has designated India as one of the 10 major  emerging markets in the world to receive special attention as US  formulates its worldwide strategy". Robin Raphel also cited an  important fact that major American corporations have recently  launched an "India Interest Group," which means that despite  Pakistan being the economic leader of South Asia in 1991 when  the reform process began in the region, today, India has easily  overtaken Pakistan as the country in South Asia which is the  primary and perhaps the sole recipient of American economic  interest and investment.    Three strategic realities define these emerging American  objectives in South Asia in the post-Cold War world. First,  American political influence is more extensive and more  pervasive in South Asia than at any time before, more so because  it is no longer confined to Pakistan and it encompasses India as  well. As Robin Raphel told the American Senate, "with the  ending of the Cold War, South Asians recognised that the United  States is now the outside power best building to assist them."  There is no competing influence from Russia now. Interestingly  for the first time, the United States is trying to build a new  intimacy with the Pakistan Army on the basis of America's  political clout without any tangible expression of support via  military hardware or financial grants, as was the case during  the Cold War years in the 50s and the 60s or the Afghanistan  period in the 80s. But the problem is that on certain core  issues for Pakistan like the nuclear programme, Kashmir and  relations with China, American policy is at variance with  Pakistani objectives. Hence the foundations of any new special  relationship between the two sides or their respective  militaries will be lacking.    The second basic reality defining American interest in South  Asia is the China factor, with the Peoples Republic of China  emerging as the area on which American strategic pressure is  bound to be felt till the end of the century. China is all  emerging economic giant with military power and political will  to assess an independent posture in world affairs and although  it is not interest in filling any vacuum created by the demise  of the Soviet Union, China certainly is no pliant country  acquiescing to American hegemony. It is thus no accident that  the United States as well as the West generally are cultivating  all of China's neighbours from Korea to Kyrgyzstan with the  Americans talking to Pyongyang and normalising ties with Vietnam  as well. With the British putting pressure on Hong Kong close  to its unification with the mainland in 1997, the Americans are  interested in the South Asian region as as a potential area to  monitor and pressurise China, especially its minority provinces  like Tibet and Xinjiang which border India and Pakistan  respectively.    South Asia and Pakistan particularly, are also the gateway  to  Central Asia and hence Pakistan is also able to influence  developments in neighboring Afghanistan which, in turn, impinge  on Cental Asia, hence the Americans view South Asia and Pakistan  in particular, as an extension of the Central Asian region, a  fact acknowledged in Raphel's statement to the Asia Society when  she said that "we must also recognise the importance of outside  factors-- concerns about China, developments in Central Asia and  Russia--in the South Asia security equation."    However, the American stated and unstated agenda for South  Asia-- preventing tensions and conflict between India and  Pakistan, focussing on India as a large market for American  goods and technology, and Pakistan as a potential observation  post for china, Iran and Cental Asia--present serious problems  given the fact that on key areas vital to Pakistan's national  security like Kashmir and the nuclear issue there is still no  real fresh and radical departure from long-standing American  policy. US policy can no longer keep pace with either the  ground realities in Kashmir or the fact that Pakistan has long  embarked on the path of nuclear independence which cannot be  rolled back either under foreign pressures or pliable  governments. As long as this reality gap is not bridged on  vital issues, with American policy still far removed from the  ground reality on the Kashmir and nuclear questions, American  policy making will be reduced to an adhoc, reactive,  moment-to-moment approach rather than a strategic perspective  what is required in these troubled times.</p>

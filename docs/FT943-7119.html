			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Exams under pressure to make the grade: John Authers on fears that new vocational qualifications may do more harm than good Results for the first advanced-level General National Vocational Qualifications (GNVQs) are announced today. But the qualification itself is under even more rigorous scrutiny than the students. This follows an attack by Professor Alan Smithers of Manchester University, a government adviser on vocational education. He said: 'If GNVQs are not significantly improved, far from revitalising our education system, they will do harm.' GNVQs do not involve conventional examinations as the GCE A-level does. Instead, candidates must complete a series of units, passing each before they earn the overall qualification. The National Council for Vocational Qualifications, the agency which oversees the qualifications, uses the driving test as an analogy. But Prof Smithers said: 'The way GNVQs operate it is as if your driving instructor were also your examiner and he or she ticked off whether you could use the clutch and steering wheel separately but did not assess your overall performance. Moreover, under the new funding arrangements, they would only be paid if you passed.' The attack by Prof Smithers and other conservative academics was damaging, as the government wants GNVQs to be ranked equally with academic GCE A-levels both for university entrance and for vocational training. Ministers want 25 per cent of all 16-year-olds to enter for them by 1996. Sir Ron Dearing, the government's chief curriculum adviser, intends to extend the GNVQ structure to cover 14-to-16-year-olds from next year, allowing them to take pre-vocational courses alongside existing academic GCSEs. Mr Tim Boswell, further and higher education minister, took action earlier this year to address the criticisms of the qualifications. He said: 'We want GNVQs to have parity of esteem with GCE A-levels. But we recognise that esteem must be earned - it cannot be conferred by government, the CBI or anyone else.' Announcing a plan to tighten the qualification, he said it was necessary to: Improve external testing. Provide more training for external verifiers. Clarify the grading criteria. Clarify what knowledge was needed for a GNVQ. Provide clearer guidance for teachers on marking coursework, grading and designing courses. Tighten criteria for accrediting schools and colleges offering GNVQs. Mr John Hillier, chief executive of the national council, said yesterday that all of Mr Boswell's points would be implemented - either this year, for external tests and grading, or next year. He added that all elements of this year's pilot of GNVQs had been externally assessed by awarding bodies, and by the government inspectorate Ofsted, the further-education funding councils and the Department of Employment's quality assurance division. Mr Hillier admitted that this level of supervision could not be sustained once GNVQs were taken more widely, but said that there were compulsory external tests for all compulsory units. He added that the apparent recognition of GNVQs by university admissions tutors and increased interest from 16-year-olds gave grounds for encouragement. While 3,800 students entered for the initial pilot of advanced GNVQs in 1992, the results for which are announced today, about 37,000 registered last year, and at least 50,000 are expected to register next month. Ms Tina Townsend, chief executive of the Business and Technology Education Council, one of the awarding bodies, pointed out that fewer than a third of students who registered for advanced GNVQs two years ago had gained an award. She said: 'It shows the exams are tough and that you need a great deal of determination and stamina to succeed.'</p>

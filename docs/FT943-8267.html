			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / People: Finance director for Lloyds Abbey Life Laurel Powers-Freeling is moving from Prudential to life assurance group Lloyds Abbey Life where, at the age of 37, she will become the first female group finance director in British insurance. An American, Powers-Freeling had worked as director of corporate strategy and planning for the Pru, helping the board reach its decision not to expand into Europe. She had then expressed the wish to try her hand at line management. Slightly less than a year ago, she set up a division concentrating on private financial planning services, an attempt to reach wealthier customers. But the experience left her feeling she was 'better in the long run operating at the broader strategic level'. In March the Pru hired John Maxwell as corporate development director. She has been promised a strong strategic slant to her new job, sorting out what she hints is at present something of a rag bag of businesses. As for the nitty gritty of the finance function, she points out that she does have a masters in finance from MIT, and that she has had to understand the accounting aspects of the industry in her previous incarnations. Before joining the Pru three years ago, she had worked at investment bank Morgan Stanley International and management consultants McKinsey. Lloyds Abbey Life has been looking for a finance director since last September when Christopher Wiscarson was moved across to another part of the group, becoming managing director of Black Horse Financial Services.</p>

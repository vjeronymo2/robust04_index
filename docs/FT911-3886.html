			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / FT Law Report: British Gas employees to get inequality compensation FOSTER AND OTHERS v BRITISH GAS PLC House of Lords (Lord Keith, Lord Templeman, Lord Ackner and Lord Jauncey): April 18 1991 BRITISH GAS is a state controlled statutory body with special monopoly powers for the provision of public services and accordingly, though it is a commercial enterprise, its employees, like public sector employees, can rely directly on the European Community equal treatment Directive when complaining of a discriminatory retirement policy operating before UK enactment of equality legislation. The House of Lords so held when allowing an appeal by Mrs M Foster and five other female employees of British Gas plc (formerly the British Gas Corporation), from a Court of Appeal decision that they were not in a position to seek compensation against British Gas for discrimination on grounds of sex. LORD TEMPLEMAN said that article 5 of the EC equal treatment Directive of February 9 1976, provided that member states of the EC should apply the principle of equal treatment to working conditions, so that 'men and women shall be guaranteed the same conditions without discrimination on grounds of sex'. The UK took the view that the Directive did not render unlawful a rule that men and women must retire at pensionable age, even if that meant that women must retire at 60 whereas men need not retire before 65. In Marshall (1986) QB 401 the European Court of Justice ruled that a general policy of retiring women when they reached pensionable age at 60 and men when they reached pensionable age at 65, was an infringement of the equal treatment Directive. The Court reiterated that a member state which had not adopted measures to give effect to the Directive 'may not plead as against individuals, its own failure to perform the obligations which the Directive entails'. It ruled that where a person involved in legal proceedings was able to rely on a Directive as against the state, he might do so regardless of the capacity in which the state was acting, whether employer or public authority. It said, 'In either case it is necessary to prevent the state from taking advantage of its own failure to comply with Community law.' As a result of Marshall section 2 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1986, which came into force on November 7 1987, rendered unlawful any discrimination by any person against a woman in relation to retirement age, so that the anomaly between employees in the public sector who could rely on the equal treatment Directive, and employees in the private sector who could not, was eliminated. The position remained, however, that a woman in the public sector who was discriminated against by retirement between February 9 1976 and November 7 1987, might be able to obtain compensation for breach of the Directive. British Gas had a policy that women should retire at 60 and men at 65. It infringed the Directive. The appellant employees were compulsorily retired between December 27 1985 and July 22 1986. They claimed compensation for unlawful discrimination. The House of Lords referred to the European Court the question whether British Gas was a body of such a type that the appellants were entitled to rely directly on the Directive. The Court gave its ruling on July 12 1990. By paragraph 22 it said that article 5 (1) of the Directive might be relied on in a claim for damages against 'a body whatever its legal form which has been made responsible, pursuant to a measure adopted by the state, for providing a public service under the control of the state and has for that purpose special powers beyond those which result from the normal rules applicable in relations between individuals'. Accordingly, the question for the House was whether British Gas was such a body. By the 1972 Gas Act, replacing the 1965 Act and repealed by the 1986 Act, the British Gas Corporation was established as a body corporate. The secretary of state was authorised to make regulations with regard to the appointment, tenure and vacation of office by Corporation members. Section 2 provided that it was the Corporation's duty to develop and maintain an efficient and co-ordinated system of gas supply for Great Britain. Thus British Gas was a body which was made responsible pursuant to a measure adopted by the state, for providing a public service. By section 4 the Corporation was directed to report to the minister, who was authorised to give it appropriate directions for securing its efficient management. By section 7 he was authorised to give it general directions as to the exercise and performance of its functions in relation to matters affecting national interest. By section 8 it was ordered to report annually to the minister on the exercise and performance of its functions, policy and programmes. By section 29 of the 1972 Act, 'no person other than the Corporation shall . . . supply gas to any premises except with the consent of the Corporation'. That section conferred on British Gas 'special powers beyond those which result from the normal duties applicable in relations between individuals'. Accordingly, British Gas was a body which was made responsible pursuant to a measure adopted by the state for providing a public service under the control of the state and had, for that purpose, special powers beyond those which resulted from the normal rules applicable in relations between individuals. British Gas could therefore not take advantage of the state's failure to comply with the equal treatment Directive. The appellants' complaints of unlawful discrimination were dismissed by the industrial tribunal and the Court of Appeal on the ground that, for the purposes of the Directive, British Gas was a private individual against whom the Directive could not be enforced. Before the European Court and before the House, British Gas repeated the arguments which had found favour in the courts below. It submitted it was a statutory corporation engaged in commercial activities; it did not perform any of the traditional functions of the state; and it was not the agent of the state. It argued that the European Court could not have intended to made the Directive enforceable against a commercial concern. Those submissions were irrelevant to the tests laid down in the Court's ruling. The sole question were whether British Gas, pursuant to a measure adopted by the state, provided a public service under the control of the state, and exercised special powers. British Gas submitted that the secretary of state did not possess the control contemplated by the Court because it had wide powers in the performance of its functions. It submitted that monopoly in the supply of gas was not a 'special power' contemplated by the Court, and that the Court in its ruling had not clearly provided that nationalised industries carrying out commercial functions were to be regarded as organs of the state. The principle laid down by the European Court was that the state must not be allowed to take advantage of its own failure to comply with EC law. British Gas's policy was no doubt thought to be in its commercial interests. The advantages of that policy would accrue indirectly to the state which provided, through British Gas, a supply of gas for citizens generally and was entitled to surplus revenue. If British Gas were allowed to escape the consequences of an admitted breach of the Directive, the state would be taking advantage of its own failure to comply with EC law. In those circumstances there was no justification for a narrow or strained construction of the Court's ruling. Applying the words of the ruling, the 1972 Act created a body which provided a public service to citizens generally under the control of the state, which could dictate its policies and retain its surplus revenue. British Gas had a special monopoly power created by the legislature. It was therefore a body against which the Directive might be enforced. The appeal was allowed. The proceedings were restored to the industrial tribunal to assess compensation. Their Lordships agreed. For the appellant employees: James Goudie QC and John Cavanagh (Bruce Piper &amp; Co). For British Gas: Michael Beloff QC and Elizabeth Slade (CEH Twiss, British Gas solicitor).</p>

Bennett, an assistant superintendent for the Fullerton School  District, will leave this month to take over as superintendent of the growing  Yucaipa Joint Unified School District.  </P> <P> Yucaipa school board members chose Bennett from among 85 applicants, board  president Jan Mishodek said Thursday.  </P> <P> "He's very sincere and shows a real compassion for children," she said. "That's  important in a school district such as ours."  </P> <P> The Yucaipa school district, which straddles the border between San Bernardino  and Riverside counties east of Redlands, has a growing number of minority  students who have special educational needs, she said. Bennett, 47, impressed  board members with his commitment to providing a good education for all  students, she said.  </P> <P> As superintendent, Bennett will oversee a staff of about 550 and an annual  budget of about $25 million.  </P> <P> Replacing Bennett in his Fullerton post will be Ronald Cooper, who is the  district's assistant superintendent for personnel services. Cooper's position  has yet to be filled. TOM McQUEENEY  </P></p>

			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Diesel engine reaches Charterhouse Street A DIESEL engine weighing nearly 200 tonnes reached its destination in Charterhouse Street near the edge of the City of London yesterday after travelling at one mile an hour under police escort from South Mimms, Hertfordshire. At the junction of Charterhouse Street and Farringdon Road, the engine's long transporter was driven up on to thick planks so that a second transporter could be backed under it at right-angles. The second transporter, designed to avoid any risk of the engine sinking into the car park underneath Charterhouse Street, carried it to its final destination - a listed power station nearly 100 years old in which a combined-heat-and-power facility is being installed. The engine is shown above waiting to be removed from the first transporter. The facility will be run by Citigen, the power company owned by British Gas and French-controlled Utilicom. The engine was the first of two being supplied by Wartsila Diesel of Finland, and the second will arrive by the same route and method later this month. The two will be linked to a network of pipes which will provide hot water, electricity and chilled water for air conditioning to buildings in the City and surrounding area. The Citigen project is intended to meet the full heat and power demand of a number of buildings including Guildhall. The system will have environmental control plant and exhaust-gas equipment aimed at reducing emissions of sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen by up to 95 per cent.</p>

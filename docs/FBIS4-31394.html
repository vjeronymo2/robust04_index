			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Attila Agh, head of the Department of </F> Political Sciences at the Budapest Economics University, by  Katalin Torok; place and date not given: "A Stable Party System  With Question Marks"]    [Text] The Hungarian society has voted freely for the  second time. Out of the 364 deputies of the Hungarian  parliament, 63 percent are new faces. Not a single  nonparliamenary party succeeded in exceeding the 5-percent  threshold. At the same time, the Hungarian Socialist Party  [MSZP] gained 54.15 percent in the recent elections. We asked  Attila Agh about the long-term effects of the results of the 29  May elections.    [Agh] The "six-party system" has become stronger. We can  really see the spectacular nature of this development if we  compare the situation with the neighboring countries: Nothing  close to this occurred in Slovakia or Poland, for example. In  other words, this shows the firm stability of the Hungarian  party system and the fact that this party system began  developing as early as the second half of the 1980's.  Essentially, there has been no "newcomer" since 1987-88,  although the small parties saw the possibility of getting into  parliament around 1992-93, but this hope fizzled away in 1994.  In the 176 election districts, the candidates who made it into  parliament almost exclusively came from the six parties. All  this is very rare, and it is a very Hungarian particularity.    [Torok] What is the situation of the parties that can be  called stable?    [Agh] In Central Europe, the right of the political spectrum  is generally more fragmented than the left. In my opinion, there  will be a balanced party system in Central Europe when there is  a consolidated center right.    [Torok] What is the cause of this phenomenon?    [Agh] The right-wing parties failed to modernize and the  institutional continuity broke up; there is only some kind of a  cultural and mental continuity here. If we had fallen on the  other side of the Iron Curtain after World War II, it is  possible that the Smallholders might have been forced to  modernize. It transpired at the latest elections that the  supporters of the clearly Christian-national middle class trend  of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] are to be found in the  Buda districts. The Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP]  only focuses on the church issue out of a multitude of issues,  and this gives them a sure 7 percent, but not more. In other  words, this preserves their small-party nature.    [Torok] What future do you envisage for the right-wing  parties?    [Agh] I envisage a lasting and very sad future for them. As  long as they are unable to overcome their fragmentation, they  will have few prospects ahead. We must seek the reasons for  their strong historical continuity in the fact that their base  of officeholders was not poor, although they have often been  humiliated. They preserved their class situation and mentality,  and they even passed this on to their children. This is why the  late Jozsef Antall was a liberating experience for them.    [Torok] In your view, what does the landslide victory of the  MSZP mean?    [Agh] The MSZP has no idea of the amount of difficulties  they are facing, including economic problems, but let the  economists speak about them. Contrary to many people, I think  that the party itself does not have any factions today; there  are only various cultural trends there, but factions might  emerge in the future, namely three factions. Mathematically,  there are bigger chances for a 209-member faction to fall into  three parties, because the MDF started with fewer members in  1990, and the results are well known. In my opinion, the big  question is whether the MSZP will be able to deal with these  difficulties, because it is possible that various trends will  find a political expression in the wake of social conflicts.    [Torok] Concretely, what trends and groupings do you have in  mind?    [Agh] First of all, a technocratic-administrative trend.  They will be the ones who argue professionally and concentrate  on solving everyday problems. Another possible trend is made up  of people who make a professional and ideological problem from  the problems of the provinces. I would like to stress that I do  not mean here the often mentioned popular-national trend whose  alleged leader is Matyas Szuros; this is the chewing gum of  ill-informed correspondents. This group will say that Budapest  is not the center of the world, that it is important to develop  the provinces, and that politics should serve the interests of  the whole country. Finally, I regard the demagogic designation  of the interests of the working class as the third trend. I  would immediately add that I do not mean here the often  mentioned trade union line; I mean that interests emerge here  that might lead politics in the direction of preserving the  interests and values of a classic working class.    [Torok] It seems that the so-called trade union line also  causes a lot of trouble to the possible coalition partners....    [Agh] As I said before, I do not see this as an acute danger  in the National Federation of Hungarian Trade Unions [MSZOSZ].  I would also list them in the first group because they are  capable of evaluating the changing world of Hungarian employees  dynamically. I think that one who believes the trade union is  naive enough to think that the current level of metallurgy in  northern Hungary can be maintained definitely does not know  Sandor Nagy and the other outstanding trade unions leaders.    [Torok] Can you envisage an internal struggle between these  trends within the MSZP?    [Agh] I think there are possibilities for the emergence of  three such trends, and the order of appearance is also an order  of power. I do not think these groups will separate very much  in personnel, because one can join one group in connection with  one problem and another group in connection with another  problem. I hope the MSZP will be able to deal with this problem  and avoid the breaking up of the party into different parties.  It is also important that the MSZP avoid the situation in which  there is a dialogue and trends within the party but a  monopolistic demand outside. I find openness very important,  especially toward the intellectuals.</p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peru aims to reverse 20 years of mine neglect TODAY MARKS the end of an ignominious chapter in Peruvian mining history. After more than 20 years of neglect, state-owned mining company Mineroperu will relinquish control over the first of a series of rich deposits. Quellaveco, first under the hammer, is expected to be hotly disputed by two big names in the mining world: Southern Peru Copper Corporation, a subsidiary of Asarco Incorporated, and the South-African giant Anglo-American through its Chilean subsidiary Mantos Blancos. Rio Anglom of Canada is also expected to put in a bid, as is Chile's Pudahuel. Logic suggests that SPCC is the most likely buyer. The Quellaveco copper deposits lie between the corporation's two huge open-pit copper mines, Cuajone and Toquepala which produce two-thirds of Peru's copper. Developing Quellaveco will almost certainly involve use of SPCC's infrastructure - the railway that ferries concentrates from the mines to the smelter and port of Ilo as well as the water and electricity supply, both operated by SPCC. 'Without using the existing SPCC infrastructure, the investment demanded for Quellaveco would be astronomical,' said a senior Peruvian mine manager. 'If Southern doesn't get it, then the winning bidder might have to come to some joint venture agreement with them.' Quellaveco is in the province of Moquegua, 930 km (580 miles) south-east of Lima, on western slopes of the Andes and about 3,600 metres (11,800 ft) above sea level. Reserves are estimated at 388.5m tonnes with 0.85 per cent copper at a cut-off grade of 0.45 per cent. The deposit is characterised by a large percentage of secondary sulphide reserves. Experts say prospects for heap-leaching are 'very interesting'. While this could mean a smaller outlay than that associated with a traditional concentrator plant, Mineroperu conditions for bidding require the buyer to process a minimum of 10,000 tonnes of ore a day. The cash minimum fixed by Mineroperu for Quellaveco is a modest Dollars 9m, intended to cover the state's investment in studies and surveys over past years. The deposit will go to the bidder who offers the most attractive cash-plus-development package. SPCC executives familiar with the deposit say integral development at Quellaveco would involve investment of between Dollars 300m and Dollars 350m. The corporation could find it hard to come up with that sort of money. It has already committed itself to investing Dollars 300m in Peru over the next couple of years to construct electrowinning plants at both its mines and on essential environmental improvements at its Ilo smelter. Despite SPCC's track-record of profitability, the corporation has had difficulty in persuading US banks to come up with financing. It is going ahead with its Peruvian investment programme with an initial Dollars 100m from its own resources and a Dollars 60m loan recently approved by the Andean Development Corporation. Early next year Mineroperu will be embarking on the separate sale of its four operational units - the Cerro Verde copper deposits, the copper refinery at Ilo, Cajamarquilla's zinc refinery and the San Antonio de Poto gold deposits. Technical assessments for all these have now been completed by British-based International Mining Consultants and promotion will be handled by Morgan Grenfell in association with Minproc, a Peruvian-Canadian company.</p>

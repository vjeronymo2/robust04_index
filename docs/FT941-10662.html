			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: New president at Daishowa Daishowa Paper, the debt-laden Japanese paper company, has replaced Mr Kiminori Saito with Mr Shogo Nakano as president, bringing to an end the company's 56-year rule by the Saito family. The move follows pressure from the company's main creditor banks, which have been reluctant to accept Daishowa's restructuring plan until it removed the family's influence. Daishowa's investments grew rapidly during the 1980s under Mr Ryoei Saito, the controversial honorary chairman. Daishowa has been trying to work out a rehabilitation plan acceptable to its creditors.</p>

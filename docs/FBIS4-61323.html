			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Zakrevskiy: "Kiev Enterprises Nominate </F> Volodymyr Lanovyy for President; Kharkov Enterprises Will  Probably Support Him as Well"]    [Excerpts] "Tell me who you are supporting for president  and I will specify the economic situation of your enterprise."  I heard this loose interpretation of the saying "Tell me, who  is your friend..." recently at the "Vulkan" factory in Kiev.  Before my departure to Kharkov for a meeting with managing  directors of CIS and Ukrainian industrial enterprises, I learned  that the "Vulkan" working collective was the first Kiev  enterprise to nominate Volodymyr Lanovyy for head of state. Now  I understand what their words meant.    Old disputes over who is currently more important for  Ukraine  -- a flexible politician, competent lawyer, or pragmatic  economist -- have most likely brought us to a conciliatory  conclusion: Ukraine requires all three of them. However, the  third one is more important. The realization of difficulties of  our economic reality will most likely not play the final part in  choosing the future president.    The invitation of V.T. Lanovyy, 42-year-old doctor of  economic sciences and former prime minister, to meet with  managing directors of more than 150 enterprises in Ukraine,  Russia, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Latvia, and Moldova shows, of  course, that he is recognized as an authoritative economist and  practical manager. [passage omitted]    When drafting a state budget, it is necessary to change the  tax structure: To issue payments to local budgets and drop tax  payments to the central Republican organs (except the most  essential ones), Volodymyr Lanovyy says. These payments should  not be redistributed and regions should have a free hand in  dealing with their budgets.    The president of the Center for Market Reforms cited these  figures: In 1993, the budget received only 40 percent of  expected tax payments while during last January-February -- only  25 percent of planned payments.    As for the insolvency of Ukraine, the presidential  candidate:  "Ukraine is solvent. It has a large currency potential, but the  funds are not kept in the state. It is not profitable to bring  currency into the state. I categorically oppose the practice of  enterprises having to sell their earned currency to the state.  This money should be deposited in Ukrainian banks. If this is  not done, exporters will continue holding their money abroad.  Excessive customs duties and export restrictions should be  removed. Different currency rates and licensing have lead to  under-the-counter deals: The one who buys currency at a lower  rate, is always tempted to sell it at a higher rate. Volodymyr  Lanovyy concludes that we have a unique situation. Due to the  restrictive policy and the system of currency regulation, we  export capital at a time when we most need it." [quotation marks  as published]    Answering a question as to whether the system of tax breaks  is justified, Volodymyr Lanovyy remarked: "A system of tax  breaks is permissible if payments for some percent of the credit  are made with funds from the state budget. Such credits are  necessary to achieve structural changes and encourage  unprofitable sectors. In Ukraine, the issuing of loans is  always unplanned and is carried out through currency emissions  and the lowering of interest rates. In 1993, the average  interest rate was twice as low as the minimum interest rate  offered by the National Bank. Thereby, tax breaks are mandatory  elements of the government's structural policy and should be  economically grounded, based on the technological reorganization  of an enterprise, its profitability, conditions for providing  new jobs, etc."    Estimating the current economic situation, Volodymyr Lanovyy  stated: "Currently, economic policy is being shaped without  considering its final results. The blind are leading the  people."    The corps of managing directors did not object to this.  Academician A. G. Aganbegyan, president of the All-Union Club of  Directors and a well-known economist, summarized, in my opinion,  the viewpoint of the majority: "The sooner Lanovyy and his  followers are able to implement reforms, the quicker the revival  of the Ukrainian economy will begin."    I heard more or less the same opinions at factories in  Kharkov -- which were visited by the presidential candidate --  and at the House of Architects, where he organized a news  conference with journalists. There is one curious detail:  There are a considerable number of people, both among  journalists and industrialists, who are ready to support Lanovyy  during the presidential campaign.</p>

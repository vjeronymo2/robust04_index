			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Technology: The 'right' price to pay for a PC - Technically Speaking The sharpest indictment of the computer industry's failure to persuade the broader business community of the value of its products, in Europe if not in the US, is the widely held conviction that there is suppressed demand for PCs which will only be released when prices fall to the 'right' level. It is more than a conviction; there is plenty of evidence from Amstrad's success with its word processors that people are prepared to experiment with an unfamiliar technology if the price is low enough. Ordinary market economics dictate that price has a marked influence on demand. The volume of people taking intercontinental flights or package holidays abroad increases as air ticket prices fall; the number of car owners rises as prices fall within the reach of the average pocket. But the idea that the market for personal computers will explode when the price falls to, say, Pounds 500, puts the most powerful business machines ever invented in the same category as expensive electronic consumer products like hi-fi sound systems or high-definition television. Large organisations purchasing hundreds, perhaps thousands, of personal computers a year are not part of this pattern, although lower PC prices do increase their flexibility - they can buy rather than rent, drive different kinds of bargains with their suppliers and spread information technology more widely through their organisations. But for smaller businesses, the price/demand syndrome suggests that PCs are a 'nice-to-have' rather than 'have-to-have' option, unlike, say, a delivery truck or, perhaps, a portable telephone. No one questions the need a business has for a delivery truck. But the business benefits of PCs are by no means so obvious. It is common knowledge that many large organisations are dissatisfied with their investment in information technology, including personal computers, so perhaps it is not surprising that some of this disaffection should have trickled down to smaller companies. But large companies are not dissatisfied with their use of computers for bread-and-butter purposes - word processing, accountancy and payroll. They are chiefly disappointed by their lack of success in so-called competitive-edge applications where technology should have given them an advantage over their rivals. There is no reason why a smaller organisation should not come up with a competitive-edge application, but common sense dictates that their primary aim in computerisation should be to drive some cost out of the business. Clearly, many have not valued this opportunity at, say, Pounds 3,500, the cost of a state-of-the-art system a couple of years ago. How many will value it at today's price of Pounds 1,000 or less? There are other interpretations. Some argue that low prices make it easier for customers to buy more computers or more sophisticated computers, and there is much in that. Yet in Europe suspicions linger that PCs are an adornment rather than critical to a business. It is hard to blame hardware manufacturers. Aircraft manufacturers have no influence on the direction in which their products will fly any more than hi-fi manufacturers can dictate their customers' choice of compact discs. It is interesting, however, that IBM is ploughing some Dollars 60m into a European media campaign designed to spread awareness of personal computing. Software is another matter. Vast strides have been taken to make packaged software simpler to use and more attractive, but there is much further to go. Business computing has been an act of faith for too long, and better software - 'softer' software as the jargon would have it - must play a big part in proving the benefits of the technology. Until the advantages of computing to the small business are obvious and unequivocal it is hard to see what basis there can be for agreement on the 'right' price for a personal computer.</p>

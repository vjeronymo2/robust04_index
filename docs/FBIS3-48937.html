			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, Dec 31 (TANJUG) -- Miners at Serbia's  biggest coal mine Kolubara on Friday ended a three-day strike  after negotiating a settlement with the authorities in the night  between Thursday [30 December] and Friday.    Early on Friday afternoon, the Belgrade city transport was  back to normal after its workers ended their several-hour  stoppage. Like the workers in Kolubara, they went on strike  demanding higher wages and better living standards. The strike  of the 17,000 Kolubara workers in Lazarevac near Belgrade ended  after the miners on Friday morning verified the agreement  reached with the republic's electricity board and the government  on Thursday night. The strikers demanded to receive their wages  in German marks because of the galopping inflation which hit one  million percent in December alone.    The disturbances in coal deliveries resulted in the  suspension of operation of the thermal power plant Nikola Tesla  in Obrenovac, which produces 50 percent of Serbia's overall  electricity, due to which the Serbian electricity board started  with several-hour brownouts on Thursday. Although the miners'  strike has ended, it is not certain whether power supply in  Serbia will be back to normal on Friday because of the  disturbances in coal deliveries and electricity production or  whether some parts of the republic will celebrate New Year's Eve  in candlelight.    Dissatisfied with low wages, workers in the Belgrade city  transport struck on Friday morning. The Serbian railways has  been on strike for several days, along with some hospitals and  gravediggers in Belgrade. A drastic fall in the living  standards and record-high hyperinflation have been provoked by  draconic U.N. sanctions introduced against Yugoslavia in late  May of 1992.    Three-fourths of Serbia's industrial facilities have been  standing still for months, while the remaining one-fourth  operate at reduced capacities although they are not on strike.  The average salary in Serbia is below 15 German marks, while  one kilo of meat sells for 40 marks.</p>

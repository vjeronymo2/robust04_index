			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 9 TASS -- A new party has emerged  lately in the Russian political firmament. The national  patriotic organisation called the movement for Russia's National  Revival was set by the nationalistic front Pamyat, the centrist  bloc of political parties and movements and the Conservative  Union.    The presentation of the new party was held in Moscow on  Wednesday in one of the rooms of the Federation of Peace and  Accord decorated with a huge portrait of Russia's last Czar  Nicholas the Second and a table with an icon and traditional  Russian bread and salt in the middle. The ceremony was attended  by several dozen Pamyat members clad in black uniform and a  large number of foreign journalists.    The party's concept is based on the "holy unity of god, the  czar and the nation." The statement of its organising committee  read out by Pamyat leader Dmitry Vasilyev was written in old  Russian and contained many provisions eulogising autocracy, the  Orthodox Church and its traditional virtues, and blasphemed  bolsheviks and communists.    A large portion of the statement was devoted to the economic  programme of the party. "Our course is towards reviving the  strong peasantry on the basis of state, collective and  individual forms of land ownership by freeing fledgling land  users from taxes and establishing a system of deductions and a  tax-free and balanced economy," the statement read.    Speaking at a news conference after the presentation,  Vasilyev said that the movement will not "take part in all these  elections" because there is something unpleasant "in the fight  for power." On the other hand, he stressed that it "will not  quit political life."    Vladimir Voronin, leader of the centrist bloc who failed to  pass registration in the 1991 presidential elections, said that  he "remains a candidate for presidency." Vasilyev refused to  comment on the movement's tactics. He added that he would not  name his supporters in the upper echelons of power, fearing they  may "come under attack."    He denounced Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the ultra  nationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, saying his  emergence "is not incidental." It was carefully prepared by  someone standing behind him. He described Zhirinovskiy's  statements as a "dangerous political provocation," adding that  he (Zhirinovskiy) "provokes revenge-seeking sentiments and  discredits the idea of the Russian issue."    Vasilyev also spoke extremely critically about Aleksandr  Sterligov, leader of the Russian national assembly. Vasilyev  distanced himself from some of Sterligov's former associates,  including Nazi Aleksey Barkashov and Communist Nikolay Lysenko.    Asked about the movement's place in Russia's political  spectrum, Vasilyev replied that "there is no place for us there.  I do not see there any people with whom I could stand together."</p>

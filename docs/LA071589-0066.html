			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 7 TOP OFFICIALS OUT AT KEY CUBAN MINISTRY  </P> <P> Seven top officials in Cuba's Interior Ministry have resigned or been fired,  the government announced Friday, one day after the execution of four military  officers, thus providing the latest twist in the nation's highly publicized  drug-smuggling and corruption scandal.  </P> <P> The sweeping changes at the ministry, which has been blamed for failing to  uncover the smuggling operation sooner, were first disclosed on the front page  of the official newspaper Granma following Thursday's execution by firing squad  of Cuban war hero Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez and three others who were convicted of  treason and other crimes in connection with the scandal.  </P> <P> Two of the four who were executed, former Col. Antonio de la Guardia and former  Maj. Amado Padron, were Ministry of Interior officials. Ten other ministry  officials, including one woman, were also convicted in the case but given long  prison terms.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'General Housecleaning'  </P> <P> A Cuban official called the shake-up "part of a general housecleaning at the  ministry."  </P> <P> Granma said six resignations, which were handed in Thursday, were caused by  "deficiencies committed by the (ministry's) leadership . . . which gave  immunity" to those convicted.  </P> <P> Four top Interior Ministry officials, including intelligence chief Gen. German  Barreiro Carames, resigned along with two departmental deputies, Granma said. A  seventh top official was fired.  </P> <P> Barreiro was replaced by Maj. Gen. Jesus Bermudez Cutino, who most recently was  intelligence chief of the Ministry of the Armed Forces.  </P> <P> Maj. Gen. Pascual Martinez Gil, the deputy interior minister, also stepped down  and was replaced by Maj. Gen. Romarico Sotomayor, chief of staff of the Eastern  Army, which has jurisdiction in the eastern third of the island. He is also a  substitute member of the Communist Party's Central Committee.  </P> <P> In a report by the Cuban government news agency Prensa Latina, in a dispatch  monitored in Mexico City, Martinez Gil resigned "in view of the irregularities  that occurred in this institution by a group of officers, activities that went  unpunished for 2 1/2 years."  </P> <P> The news agency added that both Martinez Gil and Barreiro "will be employed in  other tasks" but gave no details.  </P> <P> The four others who resigned were identified as Gen. Amado Valdez, chief of the  border patrol; Gen. Miguel Bermejo Labrada, chief of the fire department, and  Manuel Suarez Alvarez and Felix Veliz Hernandez, deputy chiefs of the  ministry's political section. A seventh official, Brig. Gen. Roberto Gonzalez  Caso, was fired as chief of immigration. Their replacements were not given.  </P></p>

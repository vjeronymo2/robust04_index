			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring by </F> Veronique Meutey; place and date not given: "Northern Ireland:  Voting for Peace" -- first two paragraphs are LE FIGARO  introduction]    [Text] The European election which takes place today in  both Northern Ireland and Britain will be dominated by the  conflict that has been racking the province for 25 years.  Candidates fielded by three major parties are expected to be  reelected: Ian Paisley for the Democratic Ulster Party (DUP),  Jim Nicholson for the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP, moderate), and  John Hume, a Catholic, for the Social Democratic Labor Party  (SDLP, moderately nationalist).    "European stakes transcend our traditional fault lines. If  we can cooperate with other European countries in view of a  common interest, then we can work together at home," John Hume  pleaded, to no avail. Once again, political and religious  differences will prevail. And both the SDLP, which has been  defending the Anglo-Irish document, and the UUP, which still  favors it, fear the disenchantment of moderate voters with the  slowness of the peace process. In this context, Irish Foreign  Minister Dick Spring explains Dublin's views on the European  election's immediate stakes as well as the conditions for a  potential referendum on Irish reunification.    [Meutey] What is at stake in this European election?    [Spring] It affords citizens a possibility of participating  directly in the activities of European institutions. The powers  of the Parliament have been significantly increased, and today  it has a real decisionmaking role. As the leader of the Labor  Party, I am confident. The Socialists will remain the major  parliamentary group.    [Meutey] Has Euroskepticism taken hold in your country?    [Spring] No. The Irish are aware of the importance of the  European Union [EU] and the need to increase its role in the  years to come. Since Ireland joined the EEC in 1973, polls have  shown that two-thirds of the Irish are in favor of it.    [Meutey] Which foreign policy do you think the EU should  follow?    [Spring] More than ever before, the Europeans must be able  to  speak as one and to act together when faced with situations such  as the Bosnian crisis, the repercussions of the former Soviet  Union's collapse, and the problems in Northern Africa and the  Middle East. Implementing the Maastricht Treaty is the only way  to establish a European foreign policy.    [Meutey] How can the conflict in Northern Ireland be ended?    [Spring] Right now, the best way would be for the Loyalists  and Republicans to seize the chance offered them by the Downing  Street declaration and subsequent texts. If they acknowledge  these texts, they agree to support negotiation efforts between  London and Dublin.    [Meutey] Do you favor reunification?    [Spring] All we want today is to put an end to the killing  in Ulster. For the time being, reunification is not on the  agenda. We must show respect for the Loyalists, who want to  retain their links with Britain. The identity of the 500,000  individuals who want to retain their connections with the Irish  Republic must be respected as well.    [Meutey] When would reunification actually happen, then?    [Spring] When a majority of Ulster's population has  expressed a wish to see it happen....    [Meutey] If Sinn Fein agrees to stop the violence, when  would the referendum take place in Northern Ireland?    [Spring] Even if violence were to stop tomorrow morning, at  least 12 months of talks would be needed. So the referendum  could be held in both Northern and Southern Ireland within a  year.    [Meutey] Will voters in Northern Ireland be asked the same  question as in your country?    [Spring] Ideally, yes. But we must take into account  differences between the two countries. There will likely have  to be two different questions.    [Meutey] Will the referendums be held on the same day?    [Spring] Same day, same time....</p>

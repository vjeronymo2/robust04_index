			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Management: Tricky nature of selling service Quality is popularly linked with the idea of excellence or achieving the best. It is often associated with expense and luxury. This traditional definition of quality has been joined by one of practical relevance to business. As a goal for managers it consists of meeting the customer's requirements or making a product which is fit for its purpose in the most cost-effective way. A medium-priced watch may lack the Swiss hand-crafting which goes with a leading model. But it must keep accurate time and retain an attractive appearance. BS5750/ISO9000 takes the idea of quality and extends it to the systems by which a company is managed. It assumes that the customer does not just want a watch to suit his purse. He wants his inquiry dealt with rapidly and his order processed as quickly as possible. The company wants its employees, materials and tools to be in the right place at the right time to reduce costs. If something goes wrong the customer wants his complaint dealt with speedily and the company wants to trace the problem and prevent it recurring. By building quality assurance into a company's entire process, the need for quality control at the end of the production line  - when rectifying mistakes is most costly and least effective - is reduced. Before looking at the requirements of the standard, businesses must confront the sometimes confusing numbering system of its different parts. The core is BS5750 part one (which corresponds to ISO9001) which applies to businesses that design and develop their own products, as well as making, installing and servicing them. Part two (ISO9002) is applicable to businesses which do not carry out their own design work but which make to a customer's requirements or to a published specification. Part three applies to businesses where final inspection and testing of the product or service are enough to assure quality. There is also an unnumbered part known as the 'registered stockists scheme.' The standard includes sections dealing with: Management Responsibility, which describes how a company should draw up an organisation chart to show the responsibilities of all staff who manage or carry out work associated with the quality of service. It requires quality procedures to be documented. Contract Review, which defines and documents the customer's requirements and establishes that the resources needed to meet them are available. Process Control, which requires the documentation of how the process is to be carried out. Written instructions must be given to the employee involved where appropriate and the process must be monitored. Document Control, is the most common cause of companies failing to achieve certification at their first attempt. It requires quality and procedure manuals to be kept in designated locations. Unauthor-ised copies must not be circulated and changes to the system and manuals must be logged. Companies which obtain their certificate can display the logo of the certification organisation. If the certifier has been accredited the logo will be accompanied by the 'tick' of the National Accreditation Council for Certification Bodies.</p>

On behalf of the municipal party committee  and the municipal government, he extended cordial regards to  airport cadres, staff, and workers, and greetings and thanks to  the broad masses of workers of the communications outlets and  departments as well as units serving as a showcase for  foreigners, who kept to production and to their work posts  during the festive period. He stressed: During this year, to  accelerate development, Tianjin must further expand opening up  internationally and externally, welcome guests and friends from  all directions and all over the world, and use foreign capital  on a greater scale. Therefore, we must exert strenuous efforts  to improve the municipal investment environment. All units  across the municipality should devote efforts to improving the  investment environment, and all people should do credit and  contribute to fostering a good image of Tianjin in opening to  the outside world.    Gao Dezhan and his entourage inspected the airport waiting  hall and the cargo transport center, visited the on-duty  personnel in the fields of security inspection, commercial  service, customs, border inspection and fire prevention, and  held cordial talks with them. While holding talks with  responsible comrades of the Tianjin Civil Aviation Bureau, the  Tianjin Branch of Air China and relevant departments at the  airport, Gao Dezhan said: Beijing a showcase of Tianjin in  opening to the outside world, Tianjin International Airport has  achieved great achievements over the past few years and made  positive contributions to Tianjin's economic development. The  airport has good conditions in various aspects, with strong  technological strength and great development potential. During  this year, we should develop new ideas, take big move, work  with one heart and one mind to seek greater achievements, and  make new contributions to Tianjin's economic development. The  municipal party committee and the municipal government have  pinned great hopes on you.    Gao Dezhan said: This year, if Tianjin wants to seize the  opportunity, accelerate the pace of reform, opening up, and  modernization, and realize big development, the most fundamental  things it should do is to further expand the degree of opening  up, develop comprehensively towards all directions and in high  layers and wider spheres, and regard using foreign capital on a  broader scale as a prominent task. In this connection, we must  further improve Tianjin's investment environment, enhance its  attraction, and induce more people, materials and investments to  flow to Tianjin. Improving investment environment is a  comprehensive project involving the whole society, which can be  achieved only by relying on the common efforts of all sectors.  The airport, seaports, communication outlets, guesthouses,  restaurants, emporiums and all "showcase" units should proceed  from the reality, do our work well, and make more contributions  to improving Tianjin's investment environment with a high sense  of responsibility. All relevant departments should do a good  job in holding talks on items concerning the use of more foreign  capital; all management departments should render good service;  all "showcase" units should create first-grade work, and at the  same time, further strengthen the building of infrastructure  facilities. We should build Tianjin into a city with beautiful  environment, good order and quality service and one of the  places with the best investment environment in the country  through our common efforts. It is the duty of all people to  improve the investment environment. The broad masses of people  across the municipality should take action actively, and add  credit to displaying the mental attitude of Tianjin people and  cultivating a good image of Tianjin.    Gao Dezhan said: The more we accelerate development and  deepen reform, the more we should mobilize the enthusiasm of the  broad masses of people. Leading cadres at all levels should  show greater concern for the living of the masses, try their  best to seek benefits for them, care for their well-being, and  do practical things for them. It is necessary to unceasingly  increase the income of workers and enhance the level of living  of retired people through developing production and raising  efficiency. The Spring Festival will come soon. Leading cadres  at all levels should go deeply to the masses, realistically make  good arrangements for the living of the masses, pay special  attention to helping workers and staff members with difficulties  to solve practical problems, and conduct activities on caring  for the well-being of the people in a down-to- earth manner.    Zheng Zhiying, member of the standing committee of the  municipal party committee and secretary general, and responsible  comrades of relevant departments participated in the inspection  and visiting activities.</p>

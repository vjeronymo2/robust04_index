			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Ford in Poland car talks Ford and the Polish government have begun negotiations on a project to assemble the Ford Escort car from kits for the Polish and bordering markets, John Griffiths reports. This could involve the assembly of about 10,000 cars a year and has been put to Warsaw as a substitute for a Dollars 50m (Pounds 32m) project to produce car interior trim in Poland. Ford has abandoned that. The negotiations, understood to have been going on for some months, are still some way from conclusion, according to indications by Ford of Europe executives this week. Ford announced in the middle of last year its intention to set up a Polish greenfield operation to make seat covers for export to its own car plants and other European vehicle producers. Ford then said the plant, at Plonsk, some 60 miles north-west of Warsaw, would come on stream late this year and would employ up to 1,000 people. Since then, however, Ford embarked on a major restructuring under its new chairman, Mr Alex Trotman. The Plonsk venture became a casualty of that. Ford no longer regards the manufacture of car interior trim as a core business and is placing it with outside suppliers. Even so, Plonsk is believed not to have been ruled out as a possible location for the car assembly project. That would be the third manufacturing venture undertaken by Ford in central Europe since mid-1992.</p>

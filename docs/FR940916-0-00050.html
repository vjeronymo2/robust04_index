			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, MARAD declines to adopt the suggestions that it deviate from its normal financial terms, such as debt to equity ratios or a minimum net worth test for Eligible Export Vessels or shipyards. MARAD believes that these traditional tests, set forth in paragraphs (d) and (e), are useful in determining the creditworthiness of an applicant to function in the marketplace and make its debt service payments. As appropriate, MARAD can modify the existing requirements as provided under paragraph (h), <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Modified Requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  MARAD also is not convinced to adopt the suggestion that it allow research and development costs to be included in Actual Cost. The financing of ``soft costs,'' such as research and development costs, exceeds the financing of the specific project, which is all that is authorized to be financed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MARAD has not adopted the suggestion that the financed Vessel be treated as the sole security for a Guarantee because in some circumstances that collateral will be insufficient to secure the Government's interest. MARAD has a fiduciary responsibility to ensure that the Government has received sufficient security for its loan Guarantees. Too often, unfortunately, the proceeds of defaulted Vessels sold to recover MARAD's payments under its Guarantee have not been sufficient. On the other hand, the current regulations state that ``under normal circumstances'' a financed Vessel or shipyard technology will be adequate security for the Guarantee. The same regulations authorize the Secretary to require additional collateral if it is determined that the Mortgage ``is not sufficient to provide adequate security.'' See section 298.31(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 298.14&blank;Economic Soundness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter argued that the new requirement in the interim final rule in paragraph (a)(2)(i) for disclosure of the ``number, type, and buyer of Vessels'' for which AST/MST ``will be used'' is unduly strict since a shipyard may be modernizing to attract a market segment rather than a specific buyer. Another commenter stated that satisfying the existing Title XI requirement in paragraph (b)(3) that the internal rate of return (IRR) analysis show a minimum return of 10 percent, based on the total project cost, would be difficult for the applicant to show in the case of the construction and development of new and innovative AST/MST facilities and equipment, and will discourage operators of General Shipyard Facilities from taking initial steps in the direction of greater productivity and efficiency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MARAD Response: MARAD recognizes that many shipyards may modernize to attract a market segment rather than a specific buyer, but MARAD believes that a shipyard's sound economic planning involves making reasonable business projections about the number and type of Vessels that can be reasonably sold and the number and types of potential buyers that can be expected to purchase them. Most businesses make such cost-benefit estimates and analyses of their business activities, especially before they commit substantial amounts of capital to expand their business. Additionally, MARAD does not believe that the IRR test will pose an insurmountable difficulty to shipyards since most shipyard projects would not be undertaken unless they were projected to have a minimum internal rate of return of 10 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 298.17&blank;Evaluation of Applications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested adding a fourth consideration for Eligible Export Vessels, in new paragraph (b) of the interim final rule, ``the export credit terms offered by foreign governments,'' while another commenter states that the new provision regarding factors considered in determining the applicant's equity requirements is not necessary as it is within the scope of the economic soundness finding in section 298.14, and should be deleted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MARAD Response: The list of items that the Secretary is required to consider in determining the amount of an applicant's equity was not intended to be exhaustive. MARAD will also consider all relevant factors, including the export credit terms offered by foreign governments, the convertibility of foreign currency, foreign sovereign guarantees, corporate parent guarantees, and other credit enhancements in determining the amount of applicant equity. It was deemed appropriate, however, to give notice to the public of some of the primary items MARAD would consider. Accordingly, MARAD has amended paragraph (b) to indicate that ``the Secretary shall consider, among other things, the following'' items.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 298.18&blank;Financing Advanced or Modern Shipbuilding Technology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters argued that paragraph (a),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Initial criteria, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  should be deleted as there is no requirement in the Shipbuilding Act that MARAD make a finding that the guaranteed financing will aid in the transition of U.S. shipyards, and encourage modernization or support increased productivity. A shipyard requested that there be included in paragraph (b) a definition of ``Technological Life'' of an asset when used to determine the duration of a Guarantee for AST/MST.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MARAD Response: Although there is no requirement in the Act that the Guarantee of shipyard financing aid in the transition of those yards, encourage modernization, and support increased productivity, the Secretary is clearly authorized to impose such a requirement as a matter of policy. Section 1112(a) of the Act authorizes the Secretary, ``subject to the terms the Secretary shall prescribe,'' to Guarantee an Obligation for AST/MST. The Secretary has the authority to prescribe terms so long as they are reasonable and are consistent with the purposes of the Act. One major purpose of the Shipbuilding Act was to encourage yards in their efforts to make the transition to commercial activities. It is clear that the initial criteria of section 298.18(a) are reasonable and are consistent with the policies of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MARAD is not yet able to include a definition of a ``technological life'' for a shipyard asset being financed. Although the request is understandable, MARAD will determine, on a case-by-case basis, what the technological life of financed assets is likely to be. In general, MARAD does not desire to have its Guarantees extend longer than the ``reasonable useful life'' of the collective assets which comprise this technology (the AST/MST).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 298.19&blank;Financing Export Vessels <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (a),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Transmittal to Secretary of Defense, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  requires the Secretary of Transportation to give the Secretary of Defense notice of receipt of an application. The Secretary of Defense may disapprove the loan Guarantee for reasons of national security. As to the requirement for review by the Secretary of Defense, one commenter urged that it should be clear that the Secretary of Defense can only disapprove the loan Guarantee based on national security interests and for no other reason. In addition, the commenter stated that the 30-day review period pursuant to which the Secretary has the right to exercise a veto is too long, given the need to streamline the approval process. Accordingly, the commenter recommended seven days. One commenter suggested that, to avoid confusion, the third reference to the Secretary in the second sentence of paragraph (a) should include the words ``of Defense.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

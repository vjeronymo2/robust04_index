			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / FT Law Report: Land to be sold at market price FREEDMAN &amp; OTHERS v BRITISH RAILWAYS BOARD AND ANOTHER CHURCH COMMISSIONERS FOR ENGLAND v BRITISH RAILWAYS BOARD AND ANOTHER Court of Appeal: (Lord Justice Nourse, Lord Justice Taylor, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith): April 9 1992. BRITISH RAIL may sell superfluous lands at market value back to the successors of the vendors from whom it was compulsorily purchased, in that the statutory provisions giving the vendors a right of pre-emption at the original purchase price have been repealed. The Court of Appeal so held when allowing an appeal by the defendants, British Railways Board and National Carriers Ltd, from Mr Justice Hoffmann's decision (FT, March 30 1990) in two actions, that they must sell derelict land back to the Special Trustees for Saint Bartholemew's Hospital and the Church Commissioners for England as the successors of those from whom they acquired it, for the original price. LORD JUSTICE NOURSE said that 125 acres of derelict land north of King's Cross Station were to form the terminus of the Channel Tunnel rail link and a large commercial development. They were compulsorily acquired pursuant to the Great Northern Railway Act 1846, which empowered the company of that name to build the railway between London and York. The land had since passed into ownership of the British Railways Board and National Carriers Ltd. Mr Justice Hoffmann on preliminary issues in two actions held that sections 57 and 102 of the 1846 Act (which he held had not been repealed) enabled the Special Trustees and the Church Commissioners, as successors of those from whom parts of the land were compulsorily acquired, to buy back three areas amounting to 52 acres ('the yellow land', 'the red land' and 'the green land') for the prices at which they were originally acquired. There was a fourth area of eight acres ('the blue land'), which was acquired by agreement. The judge held there was no right to buy back the blue land. The yellow, the red and the blue land was acquired from predecessors of the Special Trustees, and the green land from predecessors of the Church Commissioners. The whole of the yellow, most of the red, parts of the green and the whole of the blue land was owned by British Rail. The remainder of the red and the green land was owned by National Carriers. British Rail and National Carriers appealed against Mr Justice Hoffmann's decision on the yellow, red and green land. They contended that sections 57 and 102 did not have the effect he had attributed to them, or alternatively that they had been repealed. The Special Trustees cross-appealed against his decision on the blue land. A 'code' of provisions dealing with superfluous land in sections 127 to 132 of the Land Clauses Consolidation Act 1845 was incorporated into the 1846 Act. Section 127 provided that the company should sell all superfluous lands within 10 years after expiration of the statutory period for completion of the works. By section 128, it first had to offer them to the person entitled to the lands 'from which the same were originally severed'. Section 57 of the 1846 Act, which applied to the yellow and the red land acquired from the hospital, provided that if 'at any time or times' after completion of the railway any of the land was not used and required for the purposes for which the company was incorporated, 'the company shall offer such land to the governors at a sum not exceeding the original price'. British Rail and National Carriers argued that 'at any time or times' in section 57 must, by virtue of sections 127 and 128 of the code, be read as meaning 'at any time or times within 10 years after the expiration of the time limited for completion of the works'. They said section 57 was merely a gloss on the code which varied it in certain respects. Section 57 could be free from the time limit and still be a gloss on the code. It was impossible to say that the time limit was incorporated. In the context of the section as a whole it would be repugnant to common sense to say that 'at any time or times' meant 'at any time or times within 10 years after the expiration of the time limited by this Act for the completion of the works'. Mr Justice Hoffmann's conclusion on section 57 was correct. The section applied without any time limit to the yellow and the red land. Unless repealed by subsequent legislation, the hospital's right of pre-emption still existed. The same applied to section 102. As to the blue land, the power to acquire it arose under section 45 of the Railway Clauses Consolidation Act, which authorised the acquisition of additional land by agreement. The blue land was conveyed to the hospital on January 17 1851. The conveyance provided that if at any time after three years from that date any part of the land 'shall not be used and required' for formation and completion of the railway, the company should give the hospital the right of pre-emption at the original price. The hospital contended that that provision gave it a right equivalent to that given by section 102. The judge rightly rejected that contention on the ground that once the land had been 'used and required' the event which gave rise to the right could never occur. The remaining question was whether sections 57 and 102 had been repealed. Section 43 of the London and North Eastern Railway Act 1923 provided that the company should not be required to sell and dispose of any lands which were not required for the purposes of the undertaking. Section 9 of the London and North Eastern Railway Act 1935 provided that the company should have power to sell any land which was not being used for the purposes of its undertaking. Section 59 of the British Transport Commission Act 1949 provided that sections 127 to 131 of the 1845 Act 'and any other provisions to the same or similar effect' incorporated in any enactment relating to British Transport's undertaking should not apply to land acquired under that enactment. Mr Justice Hoffmann concluded that none of those three enactments had repealed section 57 or section 102. He was right on section 43 of the 1932 Act and section 9(1) of the 1935 Act, under which there could only have been an implied repeal. Neither of them carried any implication sufficient to deprive the hospital and the Commissioners of the valuable rights given by sections 57 and 102. In section 59(1) of the 1949 Act there was no implied repeal. The question whether section 59(1) had expressly repealed sections 57 and 102 depended on whether sections 57 and 102 were provisions to the 'similar effect' as the provisions of the code. When one described one thing as similar to another, one meant something which so resembled the other as to make it either pointless or impracticable to differentiate between them for the purposes for which the description was needed. The purpose of section 59(1) was to cancel the effect of the code and other provisions to the same effect. The effect of the code was to enable others, by rights of pre-emption, to acquire from British Rail or its predecessors superfluous land no longer required for railway purposes. In the terms of the definition suggested, the effect of both section 57 and section 102 so resembled the effect of the code as to make it pointless to differentiate between them. Sections 57 and 102 were effectively repealed by section 59(1) of the 1949 Act. On that ground only the appeals should be allowed. Their Lordships agreed. For the hospital: Edward Nugee QC and Terence Etherton (Wilde Sapte) For the Church:David Lowe QC and Charles Turnbull (Waltons &amp; Morse) For British Rail: Gavin Lightman QC, John Whittaker and Bridget Lucas (Nabarro Nathanson) For National Carriers: Robert Reid QC and Simon Berry QC (McKenna &amp; Co)</p>

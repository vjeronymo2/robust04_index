			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 21 January, at a meeting with journalists,  Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk commented on the results of  the trilateral Moscow statement by the presidents of Ukraine,  the United States, and Russia concerning nuclear weapons in  Ukraine.    [Begin Kravchuk recording] The thing is that we fulfilled  the  parliament's reservations. This is a very important element one  cannot refrain from. [Word indistinct] the executive power was  following the path of fulfilling the parliament's decisions, not  blocking them. For example, we were agreeing to certain  compromises, making certain concessions. [Words indistinct]  Russia, the United States, Ukraine were doing this. In  politics, this is the only way to act. Well, generally  speaking, I expected there would be an opposition [words  indistinct]. They had not yet read the documents but already  thousands of them clung to the president and to all the  executive authorities, so that if I were responding to this, one  would have never seen me any more.    Already they label me as a traitor [words indistinct]. They  say I betrayed the national interests [words indistinct]. I  know there are people who always did it this way. But if a man  who is a [word indistinct] or wants to be a [word indistinct]  politician, and who strives toward this [word indistinct], then  I would like the one who says this, who [word indistinct] big  policy to ponder over the fact that, first, [words indistinct]  policy is made when they read documents and, second, when they  take into consideration the situation in the world, take into  consideration the state of affairs [word indistinct] in the  world, including Ukraine. [passage indistinct]    The one who speculates or calls not to withdraw nuclear  weapons, to leave them in Ukraine so that Ukraine becomes a  nuclear state, this can be qualified as follows: [words  indistinct] independence to Ukraine, and our people [words  indistinct]. This is why the only correct move by Ukraine is  the move we make. [Words indistinct] not to lose our strength,  not to ignore but, on the contrary, to protect Ukraine's  national interests. But this protection can [word indistinct]  if there are real opportunities and not just a wish. [words  indistinct] the one who declares now so loudly that Ukraine must  be nuclear and that it should not give up weapons, [word  indistinct] makes Ukraine a hostage and sentences its people to  death.

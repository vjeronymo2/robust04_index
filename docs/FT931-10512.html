			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Life in the slow lane Last week's cut in German interest rates could turn out to be a lot more significant than it looked, and in more ways than one. It is likely to lead, sooner or later, to an intense debate on ways of strengthening the European Community's exchange rate mechanism. This in turn will trigger a broader debate over what is needed generally to strengthen the Maastricht treaty. And this will set the stage for an agonising reappraisal in Britain over whether it really wants to be in or out. The question is, what is the significance of the German interest rate cut? A week ago, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, was manifestly opposed to any move. He publicly repudiated criticisms of his tight interest rate policy, which he dismissed as coming from 'ignoramuses'. To cut interest rates three days later suggests a striking change of course, if not of heart. Now there is nothing in the Maastricht treaty which requires a virtually fixed currency grid well in advance of phase two next year. But the political credibility of the system depends on the continued cohesion of the central currencies in the system, starting with the French franc. In effect, the ERM in its current configuration has come to be taken as a test of the viability of monetary union; if the ERM is blown apart by the speculators, the world will refuse to believe in the feasibility of Emu. Moreover, the feasibility of monetary union is now turning into a test of the credibility of the general political objectives of the Maastricht treaty. A forced devaluation of the franc would represent a massive political blow, both for the Franco-German relationship and for the general objectives of European integration. No one imagines that the Bundesbank wants to improve the plausibility of the Emu programme; quite the reverse. But Mr Schlesinger does not have the power to revoke the treaty of Maastricht, let alone to write off the political capital invested, at least by the original member states, in the general objectives of European integration. Even if the Bundesbank has reluctantly accepted that it must do a tiny bit more to underwrite the survival of the exchange rate mechanism, it cannot guarantee unlimited support for the franc. On the other hand, the Bonn government cannot contemplate the bald collapse of the system. Only two politically acceptable options remain: if the speculators do not go away, either the system must be strengthened so it is less vulnerable, or it must be replaced by something else with equal political significance. The French are already gearing up for a strengthening of the system; a senior French official said last week the issues were now being discussed in private, though there would be no overt initiatives until after the ratification of Maastricht by Denmark and Britain. Yet the general shape of French thinking is set out in a book* just published by the planning ministry. The core countries, starting with France and Germany, would speed their progress towards monetary union, through intergovernmental agreements, and would irrevocably fix their parities next January or soon after. The Germans would have to 'internationalise' their monetary policy, and co-ordinate it with their part-ners; the French would make the Bank of France independent. Such a programme raises a raft of questions, both technical and political. For example, how would the Germans 'internationalise' their monetary policy? But the bottom line is that France and Germany have too much at stake to accept a straight defeat at the hands of the speculators. If the Emu programme cannot be salvaged in its present form, something of equivalent political weight, in this or some other field, must be devised to keep up the European impetus. This broader debate, which cannot be eluded, will be deeply embarrassing for Britain. The government has already said the pound will not rejoin the ERM this year; it has indicated that the Bank of England will not be independent; so it faces the prospect of being left in the slow lane of a two-speed monetary Europe. Some will argue that Britain is better off in the slow lane. It has broken the chains of the ERM, it has cut inter-est rates, and can go for growth. There is a political price, however. The other member states used to wink at Britain's opt-out from Emu, believing Britain could never in practice afford to stay out. Now they see the UK pursuing a policy of competitive devaluation on a grand scale, in direct conflict with the spirit of the Emu programme. Moreover, some people in France now virtually accuse the UK (and the Americans) of deliberately stimulating currency speculation, in order to bust the ERM. This may not be rational. But French insistence on the soundness of the franc is not helped by an approximate 17 per cent effective sterling devaluation. Even Chancellor Helmut Kohl alluded last week to 'those who provoke disturbances so as to torpedo the process of monetary union'. Once Maastricht is ratified, the treaty will be the subject of a new round of debate and reappraisal, which is likely to be just as intense and probably more serious than last year's. But the subject will be the negotiation of a two-speed Europe, and this time the others will not be sorry to see Britain stay in the slow lane. * L'economie francaise en perspective.

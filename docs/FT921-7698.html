			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Many textiles quota curbs may linger on - A not-too-handsome victory for developing countries FOR developing countries, the scrapping of barriers to world trade in textiles and clothing, worth Dollars 240bn a year, has been a crucial objective in the Uruguay Round of global negotiations. They have won their case, but, contrary to the claims of the US and European textile lobbies, by no means handsomely. According to the draft textiles accord, many, perhaps most, quota restrictions under the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) need not be lifted until the year 2003. The MFA, established in 1974, was intended to give the textiles industry in rich countries a breathing space to adjust to low-cost competition (restrictions on cotton textiles had already been imposed in the early 1960s). The pact governs the bulk of textiles and clothing trade between rich and poor countries. Nevertheless, textiles employment has halved in the European Community and Japan since 1973 and fallen by a quarter in the US and Canada, mainly due to heavy labour-saving investment. Protection also costs western consumers billions of dollars a year in higher clothing prices. In poor countries, protection makes it harder to establish successful textile and clothing industries, traditionally a first step in industrial development. In addition, the quota system tends to reinforce the dominance of established exporters, such as Hong Kong, and allows importers to dispense favours to particular countries which may not be the most competitive producers. Thus the Caribbean states have opposed the draft accord which could ultimately end their preferential quotas in the US market. The accord provides for a 10-year phase-out of all existing MFA quota restrictions, bringing textiles and clothing trade under normal Gatt rules for the first time. But the deal is heavily 'back-end loaded'. Before the accord comes into force with the rest of the Uruguay Round package, planned for January 1993, importing countries must lift quotas on 4 per cent of total imports by volume, followed by an additional 12 per cent by January 1993, 17 per cent by January 1996, 18 per cent by January 2000 and the remaining quotas by January 2003. However, importing countries can decide which products to 'integrate' into the Gatt system from among all textiles and clothing imports, whether currently restricted or not. According to the International Textiles and Clothing Bureau (ITCB), which represents 22 developing country exporters, this could mean no abolition of existing quotas until the year 2000, as importers first 'liberalise' the one-third or so products not now restrained under the MFA. During the transition, annual quota growth rates in effect for 1992 would be raised by 16 per cent on January 1 1993. From January 1996 they would be 25 per cent higher than now, and from January 2000 27 per cent higher. For countries with high quota growth rates, mostly medium and small exporters, this could mean big quota increases for some products. Overall, the ITCB calculates that quotas will expand on average by 55 per cent over the 10 years. In return, importing countries have secured special safeguard arrangements for products not yet 'integrated' that allow them to impose selective quotas (even where none now exist) if a surge of imports threatens 'serious damage' to the domestic industry. In addition, because the Uruguay Round package is a 'single undertaking', developing countries will have to sign up to strengthened Gatt rules on dumping, subsidies, rules of origin and counterfeiting, and their compliance with these rules will be monitored under the textiles accord. Finally, all countries including developing nations will have to scrap non-MFA restrictions on textile and clothing trade which are not Gatt-sanctioned (eg, for balance of payments reasons, or as part of preferential trading arrangements). The accord will apply to all Gatt members, whether MFA signatories or not. But trade with countries which are not Gatt members, China being by far the most important (see chart), will continue to be governed by bilateral pacts. The future of the textiles accord now rests on two unknowns: the outcome of the tariff negotiations now underway in Geneva, and the renegotiation demand on the agriculture text by the European Community. In the tariff talks, the US has been unwilling to lower its high tariffs on textiles and clothing, while the negotiations overall are being slowed by uncertainty over the agriculture deal. The present MFA was extended last year for just 18 months to the end of this year. If there is no Uruguay Round deal by then, the stage is set for a more restrictive MFA or a protectionist free-for-all in which developing countries would certainly be losers. The draft accord may not be what they hoped for, but it is far better than the alternative.  ------------------------------------------------------------------- TEXTILE TRADERS 1990  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Exporters       Dollarsbn      Importers    Dollarsbn  ------------------------------------------------------------------- EC                15.55        EC             13.86 China              7.00        Hong Kong*      9.22 South Korea**      5.68        US              6.17 Japan              5.56        Japan           3.72 US                 4.66        China           2.75 Switzerland        2.45        Canada          2.24 Hong Kong+         2.03        Austria         1.90 Austria            2.00        Switzerland     1.84 Pakistan++         2.00        Singapore       1.71 India**            1.56        South Korea**   1.65 Turkey             1.38        Sweden          1.22  ------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Provisional. + Domestic exports.

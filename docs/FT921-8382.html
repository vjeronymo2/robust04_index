			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / International Company News: Hungarian offshore bank posts strong advance CENTRAL-European Inter-national Bank (CIB), based in Hungary and the first offshore bank in central-eastern Europe, yesterday reported 1991 pre-tax profits of Dollars 33.4m, sharply up on a year earlier. CIB made Dollars 15m in 1991 after provisions, a rise of 47 per cent, and Central European Credit Bank (KHB), its wholly-owned Hungarian subsidiary, contributed Ft1.4bn (Dollars 18.4m) to the result. The 1991 earnings continue the record of lucrative returns for Banco Commerciale Italiana, Bayerische Vereinsbank, Societe Generale, the Long-term Credit Bank of Japan and the Taiyo Kobe Bank, the five foreign banks which together control 66 per cent of CIB. National Bank of Hungary, the Hungarian central bank, holds the remaining shareholding but is expected to withdraw eventually. The results, in proportion to paid-in capital of Dollars 35m, demonstrate the attractions of those Hungarian financial institutions which are relatively unencumbered by bad loans to insolvent state-owned companies. CIB attributed the profits growth to the healthy state of its main trade financing and short-term corporate lending business. CIB said it financed 15 per cent of Hungarian trade turnover in 1991. One of the banks' main clients is Tungsram, the Hungarian subsidiary of General Electric, the US company.</p>

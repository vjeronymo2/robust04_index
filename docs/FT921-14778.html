			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Water authority plans new charges PROPOSALS for a national charges scheme for the taking of water from rivers, lakes and underground sources in England and Wales were put forward yesterday by the National Rivers Authority, the environmental regulator. Most organisations, including water companies and industries that abstract water, need an NRA licence and have to pay charges. The scheme, to start next year, would replace the present complex and bureaucratic regional system, which produces more than 450 combinations of charges. There would be two elements to the new system, which should be finalised in the summer after consultations with water companies, industry, farmers and others. Those are an application charge and an annual charge, which would be set to cover the costs of the NRA's work on dealing with low-flow rivers and of planning future resources. About Pounds 74m is needed to fund work this year. Annual charges would be based on the volume of water authorised to be licensed each year and calculated using a unit rate of charge, which the NRA would fix each year, together with factors representing the nature of the source from which water is abstracted, the season when water is taken and the net loss to water resources. The NRA proposes a different unit charge rate for each of its 10 regions, although a single national rate has not been ruled out.</p>

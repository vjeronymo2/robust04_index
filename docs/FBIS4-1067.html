			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by P. Bulger] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 20 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom  Party [IFP] could not be treated with kid gloves because it was  now a full participant in the election process, African National  Congress Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa told the Multiparty  Negotiating Council [MPNC] at the World Trade Centre on  Wednesday [20 April].    Mr Ramaphosa welcomed IFP delegates back to the MPNC which  was sitting to consider constitutional amendments on the future  of Zulu king goodwill Zwelithini. The amendments were agreed  upon by IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi, ANC President Nelson  Mandela and President F W de Klerk on Tuesday.    While welcoming the IFP back, Mr Ramaphosa said the cost of  the IFP's return had been high. He said up to 700 people had  died in political violence since the IFP failed to follow  through on its electoral registration last month. "The cost of  bringing back the IFP into the election process has been very  high for our people," Mr Ramaphosa said.    He said a statement by IFP negotiator Walter Felgate that  the  IFP had deliberately played hard to get until the latest  possible moment and had been worth millions of rands, made his  heart bleed.    South African Communist Party Chairman Joe Slovo said he  hoped the IFP was entering the election with a view to accepting  the results. In a reference to kwaZulu's separatist notions, Mr  Slovo said a "Savimbi option had no future in South Africa.    Mr Felgate said the IFP was not entering the elections on a  conditional basis and was totally committed to the electoral  process. He said the IFP would work for peace and for a  successful election. He said he had been quoted selectively  about the publicity value of the IFP's strategy.</p>

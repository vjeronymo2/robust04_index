			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CANADA SOCCER PLAYER ALLEGES 5 TOOK BRIBES  </P> <P> Five members of Canada's national soccer team took thousands of dollars in  bribes to throw a tournament in Singapore in 1986, one of the players involved  in the deal told CBC-TV's "Fifth Estate" Tuesday night.  </P> <P> Paul James, 26, of Oakville, Ontario, said a friendly game of cards among  himself, Igor Vrablic of Waterloo, Ontario; David Norman of Coquitlam, British  Columbia; Chris Cheuden of Vancouver, British Columbia, and Hector Marinaro of  Mississauga, Ontario, turned into a conspiracy to throw Canada's semifinal game  against North Korea for $15,000 each.  </P> <P> The scandal broke in November, 1987, when the Royal Canadian Mounted Police  charged Vrablic, Norman, Cheuden and Marinaro with accepting bribes to affect  the outcome of an international tournament. James was to be granted immunity to  testify as a Crown witness.  </P> <P> Charges were dropped, however, when a judge ruled that the Criminal Code could  not be enforced outside Canada and that, therefore, whatever happened in  Singapore was out of the court's jurisdiction.  </P> <P> James, Vrablic, Norman and Marinaro have been playing soccer in Canada since  the charges were dropped. Cheuden has played in the United States.  </P></p>

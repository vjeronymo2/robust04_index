			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Buyers return for Lasmo VAGUE BID speculation and a presentation by one securities house were behind a strong showing for Lasmo, which jumped 10 to 209p, making it one of the best performers of London's top 100 stocks. Trading was active in the morning as an old rumour circulated that the French oil giant Elf Aquitaine might be interested in buying the North American assets acquired by Lasmo from Ultramar. Analysts tended to dismiss the talk, saying there was no reason for Elf to wait until the assets are offered to the public before showing its hand. The pricing of the public offer is expected today and estimated at between Dollars 1.07bn (Pounds 580m) and Dollars 1.16bn, and it seemed more likely that pre-pricing excitement had prompted the Lasmo rise. Also, Lasmo's broker, Cazenove, was said to have held a presentation to clients yesterday. SmithKline up The announcement of a joint distribution and development agreement helped SmithKline Beecham to rise 7 to 889p. The pharmaceuticals group said it reached an agreement with the US state of Michigan's Public Health Department that will make SmithKline the exclusive US distributor outside Michigan of vaccines for children developed by the state's public health department. Initial estimates of the gain to SmithKline were between Pounds 50m and Pounds 75m. Mr Paul Woodhouse, a pharmaceuticals analyst with Smith New Court, said the statement was 'further evidence that they are getting their act together. People are worried about volume output, and little things like this go some way to help.' Vodafone rallies After Monday's sharp fall, cellular telecoms operator Vodafone rallied as some in the market decided that the rival Cellnet's move to restructure its consumer operations was not the start of a price war that some observers had concluded. Vodafone recouped 10 to 344p with 8.6m shares traded. Reiterating his strong buy recommendation, Mr Evan Miller at Lehman Brothers said: 'This was not the start of a price war because the Cellnet move only affects consumer business. And as it will not come into effect until the end of the year, the jury will remain out until well after then.' Strauss Turnbull was also reported to have repeated its positive stance. An early session buy order in life insurer Legal &amp; General was said to have caused a squeeze, the shares closing 10 ahead at 393p. Merchant bank Kleinwort Benson was also advising clients to switch out of Prudential, steady at 250p, arguing that L &amp; G shares were cheap at the moment while the Pru was 'fairly valued'. However, Strauss Turnbull was said to be recommending a switch in the opposite direction. Concern about the profits of London International Group, due to be announced today, left the shares 3 easier at 258p. Arbitrageurs were said to be behind an advance in Midland Bank of 10 to 435p in heavy trading of 11m shares. The stock was also helped by a rise in HSBC Holdings shares, which boosts the value of HSBC's takeover offer for Midland. Results in the electrical energy sector were in line with expectations and had little effect on share prices. National Power eased  1/2 to 240 1/2 p in spite of a raised dividend, while Norweb hardened a penny to 335p as profits nearly doubled to Pounds 137.9m and the dividend increased to 17.7p from 10.94p. International drinks groups had an advantage over the more domestically orientated brewers, in view of fears that the recovery in the UK economy will be sluggish. Bass moved ahead 11 to 604p as its Holiday Inns subsidiary announced expansion plans in Czechoslovakia and other east European countries. United Biscuits declined 9 to 380p in an active business of 2.4m shares after Smith New Court cut its 1992 profits estimate to Pounds 207m from Pounds 216m and the 1993 forecast to Pounds 225m from Pounds 238m. Analysts at Smith said trading conditions had continued to worsen since the company's bearish statement at the annual meeting in May. On the other hand, Smith agreed with the recommendation given to Unilever by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew and County NatWest. Unilever jumped 11 to 944p, boosted by news that County had added the stock to its list of 30 recommended shares. This was based on the company's exposure to European countries with strong earnings growth. Other major food manufacturers traded nervously, with Tate &amp; Lyle losing a penny to 375p on heavy turnover of 2.4m shares while Cadbury Schweppes eased 2 to 477p, as both suffered from fears that UK economic recovery will prove elusive and margins in the UK and US are likely to be hit. Technical rallies helped RMC and Redland gain 11 each to 559p and 509p respectively. Rugby rose 6 to 195p as analysts reacted positively to a weekend visit to the cement maker. AMEC firmed 3 to 143p as SG Warburg was reported to be positive on the stock. Taylor Woodrow, at 98p, added 3 following a successful institutional lunch in Scotland. British Aerospace shrugged off recent worries about provisions and the dividend and bounced 12 to 306p. Smith New Court, reported to have had a sizeable buyer, is positive on the stock, as is Strauss Turnbull, where Mr Nick Cunningham believes the shares have fallen far enough. He said: 'The company is unlikely to go for complete closure of the regional aircraft division, thus the provisions will not be as big (as feared).' Increased appreciation of the successful bid for Dowty continued to boost shares in TI Group, which climbed 14 to 368p. Helped by a Smith New Court recommendation, Rolls-Royce firmed 3 to 166p on light turnover of 1.2m. News of good orders at FKI lifted the shares 2 to 78. Simon Engineering shed 5 to 243p after being dropped from County NatWest's top 30 best buys. Kleinwort Benson was reported to have been a seller of Smiths Industries, but the shares ended unchanged at 295p. Positive press comment following Monday's results helped BET improve 8 to 144p. Buying ahead of today's results from Cable and Wireless helped the telecoms group rise 6 to 540p. After its recent dismal run, Euro Disney rallied 25 to 1173p. Profit-taking knocked 12 off package holiday group Airtours, which closed at 292p. Car auctions and security group ADT moved up 20 to 478p on the back of buying in the US. Strength in Glaxo, up 12 at 735p, was also attributed to US demand. BP remained weak as a reduced profits forecast by Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull weighed on sentiment. The shares slipped 1 1/2 to 258p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (26).

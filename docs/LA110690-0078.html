			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET FOCUS;  </P> <P> IVORY COAST TRIES A RADICAL FORMULA FOR FISCAL RECOVERY;  </P> <P> ALASSANE OUATTARA HAD TO START FROM ZERO WHEN HE TOOK HOLD OF HIS COUNTRY'S  ECONOMIC REINS EIGHT MONTHS AGO. NOW, INTERNATIONAL BANKERS SAY HIS POLICIES  MAY HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE REST OF AFRICA.  </P> <P> The bittersweet scent of raw cocoa awaiting shipment overseas still permeates  the huge lagoon-side port district here, a reminder that this is the commodity  that created Africa's most stunning economic success story.  </P> <P> But a few miles away in the business district known as "The Plateau," the  windows of a top-floor office are sealed shut and the air conditioning is on  full blast, the better to obliterate the chocolaty smell that symbolizes how  reliance on a single major crop also came close to destroying the country.  </P> <P> "We can't continue to be a cocoa economy," says Alassane D. Ouattara, 48, now  in his eighth month as economic czar of the Ivory Coast.  </P> <P> In that time Ouattara, a native Ivorian with international banking credentials,  has turned Ivory Coast into a closely watched laboratory of Western economic  prescriptions for struggling African countries.  </P> <P> In a virtual blitzkrieg against the country's old, hidebound economy, Ouattara  has laid off excess government workers and cut bureaucratic costs with a  determination that would shame, say, the U.S. Congress.  </P> <P> Most recently, he negotiated to turn over Ivory Coast's huge state-owned  electrical utility to a subsidiary of the French industrial giant Bouygues, the  first decisive step in what is likely to be the largest program in Africa to  privatize a state-dominated economy.  </P> <P> "By African standards, he's moving by absolute lightning speed -- even by world  standards," says one leading international banker in admiration.  </P> <P> Handed presidential carte blanche to restructure a nation whose bureaucratic  bloat and nonchalantly pervasive corruption resemble that of a boom town just  past its prime, Ouattara may have one of the hardest jobs in Africa.  </P> <P> Ivory Coast was a forgotten backwater of the French empire when it received its  independence in 1960, seemingly doomed to living in the shadow of rich  neighbors like Ghana, which was then the economic and political heavyweight of  the region.  </P> <P> But its president, Felix Houphouet-Boigny, abjured the pan-Africanist and  quasi-socialist policies of Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah. He invited foreign talent to  live and work in his country and ordered a single-minded buildup of cocoa- and  coffee-producing capacity. Within a few years Ivory Coast was rich, the world's  leading cocoa producer.  </P> <P> But the "Ivorian miracle" did not last. When cocoa prices slumped to 15-year  lows in the 1980s, the economy followed them into the trough.  </P> <P> By the beginning of 1990, after two years of overpaying farmers for their crops  and trying to drive the world price back up by stockpiling cocoa, the country  was more or less bankrupt.  </P> <P> A plan to tighten belts by slashing public workers' salaries and imposing an  equivalent tax on private workers sent thousands of demonstrators into the  streets of Abidjan last spring and sparked violent confrontations with police  elsewhere. Houphouet-Boigny's 30-year-old reign was tottering.  </P> <P> The president's answer was to put Ouattara in full charge. An urbane product of  Ivorian, French and American schooling, his official title was to be president  of the Interministerial Coordination Committee of the Stabilization and  Economic Recovery Program; in essence, the president told him to do whatever  was necessary to rescue the economy, as fast as he knew how.  </P> <P> Ouattara says he took one look at the government's half-hearted recovery plans,  "scrapped everything and started from zero."  </P> <P> He canceled outright the pay cuts and new taxes. He moved to trim the public  payroll by firing excess workers, cutting expenses and improving lax customs  and tax collections.  </P> <P> He closed 12 Ivorian embassies, including seven in Africa, and laid off 7,000  of the country's 100,000 "temporary" public workers. The fleet of official  government cars was slashed by a third, allowing Ouattara to put 4,000  Mercedes-Benz and other vehicles on the block and producing great savings on  auto insurance, maintenance and gasoline.  </P> <P> In all, Ouattara claims to have been able to cut government spending by about  $2.8 billion and to raise $120 million in new revenues. Ivory Coast's fiscal  deficit has dropped from 18% of gross domestic product to 8%, and he expects to  show a surplus in three years.  </P> <P> In a way, Ivory Coast may be better equipped for a new economic surge than most  of its West African neighbors: Its boom years financed construction of the  region's best roads and telephone system, along with European-grade water  supplies and electrical utilities.  </P> <P> But cocoa also nurtured a culture of official corruption and favoritism on a  scale that became widely visible only when the economy suddenly shrank, the way  a receding tide exposes old shipwrecks to view.  </P> <P> The net result is a government that hands out important business franchises to  political favorites and remains deeply involved, to the country's detriment, in  the economy. Today the state owns 140 separate enterprises, ranging from the  phone company to a distributor of French wine, most of which are sloppily run  by political favorites. These enterprises register losses every year in rough  relation to the actual ratio of state ownership.  </P> <P> Between 1982 and 1988, Ouattara said, wholly state-owned enterprises showed a  combined net loss of $340 million. Those in which the state owned at least 51%  lost $40 million. But those in which the state was a minority owner made  combined profits of $576 million.  </P> <P> "This disparity indicates above all an insufficient grasp of financial and  administrative management," Ouattara said, adding that his next move will be to  arrange the sell-off of virtually all those state enterprises.  </P> <P> The sale of the electrical utility to Bouygues -- actually a management  contract that will eventually be transformed into an outright sale of assets --  will be followed by the sale of the state telephone system, potentially a major  moneymaker, and the state's palm oil distribution company. Government stakes in  local subsidiaries of Royal Dutch Shell and other oil companies are also for  sale.  </P> <P> The top-down approach of offering the most alluring properties for sale first  is designed to signal Ouattara's genuine determination to change the Ivorian  system. It's in contrast to the standard African privatization program, which  involves trying gingerly to sell off the most marginal companies first,  producing a glut of unmarketable, broken-down railroads and steel mills.  </P> <P> "Of course, if you put all the dogs and turkeys on the table first, no one will  buy them," remarks a prominent West African economist.  </P> <P> That Ivory Coast's alternatives have drawn rare raves from the World Bank and  the International Monetary Fund is not entirely surprising, given that in his  program Ouattara is not only preaching to the choir: He is a former member of  the choir.  </P> <P> Until recently, Ouattara was the IMF's top officer for Africa, a job in which  he had to persuade leaders of countries around the continent to take many of  the steps he has taken now.  </P> <P> Subsequently he became governor of the French-financed Central Bank of West  African States, a job that made him the central banker of seven former French  colonies and put his signature on their jointly issued currency. (Ivory Coast  accounts for about 60% of the seven combined economies.)  </P> <P> In fact, Ouattara is keeping his job at the Central Bank and taking no pay from  the Ivorian government. He handles both jobs from his top-floor office at the  bank's grandiose new office building in Abidjan and flies from country to  country in a private jet.  </P> <P> He ignores many of the quick-fix economic strategies that waft across the  African landscape. He rejected restrictions on moving capital out of the  country, for example, recognizing that the difficulty of moving profits and  capital abroad is a major constraint on outside investment in Africa.  </P> <P> "Those people who got their money out were being good economists," he said. "It  means our policy wasn't right." Capital would stay in Ivory Coast if people  thought they could make an adequate profit, he reasoned.  </P> <P> He was similarly concise when his plan to privatize the electricity and  telephone services in Ivory Coast was criticized as the sale to foreigners of  "strategic" state assets.  </P> <P> "The notion of a "strategic' sector is a false concept," he snapped back.  </P> <P> With the president's strong backing and the financial support of the  international community, Ouattara knows he has a window of opportunity to push  his policies through before political opposition has a chance to jell.  </P> <P> Still, there is much reason to question how far Ouattara will be able to go  before the entrenched interests in the Ivorian economy begin to fight back in  earnest. For one thing, what he sees as fraud, corruption and patronage have  been key elements in the governing style of his own patron, President  Houphouet-Boigny.  </P> <P> It is Houphouet-Boigny who appointed the managers of most of the  under-performing state enterprises, and Houphouet-Boigny who has handed out the  franchises and licenses that give political favorites the right to collect  export fees and customs duties without doing a dime's worth of work.  </P> <P> "Ouattara's credible right now because he's not part of the regime, of the  gang, and he's getting results," says an international economist here. "But a  lot of people are increasingly saying, 'He's touching on my interest.' There's  no question that many who have lost because of him are going to try to put  banana peels under his feet."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Balancing The Books  </P> <P> Alassane D. Ouattara's belt-tightening program for Ivory Coast includes these  steps:  </P> <P> Selling the electrical utility, telephone system and palm oil distribution  companies to private firms.  </P> <P> Closing 12 Ivorian embassies.  </P> <P> Laying off 7,000 public workers.  </P> <P> Cutting the fleet of government vehicles by a third, in the process putting  4,000 Mercedes-Benz and other vehicles on the block.  </P> <P> Using these steps, Ouattara claims to have cut government spending by $2.8  billion and raised $120 million in new revenues. The country's fiscal deficit  has dropped from 18% of the gross domestic product to 8%.  </P></p>

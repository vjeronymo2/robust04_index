The proposed system contains several innovations to provide assurances that USDA-inspected and passed poultry products will be free of visible contamination and will require the use of approved antimicrobial treatments in all official establishments. The proposed system would replace all existing systems of poultry post-mortem inspection with a single system in which two FSIS inspectors would staff each poultry processing line and examine carcasses for disease and visible contamination. The proposed regulation would not mandate a reduction in maximum linespeeds. The proposed system would place additional responsibility on official establishments to assure that the poultry they process is wholesome and free of disease. Establishment personnel, positioned before the on-line post-mortem FSIS inspector, would check carcasses prior to inspection and present for inspection only those poultry that are free of disease. Additionally, they would identify all poultry requiring off-line trim, salvage or reprocessing prior to presentation to FSIS for inspection. A second FSIS inspector would be positioned at a new inspection station that would incorporate that portion of the processing line between viscera harvest and the chiller. This is a location where contamination can occur but where there is currently no on-line inspection taking place. Finished Product Standards would be revised to eliminate process tolerances for fecal contamination. Recordkeeping and verification procedures would be required so that establishment process control could be assured. Additionally, all contaminated poultry that are reprocessed would be reinspected on the main processing line by the second FSIS inspector and antimicrobial treatments would required to be applied to carcasses before the chilling operation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be received on or before October 11, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments to Policy Evaluation and Planning Staff, Attn: Diane Moore, Room 3171 South Agriculture Building, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250.

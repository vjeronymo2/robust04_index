			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report] </F>   [Text] A meeting of the Central Commission for Humanitarian  Assistance, which was chaired by Armenak Darbinyan, deputy  chairman of the commission and deputy minister of economic  affairs of the Republic of Armenia, was held on 30 March.    Ishkhan Martirosyan, deputy minister of agriculture,  reported  how this sector had disposed of the humanitarian assistance it  had received last year from overseas and on anticipated  assistance in 1994. It was noted specifically that 72 tonnes of  chemically treated sunflower seeds, 1 tonne of which had been  allocated to Talinskiy Rayon, had been received along Armenia  Assistance Fund lines. As ascertained, it was these seeds that  were being sold on the streets of Yerevan, as a result of which  instances of poisoning were recorded. The commission noted that  criminal proceedings had already been instituted in this case.    It was resolved at the meeting to render assistance in 1994  to orphaned children and certain strata of society,  specifically, single retirees, schools and preschools of the  city of Yerevan, cities of the disaster zone and area schools,  cultural organizations, members of the staff of certain  vocational-technical schools of Yerevan, and others.    It was also noted at the meeting that there is currently a  multitude of nongovernment charitable organizations rendering  humanitarian assistance to various strata of the population of  the republic. But their work is uncoordinated, and the aid is  frequently received by the same recipients. In this connection  the Central Commission for Humanitarian Assistance of the  Republic of Armenia requests that the nongovernment  organizations coordinate their operations with the commission.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A curfew has been introduced in the 12-kilometer  security zone along the Inguri river.    The command of the Russian peacekeeping forces took this  decision. An address to the population broadcast on Abkhaz  television says that the curfew will be in force from 21:00 till  6:00 in the security zone covering 12 kilometers along both  banks of the Inguri river.    All people who have arms (except the state management  bodies)  must give them over to local power bodies. Charges will be  brought against those who disobey this order.    All armed people in the security zone except the state  management bodies will be detained and cars will be inspected.  Peacekeepers are allowed to use arms in case of violation of  this order.    Headquarters of the Russian peacekeeping forces in the zone  of the Abkhaz-Georgian conflict warned that if there were  attacks against detachments and servicemen of the peacekeeping  forces they could "open fire without warning."    On Friday two Russian motor rifle battalions came to Zugdidi  (western Georgia) from Batumi. Air landing detachments will  arrive in Abkhazia's Gali region the same day.    Russia's deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov, private  envoy of the Russian president, also arrived in Abkhazia  Friday. He plans to meet with chairman of Abkhazia's  parliament Vladislav Ardzinba. During this meeting they will  discuss the course of the peacemaking operation and several  issues related to the upcoming Georgian-Abkhaz negotiations  scheduled for June 30 in Geneva.</p>

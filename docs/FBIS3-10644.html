			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Francisco Tudela: "Geo-Monopoly"] </F>   [Text] On 12 February, Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa made the talks with Bill Clinton's administration's  very new National Economic Council fail. The talks had the  purpose of opening the Japanese market to U.S. exports.  <H5>  Goals and Planning </H5>   This failure was a sign of Japanese annoyance at the U.S.  "plan" for the Japanese market. U.S. officials, in the best  tradition of the 1930's New Deal, requested planned  participation in the Japanese market through previously fixed  quantitative "goals." These "goals" do not accomplish anything  but to destabilize Hosokawa's government, which was elected  after a government promise to fight the large Japanese  bureaucracy and its excessive planning. The "goals" only imply  more planning and more paperwork for bureaucrats.    U.S. negotiator Mickey Kantor reacted against the Japanese  rejection, proposing a list of harsh sanctions against Japan on  15 February. The truth is that these sanctions would be  ineffective because Japanese firms have so many factories abroad  that have become, in practice, immune to sanctions.  <H5>  Seeking Their Share </H5>   Since then the U.S. Congress has brought back to the fore an  old demand. Members of Congress called on Japan to buy more  U.S. spare parts and automobiles, despite the fact that Detroit  almost does not produce cars with the steering wheel on the  right. Congress also is revising the "Super 301" provision  applicable to U.S. foreign trade laws and through which the  government can impose unilateral reprisals against other  countries' "discriminatory practices."    The Americans not only reacted against Hosokawa's NO, but  also against the Japanese refusal -- which followed the NO -- to  respect a previous agreement giving the U.S. consortium Motorola  a larger share of the Japanese telecommunications market.  <H5>  The Real Problem </H5>   These are, however, only the symptoms of a much larger  problem: the negative U.S. trade balance with Japan. In effect,  in January alone, the U.S. trade balance with Japan showed a  $6.1 billion deficit, 17 percent more than last year. The  overall Japanese trade balance surplus with the United States  now stands at $50 billion.    In a fascinating article called "Let us play geo-monopoly:  diplomacy is to occupy your time with other nations' affairs"  (THE NEW YORK TIMES 30/Jan/94), Thomas L. Friedman points out  the Clinton's administration's great concern with the  insufficient Japanese purchase of U.S. exports and tells how  U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen asked the Japanese Finance  Ministry to not only reduce taxes to stimulate consumption of  "U.S.-made products," but also requested a commitment not to  increase the IGV [general sales tax] for two years.  <H5>  Geo-Monopoly </H5>   According to Friedman, U.S. Treasury officials are fully  conscious that those measures also will imply a destabilization  of Hosokawa's economic policies, but have decided to maintain  the pressure. Friedman says that for the present U.S.  administration, "all foreign policies must be economic policies  and all economic policies must be foreign policies." Therefore,  this new diplomacy does not stop, as in the past, at other  countries' independent and sovereign borders, but on the  contrary, it begins right there and sinks deeply in the social  and economic system of other nations.    This new policy, baptized as "geo-monopoly" by Friedman,  changes the traditional definition of who is a friend and who an  enemy in the international arena. Friedman describes how for  U.S. Treasury officials "our enemy there is bureaucracy" (in  Japan).  <H5>  Polyglot Joke </H5>   Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Treasury Secretary  Lloyd Bentsen now are articulating an offensive against Japan  under the flag of this new policy. Their strategy includes,  according to Friedman, "to deliberately cause a political crisis  (...) to pressure Japanese leaders." The Japanese, conscious of  this fact, say, half-jokingly and-half seriously, that "the  United States is the only opposition party here."    If political crises are now just tools serving U.S. economic  diplomatic purposes, then these "jokes" will be sung in many  languages in the future.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by the Press Center of the 206th Chivalrous Brigade </F> of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army from the Zvornik front]    [Text] Since early morning the aggressor has been pounding  the entire Zvornik free territory with tanks, howitzer  batteries, and mortar batteries of all calibers. At the same  time on the Mt. Majevica section of the front, the aggressor has  been trying in vain with combined artillery and infantry attacks  to break through our newly established defense lines. The brave  fighters of the 206th Chivalrous Brigade of Zvornik, commanded  by Commander Semsudin Muminovic, have rapidly and effectively  repulsed a number of infantry attacks by Karadzic's cutthroats,  defying a maelstrom of shells that has been raining down on them.    The chetniks seem incapable of understanding that they have  suffered a total defeat on the peaks of Mt. Majevica, and are  constantly launching new infantry attacks, ignoring the bodies  of dozens of their fellow fighters that will forever remain on  these peaks.</p>

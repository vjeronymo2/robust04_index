			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Radical accounts changes proposed THE PROFIT and loss account and balance sheet of many companies could be fundamentally reshaped under radical proposals unveiled by the Accounting Standards Board yesterday. In two draft chapters in its 'statement of principles', the board makes recommendations that could force all leases and off-balance-sheet finance instruments to be included on the balance sheet. It would also cast a shadow over the widespread practice of making large provisions for reorganisation expenses on buying a company, which can then be fed back to the profit and loss account. 'These go a long way beyond existing definitions,' said Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the board. 'They are pretty fundamental and we expect an onslaught of criticism.' The impact of the draft chapters would be to improve the transparency of accounts, and probably overall to increase companies' liabilities and allow less room for them to massage profits. The new chapters are the foundations on which new standards will be built. The first chapter - the elements of financial statements - defines the basic elements or items in accounts. It says that assets are 'rights or other access to future economic benefits controlled by an entity as a result of past transactions or events'. It stresses that they do not require certainty, but only some possibility of access to future benefit. Liabilities are 'an entity's obligations to transfer economic benefits as a result of past transactions or events.' The second chapter - covering the 'recognition' of these elements - says that they should be incorporated into the accounts if they meet three criteria: they meet the definitions; they can be measured reliably; and that there is evidence of changes in assets or liabilities having occurred. Organisations have until October 31 to comment on the discussion drafts.

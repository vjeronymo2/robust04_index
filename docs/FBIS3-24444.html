			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with A. Vavilov, first deputy minister of finance </F> of the Russian Federation, by V. Andreyev; place and date not  given: "High Taxes or High Responsibility?"]    [Text] The problem of nonpayments can be called one  of the main ills of the Russian economy which also affects the  fiscal interests of the state--many enterprises simply stop  paying taxes, the absence of funds in their settlement accounts  being given as the explanation. At the same time, the potential  of regulatory state organs with regard to the nonpayers is quite  limited. Our interlocutor, A. Vavilov, the first deputy minister  of finance of the Russian Federation, discussed measures that  the state intends to take in order to restore order in this  area.    [Andreyev] Andrey Petrovich, how could a situation emerge in  which even the tax inspector is not in a position to collect the  amount of taxes due from an enterprise?    [Vavilov] The essence of the nonpayment problem is in the  fact that enterprises are no longer held accountable for the  nonpayment of anything. In conjunction with a lack of funds,  they do not pay taxes to the budget, do not pay their suppliers  for goods and services, and so on. At the same time, some  enterprises have, in addition to the settlement account,  foreign-exchange, deposit, and other accounts to which the tax  inspectorate has no access.    Besides, even the most inveterate nonpayers as a rule own  certain property that is not directly related to production  operations--passenger cars, and so on. Even in a case where the  bank has on file the demand of the tax inspectorate to debit  funds without acceptance, an enterprise will manage to acquire  such property or make other payments (for example, pay bonuses  to its employees) bypassing the settlement account. Under the  current procedure, the tax inspector who represents state power  is powerless.    [Andreyev] However, if someone is not in a position to pay  his debts in a normal economy, he may simply be declared  bankrupt. Even here a creditor is entitled to bring a relevant  lawsuit in the court. Can the tax service be empowered to at  least act as a regular creditor does, and can a debt to the  state be considered possible grounds for making a claim for all  property of the enterprise?    [Vavilov] This is precisely the essence of measures proposed  by the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Russia in  order to create an effective system for the collection of taxes.  First of all, the tax service will be granted the right to levy  execution upon any accounts of a given legal entity or  individual in the event that taxes are not transferred to the  budget in a timely manner. The tax inspectorate will also be  granted the right to confiscate toward the unpaid taxes a  proportion of the property of enterprises which is not directly  related to the main line of production. Finally, in the extreme  case that these funds for the settlement with the budget are  lacking, reorganization measures or bankruptcy procedures may be  used against the enterprise.    Of course, the latter scenario is quite painful and  undesirable, but it will be used unequivocally against  enterprises whose debt to the state and whose financial  situation leave no hope for the normalization of the situation.    We also plan to introduce certain punitive sanctions to be  used against companies implicated in the violations of  disbursement discipline and procedures for settlements in cash.  Certain restrictions also existed in this area before, but  violators were virtually not liable in any way.    [Andreyev] Are there plans to introduce any new taxes or  change their rates, in addition to what was envisioned by the  December decrees of the president?    [Vavilov] At present, we are not planning to make any major  changes in the tax system itself. As of now, the most urgent  task is to create an optimal mechanism for the collection of  taxes.    [Andreyev] In what manner will the government solve the  problem of mutual nonpayments by enterprises as far as the  prevention of the growth of defaulted debt is concerned?    [Vavilov] On the suggestion of the Bank of Russia, a  calendar  sequence of payments will be introduced. At present a debtor  enterprise receiving funds for its products may dispose of them  as it sees fit, allocating them, for example, to term deposits  or conversion instead of paying the debt whereas in the  immediate future, the enterprise will be able to dispose of the  funds received only after it settles with the state and other  creditors. Even the possibility of introducing a unified bank  account with settlement, currency, deposit and other subaccounts  is being considered as an extreme measure. Other, less radical  scenarios for solving the problem are possible. However, control  over the honoring of their obligations by enterprises will be  restored, one way or another.</p>

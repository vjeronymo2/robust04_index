			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON STATE;  </P> <P> MISSING JOGGER FOUND DEAD IN RIVER  </P> <P> The farming community of Acme ended its search for 18-year-old Amanda Stavik  with the discovery of her body in the shallow Nooksack River near her home. She  had been missing since she went jogging Friday with her dog while home from  college on Thanksgiving break. The dog returned alone. Authorities believe  Stavik was abducted, said Whatcom County Sheriff's Sgt. Ron Peterson, who  refused to discuss the condition of the remains or the cause of death pending  an autopsy. Peterson said there were no suspects in the case and that anyone  who might have noticed anything suspicious along Highway 9, near which Stavik  was last seen jogging about 3 miles from her home, should contact police.  </P></p>

			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Not such a safe haven: Why bond market investors have had a more exciting year than they might have expected or wanted Bond markets are supposed to be the natural haven for investors who want a secure income and minimal excitement. In 1994 they have been more like a high-tech adventure playground in which the electronics have gone awry. The collapse in bond prices around the world prompted by a quarter-point increase in US interest rates in February has continued to reverberate, leaving many governments with unsustainably high real borrowing costs. How, with the benefit of hindsight, can these gyrations be explained? And what do they tell us about the state of the financial system? As with most seismic upheavals in capital markets, the starting point is monetary policy. Throughout 1993, this was lax in the US as a result of the Federal Reserve's continuing efforts to prop up the US banking system. Looking back, it is clear that monetary policy remained loose for longer than was necessary. By the end of last year, excess liquidity had spilled over into foreign markets. A global bull market in bonds turned into a bubble. As the charts imply, US investors' foreign purchases of bonds and equities reached an unprecedented peak in 1993. It is fashionable to attribute this to US pension fund investors' new-found enthusiasm for international diversification. Yet the subsequent plunge in the outflow of dollar funds suggests that this was less important than two other, more speculative forces. The first was the response of US retail investors to disappearing inflation. Just as unanticipated inflation in the 1970s penalised those who held long-dated fixed-interest securities and forced them to save more to offset the decline in the value of their real capital, unanticipated disinflation in the 1990s penalised people who held short-term assets. It deprived them of income as nominal interest rates fell. US depositors, including many unsophisticated pensioners, deserted the banking system in the 1990s for higher-yielding bond mutual funds (the US equivalent of unit trusts) or for equity funds that appeared to hold out the hope of capital growth. Yet as capital values rose and the yield on US Treasuries fell, mutual funds, in turn, were forced to scour global markets for higher income. They became panic buyers of high-yielding paper in the more outlandish economies of Latin America and Asia. That was the unleveraged part of the story, since mutual fund investors were speculating chiefly with their own money. The second force behind the bubble came from the commercial banking system, where the banks were using other people's money to take a huge speculative position on bonds. They did so in response to clear signals from the Fed chairman Mr Alan Greenspan. Part of the Fed's strategy for restoring the profits and capital of a banking system burdened by bad debts in property was to keep short-term interest rates artificially low from early in the decade. The banks could thus borrow cheaply from depositors to invest in higher-yielding longer-term government IOUs. As long as everyone knew that the market was being rigged in the banks' favour to avoid a credit crunch, the mismatch in the maturity of assets and liabilities was riskless. So the commercial banks entered 1994 with more than Dollars 300bn of public sector debt on their books. With the Fed providing a safety net, it was not surprising that small amounts of capital should support larger and larger speculative positions on bonds - leverage, in a word. What was surprising was that, when Mr Greenspan indicated in January that the time had come to tighten policy, the momentum was such that nobody in the markets responded. Only after February 4, when people confronted a worldwide margin call as banks demanded more collateral for their loans, did the financial community wake up. Why was the fall-out so severe? The extent of leverage in the system - which multiplied the loss arising from a modest increase in interest rates - provides one answer. The misnamed hedge funds which borrowed vast sums to speculate in the market were merely the tip of the iceberg. As we now know, everyone from the treasury department at Procter &amp; Gamble to the officials at Orange County, California, had taken to behaving like hedge fund managers: they were punting, not hedging. So, too, had the US investment banks. Their collapsing profits this year are symptomatic of a wider shift in the culture of finance towards high-octane trading on their own account. The resulting increase in leveraged dealing activity helps explain the volatility and extraordinary foreshortening of response times in the markets. In effect, a bear market adjustment that might once have been spread over years took place in a matter of weeks. And as the tide of liquidity retreated, the conflicts of interest inherent in the banks' new trading focus emerged. US industrialists discovered their treasurers' 'hedging' activity consisted of buying complex derivative products from Wall Street about which Wall Street knew more than the treasurers. Yet derivatives - swaps, forwards, options and the rest - have, like the hedge funds, received a disproportionate amount of blame. Orange County's Dollars 2bn losses had more to do with the use of 'repos' - sale and repurchase agreements - than derivatives. And one of the biggest new sources of volatility in the system, collateralised mortgage obligations (CMOs), are not really derivatives at all. Yet they have been responsible for a whiplash effect in bond markets all across the world. One of the problems of a US-style mortgage market, where fixed-rate mortgages are packaged and turned into securities for investors, is that the outstanding life of those mortgages changes with interest rates. If interest rates rise, mortgage borrowers have an incentive to hold on to their mortgages longer, since their interest burden is lower than at the new going rate. If rates fall, they have an incentive to repay the mortgage sooner and to take out a cheaper one. Institutional investors that use CMOs to match fixed liabilities or to speculate are thus obliged to hedge against potential changes in the life of their mortgages. Immediately after the Fed tightened in February, the duration of the mortgage component of the Lehman Brothers Bond Index, covering Dollars 1,200bn of outstanding mortgage paper, rose from 3.47 years to 4.35 years. Analysts at JP Morgan calculated at the time that to offset the increase in the duration of the portfolio, investors would have had to sell Dollars 140bn of 10-year Treasury bonds or nearly Dollars 250bn of five-year Treasuries. Current estimates of such short positions range even higher. These sums are huge, even by the standards of the bond markets. They explain a great deal of this year's selling and hedging activity in bonds and derivatives markets. They also offer a clue to why the futures markets' implicit forecasts of interest rates often appear so much more bearish than most commentators' assumptions. The sheer weight of money has probably been defeating arbitrageurs who would normally iron out such anomalies, not least because they have been the victims of margin calls from their own bankers. The leverage in the system is still unwinding, as the US regional banks' provisions against losses on bond portfolios underline. Yet the new volatility of the bond markets is not exclusively explained by technical factors. Distortions to the underlying pattern of global capital flows are also to blame. The natural flow of capital across the world is from Japan, with a current account surplus in 1993 of Dollars 131bn, to the US, with a current account deficit of Dollars 109bn. Yet as the accompanying charts demonstrate, long-term capital flows run counter to the financial requirements of the two economies. The US, despite the need to finance a large current account deficit, has become a long-term capital exporter. The resulting leakage of portfolio funds from the world's biggest debtor country weakened the dollar against the yen. Japanese investors, having lost billions on their US Treasury stocks in the 1980s, are no longer prepared to act as stabilising speculators to underpin the price of dollar assets. This means more of the US balance of payments financing burden has fallen on short-term bank finance and central bank purchases for the official reserves - a recipe for unstable currency and bond markets. Instability is made worse by a new capital regime for Japanese life companies, which imposes a heavy risk-weighting on foreign bonds relative to domestic bonds. Higher yields outside Japan are an attractive match for the life companies' fixed income obligations on policies. Yet the rules encourage them to take only short-term speculative positions in foreign markets. A more fundamental explanation for the rise in bond yields this year has simply been the increasing calls made on the global pool of capital as economic recovery raised the demand for finance. According to Mr Michael Hughes of Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities, the real economy competed with the capital markets for funds this year, and won. In January there was an overwhelming consensus that, while the interest rate cycle in the US was on the turn, European bond markets would provide a further leg to the bull market since Europe was pulling only slowly out of recession. In the event Europe - along with the rest of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development area - saw a far greater upsurge in manufacturing output in 1994 than the forecasters expected. The perception of accelerating growth played as important a part in the movement of bond prices as the Fed's decision to tighten policy. If the rise in yields in the British index-linked gilt market is any guide, this factor accounts for a little under 1 per cent of the rise in bond yields since February. The remaining rise in yields over the year in the accompanying table has much to do with increasing worries about credit risk. There has been a flight from countries with a large outstanding stock of debt and a history of devaluation. In the case of Canada and Italy, the financial concerns are compounded respectively by the fear of separatism in Quebec and the weakness of the Italian political structure. The market's worries about first-world debt reflect a generalised decline in public finances. In the 15 years to 1992, gross national saving as a percentage of gross domestic product fell from 23.5 per cent to 19.4 per cent in the OECD area. Over the same period net public debt rose from 21.2 per cent of GDP to 36.7 per cent, and is projected by the OECD secretariat to rise to 43.9 per cent by 1995. These figures make no allowance for rapidly growing unfunded pension liabilities. Governments find it easy to default on their pension promises: Germany and the UK already have, by downgrading the benefits in their state pension systems. But will governments also default on their debts to investors, either internally through inflation or externally through devaluation? As long as real rates of interest exceed underlying real growth rates in the more heavily indebted first-world countries, default is an issue that becomes harder to ignore. Yet it is striking that governments are increasingly using their regulatory powers to give themselves breathing space in financing large structural budget deficits. Apart from the new Japanese life assurance regime, minimum solvency requirements for US pension funds include an inbuilt bias in favour of bonds. There must also be some likelihood that the regulatory backlash in the US Congress over Orange County and other scandals will push institutional investors even further in this direction, notwithstanding the current enthusiasm for balanced budget legislation. In the UK, pension funds will shortly be encouraged by a new minimum solvency regime to increase their bond holdings. Many are doing so already, in response to the maturing of their liabilities. Across the European Union, the decision to drop the recent pension fund directive liberalising capital flows in the single market will perpetuate domestic constraints on overseas investment and a bias in favour of government bonds. While such regulatory market-rigging provides some protection against a foreign bond-investors' strike, it usually does so at the price of raising the borrowing country's cost of capital and increasing bond market volatility. In the banking system, meanwhile, the Bank for International Settlements' capital regime accords a zero risk-weighting for government borrowers. This encourages a distortion in favour of those countries that the bond markets regard with most suspicion - and is a recipe, ultimately, for a repeat in Europe of the Latin American debt crisis. The government borrowers' best hope must be that the political climate will permit fiscal adjustment on a sufficient scale to bring the bond markets round. An important lesson of 1994 is that, if the bond markets buy the story, the whiplash will prove quite as devastating on the way up as on the way down.  ----------------------------------------- BENCHMARK GOVERNMENT BONDS  -----------------------------------------                                   percent                                    point               Feb 3     Dec 21   increase  ----------------------------------------- Australia      6.50      10.15      3.65 Belgium        6.52       8.38      1.86 Canada         6.50       9.00      2.50 France         5.79       8.14      2.35 Germany        5.71       7.51      1.80 Italy          8.55      12.32      3.77 Japan          3.60       4.49      0.88 Spain          7.81      11.48      3.67 UK             6.36       8.49      2.13 US             5.76       7.80      2.04  ----------------------------------------- Source: Datastream  -----------------------------------------</p>

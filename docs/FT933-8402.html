			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / The case against redistribution: America President Bill Clinton's budget raises an age-old philosophical question: to what extent is state-mandated redistribution from the rich to the rest of society justified? The administration has imposed one of the biggest tax increases in US history (nearly Dollars 250bn over five years) yet boasts that only the top 1 per cent or so of taxpayers will face any increase in income tax. Some 80 per cent of the burden will supposedly be borne by families with incomes of Dollars 200,000 or more. Such an extraordinary emphasis on redistribution has few historical parallels. Yet few Republicans have had the courage publicly to challenge Mr Clinton. Afraid of appearing hard-hearted or apologists for the rich, most redirected their fire to proposals that made sense, such as the planned broad tax on energy. Since the mid-19th century, forcible redistribution has typically been justified by likening national income to a giant cake. Since we all have similar material needs, the cake ought to be divided equally. Alas, this is not practicable, but government can reduce inequality by imposing progressive taxes - taxes that rise more than proportionately with income. Utilitarians made this sound scientific by arguing that the law of diminishing returns must apply to money. The greater a person's earnings the less valuable must be each additional dollar of income: Dollars 100 means little to a millionaire but a great deal to a beggar. The way to promote the greatest happiness of the greatest number was thus to redistribute cash from rich to poor until all incomes were equalised. Such logic eventually led to top marginal rates of income tax in excess of 90 per cent in most industrialised countries. But, of course, the cake model is grossly misleading. The level of national output is not a given, but depends crucially on economic incentives which are blunted if incomes are equalised. This point may not seem compelling to salaried employees of large, stable organisations. In the short run changes in tax rates may not affect their hours of work or effort. But anybody engaged in risky or entrepreneurial work does care about marginal tax rates. A freelance journalist's incentive to write extra articles will be greater if the top tax rate is 30 per cent rather than 40 per cent or 60 per cent. And the trend towards corporate 'downsizing' suggests that many people formerly in stable employment will face a less secure future. More important, the cake analogy wrongly implies that society is a giant organisation run by government. In reality, it consists of a myriad of different individuals with different aptitudes pursuing different interests. Government is needed not to manage everything but to underwrite essential institutions, such as the legal system. Material rewards depend on an unpredictable amalgam of effort, luck and tastes. Luck covers inherited wealth, innate abilities and sheer good fortune, for example selecting a profession that rises in esteem. Tastes reflect preferences for financial as opposed to non-financial rewards: many economics professors, for example, could triple their salaries by working on Wall Street, but prefer a less hectic and more thoughtful lifestyle. If government is not regarded as an all-powerful mother wielding a cake knife, the logical fiscal system is one that leaves economic relationships unchanged: in other words taxes that are proportional to income, rather than progressive. This meets the practical requirement that taxes should be related to ability to pay, but denies the majority a right to impose higher tax rates on a minority (the wealthy) than they pay themselves. It regards taxes as a tool for financing essential public services, including a generous safety net for the poorest, but not as a means for social engineering. Such a rule meets common sense ethical standards. A rich man eating caviar while children starve is an obscene spectacle. But what if the children are eating hamburgers and chips? Is that kind of inequality fundamentally wrong? There are also more mundane reasons for regarding specially high taxes on the wealthy with scepticism. They are rarely paid. Mr Clinton is raising the top rate by a third to 40 per cent. This translates into large notional tax increases for the rich. A couple earning Dollars 500,000 a year faces an annual increase of about Dollars 27,000; a couple earning Dollars 1m an increase of about Dollars 80,000. Will such families hand over these sums or will they call their tax lawyers and find legal ways to reduce their liabilities? History points to increased avoidance. The share of federal tax paid by the top  1/2 per cent of taxpayers (those currently on more than Dollars 220,000) has typically oscillated between 15 per cent and 20 per cent, regardless of the level of the top rate. Mr Robert Barro of Harvard University points out that this share reached a postwar record high of 22 per cent in 1988, after the top rate fell to 28 per cent, higher than in 1960 when the top rate was 91 per cent. In other words at the peak of the 'greedy' 1980s the rich were shouldering a larger share of the national tax burden than ever before. This partly reflected special factors, such as soaring asset prices, but the low tax rates also increased incentives for top earners and reduced the advantage of taking income in non-taxable forms, such as fringe benefits. The Clinton administration will say that a 40 per cent top rate is not high by historical standards. True, but the direction of change is ominous. So is the hypocrisy of many liberal (left-leaning) Democrats who enjoy quite lavish personal lifestyles while preaching a gospel of hairshirt egalitarianism. Contrary to popular rhetoric, there are non-selfish, principled reasons for questioning the merits of a tax increase restricted to 1 per cent of the population.</p>

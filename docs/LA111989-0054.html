			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: TOM BROWN'S SCHOOLDAYS BY THOMAS HUGHES (OXFORD UNIVERSITY  PRESS: $2.25)  </P> <P> Originally published in 1857, "Tom Brown's Schooldays" was one of the first  books written especially for boys. However, it's difficult to imagine modern  children wanting to slog through Thomas Hughes' prose, which is as fussy and  cluttered as a Victorian parlor. (The reader sometimes gets the impression that  Hughes is trying to sneak up on the subject of a sentence and surprise it.)  Ironically, most readers who pick up "Tom Brown" today are interested not in  the hero, whom Hughes intended as the embodiment of wholesome, manly English  Christianity, but in the villain, the cowardly, bullying Flashman, whom George  MacDonald Fraser turned into the irredeemable but dashing hero of a series of  historical novels.  </P></p>

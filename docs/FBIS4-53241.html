			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 16 (KCNA) -- Pyongyang workers held a  meeting today supporting the South Korean workers' struggle for  wage hike.    Yi Chu-hyon, chairman of the Pyongyang municipal committee  of  the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, said in his  speech:    "The South Korean workers are overdriven for 13-16 hours a  day to earn far less than the minimum living cost. It is only  too natural that they rose up in a struggle against the  authorities' anti-popular predatory and wage curbing policies.    "The South Korean rulers, however, let loose numerous riot  police to disperse rallies and demonstrations by force and  arrest workers, far from meeting their demand. Nothing has  changed in the conditions of the South Korean workers after the  Kim Yong-sam puppet clique came to power."    Noting that the South Korean workers are the immediate  victims of the puppet clique's "strategy for economic recovery"  and war preparations, the speaker voiced full support and  solidarity for their struggle against "the civilian" regime's  anti-popular labour policy and for wage hike and the improvement  of living conditions. "If the South Korean workers and people  are to win political freedom and vital rights, they must oust  the traitor Kim Yong-sam from power and intensify the struggle  to check the new war provocation moves of the U.S. imperialists  and their lackeys and get the U.S. Forces and nuclear weapons  out of South Korea," he declared.    Workers from different industrial establishments in the city  also took floor at the meeting.    They called on the South Korean workers to expand the  struggle for their vital rights into an anti-kim Yong-sam  struggle and continue it until their demand was met.    Their speeches were frequently interrupted by slogans "Down  with Kim Yong-sam the traitor to the nation!" "Full support to  the South Korean workers' struggle for wage hike!" etc.</p>

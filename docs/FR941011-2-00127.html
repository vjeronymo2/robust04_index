			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The amendments bar MCC or MSTC participants from bringing legal proceedings, except for violations of federal securities laws, against any officer, director, employee, or agent of MCC, MSTC, or the Chicago Stock Exchange (``CHX'') if such officer, director, employee, or agent is acting on MCC, MSTC, or CHX business. These provisions do not prohibit MCC or MSTC participants from suing MCC or MSTC for actions taken by officers, directors, employees, or agents. The provisions only prohibit suits against such persons in their capacities as individuals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule changes add provisions that limit the liability of MCC and MSTC to participants for losses arising from the nonperformance or misperformance of MCC's or MSTC's duties except (1) for losses attributable to MCC's or MSTC's negligence with respect to the safeguarding of securities or funds in MCC's or MSTC's custody or control and (2) for losses attributable to the willful misconduct, gross negligence, bad faith, or fraudulent or criminal acts of MCC, MSTC, their officers, directors, employees, or agents with respect to all other activities. The limitation of MCC and MSTC liability does not apply to violations of federal securities laws. The amendments also provided that any MCC or MSTC participant that fails to prevail in a legal proceeding brought by such participant against MCC or MSTC or any of their officers, directors, employees, or agents shall be required to pay MCC or MSTC all reasonable expenses, including legal fees, incurred by MCC or MSTC in such proceedings but only if such expenses exceed $50,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that the proposals are consistent with the Act and particularly with Section 17A of the Act. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  Section 17A(b)(3)(H) requires that the rules of clearing agencies provide fair procedures with respect to disciplining participants and denying participation to any persons seeking participation in a clearing agency. <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  By establishing standing risk assessment committees, by requiring that such committees hear all appeals of MCC and MSTC decisions to deny application for membership or to cease to act for a participant, and by setting forth specific standards of review for appeals of the risk assessment committees' decisions, the proposals appear to provide fair procedures as required by Section 17A(b)(3)(H). Furthermore, the proposals also should enhance certainty and consistency in the operations of MCC and MSTC by providing that the decisions of the risk assessment committees cannot be reversed, modified, or remanded by the boards if the conclusions are within the parameters discussed earlier. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1 (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b)(3)(H) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, the proposed rule changes also contain several modifications to MCC's and MSTC's rules regarding MCC's and MSTC's standards of care and limitations of liability. By setting forth definite statements of MCC's and MSTC's standards of care and limitations of liability, the proposals should increase the general operating efficiency of MCC and MSTC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission believes that the provisions that require participants who are unsuccessful in suits against MCC or MSTC must pay MCC's or MSTC's legal expenses under certain circumstances are consistent with the requirements of Section 17A(b)(3)(D) of the Act which requires that the rules of a clearing agency provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and other charges among its participants. <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  Because the proposals allow MCC and MSTC to shift the financial burden of unsuccessful litigation to the responsible participant, the proposals appear to be consistent with this statutory objective. The Commission also believes that the rule changes should not provide an undue disincentive to litigation because MCC's and MSTC's expenses must be reasonable and must exceed $50,000 before a participant member will be obligated to compensate MCC or MSTC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;(b)(3)(D) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule changes prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of the filing of the amendments. Because the Commission has not received any comments with regard to its notice of the proposals as originally filed and does not foresee receiving any adverse comments regarding the subsequent amendments and because the subsequent amendments generally narrowed the scope of the original proposals and made clarifying and technical changes, the Commission finds it appropriate to approve the proposals prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of the filing of the amendments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Solicitation of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW,, Washington, DC 20549.

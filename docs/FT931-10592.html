			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Japan The Japanese government's tactic of pouring public pension and postal funds into an overvalued stock market may not be great value for the ultimate beneficiaries, but then the authorities have more immediate concerns. Most attention has focused on the risk that commercial banks may be unable to meet their BIS capital adequacy ratios if the stock market falls much further. Yet while the banks' capital is hardly generous and their bad debt problems are large, fears of a severe credit crunch look overdone. With companies cutting stocks and reducing capital investment, loan demand is falling. Large banks which wish to top up their tier 2 capital can do so through subordinated debt issues. The government is probably more worried about trust banks and second-tier life assurance companies. Some of these have virtually no unrealised capital gains left on their equity portfolios. A further drop in equities could leave them short of reserves. As returns on cash and bonds fall, they will struggle to maintain bonuses. Cuts in bonus rates would, however, see further cash outflows to more attractive savings products. The strains are already showing. Last week the life companies announced a cut in the discount rate they use to calculate long-term returns. Premiums will rise as a result. Daido Mutual Life Insurance is reducing its head office staff by 10 per cent. The Ministry of Finance may relax rules requiring life companies to write off foreign exchange losses on overseas bond holdings. With the rivets creaking, some smaller life companies really need that share support operation.</p>

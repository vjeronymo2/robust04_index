			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: Turkey acts to attract funds into equities TURKEY has introduced amendments to its capital market law in the hope of encouraging local institutional investors and boosting liquidity on the Istanbul stock exchange. The amendments form the spearhead of a large reform package and, with tax changes reducing incentives for holders of government paper, are aimed at attracting funds into Turkish equities. At present some 70 per cent of activity on the Istanbul stock market is concentrated in government debt. The legislation provides for greater investor protection, diluting the powers of the Capital Markets Board (CMB) in Ankara, hitherto the government's watchdog body, while tightening the rules on financial disclosure, audit requirements and insider trading. Moreover, for the first time the Turkish law provides specific penalties for insider trading, with, for example, a minimum fine of TL1bn (Dollars 150,000) for creating false markets in shares. The new law also enlarges the range of financial instruments available, to include futures, options and non-voting shares. Companies or banks wishing to issue financial instruments will now only have to register with the CMB. Banks have also lost their exclusive right to run open-ended funds, which can now be offered by brokerage houses, insurance companies and other specialised financial institutions. The difference between dividends on old and new shares has also been eliminated. Hitherto this discouraged companies from making rights issues. Taxes affecting the status of government debt are expected to be become effective in 1993.</p>

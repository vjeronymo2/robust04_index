			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Jungheinrich wins bidding for Lancer Boss The future of Lancer Boss was finally resolved when administrative receivers to the last big UK-owned producer of lift trucks yesterday announced they had sold the business to Germany's Jungheinrich. The deal secures the future of 700 jobs at Boss factories in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire. Terms were not disclosed, but it is understood Jungheinrich paid about Pounds 18m, excluding debtors, for the Lancer Boss Group and associated companies in the UK, Ireland and Austria. The deal follows intense negotiations involving Grant Thornton, the accountants who were appointed administrative receivers on April 8, and the three bidders. Jungheinrich, based in Hamburg, was persuaded to raise its bid 'very significantly', outbidding Terex of the US and a proposed management buy-in. Mr Allan Griffiths, a partner at Grant Thornton and one of the administrative receivers, said the price paid by Jungheinrich was 'at the very top end of our estimates'. He would not say how much Boss's banks, led by National Westminster, would receive, but said they were pleased with the deal. Jungheinrich was considered the leading contender for Lancer Boss after its purchase of Steinbock Boss, the UK's company's Germam arm. The takeover may not be to everyone's taste - including that of a man who wrote to the receivers complaining bitterly about the sale to a German company - but for its workers and managers it has a compelling industrial logic. However, precedent suggests the deal will mean a new beginning for the company. Five years ago, Lansing Bagnall, the great rival of Lancer Boss in the UK lift truck industry, was short of money and heading for trouble. It would probably never have made it through the recent recession had it not been purchased in 1989 by Linde of Germany, the world's biggest lift truck company. The Basingstoke-based company, now called Lansing Linde, has become an important part of Linde's global product and manufacturing strategy. If the optimism and bonhomie yesterday at Leighton Buzzard were anything to go by, Lancer Boss is destined for a similarly secure future under Jungheinrich's ownership. Mr Bob Bischof, chairman of Jungheinrich (GB), said the booms and busts of the UK lift truck market were far more pronounced than in Germany or elsewhere in Europe. He added that it was very difficult for a company such as Boss to manufacture under those conditions. The takeover by the financially strong Jungheinrich should make it much easier for Boss to weather recessions. It also brings Jungheinrich a highly regarded product range that will make the German company a much stronger third company in the increasingly global lift truck markets. Crucially, it brings Jungheinrich a manufacturing plant in a relatively low-cost country making engined products complementary to its own electric trucks. There are no plans to expand production in the UK. But Dr Hans-Peter Schmohl, a senior Jungheinrich manager, said: 'If we do expand we will do it here.'</p>

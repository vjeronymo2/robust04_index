			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Cash rates softer CASH RATES in the sterling money market softened across the board yesterday after the Bank of England was highly accommodating in its discount market operation and the Bundesbank President suggested that there might be no Lombard rate rise in the near future. Short-dated rates softened after the Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.16bn in the morning and saw most of it removed in the early round. One-month money briefly fell below the base rate figure of 10 per cent for the first time in many weeks. It closed at 10 1/32 per cent on the offered side, compared to a previous close of 10 3/16 per cent. Three-month money closed at 10 1/4 per cent, compared to a previous close of 10 3/8 per cent. Rates were softer further out, although dealers put this down to comments from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank President, who defused speculation that the central bank would embark on another monetary squeeze by raising the Lombard rate. 'I can only say that from the way things look now, we see no reason to raise this rate,' he said. Boosted by these words, 6-month money closed down  1/16 per cent on the offered side at 10 3/8 per cent, but 1-year money closed unchanged at 10 7/16 per cent. Sterling futures contracts dipped at around lunchtime following the poorer-than-expected US non-farm payroll figure for July. This forced the dollar down by about a pfennig on the foreign exchanges undermining sterling in its wake. The September contract bottomed out at 89.62, 2 basis points down from its opening level, but closed back at 89.64. The softening of rates may prove short-lived, however, as a large number of UK indicators will be issued next week underlining the gloomy outlook for the UK economy. In its money market operations, the Bank of England dealt at the established rates of 9 7/8 per cent for Bands 1 and 2 and 9 15/16 per cent for the repurchase agreement (repo). In the morning, the Bank purchased Pounds 600m in band 1 bank bills, Pounds 116m in Band 2 bank bills and Pounds 444m in the repo for resale on 26 and 27 August. The forecast was then revised to Pounds 1.6bn and the Bank purchased Pounds 108m in Band 1. There was late assistance of Pounds 275m.</p>

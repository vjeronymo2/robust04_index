			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / BCCI creditors win more time on claim agreements CREDITORS of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International have been given another four weeks in which to make up their minds about draft agreements to settle their claims. The High Court yesterday overrode objections from the BCCI liquidators, who had sought immediate court approval of the agreements, and adjourned the matter until May 11. Touche Ross, the BCCI liquidators, told the court that the agreements, involving the injection of nearly Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 972m) by the government of Abu Dhabi, were the best options available for the tens of thousands of BCCI creditors worldwide. The liquidators had negotiated the package with Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, the ruler of Abu Dhabi. Sheikh Zayed with the Abu Dhabi government and other institutions has a majority shareholding in the bank. The liquidators said it would increase the estimated return to creditors from the range of up to 10 per cent to between 30 per cent and 40 per cent, with a first payment of 10 per cent early next year. Sir Donald Nicholls, the senior Chancery Division judge, said the creditors' committee had had insufficient time and insufficient material to reach conclusions on many points. The committee was not in a position to assess the likely prospects in any litigation of claims which under the proposed agreement would be surrendered. The committee was concerned that creditors were being asked to abandon claims without adequate information about the prospects of those claims, the judge said. Before the principal provisions in the draft agreements would take effect, creditors with admitted claims totalling Dollars 7bn had to accept the offer and release claims against the Abu Dhabi government and others by September 30. Also the liquidators stipulated that court approval should have been obtained, and the time for appeals have expired, by June 30. Sir Donald said he was 'impressed by the need for the creditors throughout the world to have the benefit of informed recommendations from the creditors' committee as far as that can reasonably be achieved.' He added that the committee's recommendations were particularly important because many creditors were undoubtedly unhappy with the proposed terms. The judge had been told that hearings seeking court approval were due in Luxembourg on April 28 and the Cayman Islands on April 30. He said he did not think an adjournment to May 11 would cause insuperable difficulties for the other courts.</p>

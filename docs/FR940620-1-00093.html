When only portions of a page of printed material are subject to the asserted restrictions, such portions shall be identified by circling, underscoring, with a note, or other appropriate identifier. Instructions that interfere with or delay the operation of computer software in order to display a restrictive legend or other license statement at any time prior to or during use of the computer software shall not be inserted in the software, or otherwise cause such interference or delay, unless the contracting officer's written permission to deliver such software has been obtained prior to delivery. Reproduction of technical data, computer software, or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions shall also reproduce the asserted restrictions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

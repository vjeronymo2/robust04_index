			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN SIGN OF BUDGET CRUNCH, SOVIETS WILL SHUT SPACE LAB  </P> <P> The Soviet Union's three-year-old orbiting space station Mir will be evacuated  at the end of this month and mothballed, Soviet authorities disclosed Tuesday  amid indications that the Kremlin is sharply scaling back its ambitious space  program.  </P> <P> Mission control has ordered the three cosmonauts aboard Mir to begin shutting  down and putting into protective wrappings the station's scientific, flight and  control systems, according to the official Tass news agency. In addition, the  scheduled April 19 launch of a three-man replacement crew has been canceled.  Space officials were saying as recently as a month ago that the mission would  proceed as planned.  </P> <P> "New tasks will be found for the Mir," Radio Moscow said late Tuesday, implying  in its announcement that the space station will remain unmanned for some time,  although it was designed and placed in orbit as the centerpiece of the Soviet  manned space program.  </P> <P> Plans to enlarge Mir with two new modules -- one small factory for growing  crystals in conditions of zero gravity and the other adding more scientific  equipment to the space laboratory -- have also been postponed.  </P> <P> These actions, so far not officially explained, may reflect the Kremlin's  determination to reduce its huge budget deficit, estimated at $160 billion this  year, as well as a rising popular demand that the space program be cut so that  more money and resources can be allocated to meeting consumer needs.  </P> <P> "We are tackling more problems in the Soviet Union, but it is equally true that  we are not used to counting our expenses," a science commentator in the  government newspaper Izvestia wrote recently. "There is actually no system yet  that would enable a quick transfer of space achievements to our economy on a  commercial basis."  </P> <P> According to U.S. space experts, the Soviet Union spends more than $30 billion  a year on its combined military-civilian space program.  </P> <P> During parliamentary elections last month, the once-prestigious Soviet space  program ranked close to the government's bloated bureaucracy and its massive  military spending as the most frequent targets for criticism.  </P> <P> "I am not saying we should abandon space research -- just stretch it out," said  Boris N. Yeltsin, the radical populist who won 89% of the vote in Moscow for a  seat in the new Congress of People's Deputies. Explaining what he felt could be  cut to improve the availability of consumer goods, he added, "Mars, Venus, the  stars will be there 10 years from (now), just as they are today."  </P> <P> Another critical element, however, may be the failure of two Soviet probes  launched toward Mars last July with the goal of landing on the Martian moon  Phobos. The first was lost in October due to a ground controller's error, and  radio contact was lost with the second in late March.  </P> <P> Those setbacks have brought into the open a serious debate among Soviet  scientists over the course the space program should take, and the Soviet press  has suddenly been filled with critiques of the program from half a dozen points  of view.  </P> <P> "Some time is needed to assess the results of the Mir program, to measure them  against our goals and decide how to proceed, and we do not need to keep men in  space for that," one well-informed Soviet official commented. "But there  already is agreement that we do not need to keep Mir manned all the time."  </P> <P> The manned space program has been strongly criticized within the Soviet Academy  of Sciences as expensive and less and less useful scientifically.  </P> <P> But manned missions have also had strong supporters, not only in the scientific  community but also in the Soviet military.  </P></p>

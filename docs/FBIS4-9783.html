			<p>BFN     [Text] Zambian Foreign Minister Remmy Kaindu Gilly Mushota  is en route to Jamaica following a busy one-week visit that  served to strengthen cooperation between Zambia and Cuba. During  a news conference a few hours before his departure, Mushota  described his visit as very positive and stressed that his  meetings resulted in a mutual understanding on essential  principles concerning health, education, the development of the  sugar industry, sports, and international relations. The accords  reached in these areas will be completed when Zambia's president  visits Cuba.    [Begin recording of Mushota, in English with  passage-by-passage translation into Spanish] What I can tell you  as result of our visit is that Zambia and Cuba have agreed, in  principle, that by the time Zambia's president visits Cuba, we  should be in a position to sign an agreement for developing the  sugar industry and its by-products in Zambia, with Cuba  providing technical assistance and Zambia financing all the  operations. The details of this agreement will be made public  when Zambia's president visits Cuba. That is my delegation's  success story. [end recording]    Mushota added that regarding sports, Zambia will send soccer  trainers to Cuba and, in turn, will host Cuban trainers in  athletics, baseball, and boxing. Zambia will also receive Cuban  assistance in getting ready for the African games and future  Olympic games.</p>

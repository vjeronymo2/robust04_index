			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> IT'S OFFICIAL: SCOTT IS LEAVING MORNINGSIDE;  </P> <P> PREPS: LADY MONARCH BASKETBALL COACH STARTS NEW JOB AS PART-TIME ASSISTANT  COACH WITH THE USC WOMEN'S TEAM.  </P> <P> Frank Scott has resigned as Morningside High girls' basketball coach and taken  a job as a part-time assistant coach with the USC women's team, a USC official  said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Scott, who could not be reached for comment, said last month he was "99.9%  sure" he would make the move at the conclusion of Morningside's summer league  season. The Lady Monarchs finished play last week.  </P> <P> Tim Tessalone, USC sports information director, said Wednesday was Scott's  first official day at his new coaching job. He will remain a full-time teacher  at Morningside.  </P> <P> Scott said last month that the assistant's position pays around $20,000 a year.  He will work with Marianne Stanley, who is beginning her second season as USC's  head coach. Stanley is on vacation and was unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> By taking the job, Scott will continue his coach-player relationship with Lisa  Leslie, the 6-foot-5 Morningside All-American who led the Lady Monarchs to the  last two state Division I titles.  </P> <P> Scott has denied reports it was a package deal.  </P> <P> "A lot of people have said I'm getting the job because of Lisa Leslie," he said  last month. "But (the job) was offered to me long before Lisa signed a letter  of intent."  </P> <P> Leslie, selected the nation's top schoolgirl player by USA Today, picked USC  over Cal State Long Beach.  </P> <P> What Scott leaves behind after 10 years as Morningside's coach is the most  successful girls' basketball program in the history of the South Bay.  </P> <P> Aside from capturing two state titles, his teams have won eight consecutive  league titles, including 88 victories in a row, and four CIF-Southern Section  major division titles, including the last three.  </P> <P> "I think I've done just about all I can do on the high school level," Scott  said last month. "The USC job is going to be a challenge. I've always wanted to  try this before. If I don't jump at this opportunity right now, I don't think I  ever will."  </P> <P> Scott said his successor will inherit a team capable of winning a third  consecutive state title. The Lady Monarchs return four starters, led by 6-4  junior Janet Davis.  </P> <P> "The cupboard will not be left bare," he said.  </P> <P> Morningside Athletic Director Carl Franklin said the school will probably  conduct interviews for a new coach later this month.  </P> <P> One person who plans to apply for the job is Ron Randle, who coaches the  Morningside boys' basketball team with Franklin.  </P> <P> "I'll do everything possible to get it," he said. "I'm tired of being second  banana."  </P></p>

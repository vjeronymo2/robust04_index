			<p>940106 FT  06 JAN 94 / Banks pressed to provide Pounds 1.4bn to shore up Banesto The Bank of Spain has pressed the country's big banks and savings banks into opening a Pta300bn (Pounds 1.4bn) line of emergency short-term credit on the interbank market to help shore up liquidity at Banesto, the struggling commercial bank whose management was replaced by the authorities last week. Spanish retail depositors have withdrawn up to Pta250bn from Banesto since its chairman, Mr Mario Conde, and the rest of his board were dismissed by the Bank of Spain on December 28. The move came after the central bank's inspectors found a Pta503bn over-valuation of assets at Spain's fourth biggest bank. Mr Luis Angel Rojo, the governor of the bank, met senior executives of the banks and savings banks in Madrid on Tuesday morning, winning agreement from them that the banks would supply 70 per cent of the credits Banesto needs, with the rest being supplied by the savings banks. A representative of one savings bank described the meeting as 'tense', reflecting unease, particularly among the savings banks, at being forced to come to the assistance of Banesto. The commercial banks may also be asked later this year to help recapitalise Banesto with a temporary equity injection. In order to ease worries among the institutions being asked to supply short-term credit to Banesto now, the Bank of Spain has undertaken to guarantee loans made through the credit line to Banesto, which by September last year was Pta504bn in debt in the interbank market. Details also emerged yesterday of an earlier attempt by JP Morgan, the US bank which advised Banesto, to persuade the Bank of Spain that Banesto could survive under its former management. Morgan's effort was led by Mr Roberto Mendoza, a Morgan vice-chairman, who also sat on Banesto's board. Morgan estimated the over-valuation of Banesto's assets at Pta372bn, compared with the central bank's figure of Pta503bn. Morgan drew up a plan late in the year to write down Pta265bn of Banesto's Pta7,000bn assets immediately, using Pta180bn of the bank's capital reserves and releasing a tax credit of Pta85bn. According to the intervention document drawn up by the central bank, Morgan also intended to help Banesto raise up to Pta230bn of fresh capital over the following 18 months. Measures would include issuing Pta60bn in convertible bonds, selling half of Banesto's controlling stake in Banco Totta y Acores of Portugal and possibly raising additional equity of up to Pta60bn. But the document said the management had 'shown themselves to be incapable of correcting the slow but inexorable decline in the bank's condition'. The document argued that Morgan's plan was based on several overoptimistic assumptions about Banesto. At Banesto's large insurance affiliate, La Union y El Fenix, a new management installed by the Spanish insurance watchdog last week announced it would make a group loss of some Pta12bn in 1993. New managers said a planned takeover of Union y Fenix by AGF of France would proceed.</p>

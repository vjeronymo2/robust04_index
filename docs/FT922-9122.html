			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Letter: A second opinion? Sir, For your TV correspondent to denounce the BBC ('Arts: Today's Television', May 6) for embracing environmentalism without examining the evidence is a bit rich for someone who argues that heterosexuals cannot catch Aids, that there is no evidence of damage to the ozone layer, etc. Should not the distinguished science correspondent comment on Mr Dunkley's scientific asides - at least when they are potentially lethal? Graham Hallett, 10 Coed-yr-Ynn, Rhiwbina, Cardiff CF4 6PH</p>

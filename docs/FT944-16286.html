			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Uruguay Round to face delay in Japan Last minute wrangling by Japan's ruling party politicians with backing from the powerful rice lobby is threatening to disrupt ratification of a legislative package to implement the Uruguay Round trade treaty. Japan has agreed partially to open its rice market from next year, and next week the cabinet is scheduled to approve Uruguay Round legislation, including a law on rice production and distribution, before submitting it to parliament. However, politicians from farming communities are upset about the absence of farm subsidy guarantees within a supplementary farm measures package aimed at supporting farmers affected by implementation of both the international trade agreements and the Uruguay Round accords. Some are threatening to boycott approval of the legislation unless a substantial amount of aid for farmers is included in the support package. Some politicians have been reported as demanding support amounting to up to Y6,000bn (Dollars 60bn) over the next six years. The Ministry of Finance is opposed to any such farm subsidy guarantees and negotiations with the Agriculture ministry, which is being prodded by the farm lobby, are deadlocked. The government is expected to announce the measures next week, and agricultural committees of coalition parties are pushing Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the prime minister, for a political settlement. The rice lobby wants Japan to delay Uruguay Round ratification until its trading partners pass their implementing legislation. Mr Murayama yesterday endorsed this view in a parliamentary comment that ratification procedures in the US and EU nations needed to be observed carefully. This means Japan's ratification of the Uruguay Round legislation package is now unlikely until the US congress convenes at the end of November to vote on the trade measures.</p>

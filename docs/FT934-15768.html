			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Frankfurt reaches a high - At a glance FRANKFURT'S DAX index hit an all-time high this week, gaining 4.9 per cent on the week and closing on Friday at 2,005.1. The main impetus behind the surge was thought to be German investment funds moving out of bonds and money market funds and into equities, as capital market rates fall. Equities currently form a historically low proportion of privately-held German funds' portfolios, so there is scope for a continued boost to the market. Foreign investors, particularly from the US, have also been showing interest in German shares due to hopes of growth in corporate earnings after restructuring.</p>

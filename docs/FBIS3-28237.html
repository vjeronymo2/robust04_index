			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- The government and the ruling  coalition parties are unlikely to drop the newly announced 7  percent national welfare tax plan, Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii said Friday [4 February].    Referring to ongoing discussions among coalition party  leaders, Fujii told reporters after a morning cabinet meeting,  "it's impossible to settle" (the issue) by dropping the plan  into "a blank sheet."    Brushing aside criticism that the ministry forced Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to decide on the tax plan, Fujii said  he is "silently watching" the coalition meeting with his  ministry taking an open-minded or "blank sheet" stance.    Fujii also sought to justify Hosokawa's decision by  stressing  that the prime minister followed "required procedures" by  consulting with his advisory panel, an economic policy forum of  the government and coalition parties and a meeting of party  leaders.    But Fujii reiterated his opposition to changing the new  national welfare tax into an "objective" tax -- one in which  the revenues are earmarked for special accounts rather than the  general account.    The new tax would "virtually be an objective tax" because it  would be implemented in a law stipulating that revenues be for  welfare purposes.    The Social Democratic Party -- the largest party in the  ruling coalition -- is threatening to quit the cabinet unless  the government accepts its compromise plan that primarily calls  for changing the welfare tax to an objective tax.    The tax plan decided by Hosokawa calls for adoption of the 7  percent welfare tax in place of the current 3 percent  consumption tax in April 1997 to finance tax cuts worth 6  trillion yen.    Fujii reiterated that his ministry's calculation that a 7  percent tax is needed to finance the tax cuts is "correct."    Meanwhile, he said he welcomed a debate about the new tax in  view of the aging of society, and noted that Hosokawa's  intentions are in line with the Tax Commission's November report  calling for a cut in the income tax burden and an improvement in  consumption taxes to cope with the graying population.    He said discussions should not be focused too much on  economic measures.    But in including the tax cuts in the stimulus package to be  announced shortly, Fujii said the government is taking the  measures with "confidence" to put the economy on a full-fledged  recovery path in fiscal 1994, and stable growth in fiscal 1995.</p>

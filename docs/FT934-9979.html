			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / US backs Yeltsin's decision to serve out full term RUSSIAN political groups yesterday denounced President Boris Yeltsin for going back on his commitment to stand for re-election next June, but the US pledged support for the Russian leader 'as long as he is promoting democracy'. Mr Yeltsin confirmed at the weekend that he intended to serve out his full term until June 1996, but added, according to the Interfax news agency, that he would not stand again. 'Everyone knows how many fateful blows I have suffered. It's too much for one man,' he said. Opponents and some supporters of Mr Yeltsin criticised the president's decision, which he announced to media editors on Saturday. His supporters conceded that Mr Yeltsin was now set to serve as a 'very strong' executive president under a newly agreed constitution. However, in a US television interview, President Bill Clinton said: 'As long as he continues to promote human rights, democratic and economic reforms, the US should still support him.' Mr Clinton expressed uncertainty as to what Mr Yeltsin had said and meant on Saturday, but declined to criticise his decision. Mr Yeltsin understood, he added, 'that he is not the only source of democratic power in Russia' - and next month's parliamentary elections should demonstrate this. Mr Yeltsin also won strong backing from his prime minister, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, who described the decision as 'absolutely correct'. 'This is the position of a highly decent and responsible man, conscious of his civic duty,' said Mr Chernomyrdin. Mr Yeltsin's move, which appeared to take his closest aides by surprise, was part of a series of important alterations to the constitution agreed privately between Mr Yeltsin and regional leaders last week. It means the reversal of a concession he made to his opponents in September when he dissolved parliament and called for fresh parliamentary elections in December. Criticism came from those in parties opposed to Mr Yeltsin, including Mr Viktor Aksyuchits of the Christian Democratic Movement and Mr Mikhail Lapshin of the Agrarian party, who described it as 'a real deception of the people'. Some of the president's supporters were also critical. Mr Konstantin Borovoi, leader of the Party of Economic Freedom, said the president 'cannot cancel his decision . . . because it is a commitment to the citizens of Russia and to the world community'.

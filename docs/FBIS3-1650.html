Braving the severe cold, they  travelled deeply to the disaster areas to cordially salute the  people in the disaster areas on behalf of the regional party  committee and government and to help them solve some practical  problems so that people in the disaster area will have a happy  Spring Festival.    Wang Qun listened to briefings given by the Xingan League  party committee on the morning of 24 January. He was very  pleased with this league's achievements in overcoming natural  disasters and various difficulties. Wang Qun said: A batch of  good examples have emerged in Xingan League. This is your  wealth, the road of reform is under your feet, and the methods  of reform are in your experience. Those who are capable of  grasping their own advantages and selecting the accurate  economic development path will be able to display their skills  in the market economy.    Wang Qun pointed out: Many reform measures will be issued  this year. This is a year of reform and development which is  very important to Inner Mongolia. Leaders at all levels should  make a good choice of the breakthrough points, expand the reform  strength, use the experience of selected units to promote work  in the entire area, speed up the work, and achieve actual  results.    Wang Qun stressed: To successfully carry out this year's  work, we should further emancipate the mind, broaden the field  of vision, proceed from local reality, define the report  priorities, pay attention to grasping the priorities and solving  in-depth problems, formulate supporting measures, and  conscientiously organize efforts to implement them. To this  end, we should strive to study and really know well all reform  guiding ideologies, basic ideas, programs, and operational  measures issued by the party Central Committee and the State  Council, conduct in-depth and meticulous ideological  mobilization, organize the work carefully, and implement the  guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party  congress and the eighth enlarged plenary session of the fifth  regional party committee in places where needed.    Wang Qun pointed out: Guiding peasants and herdsmen to the  market is an important task which this era has assigned to  cadres at all levels. We should create conditions for peasants  and herdsmen to march towards the market and use information to  guide them enter the market. To become prosperous by developing  "high-yield, fine-quality, and highly efficient" farming and by  commercializing production, we must combine foreign trade with  industry and agriculture, and the planting industry with the  breeding and processing industries, implement the agricultural  and animal husbandry production structure characterized by  serialized and enterprise-oriented large-scale production of  agriculture, industry, commerce, technology, and foreign trade  that can find a place in the market, invigorate the economy by  developing local resources, and turn the advantage of natural  resources into economic advantages.    Wang Qun stressed: In the course of rapidly carrying out all  reforms, we must be bold, keen in blazing new trials, have new  ideas, measures, and methods, strengthen the study of policies,  pay attention to solving the new situation and new problems  emerged in the course of reform and development, particularly  problems closely related to the lives of the masses, and  maintain social stability.</p>

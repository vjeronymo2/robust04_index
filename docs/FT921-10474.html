			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Arts: Ballet du Nord - Sadler's Wells The Ballet du Nord is a medium-size company based in Roubaix. From its inception in 1983 it reflected the artistic lineage of its founder-director Alfonso Cata, who danced with New York City Ballet, but had also experienced the madcap ways of the Grand Ballet du Marquis de Cuevas, of blessed and slightly improbable memory. Cata educated his dancers with Balanchine - and also more exotic fare - and led his troupe round the world to considerable acclaim, paying visits to regional theatres in this country. On his death a year ago, the Ballet du Nord gained Jean-Paul Comelin as director, and he has now brought the company for its first London visit. I wish I could report that the programme chosen for this week at Sadler's Wells showed the troupe at its best. Balanchine's Apollo must always hold the stage in splendour, even when given - as here - a somewhat fidgety interpretation, but neither Jose Limon's There is a time nor M. Comelin's realisation of the Mozart Requiem, which completed the bill, bear any serious contemplation. There is a time looks like the death-throes of traditional American dance. Made in 1956 by one of the greatest modern dancers, it proposes a sequence of emotional studies in which joy, grief, reaping and sowing, and the tedious paraphernalia of life, love and death, are exposed in exquisitely naif little scenas. There is an ingratiating score by Norman dello Joio that challenges you not to love its home-spun predictabilities. The dancers wear costumes that make them look as if they are in search of an audition for Shakespearean peasantry. They scamper, form rings, laugh (and are terrible, as The Immortal Hour so acutely observed). Given with the physical weight and purpose that marked Limon's own performance - his style owed much to the intensities of Doris Humphrey, pioneer of American dance - There is a time might still make sense, but it demands a way of moving unknown to ballet-trained artists today. Ecclesiastes may not have mentioned it, but there is a time to leave old dance pieces alone. And it is now. About M. Comelin's Requiem I speak with the reluctance of anyone asked to comment upon some merry soul attempting to climb the Matterhorn on a pogo-stick. That M. Comelin sees Mozart as a suitable basis for gymnastic exercises - and not particularly adventurous ones - is a first problem. That he peoples the stage with women in dull nightdresses and men in underpants (sagging haunches abound) is a further matter for concern. That the movement vocabulary relies upon repetition of dull little sequences which contrive to make the dancers look foolish, was, I found, a final noxious touch. The Wren orchestra, a chorus and soloists were also involved in this outbreak of kitsch religiosity. Send not to know for whom the bell tolls - it tolls for them all.</p>

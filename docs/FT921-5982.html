			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Arts: Dancing up the wall - V-Tol's contribution to Spring Loaded THE DANCE images proposed by Mark Murphy in his choreography are linked with the idea of Vertical Take-Off in aeronautical flight, whence comes his company's title, V-Tol. Movement is reckless, daring, as bodies zoom and plummet, crash into each other or to the floor, or hang suspended from the wall that is part of the set for this new 70-minute piece at The Place. Under the engaging title of Time spent in the company of bad people - a promise alas unrealised, for the characters are not in the least bit wicked, merely dull - Murphy and his colleagues (Keely Mancini, Kristina Page, James Hewison) explore domestic angst at some considerable length and with no less considerable energy. The staging, which I saw on Thursday night, is part of The Place's Spring Loaded season. Murphy's movement style is immediately gripping, and theatrically sure. Two block-like chairs and a sofa, with a sheltering wall, are first revealed to us in a series of snapshots in which the cast (who are collaborators in the dance) take up positions vertical or horizontal, cling to the wall or balance above and under the furniture, which is itself hoisted on to the wall to suggest altered vistas of reality. The effect is of shifting perspectives, or aerial shots of an interior. Murphy extracts maximum value from this before the dance proper begins and bodies are hurled at other bodies, or curl and thresh and twist in vivid brush-strokes of dynamics. The short-term rewards are many, but the manner seem ultimately self-defeating. Unlike DV8, whose influence, if slight, is perceptible, V-Tol does not provide a coherent emotional argument for the piece. We see the two couples exercising their frustrations as if working out at a gym, and we see them copulating - twice, which seems to exaggerate the value of coition as a relief from boredom. But we do not see V-Tol's dance extending into a more expressive language. It may be that Murphy's point is that marital despairs are exactly so because of their lack of any variety or horizon, and the deadpan bravura of his cast stresses this. But the piece, which begins well, and has so sharp a physical edge, loses impact because of its deliberately constrained vocabulary. Performances are nonetheless to be valued - for their exactness of aim and timing, and for their unsparing power in showing emotional frustration as a kind of slamming, that punk-dance fashion in which brute force so acutely expressed the brutalities of life. Design, by Miranda Melville, is sure (the women wear dresses that could drive a girl to suicide), and the piece is excellently lit by Simon Robertson. There is a score by Peri Mackintosh which does what it does efficiently.</p>

			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Manufactured optimism After such a good run of economic statistics, the slight fall in UK manufacturing output in June comes as a bit of a surprise. There is not much ground for worry, though. In the second quarter manufacturing output still grew 1.3 per cent, faster than the economy as a whole. Given evidence of recovery on the continent, there should be increasing impetus from exports which in turn will limit the damage to the balance of payments from the UK's domestic recovery. Despite its hint of higher interest rates, the Bank of England is reasonably sanguine on inflation. The equity market has reason to look perky - which, after its 85 point rise this week, seems precisely to reflect its mood. With economic recovery now well-established, the equity market has less to worry about from higher base rates in the autumn. Trading statements from the likes of TI Group and Forte are becoming more optimistic. So earnings growth should provide some decent momentum. But there are limits, not least concerning the degree to which equities can decouple from gilts. Yields on 10-year gilts rose slightly over the past week. That is understandable since, however good the apparent news on inflation, it is hard to see why yields should fall when the economy is so strong. An equity/gilt yield ratio of 2.3 times looks reasonably comfortable, but equities now yield less than index-linked gilts. Growing expectations of real dividend growth are some compensation, but that relationship is nevertheless a constraint.</p>

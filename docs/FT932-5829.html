			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Brown calls for overdraft charge inquiry AN INQUIRY into the system of charges operated by the high street clearing banks was demanded yesterday by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, who said charges for unauthorised overdrafts were 'little short of usurious'. He warned Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, that millions of consumers would be shocked by the levels of charges, and would expect protection from him. The condemnation came on the day that National Westminster Bank became the first of Britain's big four banks to introduce a charge of Pounds 3.50 a day on current account holders who overdraw 'substantially' without authority. According to calculations carried out for Mr Brown by the House of Commons library, NatWest is making charges equivalent to an annualised percentage rate of interest (APR) of 369 per cent for an unauthorised overdraft of Pounds 1,000. The calculations include both interest charged on overdrafts and administrative charges. Mr Brown said the NatWest charge for an unauthorised Pounds 100 overdraft was equivalent to an APR of more than 1m per cent. The figures suggest that at Barclays an unauthorised overdraft of Pounds 100 would attract charges equivalent to an APR of 961 per cent, at Lloyds 238 per cent, and at Midland 733 per cent. Mr Brown dismissed criticism of his calculations, saying charges, commission and interest rates all contributed to the cost of borrowing. Total charges for the top eight banks, he added, were more than Pounds 6.2bn, compared with just more than Pounds 4bn before the recession started two-and-a-half years ago. Among the remedies which Mr Brown urged were a right to be told the details of charges in advance, recourse to a statutory ombudsman and the right to information about bank charges in the form of a league table. NatWest said yesterday it did not understand how a figure of 1m per cent APR could be reached under its charging structure. It said rates for unauthorised overdrafts were clearly set out in advance for its customers.</p>

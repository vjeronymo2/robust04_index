			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Travel: Queen Victoria drank here - Adrian Gardiner tours Scotland's distilleries and samples the 'water of life' Want to know the secret of eternal life? It is whisky, according to James Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd: 'If a body could find oot the exac' proper proportion and quantity that ought to be drunk every day, and keep to that, I verily trow that he might leeve forever, withoot dying at a', and that doctors and kirkyairds would go oot o' fashion.' After my first distillery visit on the newly-opened 'Whisky Trail' I was little wiser about the process. The guide's Aberdonian dialect was incomprehensible even to a lowland Scot. That was 10 years ago. Today things are different. Distilleries on the Whisky Trail have multilingual guides and audio-visual presentations in seven languages, including Japanese. All you have to get your tongue round is a dram of Highland hospitality: uisge beatha, Gaelic for the 'water of life'. There are about 200 distilleries in Scotland - six on the island of Islay alone - and the greatest concentration is on Speyside, the Grampian region between Aberdeen and Inverness. The Whisky Trail is a route of about 70 miles, linking eight prominent ones. Tomintoul, the highest village in the Highlands, is at the southern end of the circuit. Here the peaty burns which spring from the Cromdale and Ladder hills supply one of the three ingredients of malt whisky. The others are yeast and malted barley. That so many distilleries now have visitor centres is the result of the only real change in the production process in 150 years: few distilleries still malt their own barley on site. It makes better economics to buy it in from specialists, so the empty maltings are put to use as whisky museums, shops and visitor centres. A distillery visit will acquaint you with the folklore and peculiar terminology of whisky. The malted barley is steeped in hot water in a mash tun and the liquid, known as 'wort', is piped into washbacks where it is fermented into 'wash'. This is distilled twice; of the second distillate, only the middle portion is kept: the 'feints' and 'foreshots' are discarded. Whisky off the still is colourless. Caramel is sometimes added to blended whisky, but the honey colour of single malts comes from long maturation in oak casks. Sherry casks are preferred. During this time - eight, 10, 12, 15 or more years - at least a quarter of the spirit is lost by evaporation: the 'angel's share'. There are things, however, the Scots rarely mention: that tartan and bagpipes originated outside Scotland, and that the father of the Scotch whisky industry was an Irishman. In 1831 Aeneas Coffey invented a still which made continuous distilling possible, enabling whisky to be produced in bulk. Whisky is a big employer and a big export earner. At one end is an elaborate worldwide marketing machine. At the other: skilled trades which, but for whisky, would have died out. Specialist companies in Glasgow and the Lowlands make and repair casks (coopering) while coppersmiths maintain the stills. 'Rome was built on seven hills, Dufftown on its seven stills.' From Dufftown, home to Glenfiddich, we travel clockwise to Tamnavulin (the 'mill on the hill') and to The Glenlivet, which in 1824 became the first licensed distillery in the Highlands. Following the River Avon north we meet the River Spey and the distilleries of Glenfarclas, Tamdhu and Cardhu. North again is the town of Rothes, home to Glen Grant, and a few miles east is Strathisla in Keith. Strathisla is the heart of the famous Chivas Regal. Also worth visiting is Dallas Dhu near Forres. This distillery was a casualty of the 1970s recession and was taken over by Historic Scotland as a museum. Elsewhere in Scotland, both Dalwhinnie and Blair Atholl are easily accessible from the A9 Perth-Inverness road, and from Pitlochry it is two miles to Moulin, where a little whitewashed huddle of cottages called Edradour forms the smallest distillery in the country, producing a mere 600 gallons a week. While travelling this north-east corner of Caledonia you might take in the castle country of Aberdeenshire, and drive the 'Royal Route' from Braemar to Aberdeen. It follows the Dee, second only to the Spey as a notable salmon river. Braemar is not a town to linger in, unless you are a fan of tartan tat. Its only merit is the cottage where Robert Louis Stevenson stayed in 1881 and wrote most of Treasure Island. There is a gravestone in the churchyard inscribed 'John Silver'. Aboyne and Ballater are more dignified: solid conservative towns. Short detours off the main A93 bring you to some remarkable turreted castles. Craigievar is perhaps the best known. Now in the care of the National Trust for Scotland, this fortified tower house, complete with plasterwork ceilings and secret passage, is said to have inspired Walt Disney's drawings for the castle in Sleeping Beauty. Crathes, just outside Banchory, is another fine castle set in famous formal gardens. But the main-crop tourists make for Balmoral, an architectural fake built by Prince Albert around 1850. Queen Victoria had a lifelong love affair with Deeside. Signposts featuring that well-known silhouette now link her favourite places on the Victorian Trail. Victoria was known to be fond of a dram or two. You can follow her footsteps today to the Royal Lochnagar Distillery. Victoria lived a full life and died aged 82. Perhaps the Ettrick Shepherd was right. Maps of the Whisky, Castle and Victorian Trails are available from the Tourist Information Centre, 45 Station Road, Banchory AB3 3XX, tel. 033-022-066. August is the distillers' holiday month. Visitor centres are open but you might not see the whole operation in action. Adrian Gardiner is the author of Classic Touring Routes in Scotland (1991) published by Thomas-Lochar. It includes a chapter on the Whisky Trail.</p>

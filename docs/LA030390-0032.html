			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAGAN'S TAPED TESTIMONY  </P> <P> Incredible, isn't it? For eight years we had a President who knew nothing, did  not want to know anything, had his wishes carried out by underlings with the  unspoken directive to be told nothing -- to keep him the hell out of whatever  was going on -- and we loved him for it, and seemingly still do.  </P> <P> We prate and boast to the rest of the world of our beautiful democracy and  suggest that it be emulated by one and all.  </P> <P> Just who are we kidding? We are a bunch of idiots, nothing less, for knowing  and putting up with this charade and reelecting him by an overwhelming  majority, really knowing deep inside that he did not, could not cope with the  immensity of his position and we laughed at it all.  </P> <P> Are we still laughing? One wonders. Is there any limit to the gullibility and  stupidity which we are still able to generate.  </P> <P> Heaven help us all.  </P> <P> JACK CHESNER  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW OFF 32.89 DESPITE BULLISH TRADE REPORT  </P> <P> The stock market posted a broad loss today, registering little enthusiasm over  the latest news on the nation's international trade balance.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 32.89 at 2,732.88 on moderately  heavy volume of 150 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> In the broader market, declining stocks led advances by a 2-1 margin.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department reported that the U.S. trade deficit in February shrank  to its narrowest reading in more than six years. Imports exceeded exports by  $6.49 billion, down from $9.32 billion in January.  </P> <P> Analysts said that held out the prospect of stronger-than-expected growth in  economic output, and improved profits at many companies with a substantial  international business.  </P> <P> At the same time, however, the figures touched off fresh worries about the  outlook for interest rates.  </P> <P> In the credit markets prices of long-term government bonds fell more than $10  for each $1,000 in face value, increasing their yields to the 8.84 percent-8.90  percent range.  </P> <P> Traders said the market was driven down by reports from Tokyo that Japanese  institutional investors were selling as much as $6 billion in U.S. government  securities. The Japanese are big holders of U.S. bonds.  </P> <P> Market watchers said the February trade data put out today further fueled  concerns that the economy is strengthening and that interest rates are heading  higher.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said the trade gap eased from a revised $9.32 billion  in January to $6.49 billion in February -- the lowest monthly trade imbalance  since December, 1983.  </P> <P> "The bottom line is that this (trade data) will add to the growth of first  quarter gross national product, which is a negative for the bond market," said  Kevin Flanagan, a money market economist with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.  </P> <P> The combination of high inflation and an improved economy could prompt the  Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, which would depress bond prices, he  said.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments  fell about 1/16 point, intermediate maturities lost between 5/32 point and 1/4  point and long-term issues were off around 1/2 point, according to Telerate  Inc., the financial information service.  </P> <P> The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures price  movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or  longer, fell 2.44 to 1,141.65.  </P> <P> Yields on three-month Treasury bills stood at 8% as the discount gained 1 basis  point to 7.75%. Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.21% as the discount gained  1 basis point to 7.79%. Yields on one-year bills increased to 8.38% as the  discount climbed 3 basis points to 7.80%.  </P> <P> A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the  annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the  percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at  maturity.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight  loans, was quoted at midday at 8 7/16%, up from 8 3/8 percent late Tuesday.  </P></p>

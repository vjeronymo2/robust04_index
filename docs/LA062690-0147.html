			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY;  </P> <P> PATENT FIGHT APPEARS OVER, TO THE RELIEF OF 2 LOCAL COMPANIES  </P> <P> At least two Orange County computer companies are sighing with relief with the  news that the patent dispute between Motorola Inc. and Japanese electronics  giant Hitachi Ltd. was tentatively settled out of court on Monday.  </P> <P> Both Alpha Microsystems in Santa Ana and General Automation Inc. in Anaheim  make computers that use Motorola's 68030 microprocessor, a brain that controls  computing functions, which was the subject of the dispute between the two chip  makers. The dispute also threatened to cause serious consequences for companies  such as Apple Computer Inc. and Sun Microsystems, which depend on a steady  supply of 68030 chips for manufacturing their personal computers.  </P> <P> Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., depends on the chip for more than $100  million in annual sales, according to semiconductor industry analysts.  </P> <P> Last week, a federal judge in Austin, Tex., entered an order to enforce an  injunction he issued in March temporarily barring both companies from selling  the chips involved in the court case in the United States pending a resolution  of the dispute. Last Friday, Motorola filed documents in federal court in  Washington seeking a permanent stay of the Texas judge's order.  </P> <P> On Monday, Motorola said it had reached a preliminary settlement agreement with  Hitachi. Neither company disclosed details of the tentative agreement.  </P> <P> John S. Cain, president and chief executive of Alpha Microsystems, said his  company was concerned about the battle because one its lines of business  computers uses the Motorola chip. He noted, however, that his company is not  dependent on the chip because several of its other models use other Motorola  chips not involved in the Hitachi suit.  </P> <P> General Automation officials expressed far more concern about the  Motorola-Hitachi case because their company's most powerful machines, the 8000  Series of minicomputers, are based on the Motorola chip. Further, the company  had also planned to convert the remainder of its business computer line to the  68030 chip in November, said John Howorth, General Automation vice president of  marketing.  </P> <P> "It's a relief to know the dispute is finally concluded," Howorth said. "But we  were confident that the stakes were so high for Motorola that they would do  nothing that could interrupt the supply. We were surprised the legal action  went as far as it did."  </P></p>

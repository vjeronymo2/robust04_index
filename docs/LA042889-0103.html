			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOGAN MAKES SENSE OF 'IDIOGLOSSIA' AT ODYSSEY  </P> <P> When most actors learn their lines, they learn words. Beth Hogan learned  gibberish.  </P> <P> "It must sound more difficult than it actually is," said the actress who plays  Nell, a young Appalachian woman -- isolated from the outside world -- who has  developed her own language in Mark Handley's "Idioglossia" (at the Odyssey  Theatre). "Hotten is hot, guh-few is food. Rye-prow means very good. Durdadaw  is during the time. Rye hong is hungry. Duray, done rye hong means today, very  hungry. And holdate is hold the potato."  </P> <P> At the onset of the story, Nell is found in a lonely cabin, and comes under the  care of a team of behavioral and speech therapists, who set about to decipher  her "Nellish" and introduce her to English.  </P> <P> "Mark (Handley) made a tape of the Nellish, with that Appalachian-hillbilly  accent," Hogan said. "The lilt of the language really helps, because it does  have a rhyme and cadence to it. Of course," she said with a smile, "initially  you have to get over feeling like a nerd-head. But it also gives you a great  sense of freedom. Suddenly you're not restricted to the way people think you  can say the line -- because they don't know what you're saying."  </P> <P> If the role wasn't challenge enough, Hogan had her friends' funereal reactions  to contend with. "Well," they said gamely at the end of the first preview,  "it's always good to see you on stage."  </P> <P> But the next night, Hogan says, the audience was totally different. "They  accepted the play -- and that gave me confidence. I have felt uncomfortable in  that (theater) before. But not with this character. She doesn't have any  anxieties, because she's not trying to prove anything. So she lets everyone  into her world. If you want to be there, fine; if you want to leave, you can.  It's the same thing with her communication. She says: 'It's important what I'm  saying. It's less important that you hear it.' "  </P> <P> Hogan began acting at a Catholic women's college in her native Iowa. "It was  one of those theater departments where you didn't have men around, so you got  to do everything," she said with happy nostalgia. "We built the set, did the  lights, acted in the plays, made the costumes. You really got a sense of not  just acting, but being in a community and how a play happens -- that community  feeling."  </P> <P> Accompanying a friend on an audition for the graduate acting program at UC San  Diego, Hogan was encouraged to do a reading -- and was later chosen for the  program, one of four women picked from nationwide auditions.  </P> <P> "So I went to La Jolla with my big Midwestern shoes and a car my dad had bought  me," she said. "We called it Desiree. It was a huge white boat, a Chrysler  Newport -- it was just not cool. That was also the first time I had acting  classes. Before, we'd just done the play. I didn't know anything about  studying, what honesty was supposed to be about, breaking down a script. I felt  so left out: the car, the clothes, the shoes, the haircut, the accent."  </P> <P> In 1977, Hogan moved to Los Angeles, where she began teaching poetry, English  and morality at a private high school. One night she happened upon a Grotowski  workshop conducted by Odyssey artistic director Ron Sossi; out of that came a  role in the Odyssey's "An Evening of Dirty Religious Plays."  </P> <P> She later became a member of the theater's ensemble, appearing in "Three Top  Hats," "A Voyage to Arcturus," "Edmond," "Mary Barnes" and "Mother Courage."  Nowadays -- in addition to performing in this play -- she divides her time  between the theater's subscription office and teaching acting at Santa Monica  College.  </P> <P> But that's where she parts company with most of her colleagues. In an industry  town, where every actress really wants to be a star, Beth Hogan is on a  different track. She tells her age (36) without a moment's hesitation, balks at  the phoniness that's expected of her in a casting situation. And she refuses to  chase the almighty dollar.  </P> <P> "You have just so much time," she said. "And to drive all over town (to read)  for four lines, then drive somewhere to go 'Yum!' in a commercial -- well, it's  hard for me to say, 'That's what I'm going to dedicate my life to doing.' I  have a real pride about theater. And the nice thing about (the Odyssey) is if  they like you, you can stay."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 1:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HML commented that rebates and discounts should not be included in constructed value because they are price adjustments and not expenses. It cites Antifriction Bearings (Other than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from The Federal Republic of Germany, Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review (55 FR 31692, 31732, July 11, 1991), as an example of the Department's practice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree. Our preliminary analysis memorandum may have made it seem as if we included rebates and discounts in constructed value. However, we did not include rebates and discounts in our preliminary constructed value calculation because it is not our policy to do so. Therefore, no change in our calculations was necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 2:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HML commented that in comparing U.S. sales to constructed value, the Department made an error regarding home market inventory carrying costs of coated media. HML asserts that the Department should include these costs when determining the total amount of home market indirect expenses to deduct from constructed value just as it did in calculating the deduction from home market prices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree. It was our intention as we stated in our preliminary notice that inventory carrying costs be included in the pool of indirect home market selling expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, we have corrected our calculations. In accordance with our practice, we have limited the adjustment to constructed value of home market indirect expenses to the amount of indirect expenses HML incurred on its exporter's sales price transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 3:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HML pointed out two clerical errors in the model match table used in the computer program which caused no matching FMV sales to be found for two of the models sold in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree and have corrected the our calculations accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Final Results of the Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a result of this administrative review, the Department determines that the following margin exists for the period April 1, 1992, through March 31, 1993:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,7 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Manufacturer/producer/exporter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Margin percent  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> HML  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 0.96  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department will instruct the U.S. Customs Service to assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. The Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon publication of these final results of this administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review for all shipments of the subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) For subject merchandise exported by HML, a cash deposit of 0.96 percent; (2) For subject merchandise exported by manufacturers or exporters not covered in this review, but covered in previous reviews or the original less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation, a cash deposit based on the most recently published rate in a final result or determination for which the manufacturer or exporter received a company-specific rate; (3) If the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, a prior review, or the original LTFV investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and (4) If neither the exporter nor the manufacturer is a firm covered in these or any previous review reviews conducted by the Department, the cash deposit rate will be 42.85 percent, the ``all other'' rate established in the LTFV investigation, as discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On March 25, 1993, the Court of International Trade (CIT), in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Floral Trade Council  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Slip Op. 93&hyph;79, and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal-Mogul Corporation  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Slip Op. 93&hyph;83, decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company, it can only be changed through an administrative review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

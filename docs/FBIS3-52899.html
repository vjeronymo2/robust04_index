This agreement is to be signed today in Jerusalem by  both sides.    The establishment of relations between the Vatican and the  Israeli regime is actually an about-face by the Christian world,  which is symbolized by the Vatican, who has suddenly ignored all  its principles and values and a holy place that is under the  occupation of Zionist usurpers has been handed over on a silver  platter to them on behalf of all the Christians of the world.    The Pope, as the leader of the Catholic Church in the world  and who has rewarded the Zionists for the crimes they have  perpetrated and for their occupation, should be asked by all the  Christians of the world and by all mankind: Will the noble  Christians of the world allow the Vatican to reward the Zionist  traitors and criminals?    The Zionist groups in the United States and the Western  countries have placed the Vatican under pressure to compromise  with the Israeli regime. But this will only lead to further  discord and disagreement in Europe and will definitely give rise  to insecurity and protests there. Pious Christians will never  agree to this compromise. The Christians of the world should  prove that this is not a reward by the Christian world to the  Zionists, but a reward that has been handed out by the corrupt  club of the powerful who rule the West.</p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Derivatives markets shared in the volatility seen in equity sectors in the final pre-Easter trading session, writes Terry Byland. For much of the day, the June contract on the Footsie traded at a small discount to the cash market but traders stressed that dealing was restrained. The final reading of 3,058 showed the contract at a substantial discount to the cash market but some ground was recovered in after hours trading. Trading volume was swollen to just over 15,000 contracts in the June contract.</p>

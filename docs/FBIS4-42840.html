			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Hans Joerg Sottorf: "Kinkel Practices </F> Tightrope Walk With Moscow"]    [Text] After NATO defense ministers told the Russians at  the Brussels North Atlantic Cooperation Council meeting that  they would not be conceded a special status in their  relationship with NATO, not even within the framework of the  Partnership for Peace program, the foreign ministers of the  Atlantic alliance at their meeting in Istanbul now want to prove  their diplomatic skills and make this position clearer to the  prestige-oriented Russians, which, in this case, means that they  will have to make their position appear more attractive.    Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel will play a special role in  this connection, because the NATO allies, the Americans in  particular, have entrusted Germany with a crucial role for  shaping relations between the members of the North Atlantic  alliance and the states or successor states of the former Warsaw  Pact. Typically, the diplomats will act more cautiously than the  defense ministers, who tend to prefer a clear language.  According to internal preliminary discussions, in Istanbul  Kinkel will defend the principle that participants will not be  treated differently within the Partnership for Peace scheme, not  even Russia, which has still not signed the framework agreement.    In diplomatic circles in Bonn, it has been pointed out that  one must understand the claims of an international and nuclear  power such as Russia to an outstanding position in European  foreign and security policy. However, it has been said that one  could not formalize such a position, but, at the most,  "institutionalize" it. Yet, so far nobody knows exactly how this  can be done without upsetting the other members of the program  and making them call for full NATO membership immediately. In  Bonn the question marks that determine the discussion on the  future European security policy are by no means being ignored.  In such cases, the diplomats tend to bank on the time factor --  and this is what they are doing now. From the period of  transition, Russia has belonged to the NATO Cooperation Council,  which was conceived as a bridge to NATO. Some members of this  council were seeking early full membership, which caused  controversial debates. That Russia should not and would not  become a NATO member was obvious to everybody. This is what  generated the American idea to create a kind of preparatory  program through Partnership for Peace for countries that will  one day achieve the political and economic conditions for full  NATO membership.    Strictly speaking, Russia does not belong to this group,  because it wants to remain outside NATO. However, out of  political considerations, nobody would or could exclude Moscow  from participation either, which has created an almost  schizophrenic situation.    Officials in Bonn meanwhile know to what extent Moscow is  anxious, for reasons of domestic policy, not only to make the  North Atlantic Cooperation Council superfluous but to devalue  NATO in general by upgrading the CSCE to an umbrella security  institution. Yet, this plan should not work out, something on  which the Federal Government and its Western partners all agree  on. "In these insecure times of change we still need NATO,"  they say. Whether the Russians will jump on the tightrope of  noncommittal declarations of intent, which the NATO foreign  ministers intend to put up in Istanbul, remains, however,  uncertain.</p>

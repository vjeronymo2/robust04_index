			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GABOR TO GIVE UP APPEAL OF SLAPPING  CONVICTION  </P> <P> Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor has decided to give up her court appeal to have her  conviction for slapping a Beverly Hills motorcycle policeman reversed.  </P> <P> "She's just tired of it, and 72 hours isn't going to kill her," her publicist,  Phil Paladino, said of the three-day jail sentence Gabor has said she will  serve.  </P> <P> Paladino made his comments Wednesday, the eve of the first anniversary of the  famous slap heard around the world. "As Zsa Zsa would say, you can't beat City  Hall," Paladino said. "In her heart, she's innocent."  </P> <P> Gabor, 72, still has to notify the court that she is dropping her appeal, her  spokesman said, adding that she will probably serve the sentence "within the  month." Gabor was convicted of striking Beverly Hills Police Officer Paul  Kramer during a traffic stop last June 14.  </P></p>

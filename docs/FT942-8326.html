			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Derivatives traders reported a more positive tone to trading following the release of improved retail sales figures, though the futures contract later fell back with the publication of US economic data, writes Joel Kibazo. In stock index futures, the June contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 3,120, in line with the cash market. It advanced with the release of the UK retail sales figures to a peak of 3,139, pulling the underlying cash market higher. However, the premium to cash was only a few points for most of the session, leaving traders few opportunities for arbitrage trading. The day's range was a mere 13 points. The larger institutions were said to have been selective in their activity in the market yesterday, leaving one dealer to comment: 'Institutions are only going for value at this stage.' US data, which revealed a higher than expected March trade deficit, unsettled June in the afternoon, leaving it to drift lower. It closed at 3,125, up 15 from its previous close and at a 2-point premium to cash. Volume, at 10,436 lots, was poor. Turnover in the traded options slipped back to 32,877 contracts. In the index options, 12,034 were traded in the FT-SE 100 option and 5,720 in the Euro FT-SE. Hanson was the busiest stock option with a total of 4,019 contracts dealt.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Consumer interest points to recovery CONSUMER INTEREST in buying goods and services has shown a big increase since the beginning of the year, although it stabilised between February and March, a business information company said yesterday. The levelling off in enthusiasm for purchases shown by an index compiled by NTC Research adds to fears that the recovery may be weak. The index, taking in TV advertising, job vacancies, share prices, interest rates and retail sales, leapt from 114.23 in January to 127.76 in February. In March it moved up only fractionally to 127.89. Vodafone, the Newbury-based mobile telephone company, yesterday added to evidence that the recovery is under way by reporting that April was its best month for three years. The company added a net 18,766 subscribers to its network in April - the largest number of new subscribers since May 1990 - bringing total subscribers to 856,000. A year ago the monthly tally for new subscribers was running at about 5,000 net. Figures for new connections by cable TV companies offering phone services also show strong growth. According to the Independent Television Commission, the first three months of the year saw an increase of a third in the number of residential and business lines, taking the total number of exchange lines installed to 143,660. Meanwhile the UK's electronics industry is seeing signs of recovery after two years of stagnant sales. Mr Cyril Teed, president of the EEA electronics industry trade association, said last night at its annual dinner that new orders rose by 7 per cent last year and were back at 1989 levels.

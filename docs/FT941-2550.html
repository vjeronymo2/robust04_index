			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Books: With his best Foot forward / Review of a new biography of the man who held the Labour Party together MICHAEL FOOT by Mervyn Jones Victor Gollancz Pounds 20, 570 pages When he retired as a Member of Parliament in 1992, Michael Foot declined to go to the House of Lords on the entirely rational ground that he had always said the place should be abolished. More surprising, and far more regrettable, was his decision not to write his memoirs. The task of producing his biography was taken on by Mervyn Jones, an old journalist friend, author of many novels and broadly a political soul-mate. Jones has risen manfully to the challenge. The published version of his book runs to 570 pages; the full version has been placed with the Museum of Labour History in Manchester. One may ask, however, whether this is the right way to go about it. Apart from the biography, Jones has provided a potted history of the events leading to the second world war, a summary of the cold war, and a history of the Labour Party seen from the left. It is as though Michael Foot was a pivotal figure throughout. The truth is rather different. Foot was always an engaging man, but until relatively late in life his political influence was peripheral. He has perhaps two big claims to fame in British politics. The first is that he was instrumental in founding the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in the late 1950s. CND, whatever was said by its detractors, led to an intellectual concentration on the problems posed by nuclear weapons. It also contributed to the test ban treaty, which was the first serious attempt to bring the weapons under international control. On the second claim to fame, the jury is still out, but the preliminary verdict must be sympathetic. Jones puts it starkly: 'The truth about Michael Foot's place in history is that he was the man who saved the Labour Party'. Some people may argue that by the late 1970s the Labour Party had served its purpose and should not have been saved. A more telling judgment will depend on whether there is ever again a Labour government. If there is, Foot will have done something to bring it about, for it was he who strove as much as anyone to hold the party together. In his early political life, Foot had always been a maverick. Initially he was a Liberal from a liberal family. He was never short of contacts. After Oxford, his first job was with a shipping firm in Liverpool, employed by the right wing brother of Stafford Cripps, and it was on Merseyside that he turned to socialism, though it was socialism of a quixotic kind. Foot's patron was Lord Beaverbrook, for whose papers he wrote, despite dissenting views. His hero was Aneurin Bevan, of whom he became the biographer. Yet, as Jones points out, there was always a dilemma between politics and literature. Foot could do either, but was never quite sure which he preferred. For a time he had it both ways. He entered Parliament for Plymouth Devonport in 1945 and held the seat for 10 years. In 1960 he succeeded Bevan as the member for Ebbw Vale. Before he died, Bevan had become a controversial figure on the left of the party because he refused unilaterally to renounce nuclear weapons. Foot knew, from his Bevanite experience, how schismatic the party could be, yet for a decade he continued on the outside left. Then in 1970, when Harold Wilson lost the general election, Foot decided to move inside. He stood for the shadow cabinet, was elected and for the next 13 years, whether in government or opposition, played a crucial role in keeping the party just about intact. This is the seminal part of the political chapters in the Jones book. Some of the information, drawn from personal interviews, is new. I did not know, for instance, how far Foot was behind the Lib-Lab Pact of the late 1970s, and I was surprised to learn that Denis Healey was utterly loyal to Foot until the end. Healey, like Foot, had the same instincts: the only practical course was to seek to preserve the party. The man who was badly treated was Peter Shore, who once seemed Foot's candidate for the succession to James Callaghan as party leader. In 1980 Foot forgot to tell Shore in time that he had decided to stand himself; the reason was that Foot was persuaded that he himself had the best chance of keeping the party together. Foot lost the general election of 1983 decisively, but the party survived. In the process, he had seen off the Social Democrats and Tony Benn and begun to resist the Militant Tendency. Perhaps we should give him the benefit of the doubt; no-one else could have done it. Yet Foot is a much more attractive, eccentric man than those last few intensely political years suggest. He was prone to accidents: he suffered seriously from eczema and asthma (hence his absence from the war), then had a car crash, which relieved him of both, but left him lame: hence his famous stick. He received gratuities from Beaverbrook which it is unlikely that a politician would survive today, but one does not doubt his independence. He wrote wonderfully about Jonathan Swift and was one of the best speakers in the House of the Commons. His parliamentary ally was often Enoch Powell, who has also avoided the Lords. Some of this lively side comes out in the book; much of it is lost in the padding. The pity is that Foot is now spending his time writing about another hero: HG Wells. Typical Michael Foot. It would be good to have the real memoir.</p>

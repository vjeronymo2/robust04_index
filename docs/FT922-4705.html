			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Fall in earnings at Turkey Trust Net asset value per ordinary share of Turkey Trust stood at 155.12p at April 30. That compared with 183p basic and 187.2p fully diluted 12 months earlier and with 148.97p at end-October 1991. Net revenue for the half year to end-April fell to Pounds 62,000 (Pounds 241,000) for earnings of 0.63p (2.46p) per share. That reflected a lower level of interest income earned from UK government stocks due to the trust being more fully invested in Turkish equities.</p>

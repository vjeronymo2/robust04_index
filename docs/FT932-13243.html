			<p>930423 FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: Dow result cheers chemical sector DOW CHEMICAL, the second-biggest US chemicals group, yesterday provided a glimmer of hope for the embattled US chemical industry by posting better-than-expected first-quarter earnings. Although Dow's underlying first-quarter profits dropped 28 per cent to 47 cents a share, they were significantly above the 30 cents Wall Street had anticipated. Dow's shares climbed Dollars 3 1/8 to close at Dollars 56 in New York yesterday. Mr Leonard Bogner, senior chemical analyst at Prudential Securities, attributed the unexpectedly strong results to 'a recovery in Dow's traditional commodity chemicals and plastics operations, plus a profit contribution from Europe. Most analysts had expected European operations to be in the red. Mr Bogner said: 'While the numbers do not suggest that the chemical cycle is booming, we believe that they do suggest the erosion in profitability is over for chemicals. We would anticipate a slow recovery for the rest of 1993 and some big improvements in earnings in 1994 and 1995.' Special items in the 1993 and 1992 quarters muddied Dow's balance sheet. In the latest quarter, Dow had net earnings of Dollars 402m, or Dollars 1.47, including a one-time gain of Dollars 450m, or Dollars 1, from the sale of its 50 per cent stake in Dowell Schlumberger. A year earlier, Dow posted a net deficit of Dollars 587m, or Dollars 2.17, including charges of Dollars 765m for accounting changes. Sales in the 1993 quarter slipped 6 per cent to Dollars 4.4bn from Dollars 4.6bn. Operating income from chemicals and performance products soared 66 per cent in the latest quarter to Dollars 146m, due to widespread improvement in earnings from most businesses in the segment which offset lower prices for caustic soda. Sales were flat at Dollars 1.1bn. Dow's operating income from plastics rose 4 per cent to Dollars 87m in spite of a sharp drop in thermoplastic prices in Europe. Dow said gains in polyurethanes, styrenics and fabricated products led the advance in operating income. Sales slipped 2 per cent to Dollars 1.6bn. The company's hydrocarbons and energy business narrowed its operating loss to Dollars 7m, from Dollars 31m, on flat sales of Dollars 384m. Consumer specialties saw operating earnings plunge 52 per cent to Dollars 162m on a 15 per cent decline in sales to Dollars 1.3bn. Marion Merrell Dow, the pharmaceuticals company 70 per cent owned by Dow,posted sharply lower sales and operating income in the period.</p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Eldridge Pope recovery continues with 46% rise - Three drinks companies report varying levels of profits growth ELDRIDGE POPE, the Dorset-based brewer, continued its recovery from 1990 losses on hotel and computer ventures with a 46 per cent increase in full-year pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 1.61m. The result was achieved in spite of 'bleak summer trade', said Mr Christopher Pope, chairman. 'I am glad to say that trading has stabilised into a more normal pattern since.' Earnings per share for the year ended September 30 rose from 5.5p to 8.3p. A proposed final dividend of 1.94p lifts the total by 23 per cent to 3.25p (2.64p). Mr Pope pledged to increase dividends 'to their full former real value as soon as earnings and prospects permit'. Operating profit rose 12 per cent to Pounds 3.49m (Pounds 3.11m) on turnover ahead 2 per cent to Pounds 43.1m (Pounds 42.2m). Sales of cask ale rose 6.8 per cent, helped by a 10.4 per cent increase in volumes of the premium Thomas Hardy bitter brand. Wine sales improved 6.6 per cent. Pub retailing profits increased by Pounds 400,000, with food sales ahead by 9 per cent. Exceptional items included a Pounds 1.1m profit on sales of capital assets, partially offset by a provision of Pounds 400,000 against future restructuring costs. Costs last time were Pounds 481,000. In the previous year there was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 150,000. Net interest charges fell 6.4 per cent to Pounds 2.18m (Pounds 2.33m). A write-down of Pounds 9.4m in the value of the company's properties was charged to revaluation reserve.</p>

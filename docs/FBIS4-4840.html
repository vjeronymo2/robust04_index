			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- The Japanese Government has  told the United States it will take "all available measures" to  ensure the implementation of the recent bilateral accord on the  opening of Japan's mobile telephone market, the postal ministry  said Wednesday.    Japan's intentions were notified in a letter to U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor from Japanese Ambassador to  Washington Takakazu Kuriyama, published the same day by the  Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. In the letter, dated  March 12, the day when the bilateral deal was struck, Kuriyama  said the Japanese Government will "monitor and oversee  completion of the actions described in the letter," referring to  the agreement.    If the actions called for in the agreement have not been  implemented, Japan, in consultation with the U.S., "will take  all available measures to ensure compliance with the letter by  the next quarterly review."    Under the bilateral agreement, Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp.  (IDO) will take several steps to help improve access for  Motorola Inc. of the U.S. to the Japanese market, including the  establishment of 159 new relay stations for Motorola-formula  telephone services by October 1995.    The two governments agreed to meet every three months or on  request by either government to assess implementation of the  agreement. The accord came just in time for the deadline for  threatened U.S. trade sanctions against Japan.    Washington had accused Japan of breaching a 1989 Japan-U.S.  trade accord meant to boost imports of U.S. cellular phones and  set March 17 as the deadline for an announcement of sanctions  over its trade disputes with Tokyo.</p>

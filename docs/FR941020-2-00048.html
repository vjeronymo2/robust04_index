			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have determined that ASHI's laboratory enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and appeal policies are essentially equivalent to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of this subpart as they apply to accreditation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Federal Validation Inspections and Continuing Oversight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We may conduct Federal validation inspections of ASHI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accredited laboratories, as specified in &sect;493.507, on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative sample basis or in response to allegations of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance (called complaint inspections). The outcome  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of those validation inspections, performed by us, the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey agency, or a HCFA agent, will be our principal means  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for verifying that the laboratories accredited by ASHI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remain in compliance with CLIA requirements. This Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring is an on-going process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Removal of Approval as an Accrediting Organization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Our regulations at &sect;493.511 provide that we may remove  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the approval of an accreditation organization, such as that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of ASHI, prior to the end of the effective date of approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If validation inspection outcomes and the comparability or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> validation review produce findings as described at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;493.509(a), we will conduct a review of an accreditation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organization's program. We also conduct a review when the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> validation review findings, irrespective of the rate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disparity (as defined in &sect;493.2), indicate systemic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problems in the organization's processes that provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence that the organization's requirements, taken as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whole, are no longer equivalent to the CLIA requirements,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taken as a whole.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If we determine that ASHI has failed in practice to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforce its standards, or systemic problems exist in its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection process, we may give it a probationary period,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not to exceed one year, to allow ASHI to conform its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection or enforcement procedures to the CLIA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. Based on an evaluation of any of the items  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stipulated at &sect;493.511(d), we will make a determination as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to whether or not ASHI retains its approved status as an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accreditation organization under CLIA. If we deny approved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> status, ASHI may resubmit its application when it has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised its program to address the rationale for the denial,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrated that it can reasonably assure that its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accredited laboratories meet CLIA condition level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, and resubmits its application for approval as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an accreditation organization in its entirety. If, however,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ASHI requests reconsideration of an adverse determination in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with subpart D of part 488 of our regulations, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may not submit a new application until a final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reconsideration determination is issued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

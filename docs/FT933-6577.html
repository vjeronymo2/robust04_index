			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Drugs active The rehabilitation of the UK drugs sector, which began in earnest a couple of weeks ago when a burst of US buying triggered a general rerating of the sector, continued yesterday and was again driven by US funds. London marketmakers were said to have been caught short of the front line stocks such as Glaxo, Wellcome and Zeneca, all of which performed strongly. Zeneca, first traded around 592p in May this year, following its demerger from ICI, appreciated 15 to a record 712p on 2.4m traded. Glaxo put on 5 1/2 at 583p and Wellcome advanced 12 to 756p. The BZW profits upgrade continued to bolster ICI, which moved up 5 to 695p. Hickson International was a rare weak spot in the chemicals area, the shares losing 13 to 171p after the 17 per cent profits fall and a disappointing accompanying statement. US activity provided the lion's share of turnover in Vodafone (8 higher at 570p), where a block of 7.5m shares was traded at 561p, simultaneously with a block of 750,000 ADRs dealt at Dollars 84.89. The two classes of BT made modest progress after the Pounds 500m Eurosterling bond. BT 'old' edged up 2 1/2 to 425p and the partly paid 3 to 183p. There was no let-up in the demand for Barclays shares, which has followed the appointment of Mr Martin Taylor as the bank's new chief executive as from next January. Turnover in Barclays topped 8m, with the stock price surging ahead to close a further 10 up at a record 515p. Lloyds Bank also attracted sustained institutional support, ending a busy session 9 to the good at 548p. National Westminster added 5 at 495p and Standard Chartered 13 at 938p. The composite insurance sector was much calmer, with Guardian Royal Exchange 4 firmer at 214p ahead of interim results expected this morning. Lowndes Lambert was the pick of the insurance brokers, appreciating 12 to 443p on talk of a broker buy note. A broker buy recommendation was said to have boosted National Power, 8 1/2 up at 365 1/2 p. PowerGen strengthened 9 1/2 to 392 1/2 p. The exploration and production sub-sector made further strong progress, led by Enterprise Oil, which climbed 12 to 448p on above-average turnover of 3m shares, with the Kleinwort Benson and Lehman Bros buy recommendations issued earlier this week followed by advice from another of the leading UK brokers to switch from Lasmo. Nevertheless, Lasmo continued to push ahead, touching 146p before settling 3 up on the day at 145p. Turnover came to 5.6m, maintaining the heavy activity seen in the stock over the past few weeks. Hardy Oil advanced 6 1/2 to a 1993 high of 164p following recent broker buy recommendations. Calor, another broker favourite this week, added 5 at 265p. A broker's visit to Asda boosted turnover to 20m and the shares firmed 1 3/4 to 66 1/4 p. Turnover in Tate &amp; Lyle swelled to 10m after two agency crosses. The shares eased a penny to 393p. Dalgety forged ahead 20 to 518p on talk of a strong recommendation from Strauss Turnbull. The strong trend in both the UK and French stock markets gave impetus to the recovery in Euro Disney shares, which finished 20 higher at 665p. Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel was also helped by the same sentiment, finishing 13 ahead at 466p. Bellwinch ended 6 dearer at 40p in response to a buy recommendation from Credit Lyonnais Laing, its broker, ahead of results due next Tuesday. Shares in high street retailer WH Smith surged forward after the company reported annual profits at the top end of expectations and also raised the dividend payment. The WH Smith 'A' stock rose 16 to 471p as 4.1m shares were traded. Mr Tony Shiret at BZW was among brokers who upgraded current year estimates, lifting his forecast by Pounds 5m to Pounds 122m. WH Smith's good showing helped sentiment in Boots, which put on 6 at 486p. Profit-taking was blamed for a decline in Kingfisher, 9 cheaper at 669p. Reports of 'sell' advice from UBS left Ladbroke 3 lighter at 205p. Rentokil Group encountered demand ahead of today's interim figures, firming 4 to 210p. A positive recommendation from Kleinwort Benson was said to have continued to fuel an advance by Inchcape, which added 13 at 567p. The 'light' end of the building materials sector provided a firm feature in Wolseley, which appreciated 10 more to 654p, still boosted by a series of recent buy recommendations from building analysts, notably from Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken. Mr Lawrence Ambolt at Carr said: 'In a highly rated sector, Wolseley represents good value - particularly when compared with other distributors, none of which have Wolseley's track record, nor, we would argue, its prospects or management strength.' Pilkington came in for sustained buying interest, the ordinary shares moving forward 4 to 158p and the warrants 2 1/2 to 56 1/2 p. Among housebuilders, Barratt advanced 5 to 161p, Wilson Bowden 11 to 439p and Wilson Connolly 8 to 192p. Alfred McAlpine, scheduled to report interims today, was 8 higher at 215p.</p>

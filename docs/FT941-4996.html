			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Dutch drop mobile phone tax The Dutch government has dropped controversial plans to tax the profits of companies operating mobile phone networks. It is instead considering charging mobile phone operators for the use of radio frequencies. Koninklijke PTT Nederland, the state-owned telecoms operator, plans to launch a European GSM standard mobile communications network in July, and a second operator will be chosen by tender in late 1994. Mrs Hanja Maij-Weggen, public works minister, said consortia bidding for licences would be informed that Dutch policies on radio frequencies were under review and subject to change. However, legislation on the use of frequencies is not expected in time for the opening of bidding in the autumn, because of general elections on May 3. Several international consortia, grouped around the three main Dutch banks, ABN Amro, ING and Rabobank, are expected to compete for the second operator's licence.</p>

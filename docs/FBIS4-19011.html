			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Franco Venturini commentary: "The Necessary Ally"] </F>   [Text] Was it not perhaps Russian pressure on the Serbs  which led to the liberation of Sarajevo two months ago? Was it  not Moscow diplomacy which covered the backs of American  negotiators in recent weeks? And now, as sole response,  American NATO planes arrive to strike Serb positions without  even informing the Kremlin, without consulting it, [not] giving  it a mere telephone call from Clinton once everything had been  decided. A true affront, which could extend the flames of  Gorazde to the relationships between the United States and  Russia.    A furious, red-faced Boris Yeltsin expressed himself more or  less in this way to manifest his indignation. But do not fear:  There will be no fire in relations between Washington and  Moscow because neither of the two supposed pyromaniacs has any  interest in lighting it, and indeed the appropriate diplomatic  maneuvers are already under way to cool things down. Yeltsin  will calm down. But the problem posed by his outburst of rage  remains, because the West continues to lack any policy worthy of  the name toward Russia.    The anti-Serbian incursions around Gorazde pose no question  of legitimacy. For one year now there has existed a UN  resolution which Russia voted for, along with the others, and  which provides for the use of every necessary means to preserve  certain Bosnian cities. Gorazde is one of these, and UN  Secretary General Butrus-Ghali had repeated in the last few days  that the United Nations would resort to air strikes if the Serbs  continued their murderous shellings. Hence Yeltsin cannot raise  the question of the right to take action. But he can raise and  he is raising a question of the appropriateness of this action,  precisely the question which NATO and the United States have  been unable to manage.    Perhaps it was felt at the White House that it would have  been better for Yeltsin not to know, and that by leaving him in  the dark NATO would, in reality, have protected him against the  assaults of nationalists like Zhirinovskiy (the same person who  yesterday was suggesting to heaven knows whom to attack Aviano).  Maybe. But thinking this way would signify a lack of  understanding of the fact that, in Russia, image is more  important than politics, and that the greater offense, for  Russians, is not to be opposed, but to be neglected. In  particular when the Kremlin has already taken the risk of being  unpopular within the country.  <H5>  A Crucial Role </H5>   We have to admit that Russian diplomacy for the last two  months has been playing a crucial and constructive role in the  Bosnian problem. Moreover, only Moscow is in a position to  exercise fruitful pressure on the Serbs, who are Slav and  Orthodox. The conclusion is obvious: There is today and there  will continue to be tomorrow an absolute need for Russia,  because, without its work of convincing, no peace project drawn  up by the Americans or Europeans will be able to really involve  the Serbs and therefore have a hope of success.    Was it not, therefore, necessary to be realistic, and to  consult Yeltsin, and not to go ahead with the strikes in the  absence of his approval? Not for a moment. NATO cannot and  must not concede to Russia a power of joint decision which would  pervert its role, leading very rapidly to a process of breakup.    And neither is it conceivable that America, as such, the  sole  real superpower, rely on the red telephone with the Kremlin  before deciding on what has to be done.    Long ago diplomats invented ways of squaring the circle. One  provides information at the appropriate times and in the  appropriate fashion (as moreover happened for the second  attack), one involves without subordinating anything, one shows  respect without showing pliancy.  <H5>  Family Picture </H5>   This, and no more, the West owes Yeltsin. Otherwise, it  would be useless to think of a pretty family picture, with  Vesuvius in the background and in the July heat.</p>

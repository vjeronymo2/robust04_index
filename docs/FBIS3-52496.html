It  was expected that the Indians would reiterate their well-known  position on Kashmir that the UNCIP's [UN Commission for India  and Pakistan] resolutions on the issue were no longer relevant.  Equally predictable was Pakistan's response that any  efficacious solution to the Kashmir problem must be sought  within the framework of these resolutions. As both sides stuck  to their own positions, the talks could not but founder on the  rock of disagreement on Kashmir. And though the joint statement  issued at the end of the seventh round mentions the possibility  of the continuation of talks, no date has been fixed for these.  This itself is a tacit admission of the growing futility of  negotiations at the foreign secretary-level. The outcome of the  talks could, however, have been different had the Indians not  come to the negotiating table with an agenda which did not leave  any room for compromise. One indication of this was a statement  by Dinesh Singh, India's minister for external affairs, on the  eve of the talks, parroting the old theme of Kashmir being part  of India. The Indians, in fact, had sealed the fate of the  seventh round before it had even begun.    But the intransigence and obduracy are the hallmarks of  Indian diplomacy that for long have blighted the prospects of  peace in the South Asian region. And though it is important to  keep this factor in view while dealing with Delhi, more  significant is to devise an effective, long-term counter to this  Indian attitude. Sadly, so far our foreign office mandarins  have failed to come up with such a strategy. Their flaccid  response to India's intense diplomatic moves on Kashmir is a  testimony to this fact. The Indians, despite committing some of  the worst crimes against humanity in Kashmir, have been trying  hard, with some success, to convince the world that they have a  case on Kashmir. Pakistan, on the other hand, has not been able  to elicit a positive response from the world community, even  though its stand on Kashmir is much stronger and more cogent  than Delhi's. This failure becomes all the more glaring if seen  in the light of the fact that in today's world no State can  violate human rights with impunity and not incur international  odium and censure. But thanks to our diplomatic fecklessness,  Delhi has been able to perform the are feat of killing Kashmiris  and feigning innocence in the court of international public  opinion at the same time.    The failure of the seventh round of secretary-level talks  should be an occasion for our policy makers to draw a long-term  India policy with clear cut and well-defined goals; one of which  should be to not let world focus shift from Delhi's oppression  in Kashmir. Once the goals have been defined, all diplomatic  efforts should be geared towards achieving these. More  crucially, the political leadership now has to realise that  foreign policy is too serious a business to be left to erring  bureaucrats. Difficult political problems, whether domestic or  foreign, are best dealt with at the political level.</p>

They  discussed the massacre at the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq  Micha'il, developments in Lebanon, and the suspension of the  bilateral talks following the massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque  in Hebron. Hambley handed President al-Hirawi a message from  U.S. President Bill Clinton expressing the feelings of the  American people and their strong support for Lebanon in foiling  the attempts of those who are trying to infringe upon its  independence.    After the meeting with President al-Hirawi, Hambley said  that  the visit was intended to express condemnation of the carnage at  the Sayyidat al-Najat Church, which caused the death of innocent  people. He reiterated his country's support for the peace  process and its emphasis on continuing these steps toward peace.  He noted that President Clinton had stressed his support for  President al-Hirawi and, through him, to the other Lebanese  leaders and people.    Responding to a question on continuing the talks after their  suspension in the wake of the Hebron massacre, Hambley said that  his country is trying to find a suitable atmosphere for a  resumption of the talks and the peace process in the region. He  noted that his country is contacting all parties and expects the  parties to resume talks in Washington soon.</p>

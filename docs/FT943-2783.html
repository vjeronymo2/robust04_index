			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / US court bars extradition of IRA man: Appeal against San Francisco ruling expected The government is expected to appeal against a ruling by a US judge blocking the extradition of a convicted IRA gunman. Ms Barbara Caulfield, a San Francisco federal judge, ruled against the extradition of Mr James Smyth on the grounds of 'the punishment, detention and restrictions on his personal liberties' that he would face on his return to prison in Northern Ireland. The ruling drew an angry reaction from prison officers in Northern Ireland and from some unionist officials. Mr Finlay Spratt, chairman of Northern Ireland's Prison Officers' Association, said the judge's decision was an 'absolute disgrace'. Northern Ireland had 'one of the most relaxed penal systems in the world'. The ruling was also seized on by Irish-Americans sympathetic to the republican cause. Mr Smyth said he planned to stay in the US 'until the British leave Ireland' and to campaign on behalf of three other Irish nationals who remain in US prisons. UK government officials yesterday played down the political significance of the ruling, indicating they would not allow it to get in the way of their collaboration with the US administration over the current Anglo-Irish peace process. They do not believe there has been any political interference with the judge's decision. Officials think it likely that a US court of appeal will eventually rule in favour of extradition. The case is not expected to be settled for some months, by which time political developments may mean Mr Smyth will return voluntarily. Mr Smyth was arrested in San Francisco in 1992 after spending nine years as a fugitive from British justice. Before the latest ruling a request for bail had been refused by a US appeal court. The government has been seeking Mr Smyth's extradition so that he can complete a 20-year sentence for the attempted murder of a prison officer and face trial for taking part in an armed mass escape from the Maze prison in 1983. In May last year a request by Judge Caulfield for Whitehall documents was refused by the government. These are thought to have included details of UK security policy in Northern Ireland. The Irish government yesterday signalled that it might consider releasing some IRA prisoners in coming weeks as part of the peace process.</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Internationals hit Internationally traded stocks suffered as a stronger pound against the US dollar affected the value of shares traded in New York. Comments from a UK Treasury official, who sought to dampen further expectations of early UK interest rate cuts, helped sterling to rise more than a cent to breach Dollars 1.50 against the dollar. This left UK stocks traded as American Depositary Receipts looking expensive. One ADR trader cited Glaxo and suggested that at least half of the slide in the pharmaceutical company's shares, which fell 16 to 666p, was the result of sterling's strength. Many international stocks also attracted fundamental sellers. Among them, Reuters Holdings fell 47 to 1825p as a lingering row with the Chicago Board of Trade over Reuters' Globex dealing system flared up again. Perennially bullish analyst Mr Brian Newman of Henderson Crosthwaite said the row was a 'storm in a tea cup' and promptly wrote a buy recommendation. Wellcome drew some attention after it was announced that full results from last year's big French study on the anti-Aids treatment AZT would be published shortly in the Lancet medical journal. The shares dropped 22 to 674p.</p>

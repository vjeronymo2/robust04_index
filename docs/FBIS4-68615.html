			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vyacheslav Chornovil, chairman of People's </F> Rukh of Ukraine, by Andrey Derepa and Dmitriy Ponomarchuk,  Rukh-press; place and date not given: "During the First Round We  Won Some Back But We Did Not Lose"]    [Text]    [Rukh-press] How do you feel about the accusations from the  anticommunist camp that Rukh has violated the convention with  its fellow democrats and struck out on its own during the  elections?    [Chornovil] On the contrary. Each party nominated its own  candidates. We are accused of ignoring the agreement and  printing up our own list of candidates. That is not true. We  looked for an agreement with each district and achieved one with  some districts. In places where we did not reach an agreement we  did indeed publish our own list. Many other parties did this as  well. But our list included not only Rukh members but also  Konstantin Morozov, Volodymyr Lanovyy, and certain members of  the URP [Ukrainian Republic Party]...    From Vyacheslav Chornovil's speech at the Rukh meeting  on 16 April:    "Our modest results seem more significant against the  background of the collapse of other noncommunist parties. The  URP, which ran almost as many candidates in the elections as we  did, gained only nine mandates, the PDVU [Party of Democratic  Revival of Ukraine]--five, the Democratic Party--three, Peasant  Democrats--the same, and Social Democrats--two. And the leaders  of all these parties except the Democratic Party lost. And if  the loss of certain parties can be explained by the embryonic  stage of their existence and their lack of ramified structures,  the losses of the structurally stronger organizations with KNDS  [Committee of National Democratic Forces] leanings must be  attributed to the conciliatory policy of this party's leaders  toward the ruling postcommunist nomenklatura."    [Chornovil] ...at the same time, for example, the nominee  from the oblast URP conference ran against me. He did not even  get 1 percent. This fact in itself is instructive because the  Rukh conferences did not run candidates against either the  chairman of the URP, Mykhaylo Horyn, or against the leaders of  other parties included in the democratic association Ukraina.    It is clear to everyone today that this association was  created out of one political force--the so-called KNDS, the  nucleus of which is the URP. This party rallied around itself  organizations which had no influence on the elections, but it  wanted very much to create the appearance of a large association.    Demonstrating our desire for unity and hoping that common  sense will win out over ambition, we too joined this  association. But it turned out that this association needed Rukh  only for financial aid. As soon as it received this aid,  everything possible was done to isolate Rukh within the  framework of this association.    The apparatus of Ukraina was formed mainly from URP members.  They even accepted people we had fired from the Rukh secretariat  because of their poor work.    There were simply scandalous things, such as when they asked  us to withdraw our strong candidates in favor of certain very  questionable people. That is, weak but ambitious organizations  wanted to take advantage of Rukh's structures under the shield  of the Ukraina association to campaign for candidates who were  known to be losers. Sometimes URP simply took candidates off the  street...    It was very insulting to see how the association's chairman,  Levko Lukyanenko, forgetting about his "objectivity" and  "freedom from party affiliation," traveled to the areas of  Ternopol or Ivano-Frankov and campaigned for the candidates from  the URP and against the candidates from Rukh, slinging mud all  over me: Do not think about voting for so and so because he will  be on Chornovil's team, and Chornovil is in favor of the  collapse of the state and for two state languages. And what  then? After this kind of "campaigning" the chairman of the  oblast URP organization, who had a certain chance, lost to our  candidate Andrey Zarudnyy.    [Rukh-press] Do you agree that Galicia produced almost 15  votes from the extreme right?    [Chornovil] Not 15. The Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists  [KUN] ran under right-wing nationalist slogans, thinking they  stood to gain something from that. But the KUN has repeatedly  announced its support for democratic nationalism. So barely  seven deputies from the KUN can be regarded as at the extreme  right. Actually, there will be only six extreme right-wingers in  the Supreme Council--three from the UNA-UNSO [Ukrainian National  Assembly-Ukrainian National Self-Defense] and two from the UKRP  (Stepan Khmara and another Khmara supporter, and even he is  fairly moderate).    On the other hand, Galicia produced a fair number of  moderate  candidates. The largest numbers of mandates were received by  candidates from Rukh--Yaroslav Kendzyor, Mikhail Kosiv, Oleh  Lavrinovich, Les Tanyuk, Bogdan Boyko, Boris Kozhin, Andrey  Zarudnyy, and others.    Both Ihor Yukhnovskyy and Viktor Pynzenyk were elected in  Galicia along with other centrist politicians.    [Rukh-press] Repeat elections will be held in 112 districts.  Do you hold out the hope that the democratic forces will still  unite in order to acquire approximately 10 more mandates?    [Chornovil] We must look at things realistically. What are  "democratic forces"? If democracy is a matter of bringing one  another to our knees then I am against it. We have already  exhibited that kind of "democracy"....    [Rukh-press] Radio Liberty and UTN have reported that you  supported Ivan Plyushch's candidacy for the post of president...    [Chornovil] This "gift" was foisted off on us by the  Ukrainian service of Radio Liberty without checking the  information received from Russian sources. We have not supported  anyone yet. Rukh did not nominate its own candidate since it  considers presidential elections unnecessary until the functions  and status of the president are determined. Incidentally, it is  apparent from the elections to the Supreme Council that we can  significantly influence the course of the presidential campaign.  We not only put through 30 of our own candidates but also  stopped several dozen of the most odious communist candidates,  sometimes at the price of allowing our own candidates to lose...    From Vyacheslav Chornovil's speech at the Rukh meeting  on 16 April:    "I think that today the most dangerous enemies of the  Ukrainian state and hence enemies of Rukh are not even the  communists, who are living out their historical age through  inertia, fed by the blind social protest of the eastern regions.  Our biggest enemy today is the Interregional Reform Bloc [MBR]  headed by Kuchma-Grinev, who are not yet very well known to  everyone.    They are closely linked to the local nomenklatura, they  have funds and support, including propaganda, from Russia, and  they exploit pro-Russian slogans, which are very popular in the  eastern part of Ukraine today. Finally, they have a leader who  knows what he wants: to seize power. And when it comes to this  they have no concern about either methods or people, surrounding  themselves with people who are not without talent but who are  cynical and greedy and who would sell not only Ukraine but even  their own mothers for the sake of Mammon and power.    In a year or two this political force, which is not  very appreciable today (incidentally, its leader is bucking for  the presidency...) could become the strongest anti-Ukrainian  grouping in our state. And we must oppose this MBR wave, like  the communists, today, since tomorrow will be too late."    [Rukh-press] Many people accuse you of being on the side of  Leonid Kravchuk, who is also against early presidential  elections...    [Chornovil] Is it not possible for our positions to converge  at some point? This still does not mean that we are not in  opposition to the president. It is simply that Kravchuk is  thinking correctly in this case. His motives are another matter.  He does not want to leave his chair and we do not want to fight  for an empty chair. Nobody has abolished the laws of formal  logic. Either for Kravchuk or for Chornovil.    ...But--it is not the same for me.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Phisit Li-atham, director of the Bank of Thailand  [BOT] Governor's Office, has said that the increase in the  country's 1993 total exports exceeded the target. The increase  in the fourth quarter, in particular, was 18.8 percent, compared  to an average of 13.1 percent for the whole year. The total  value of 1993 exports was 922 billion baht. He attributed the  rise to the economic recovery of Thailand's trading partners,  especially the United States; the removal of Thailand from the  U.S. Priority Foreign Country (PFC) watchlist; and the  appreciation of the yen.    Phisit revealed that the total value of the country's 1993  imports was 1.143 trillion baht, an increase of 12 percent over  the previous year. The value of oil imports increased slightly  due to the fall in the price of crude oil. The value of non-  petroleum imports was 1.0758 trillion baht, an increase of 12  percent. The target had been 11.6 percent. Meanwhile, the  current account balance suffered a deficit of 2.030 trillion  baht by the middle of 1993, or approximately 6.8 percent of GDP.  The real deficit at year's end, however, was only 1.710  trillion baht -- only 5.5 percent of GDP -- 30 billion below the  anticipated figure.    Phisit said: "The increase in exports, coupled with the  reduced current account balance deficit, might result in the  readjustment of the 1993 economic growth rate and the prediction  for this year."    Phisit noted that the influx of capital funds was very high.  In particular, investment capital in the stock market rose seven  to eight times, from 14.104 billion baht in 1992 to 118.192  billion baht in 1993. Foreigners' baht bank accounts amounted  to 109.365 billion baht, up from only 55.275 billion baht the  previous year. The year 1993 saw Thai private firms selling as  much as 50.579 billion baht in debentures to mobilize foreign  capital, up from the previous year's figure of 2.592 billion  baht.    It was reported that the 7.5 percent economic growth rate  calculated for 1993 has to be adjusted to 8.1 or 8.2 percent  because of the increase in exports and the decline in the  current account imbalance.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev 23 April TASS -- The press service of the  Ukrainian Defence Ministry circulated the following statement:    Talks were held between the Ukrainian and Russian military  delegations in Sevastopol on 21-22 April. The aim of the talks  was to examine issues on the implementtion of the agreement on a  gradual settlement of Black Sea Fleet problems, to wit: division  of warships and vessels as well as their temporary separate  basing.    Guided by a flexible and constructive position and seeking  to  find a realistic and mutually acceptable solution of existing  problems, the Ukrainian side suggested a stage-by-stage approach  to their settlement and put forth several possible versions.    Despite the initial considerable difference in approaches of  the sides to quantitative indexes of the fleet, the Russian side  tried to lessen the Black Sea Fleet's sea-going forces by more  than 50 per cent. The substantiated position of the Ukrainian  side made it possible to agree all the main quantitative  parameters, including the list of Black sea Fleet craft as well  as warships and vessels, which should compose a Ukrainian Navy.    At the same time, the sides managed to settle the problem of  a temporary base of the Russian Navy on the Ukrainian territory.  Guided by the need for disengaging the two countries' fleets,  provided for by the Russian-Ukrainian agreement of 1994, the  Ukrainian side offered several versions, including separate  deployment of the Ukrainian and Russian Navies at various  facilities in Sevastopol.    The Russian side insisted that the Russian Navy should be  based at all the Crimean facilities, while the Ukrainian Navy --  outside the peninsula. The Ukrainian delegation justifiably  showed that it is impossible to create a viable Ukrainian navy  without Crimean bases.    Nevertheless, Russia's approaches were immutable. Moreover,  unwilling to heed common sense and to understand Ukraine's  legitimate position concerning the deployment of the Ukrainian  Navy on its own territory, the Russian delegation stopped the  talks and disappeared without any explanation.    This happened at a time when experts tried to register the  approved parameters and provisions which were numerous by that  time.    The press service of the Ukrainian Defence Ministry  expresses  regret over the conduct of the Russian delegation, not meeting  norms of international negotiating ethics. This is even more  deplorable, since real outlines for settling Black Sea Fleet  problems became more evident after the last meeting between the  Ukrainian and Russian presidents.    The Ukrainian Defence Ministry imposes the entire  responsibility for the disruption of the talks on the Russian  side and reports its readiness to continue the negotiations at  any time.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Provisions to assure that the control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  also apply to major stationary sources of PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  precursors, except where the Administrator determines that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  levels which exceed the NAAQS in the area. See sections 172(c), 188, and 189 of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some provisions are due at a later date. States with initial moderate PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment areas were required to submit a permit program for the construction and operation of new and modified major stationary sources of PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by June 30, 1992 (see section 189(a)). Such States also were to submit contingency measures by November 15, 1993, that become effective without further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to achieve RFP or to attain the PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. See section 172(c)(9) and 57 FR 13510&hyph;13512 and 57 FR 13543&hyph;13544.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. This Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is approving the Libby PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP, which includes the Lincoln County Air Pollution Control Program, as revised by the State of Montana on March 19, 1993, and submitted by the Governor of Montana to EPA on May 24, 1993, with the exception of contingency measures. Final technical corrections to the SIP were sent to EPA with a letter dated June 3, 1994. This submittal replaced earlier submittals, detailed as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Libby PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP was originally adopted by the Montana Board of Health and Environmental Sciences (MBHES) on November 15, 1991, and submitted to EPA by the Governor on November 25, 1991. To address deficiencies identified by EPA, commitments were adopted by the State after a public hearing on December 21, 1992, and submitted to EPA on January 13, 1993, as additional tasks to be completed to correct the deficiencies in the Libby and statewide SIP. The commitments relevant to the moderate PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment area SIP requirements due November 15, 1991, were fulfilled through SIP revisions adopted by the MBHES on March 19, 1993, and submitted by the Governor of Montana to EPA on May 24, 1993. In his cover letter, the Governor said that this May 24, 1993, submittal should replace the documents submitted in November 1991. Final technical corrections to the SIP were sent to EPA in a letter dated June 3, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The May 24, 1993, submittal also included contingency measure provisions. In a May 27, 1994, letter from Douglas M. Skie (EPA) to Jeff Chaffee (Montana Air Quality Bureau, MAQB), EPA advised the State that additional language concerning triggering of the contingency measures would be needed in the local regulations. EPA will propose separate action on the contingency measures once the State has incorporated the necessary changes, and submitted the revised SIP element to EPA. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The State is working with the local governments to amend the Lincoln County Air Pollution Control Plan to address EPA's concerns with the contingency measure trigger language. The State expects to incorporate the changes into the Montana SIP and submit a SIP revision to EPA during the fall of 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State has fulfilled all remaining commitments. EPA is preparing separate actions on State submissions which satisfy commitments relating to Montana's operating permit program, and to Montana's New Source Review and Prevention of Serious Deterioration regulations and PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission test methods. These items do not impact the attainment or maintenance demonstrations, credited control strategies in the Libby PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SIP, or other federal Clean Air Act SIP requirements for the Libby moderate PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment area due to EPA on November 15, 1991. A more detailed discussion of these commitments can be found in the Technical Support Document (TSD) for this action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565-66). In today's action, EPA is granting approval of those elements of the Libby PM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  plan that were due on November 15, 1991, and submitted by the State on May 24, 1993, with final technical corrections dated June 3, 1994. EPA believes that the Libby plan meets the applicable requirements of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A.

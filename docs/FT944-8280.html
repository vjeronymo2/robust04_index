			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Personal View: Balanced ticket for business and greens The delicate balance of power between UK industry and its adversaries in the green lobby may be on the point of being upset. A draft Bill establishing the Environment Agency, which absorbs Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution (HMIP), the National Rivers Authority (NRA) and the waste regulation functions of local authorities, contains a loosely worded clause requiring the agency to take account of the costs and benefits of its actions. While the business community welcomes this as a recognition of reality, others fear it opens the way for polluters to block moves to protect the environment. But even if the new agency's statutory role is weaker than many environmentalists hoped, environment secretary John Gummer's claim that there will be no place for busybodies may prove premature. Most of the problems business faces in meeting environmental standards are not caused by too tight a statutory definition of the duties of HMIP or the NRA. They arise more often from ill-considered, or illogical, directives proposed by the European Commission - and from the tendency of regulators to measure their success mainly in terms of prosecutions. The cost of waste disposal, for example, which industry and households alike must bear, may rise substantially in the next few years. This will not be because of the actions of any British regulator but because the European landfill directive threatens the cheapest method of waste disposal in the UK. The directive, which may be forced through despite British objections, ignores the geological and other characteristics which make landfill more acceptable in the UK than elsewhere in Europe. Equally unnecessary is the burden imposed on British farmers by immediate implementation of the nitrates directive. This enforces standards for drinking water which have been arbitrarily chosen by Brussels in defiance of World Health Organisation recommendations. No scientific or medical evidence exists to support them and they are now belatedly being questioned by other bureaucrats within the European Commission. Since the Environment Agency's role will be to enforce standards but not to set them, the deregulators should concentrate on persuading Britain's European partners to measure environmental quality in the broadest sense. A draft directive on integrated pollution controls is now under negotiation. From the point of view of British industry it is crucial that the principle of BATNEEC - best available technology not entailing excessive cost - should be built into this directive. This principle, already widely used by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution, achieves a compromise between the needs of industry and the demands of the greens. It provides a valuable safeguard for business against the continental preference for rigid emission standards. An agency strong enough to command the confidence of the more realistic environmentalists could use the experience gained by HMIP for the benefit of the environment while also protecting UK employers against meddlesome bureaucracy and the ravages of Brussels. A constructive dialogue between the agency and those whom it regulates should prevent the imposition by over-zealous officials of burdens on business never intended by government or legislators. In any event, it is doubtful how far industry itself wants to water down the aims of the environmental lobby. Unlike the extra costs to employers of the Social Chapter, which simply destroys jobs by undermining the competitive position of those companies which have to carry them, investment in higher environmental standards can bring commercial advantages. Customers, especially younger ones, may prefer products and services supplied in an environmentally responsible way. Employees, particularly those with scarce skills, are easier to retain when offered a good working and living environment. From a national viewpoint, countries with high environmental standards will attract investment in the high value-added industries which we want our children and grandchildren to work in. The challenge for both the agency and the pressure groups is to harness the resurgence of interest in the environment and build on initiatives such as the chemical industry's responsible care programme. Business must show commitment to continuous environmental improvement, using systems capable of being externally verified and promote more environmental reporting and audit. In the long term, dilution of the agency's statutory role does little for either business or the environment. The author is a former UK environment minister</p>

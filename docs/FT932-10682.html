			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Foreign buyers fancy a spring fling in gilts: Sara Webb asks how long overseas demand for UK government bonds will last FOREIGN investors have returned to the UK government bond market this spring after a noticeable absence. Overseas purchases of gilts amounted to Pounds 1.134bn in March, up from Pounds 1.031bn in February and triple the month's sales to UK buyers. With a forecast Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) of Pounds 50bn for 1993-94, the Bank needs to attract as many buyers to the gilt market as possible - both domestic and overseas. The renewed foreign interest this spring has been sparked by three things: the potential to make currency gains as sterling strengthened against other currencies; the potential to make capital gains as gilt prices rallied on hopes of falling interest rates; and the availability of relatively high yields compared with those on other government bonds. While sterling was a member of the European exchange rate mechanism, foreign investors played an important role in helping to fund the PSBR. They held between 13 per cent and 17 per cent of total UK government debt. With sterling in the ERM, they felt the exchange-rate risk was much lower, and they expected a gradual cut in UK interest rates as inflation fell, resulting in a rally in gilt prices. However, foreigners got cold feet as sterling came under intense speculative pressure in August and early September. The outflow sparked worries that the government would face difficulties in funding the growing PBSR in 1992-93 and 1993-94. The Bank's latest figures suggest the tide may have turned. Some dealers claim they have noticed healthy foreign demand for gilts since February, prompted by hopes that sterling would appreciate against other currencies, especially the D-Mark. Sterling fell to DM2.3275 in February, but has risen, closing yesterday at DM2.48. Mr Kim Thomsen, head of fixed income at fund management group Danske Invest, expects sterling to appreciate to DM2.50-DM2.60. 'We look at both the currency and the return on the bond side when we are investing in the bond markets. I think when Germany cuts rates, sterling will strengthen so the currency would get an extra kick.' Mr Michael Korn, head of bond portfolio management at Deutsche Investment Trust, Dresdner Bank's investment arm, says 'Sterling is still interesting for German investors because of the potential for currency appreciation. We see sterling in the DM2.45-DM2.55 range.' Japanese investors also have been buying UK securities - both equities and gilts. Mr Chris Dillow, economist at Nomura International, says: 'The strength of the yen against all currencies, particularly sterling, has acted as a force for outward investment from Japan.' Mr Malcolm Roberts, head of global bond research at UBS, says that even though gilt yields have declined, they are still relatively high compared with those in other bond markets. For Japanese investors, 10-year gilt yields of 8 per cent compare very favourably with domestic debt yields of 4.33 per cent. 'I could see one more cut in the UK if the economy remains weak or if Germany starts to cut rates very fast' says Mr Kim Thomsen of Danske Invest. 'The Bundesbank could cut rates very rapidly once they realise how deep the recession is in Germany.' However, there are plenty of foreign investors who believe that the gilt market is now less attractive than other government bond markets, especially since recent economic data suggest the UK may be pulling out of recession, reducing the chance of further interest-rate cuts. 'The potential for low rates is not too exciting' claims Mr Korn of DIT. 'In a European context the UK is well ahead in the cycle, so the potential for lower rates is less than in Italy and Spain.' Mr Martin Wooller, head of fixed income at the UK operations of Fidelity, the US fund managers, thinks there are other, better opportunities, 'because of the high real interest rates available elsewhere'. 'Once the ERM tensions have gone, Italy and Spain may be able to lower rates, so the high-yielding markets become more attractive,' says Mr Andreas Johannsen, portfolio manager at DWS, the investment management arm of Deutsche Bank and Germany's largest fund management group. Longer-term, investors worry that inflation in the UK could start to pick up again. 'The effects of devaluation will come through at some stage,' says Mr Johannsen. 'Inflation is not a problem now but it will be a problem later this year.' An additional worry is the prospect of heavy supply of gilts in the next year. The Bank of England has said it will hold an auction roughly every month, offering between Pounds 2bn and Pounds 4bn of stock at each sale. 'The amount of issuance that must be placed is quite daunting, especially if there are no further interest rate cuts' says Mr Johannsen. Given the freedom on movement of capital, foreign investors can pick and choose their financial markets with ease. While the gilt market has held the foreigners' gaze in recent weeks, longer-term it may prove difficult to keep them constant. Lex, Page 18</p>

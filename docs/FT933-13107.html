			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: A who's who of Euro-sceptics - Profile of the key Tory rebels in the Maastricht debate NONE OF tomorrow's potential Tory rebels is saying publicly how they will vote. But ministers' attentions are focused on whittling away at the group of 30 or so Euro-sceptics who voted against the government at key points in the Maastricht bill's passage through the Commons. If just 10 of them rebel in tomorrow's vote and no opposition party breaks ranks the government will be defeated. If the Ulster Unionists abstain - they are seen as the party most likely to be persuaded not to oppose the government - the number of rebels needed to defeat the government would rise to 14. Should the nine Unionist MPs vote with the government then 19 rebels would secure an opposition victory. By last night, with relentlessly increasing pressure from government forces, helped by reformed rebels and constituency associations, some Euro-sceptics were showing signs of peeling off. But there remains a hard core which even the whips do not expect to coax into the government lobbies. These are the ringleaders of the group that has stuck together throughout the tortuous Maastricht committee stage, agreeing generally to vote as a block in line with their self-styled whips' instructions. The rebel rump still appears to include these MPs: Mr Bill Cash, once described as the Tory party's white cliff of Dover, the extravagantly prolix MP for Stafford, has made a key contribution to the rebel campaign by providing the elegant Westminster town house for its nerve centre. A qualified solicitor, he spoke for more than 2 1/2 hours during the first debate on the Maastricht bill. Sir Teddy Taylor, perhaps the canniest of the hardcore Euro-sceptics and MP for Southend East who reached the pinnacle of his political career as a junior Scottish Office minister in the 1970s. A logical and persuasive speaker, he demonstrated a willingness to rebel against the government in the 1980s, particularly on EC-related issues. Mr Roger Knapman, the MP for Stroud, is a chartered surveyor and farmer who has toiled away in the engine room of the Euro-sceptic campaign almost unnoticed by the outside world. His low-profile political career was previously marked by his ultra-loyalty. Mr James Cran, one of the rebel whips and the soft-spoken but determined MP for Beverley, is another of the unsung stalwarts of the Euro-sceptic campaign. The Maastricht process has brought out a little-suspected and dry sense of humour in this former CBI regional director. Mr Christopher Gill is the other key Euro-sceptic organiser. This livestock farmer exudes the courtly air of an old-style English gentleman. He is nonetheless sometimes known as 'the butcher of Ludlow', the Shropshire constituency he represents, in deference to his status as the man behind Gill's sausages. Mrs Teresa Gorman, one of the Essex Tories, is a trenchant campaigner for more female MPs and among the most colourful Euro-sceptics in dress and character. The MP for Billericay, she also criticised Mr John Major for failing to appoint a woman to his first cabinet. Mr Michael Spicer, the cultured MP for Worcestershire South, served as a junior minister in the transport and energy departments during the 1980s. He was dropped by Mr Major when he became prime minister in November 1990. Mr John Carlisle, the drollest Euro-sceptic, has been Luton North MP for 14 years. He is best-known as a staunch long-term defender of South Africa. Mr Tony Marlow, a stocky sergeant-major-type, has a record of rebelling against the government during a 14-year parliamentary career. He shared with Mr Cash the accolade of being the Tory rebel most likely to get under Mr Michael Morris's skin while his fellow Northampton MP was presiding over the Maastricht committee stage in his capacity as chairman of ways and means. Mr Richard Shepherd, the MP for Aldridge-Brownhills, oozes impassioned sincerity in every utterance about Maastricht. He is the only MP to list searching for the Home Service on the wireless among his interests. Mr Nicholas Winterton, the MP for Macclesfield, has had so many run-ins with the government since being forced to stand down last year as chairman of the Commons health committee that government whips jokingly regard him as virtually an opposition member. The interests of British manufacturers is another of his preoccupations. Seventeen other Tory MPs have also defied the government on Maastricht at critical moments and these will also be high on the whips' lists of MPs whom they need to win over.</p>

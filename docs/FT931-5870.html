			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Law reform group says system failing investors THE SYSTEM of investor protection introduced by the 1986 Financial Services Act is failing small investors, according to a report by Justice, the all-party law reform pressure group. The system is unnecessarily complex, incoherent and not easily comprehensible, Justice says. The root of the problem lies in the nature of the system itself with its fragmented regulatory organisations and the inevitable confusion in the mind of the small investor. Acronyms of the self-regulatory organisations such as Lautro, Fimbra and Imro 'have the ring of biblical incantations and are likely to be incomprehensible to the small investor', the report says. Lautro regulates the life insurance and unit trust industry, Fimbra is responsible for financial advisers and money brokers and Imro handles investment management. At best the fact that a financial services company is 'authorised' by one of these bodies may 'lull the investor and his advisers into a sense of security that the investment is safe and sound,' the report adds. The proposal to set up a Personal Investment Authority for all retail financial services designed to absorb Lautro and Fimbra must be welcomed as 'a major step towards the improvement of the system', Justice says. But it adds that it is doubtful whether the system will ever be effective in eliminating fraud and dishonesty. The time is ripe for a more objective and independent assessment of the self-regulatory system. 'It is short-sighted to stagger from one modification of one part of the system to another without considering the efficacy of the system as a whole,' the pressure group says. Its report outlines four minimum requirements for protecting small investors: access to reliable expert advice; honest, accurate information about products and reliable advertising and promotional literature; quick, effective compensation if things go wrong; and, a comprehensive but clear regulatory structure. Justice calls for: Simplification of the system and greater consumer representation on the Securities and Investment Board and the other regulatory bodies; Higher levels of compensation to be increased and backed by an independent financial services ombudsman; Stricter standards of financial advertising; Personal liability for directors of investment business companies; Uniform protection throughout the European Community.</p>

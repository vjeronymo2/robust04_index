			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Boeing has flat third quarter Boeing, the world's largest aircraft manufacturer, yesterday reported third-quarter earnings and sales virtually unchanged from a year ago. The group blamed a fall in commercial aircraft deliveries, increased debt expense and lower corporate investment income, which offset the positive impact of a lower federal income tax rate. Although Mr Frank Shrontz, chairman, forecast that commercial jet deliveries this year would be slightly higher than forecast, at 265, he said that year-end sales would still be about 15 per cent below 1993's total. Mr Shrontz also warned that sales would remain at 'relatively low levels' through next year, and until the global economic conditions and the financial health of the world's airlines improved. On a more upbeat note, however, the Boeing chairman said there were already signs of an economic pick-up in Europe and Asia which, combined with the sustained recovery in the US, augured well for the group's future. He also said there was evidence that the main travel markets of the world were also showing signs of recovery. For the third quarter, Boeing's net income was Dollars 185m, or 54 cents a share, compared with Dollars 189m, or 56 cents, in the same period of 1993. Sales during the three months totalled Dollars 5.1bn, against Dollars 5.2bn a year earlier.</p>

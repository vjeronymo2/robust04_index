And this was reflected in the State of  the Union message that he read out Tuesday [25 January] at the  joint session of both houses.    The President seemed optimistic, confident, and resolutely  determined to achieve by the end of the year objective number  one for 1994 -- the introduction of a free health care program  for all Americans, which would mark a historic turning point  similar to the adoption of Roosevelt's first social measures in  the 1930's. The bill, submitted by the government and drafted  by First Lady Hillary Clinton herself, doubtlessly will undergo  modifications during its debate in Congress, but Clinton has  already threatened that any version that does not embody the  principle of health care for all will be vetoed. At the same  time, the President tried to avoid a tone of ideological  controversy and to make the White House impartial in its role as  guarantor of national interests.    On some issues, such as the fight against crime and the  reform of the welfare system, he did not hesitate to espouse the  Republicans' traditional arguments. Clinton's intention thus  was to stress the "centrist" position, the plataform on which he  was elected in November 1992 and which many accused him of  having relinquished after his first year in government by  falling back on the theories of the "liberal" left.    In this context the point on which the President focused his  entire speech is all the more significant -- that is, the need  for a "return to traditional values" (comprising the three  elements of family, community, and work) that was another of the  themes used by the Republican Party in the past. Its  endorsement by Clinton confirms his determination to tackle the  United States' problems on a new, realistic and not ideological,  basis. This approach has received the approval of a large  majority of the country, and the opinion poll held immediately  after the speech shows that 84 percent of Americans agree with  the President's approach.    The task of every State of the Union message is twofold --  to  indicate to the country what direction the government intends to  pursue in the year ahead and to define the legislative program  that it will submit to the houses. Although the plans to step  up measures against crime will be approved easily with the  support of both parties, the conflict over health care is almost  bound to continue throughout the year. The Republicans accept  some parts of it, but sharply reject others, and it will be  necessary to find a compromise.    The part of the speech devoted to foreign policy confirms  that this remains the sector in which Clinton moves with the  least confidence and the greatest difficulty, lacking a clear  vision of the relationship between theory and reality. Apart  from the very vigorous reaffirmation of the determination to  maintain the United States' international leadership role and  the commitment to continue along this path, the trouble with the  picture the President presented to America in the present  international situation is that it was either too generic or  falsely optimistic.    The principle on which Clinton wants to base foreign policy  -- "the strengthening of the democratic area in the world," that  is, a kind of new Wilsonism -- seems like an empty slogan devoid  of both a realistic perception of the problems and a consistent  strategy. The best example is provided by the sharp  deterioration of the crisis in Russia. In this connection the  President repeated the old theory about the desire to facilitate  the process of reforms in Russia and urged Congress to join this  effort. But he did not even mention the increasingly serious  threats now presented to Washington by Yeltsin's return to an  inflationist economic stance and the resurgence of  neoimperialist nostalgia.    An example of this former threat came with yesterday's  confirmation of the resignation of Economy Minister Boris  Fedorov, one of the reformist leaders; while an example of the  latter is the new Russian parliament's vote against Western  military measures against Serbia. Neither of these alarming  developments was mentioned in Clinton's speech, though he spoke  at length about aspects that have become entirely marginal, such  as nuclear and space agreements with Russia. With regard to the  Middle East, the President reaffirmed, resolutely but obviously  in general terms (as, for that matter, he did with almost all  aspects for foreign policy), support for the current peace  process between Israel and the Palestinians, while admitting  that we face a "long and difficult road, but one which America  intends to pursue with supportive action." The Bosnian question  was mentioned almost in passing, and the same went for the  Somali crisis and the Haitian problem. Despite the possibility  that this will cause difficulties in the future, for the present  the outlook looks promising for Clinton. Of course, his  prospects of success depend to a large extent on the evolution  of the situation that has favored him hitherto. The President  did not hesitate to attribute the major economic recovery to his  last year's policy, entailing a deficit reduction, a fall in  interest rates, and creation of new jobs. In the belief that  for the present he has won the "economic battle," Clinton did  not put forward any new initiatives in this field, counting on  the fact that the expansive trend now set in motion will  continue through 1994. For that matter, most experts agree with  him, although they note the possibility of a clash between the  White House and the Federal Reserve over the issue of interest  rates. The Fed, anxious to nip in the bud any return of  inflation, wants to raise them, but Clinton opposes it. For the  present the future holds two dangers for the President: The  first is an exacerbation of the Russian crisis, restoring a  climate of instability throughout East Europe; and the second  would be the emergence of further disclosures in the Whitewater  case. It has not yet affected Clinton's popularity, and the  information that has emerged hitherto has been received by the  country with a certain degree of irritation. However, it  remains to be seen whether during the inquiry that is starting  now there will emerge further disclosures capable of changing  people's minds about the situation.</p>

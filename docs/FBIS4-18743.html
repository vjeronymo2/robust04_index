			<p>BFN     [Text] In Rwanda, Kigali Airport has been opened and, in  principle, Belgian planes should be able to land there. They  have obtained the authorization to land from the Rwandan  authorities. Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes, however, has  dampened the optimism:    [Begin recording] [Claes] Listen, we have received the  authorization from the new government, but as concerns the  operation on the ground, it is the military command which will  decide. I cannot give you more ample details.    [Unidentified correspondent] Is this authorization serious  and reliable?    [Claes] Well, I could not tell you that we had the  authorization if we had not taken all possible precautions. We  still have a slight reservation: I cannot give you a 100  percent guarantee that the Rwandan troops at the airport are  obeying the authorities, but I am still quite confident.    [Correspondent] Was a parachute landing ever considered?    [Claes] No, absolutely not.    [Correspondent] So you will only land in a specific  operation?    [Claes] Yes. [end recording]    Willy Claes is therefore dampening the hope that all Belgian  nationals will rapidly be evacuated from Kigali. We will judge  on the spot, he said, when the first Belgian planes approach the  runway to land. Willy Claes also said that it has not been  ruled out that some Belgians should be evacuated in other  planes, French or American, in the context of a coordinated  operation, and taken to Nairobi and Bujumbura, where they would  then be taken over by Belgian soldiers. Willy Claes refused to  give any more details on the operation, but added that only  those who wish to leave would be evacuated. Those who remain  will do so at their own risk.</p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Utd Carriers warns again as too little is now too much Events at United Carriers took a surreal turn yesterday as the parcel delivery group issued its second profit warning since going public in February. It blamed the first setback on too few parcels; the second on too many. Yesterday's warning was accompanied by a boardroom shake-up which sees Mr Michael Howe resign as group managing director and Mr Allan Binks step down as chairman while remaining chief executive. Mr Binks said: 'We have made a right mess of our return to the stock market and none of us can completely absolve ourselves.' The company warned that profits in the second half would be below the first half's Pounds 1.2m. The shares fell 15p to 79p, half the flotation price of 153p, as analysts cut full year forecasts from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 2m. In May, when forecasts were Pounds 4.8m, the company warned it had suffered a sharp fall in parcel volumes in April. In response it started an aggressive selling campaign. 'In the space of a few days a the end of September volumes shot up and we were unable to introduce new resources quickly enough,' said Mr Binks. Operating costs rose sharply as the company was forced to hire new vehicles and take on temporary labour to clear the backlog. Compensation has yet to be agreed for Mr Howe, who has a two year rolling contract on a salary of Pounds 95,000. He will continue to manage the parcel business until his unnamed replacement arrives in January. Mr Binks said his own Pounds 140,000 salary would not be cut in line with his reduced responsibilities. The new chairman is Mr Doublas Rogers, chairman of Newman Tonks. The company said it would pay a final dividend of 3.3p 'in the absence of unforeseen circumstances'. The flotation was sponsored by Lazard Brothers with brokers UBS.</p>

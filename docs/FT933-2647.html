			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: RMC little changed at Pounds 61.6m - Rise for UK as prices hold firm and expansion in Germany RMC GROUP, the concrete producer, reported a slight decline in first-half pre-tax profits from Pounds 62.1m to Pounds 61.6m despite higher operating profits in both the UK, where ready mixed concrete prices firmed, and Germany. Turnover from continuing operations in the six months to June 30 increased by 11 per cent to Pounds 1.56bn (Pounds 1.4bn) including Pounds 71.7m from acquisitions in Germany. Operating profits were Pounds 81.3m (Pounds 78.7m) including Pounds 5.8m from the acquisitions. Over the past 2 1/2 years the group has invested between Pounds 270m and Pounds 280m in its cement operations in eastern Germany. This is reflected in an increase in net interest paid to Pounds 23.2m (Pounds 18.5m). The merger of the east and west German operations in April enabled RMC to take advantage of substantial tax reliefs and incentives available in eastern Germany. Overseas tax fell to Pounds 15.1m (Pounds 24.2m). The overall charge dropped to Pounds 16.3m (Pounds 26m), a rate of 26 per cent which was expected to be maintained for at least five years. Earnings per share, after allowing for higher minorities, increased to 13.4p (12.1p) with about 1p of the gain reflecting currency movements. The interim dividend is maintained at 6.6p per share. In the UK delivered volumes of ready mixed concrete and aggregates fell further with sand and gravel volumes down by 2 or 3 per cent. However operating profits increased to Pounds 14m (Pounds 8.8m) on turnover of Pounds 452.1m (Pounds 440.9m) reflecting the cost reductions achieved over the last year and improved results from those activities associated with the housing sector. In addition RMC said small increases of up to 3 per cent in the price of ready mixed concrete in the first half had held. Overseas, Mr Peter Young, group managing director, said construction activity in Germany continued at a high level because of strong demand for housing in the west and an expansion of building work in the east. Overall operating profits of the expanded German operations increased to Pounds 50.4m (Pounds 40.5m) on turnover of Pounds 654.6m (Pounds 503.7m). However elsewhere in the EC, with the exception of the Netherlands, there was an overall decline in profitability to Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 23.6m) on turnover which declined to Pounds 305.5m (Pounds 334.2m). The decline was most marked in France and Spain where volumes fell by 11 per cent and 19 per cent respectively. Activities in the south-eastern US states showed a significant improvement but an associated undertaking in northern California continued to experience difficult trading conditions. Exceptionally competitive markets reduced profits in Austria and the group's Israeli concrete subsidiary was affected by labour problems. But the Israeli roadstone operations, which are an associated undertaking, boosted profits. See Lex</p>

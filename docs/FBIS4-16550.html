			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Naryshkin] </F>   [Text] Zagreb April 16 TASS -- Russian envoy Vitaliy  Churkin has called for establishing a demilitarised zone around  Gorazde similar to that in Sarajevo, Sarajevo television said on  Saturday.    Churkin said that this would involve the withdrawal of heavy  artillery from the 20-kilometer security zone around the city  and deployment of U.N. peace-keeping troops in the region.  "This is the only way out of the current chaos," he said.    Bosnia-Herzegovina's leaders Alija Izetbegovic and Haris  Silajdzic demanded at a meeting with U.N. envoy Yasushi Akashi  guarantees of immediate cease-fire around Gorazde. Otherwise  Akashi should guarantee that Serb positions will be subjected to  "energetic air strikes," Izetbegovic said.</p>

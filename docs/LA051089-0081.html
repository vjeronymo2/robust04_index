			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH VISIT TO DRUG SITE  </P> <P> In response to "Bush Takes Anti-Drug Effort to Smuggling Site," Part I, April  26:  </P> <P> President Bush stated there was a need for entertainment industry figures to  become more involved in drug fighting. Once the drugs are on the streets, there  is nothing the entertainment industry, local police departments or anyone else  can do to eliminate it. Action must start and take place at the top, and the  top is the White House.  </P> <P> If our President is not willing to take action against countries trafficking  drugs into this country, what action is he expecting the local community to  take?  </P> <P> Action starts with the change of command; stop putting on a front and take  action by whatever means necessary.  </P> <P> CHARLES CLAXTON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: F&amp;C aims to raise at least Pounds 30m - Issue News Foreign &amp; Colonial Ventures is to launch two parallel venture capital funds, the Private Equity investment trust and a limited partnership with the same investment objectives. The combined funds aim to raise at least Pounds 30m. They will invest in small to medium-sized unquoted companies, mainly management buy-outs and companies seeking to expand or make acquisitions, rather than start-up companies. The two will have initially identical portfolios, in proportion to the amount of money raised by each. After the initial investment period, the proceeds of realisations from the limited partnership will be returned to investors, whereas the investment trust will reinvest all proceeds. Both funds will have an initial life of 10 years, but the investment trust can be extended by shareholders' vote after six years. Shares will be issued partly paid, with 50 per cent payable immediately, and 50 per cent in November 1995. There will be no public offer, and the minimum subscription in the placing will be Pounds 20,000. Mr James Nelson, managing director of Foreign &amp; Colonial Ventures, said there was evidence of demand for both types of investment structure, but the choice for investors preferring a quoted fund was limited.</p>

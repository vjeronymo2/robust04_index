			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NUCLEAR DUMP PLAN 'IN SERIOUS TROUBLE';  </P> <P> WASTE: BUSH ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS CONCEDE THEY WILL MISS DEADLINE FOR  OPENING SITE IN NEVADA. THE PLAN FACES LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS AND FIERCE  OPPOSITION FROM NEVADA POLITICIANS.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration, in a major setback to the nuclear industry, is  preparing to officially concede that it will be unable to meet its schedule for  opening a long-term dump for highly radioactive nuclear waste that has been  planned for Yucca Mountain in Nevada, Administration officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> "Progress hasn't been made with the site," a senior Administration official  said. "The program is in serious trouble."  </P> <P> The problems are twofold, both technical and political. On the technical level  "everyone, members of Congress, the executive branch, has known for some time  that there are serious problems" with meeting a deadline of 2003 for opening  the waste site, the official said.  </P> <P> On the political level, "you've got some Nevada politicians out there that have  staked their careers on stopping this thing," the official added.  </P> <P> The new delays may push back the opening of the waste site by three years,  according to Robert Loux, executive director of Nevada's Nuclear Waste Project  Office. Deputy Energy Secretary W. Henson Moore said the delays could be as  much as seven years beyond the 2003 date.  </P> <P> Several steps that would be necessary to put the waste site into business have  not yet been taken. For example, under legislation passed during the last year  of the Reagan Administration, the federal government is supposed to appoint a  negotiator to work out terms with Nevada for accepting the burden of housing  the nation's nuclear waste dump. So far, no action has been taken on that  appointment.  </P> <P> Finding a suitable site for a permanent nuclear waste facility has been a major  priority for the nuclear industry and for nuclear power supporters within the  Administration.  </P> <P> According to the Department of Energy plan, 70,000 metric tons of deadly waste  from commercial nuclear reactors and weapons plants would be buried 1,000 feet  under Yucca Mountain, 100 miles north of Las Vegas.  </P> <P> A 116-mile grid of tunnels in the mountain's volcanic rock would house the  waste repository. Steel canisters would hold the nuclear waste, which would  come by truck or rail for 26 years. The site would be then be sealed.  </P> <P> Federal officials have said the mountain's geology and its remote location in a  Nevada desert make it an ideal site for the waste dump. The rock must prevent  radioactive leakage from reaching the underground water table for 10,000 years,  when most of the radioactive elements will have decayed.  </P> <P> Some scientists, however, have questioned the mountain's stability because  several earthquake faults run through it. There is also concern about possible  volcanic activity in the area. And some scientists have said fractures in the  volcanic rock might allow moisture to seep through to the storage vault, where  it could corrode the steel waste canisters.  </P> <P> If this scenario occurred, it could introduce radioactive materials into the  water table, which stretches across the California border to Death Valley  National Monument, 25 miles to the west.  </P> <P> Energy Secretary James D. Watkins has been stymied in efforts to persuade  Nevada to grant the air- and land-use permits required to begin work sinking  exploratory shafts in the mountain to determine the geologic suitability of the  site. The Nevada Legislature also passed a bill earlier this year declaring  that no high-level nuclear waste could be buried in the state.  </P> <P> The delays will clearly compound waste storage problems already faced by the  nation's 114 commercial plants. Nuclear utilities have contributed nearly $4  billion toward construction of the dump.  </P> <P> With previous delays already postponing the estimated opening of the repository  for five years, operators at many of the plants are running out of storage  space for the deadly waste and have been forced to expand temporary facilities  for storing the waste on their property -- an expensive undertaking shouldered  by consumers.  </P> <P> Loux said the developments Tuesday amount to a major restructuring of the  Department of Energy's Yucca Mountain program.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Jenifer Warren contributed to this story.  </P></p>

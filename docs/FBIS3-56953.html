			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev, [no date as received] -- At a meeting with  journalists on 19 January, William Miller, the U.S. ambassador  to Ukraine, explained his vision of ways of implementing the  security guarantees given to Ukraine by the United States. "If  any state carries out an attack on Ukraine or makes territorial  claims on it, the United States will appeal to international  organizations such as the United Nations in order to protect  Ukraine," the U.S. ambassador noted. Talks on disarmament have  been tense in recent months. Their participants concentrated  special attention on three issues: Guarantees of Ukraine's  security, the forms and amounts of compensation for enriched  uranium contained in warheads, and the rendering of technical  and economic assistance for the dismantlement of nuclear  weapons.    Replying to questions from journalists, William Miller  stressed that of the $800 million, which the United States will  be granting for implementing the program of nuclear disarmament  of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine, our state will  receive $175 million. The United States also pledged to give  humanitarian and technical assistance to Ukraine. The  ambassador reported that a Ukrainian delegation will be leaving  for the United States next week, which would be engaged in  issues of coordinating U.S. assistance to Ukraine. At the end  of the meeting, William Miller expressed the hope that Russia  and other UN member states would adhere to the charter of this  organization.</p>

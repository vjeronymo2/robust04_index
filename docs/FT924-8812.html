			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / The CBI at Harrogate: Howard rejects call for planning code MR MICHAEL HOWARD, the environment secretary, yesterday rejected a call from the CBI for the government to produce an annual policy paper on land use and infrastructure planning. The plan forms one of the main proposals in the recent report of the CBI's planning task force which proposes a national policy framework for planning. The report says strategic failure to put such a policy in place has led to unacceptable but avoidable costs to British business and the economy. The CBI plan would draw up a framework for land use and infrastructure development over a five-year period, identifying priorities for the coming year. It also recommends that the Treasury should make a core funding commitment to back priority schemes identified by the five-year plan. But Mr Howard told the CBI conference it would be 'quite wrong' for the government to make promises which could not be delivered. He said: 'The government simply cannot offer a five-year commitment on infrastructure investment'. Mr Howard said he accepted industry needed more certainty in planning but emphasised there had been a 'radical overhaul' of the planning process in the last four years. The government already provided three-year public expenditure totals and annual road programme statements. These, combined with white papers, regional strategies and development plans meant, there was 'more certainty in planning than ever before'. Mr Howard echoed the recommendation of the CBI task force that business should work more closely with planning authorities at local level to help bring about recovery. Mr Ian Prosser, chairman of Bass and chairman of the task force, accepted that business could not leave land-use planning issues to the planning profession. 'Planners, government and business have tended to communicate by semaphore. Major decisions have been left for local debate in a strategic policy vacuum.' Mr Prosser said the planning system worked well for smaller applications but the real difficulty involved the costs, time-scales and conflicts generated by large business and infrastructure developments. Mr Prosser said the CBI, in recommending an integrated strategic framework, was not talking about central planning. It wanted the government to provide a policy lead by defining priorities within and between different government departments. He said many significant planning applications were in danger of being left for local decision in a partial policy vacuum. They should be considered within a clearly prioritised national framework. He said: 'The problem we face is that major business and infrastructure developments become bogged down in the pursuit of planning approval. This has substantial negative implications for business development and competitiveness.'</p>

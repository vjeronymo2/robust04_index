			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CORPS VOWS TO USE TREES OFFERED AS 'URBAN FOREST'  </P> <P> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Thursday it would find a way to use 1,000  trees being offered by a San Fernando Valley business association that has  launched a campaign -- without the Army's approval -- to grow an "urban forest"  in the Sepulveda Basin.  </P> <P> The Valley Industry and Commercial Assn. announced earlier this week that it  wanted to raise $150,000 to buy the trees for a 60-acre site along the basin's  northern edge, at Victory and Balboa boulevards, where a proposed cultural  center might be built.  </P> <P> The announcement caused confusion among officials from the Corps of Engineers,  which owns the flood-control basin, and the city of Los Angeles, which leases  the land for park use.  </P> <P> The association never asked permission to undertake a mass planting on the  site, federal and city officials said.  </P> <P> They also said there might not be enough irrigation and land to sustain that  many trees.  </P> <P> Thursday, however, the group planted a symbolic sycamore tree at the site and  the corps said it would make every effort to put future donations to use.  </P> <P> "You don't want to turn down 1,000 trees," said Ruth Villalobos, chief of the  corps' Environmental Resources Branch. "We'd be willing to work with them."  </P> <P> VICA has sent a fund-raising brochure to its 242 member corporations asking for  donations to buy camphor, jacaranda, California live oak and other varieties of  trees.  </P> <P> The association said it wanted to purchase the trees by next fall or spring.  </P> <P> Confusion between the association and government officials began when VICA said  the corps had approved the fund drive.  </P> <P> The corps denied giving any approval.  </P> <P> On Thursday, the association said it had a list of about 1,000 trees designated  by the corps specifically for the basin.  </P> <P> The corps, however, said the list had been drawn up for another community  organization interested in donating trees, park benches, water fountains and  other amenities to the park.  </P> <P> A VICA spokeswoman later confirmed that her group had not received the list  directly from the corps.  </P> <P> At this time, the 60-acre site where the trees would be planted is not  irrigated.  </P> <P> If the proposed arts center is built, a private group called the Cultural  Foundation, which is trying to fund the complex, would install a watering  system, Villalobos said.  </P> <P> The Arts Park L.A. project -- which could include theaters, workshops and  exhibit spaces -- will be debated at an upcoming public hearing and must be  approved by the corps and the city.  </P> <P> If the project is not built, the corps said it would irrigate the 60 acres  itself, ask the city to do so or find other places in the basin for the trees.  </P> <P> That task could take a number of years, a corps official said.  </P> <P> "We are committed to raising $150,000 to plant 1,000 trees in the basin," said  Laurie Golden, a VICA spokeswoman. "And we are excited and gratified that the  Army Corps of Engineers is going to help us make this happen."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Friday [22 April] the Bundestag  finally approved the compromise on the nursing-care insurance  with the overwhelming majority of the votes from the coalition  and Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] opposition.  Subject to the approval of the Bundesrat next Friday, which is  considered certain, the law can come into force on 1 January  1995.    FRG Labor Minister Norbert Bluem (Christian Democratic  Union)  said that the implementation of the law will depend on the good  will and dedication of many people. A law cannot replace human  readiness for help.    Rudolf Dressler, the SPD's chief negotiator, pointed out  that  his party has achieved considerable improvements during the  months of the mediation procedure between the Bundestag and the  Bundesrat. Now it is the business of the laender to keep the  promise of abolishing one public holiday to compensate for the  costs arising for the employers. Gisela Babel (Free Democratic  Party of Germany) said that it is to her party's credit that the  nursing-care insurance did "not" turn out to "be larger,  clumsier, and more expensive."    The Party of Democratic Socialism and the Alliance  90/Greens,  who had come out in favor of a nursing-care insurance finance  via taxes, expressed their disappointment.</p>

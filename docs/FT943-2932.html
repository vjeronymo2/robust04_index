			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Born again A licence to exist, if not to print money. Yesterday the Independent Television Commission announced that it would readvertise the frequency allotted to Britain's fifth terrestrial television channel. The long-awaited statement gives investors a second chance to bid for the licence, although it makes it no easier to judge its value. The ITC's statement follows the disarray of its last auction for Channel 5 two years ago. Then, it turned down the only bidder on doubts about shareholders' financial commitment to the consortium. Nonetheless, several groups still express interest; Pearson, the international media group which owns the Financial Times, has indicated it may join one. The government is right to give investors - and viewers - the opportunity. The form of the channel's programming is left open, but judging by the plans of potential bidders, Channel 5 could provide city-based television, in addition to the regional services of ITV and the British Broadcasting Corporation. Regional stations are a powerful flavour in the US programming mix, and one that would enrich British television. The channel will also give regional and national advertisers another route besides ITV to reach audiences, helping curb inflation in the cost of airtime. Ministers have rightly not succumbed to fears that, if Channel 5 were successful, it could jeopardise ITV franchises, some of which remain financially stretched. ITV companies were directed, in bidding for their own licences, to assume that a new fifth channel would bite into their advertising and audiences. So far, they have been spared this competition, although recession bit more deeply into revenues than they predicted. But unexpected consequences of the ITV auction should not block the birth of a rival channel. However, the government is misguided in withholding from Channel 5 one of the two frequencies advertised last time. In deciding to reserve one frequency for digital television, it risks adding to its long record of promoting high-technology projects of questionable commercial potential. The consequence is to handicap Channel 5, which may now reach as little as 52 per cent of the country, compared with the 74 per cent achievable with both frequencies. Uncertainty about its coverage is one reason why its viability is currently hard to assess. The potential liability for retuning video recorders, which share the same frequency, is also unknown. Even when these points are clarified, bidders will have a tough job deciding if Channel 5 is a prize worth having, and the price worth paying to secure it. But at least they now have another chance.</p>

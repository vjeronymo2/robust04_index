			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Technology: Human limits on information age - Technically Speaking DOES the age of information technology need a new economics? Yes, according to Michael Rothschild, a US high-tech management guru. The invention of microprocessors and fibre-optics capable, respectively, of processing and transmitting ever-increasing volumes of information means that the old metaphors we use to understand the economy are no longer appropriate. During the industrial age it made sense to describe the economy as an engine and think of workers as cogs in a huge machine. In order to make the economy or a company work, all that was necessary was to press the right combination of buttons or pull the right levers. But this mechanistic mind-set has outlived its usefulness, Rothschild argued in a lecture earlier this month at the Institute of Economic Affairs, the London free-market think-tank. It is not just the central planners of the old Soviet bloc who have discovered this. Increasingly, managers of hierarchical organisations and politicians in the capitalist world are finding that their old techniques do not produce the predictable results they once did. The explanation, according to Rothschild, is that the explosion of information means that it is no longer possible or desirable to control companies or economies mechanistically. His alternative approach, dubbed bionomics, is to view the economy as an ecosystem. Both are 'vast decentralised information networks that no one planned and no one controls - enormously vibrant and always changing'. There are interesting parallels. The methods used for encoding information in DNA are similar to computer programming language. The food chain in biology is analogous to the value chain in the economy, with part of an organisation's products being consumed by other organisations and part returning in the form of profits to enable the organisation to 'reproduce' and grow. There are also parallels between the Darwinian process of evolution through specialisation and natural selection, and the way the economy mutates. Most importantly, the key to success in both biology and economics is learning through experience. This leads to the conclusion that managers and politicians should not seek to control behaviour through bureaucratic systems but to find ways to enable their organisations to learn faster from experience. There is much appeal in this analogy. But whether it amounts to a new economics is doubtful. Adam Smith, back in the 18th century, explained how competitive markets resulted in the survival of the fittest. This century, the Austrian economist Friedrich von Hayek stressed that free markets fostered experimentation, learning and dynamism because individuals were able to respond to information generated at a local level. Moreover, Rothschild is perhaps a little too gung-ho about microprocessors, fibre-optics and other gizmos of the information age. These new technologies clearly have a part in improving productivity, but they are not the whole picture. What matters is not so much crude information as judgment. Modern executives are already bombarded with junk mail, junk faxes and junk phone calls. However fast computers are able to process information, there will still be a constraint on how much information humans can digest. Similarly, what matters is not so much cheap channels of communication as developing long-term relationships with suppliers, customers, employees and other stakeholders. The performance of Japanese and German economies has shown the value of such long-term relationships as compared with Anglo-American short-termism. However cheap it becomes to transmit information, there will still be constraints on the number of high-quality relationships humans can maintain. Information technology can generate wealth, but only within the limits of human psychology.</p>

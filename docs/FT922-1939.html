			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: CBOE seeks listing for S&amp;P quarterly options CHICAGO Board Options Exchange is seeking approval to list options on the Standard &amp; Poors 100 and 500 indices that expire quarterly. The CBOE already trades S&amp;P 100 and 500 options, but these expire monthly. The exchange believes that quarterly expirations for these heavily-traded products would help accommodate institutional investors whose performance is judged on a quarterly and yearly basis. Mr Duke Chapman, CBOE chairman, said the move was 'in response to customer needs'. The products, referred to as Quarterly Index Expirations, or QIXs, in the filing, would have similar terms to the corresponding regular index options. This means the S&amp;P 100 QIXs would have American style exercise, while the S&amp;P 500 QIXs would have European exercise. The exchange intends to list the new options for as many as eight quarters.</p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHEN TWO MEN DANCE  </P> <P> It would appear that Mr. McQuilkin has never seen the dance "Light Rain,"  performed often at the Los Angeles Music Center by the Joffrey Ballet Company.  This highly acclaimed dance is in every way as sexually explicit as the dance  performed at "Ten! A Decade of Song."  </P> <P> The one difference, of course, is that the dance was performed by two  (beautiful) men.  </P> <P> If the explicit showing of sexual attraction between two men is the basis of  his assessment that the dance "exceeded the bounds of good taste," then perhaps  Mr. McQuilkin should review his own attitudes.  </P> <P> If that is not the case, then perhaps he should attend a performance of "Light  Rain" and re-evaluate his perception of the bounds of good taste in light of  its artistic sentiment.  </P> <P> THOMAS L. JACKSON  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

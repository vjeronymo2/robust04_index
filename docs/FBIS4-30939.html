			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Jozo Curic from Geneva] </F>   [Excerpt] The Bosnian Croats were again the first to agree  to come to Geneva. Kresimir Zubak, president of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, and Mile Akmadzic, foreign  minister of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, arrived in  Geneva a few minutes ago. They were invited by Yasushi Akashi.  There is no indication whether Federation Vice President Ejup  Ganic, who represents the Bosnian Muslims at the cease-fire  negotiations, will come.    Bearing in mind that all three sides have been invited to  Geneva, it is not likely that Kresimir Zubak will be negotiating  on behalf of the Federation, that is, of the two sides. Let us  note that these talks today are not the negotiations on a  general political solution to Bosnia-Herzegovina that are  expected to resume in Geneva this coming weekend. This is the  United Nation's attempt to mediate in a cease-fire between the  Serbs and the Muslims, to make Mladic and Delic sign an  agreement to disengage their forces. [passage omitted]</p>

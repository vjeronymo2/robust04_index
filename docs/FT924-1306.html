			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / International Company News: US Pru to take over O&amp;Y's Aetna Centre PRUDENTIAL of America is due to file a motion in an Ontario court today to take over Toronto's Aetna Centre from Olympia &amp; York Developments. Prudential holds a CDollars 185m (USDollars 144.5m) first mortgage on the building. Lawyers for Prudential said an agreement was struck between both companies. The insurance company wants to take back the building immediately and try to replace a tenant moving out next spring. O&amp;Y on Wednesday filed with the court its revised restructuring plan, which allows senior creditors to seize their collateral. Creditors vote on the plan during the week of January 11. The Ontario Securities Commission halted trading in CDollars 325m of bonds secured on First Canadian Place, O&amp;Y's biggest Canadian property. O&amp;Y failed to meet a deadline for filing First Canadian's financial statements. The company said it would do so within the next few days. The delay was due to the effort required to put together the detailed restructuring plan.</p>

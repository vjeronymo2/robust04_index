			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ACCUSED DRUNK DRIVER PICKLED, NOT A PICKLE LOVER, JURY RULES  </P> <P> Zbigniew Krawiec swore that he had just been drinking pickle juice when he was  pulled over for drunk driving, but a jury decided he was pickled and convicted  him anyway.  </P> <P> Krawiec, a Polish immigrant, said his favorite beverage is pickle juice. It's a  Polish custom, he told jurors Thursday.  </P> <P> To prove his point, defense attorney Jim Kane introduced a jar of dill pickles  and wanted Krawiec to take a mouthful on the witness stand to prove he loves  the stuff.  </P> <P> But deputy prosecutor Steven Nash objected, and Judge Charles Dorn upheld the  objection.  </P> <P> "Have I ever seen a 'pickle juice defense' before this? No," said Dorn, who has  tried hundreds of drunk-driving cases.  </P> <P> Washington State Trooper Dan Derrick testified that he pulled Krawiec over  after spotting him driving with his lights off. Derrick said Krawiec failed a  field sobriety test and refused to take a breath test.  </P> <P> Derrick and two jailers testified that the defendant's breath smelled of  alcohol, not pickles.  </P> <P> Dorn fined Krawiec $400 and ordered him to serve three days in jail. Kane is  expected to appeal.  </P></p>

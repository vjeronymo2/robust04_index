			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / International Company News: TNT, Ansett face TPC action AUSTRALIA'S three biggest parcel carriers - TNT, Ansett Transport Industries and Mayne Nickless - face legal action by the federal Trades Practices Commission (TPC) for alleged breaches of competition law. Documents filed by the TPC in the federal court allege that the three companies operated a cartel to reduce price competition in the ADollars 1bn (USDollars 700m) a year express freight market, which they jointly dominate. The commission is seeking financial penalties against the three companies and 19 named executives and former executives alleged to have participated in operating the cartel. There was no comment from TNT or Ansett, which is jointly owned by TNT and News Corporation, Mr Rupert Murdoch's media group. Mr Ian Webber, chairman of Mayne Nickless said the group would 'vigorously contest' the allegations. Mr Webber said Mayne Nickless had not received a copy of the documents filed in the court. He said the company would make no further comment while the case remained sub-judice. The commission alleges that the companies agreed not to compete on prices and rates; not to offer competitive quotes to each other's customers; and to compensate each other if customers transferred their business. Papers filed in the court include details of a number of alleged meetings between executives from the companies, and case studies of the effect of the alleged cartel on specific customers. The performance of Ansett's aviation businesses is expected to improve this year, Mr David Mortimer, TNT managing director, told analysts in New York. Mr Mortimer, who recently replaced Sir Peter Abeles, said TNT was 'profoundly aware' that losses by TNT and its affiliated aviation companies in the past two years had undermined shareholders' confidence. He said the board was 'in the process of developing clear strategies and definite plans to bring the TNT group back to solid profitability'.</p>

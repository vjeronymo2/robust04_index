			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Cupid shares fall as founder quits SHARES IN Cupid plummeted from 85p to 53p as the USM-quoted bridal wear group reported that Mr Michael Murray, its founder, had 'resigned from the board and from his position as group chief executive following a disagreement with the rest of the board'. Mr Michael Fort, the director who runs the retail division and was the only member of the board available yesterday, would not elaborate on the announcement beyond pointing out the warning in the press release that the outcome for the full year was 'unlikely to exceed last year's results'. However, he did say that Mr Richard Lee, chairman and interim chief executive, was in close contact with the group's institutional shareholders about the share price fall. The group reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 168,000 (profits Pounds 93,000) for the six months to September 30, but Mr Fort said that customary seasonal factors were exaggerated by Youngs, the formal wear business acquired in mid-January. Much of the inflowing cash was taken before the acquisition, though most of the costs were incurred afterwards. Quilty, the nursery care division, also dragged down the pre-tax outcome. Mr Alex Williamson, Quilty's managing director, has joined the main board which was strengthened by Mr Richard Shaw and Mr Robert Shepherd last August. Group turnover rose to Pounds 8.5m (Pounds 6.07m) and interest payable to Pounds 184,000 (Pounds 129,000). Losses per share were 1.27p against earnings of 0.85p and again there is no interim dividend.</p>

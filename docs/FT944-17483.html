			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian oil exports uprated Recent Russian oil exports have continued to grow more strongly than previously forecast, according to the International Energy Agency in Paris. In its monthly oil market report published yesterday the agency estimated that August exports from the former Soviet Union were 2.59m barrels a day, compared with an earlier forecast of 2.32m. September exports are thought to have declined slightly, to 2.2m b/d. The IEA also lifted its forecast for fourth quarter Russian exports to 2m b/d, 100,000 more than its earlier estimate. Winter storms in the Baltic and the Black Sea often hamper tanker loading operations at that time. But it expected a slight rise in exports because of low domestic demand, the need for hard currency and the prospect that joint ventures between western and Russian oil companies would be more successful in getting export licenses. The fourth quarter estimate for output from the UK and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea is also raised to a total of 6m b/d. The continuing surge in North Sea production is the main factor behind the IEA's forecast that fourth quarter output from countries outside the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries will be 42m b/d, up 1.1m from the third quarter. It put Opec output at 25m b/d, above its 24.52m b/d ceiling, due largely to a recovery in Nigeria following the end of the oil workers' strike.</p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold surge falters at Dollars 400 THE GOLD price was only 75 cents away from Dollars 400 a troy ounce at one stage in London yesterday. But the precious metal's attack on the psychologically-important level faltered in the face of profit-taking by New York funds and it closed in London at Dollars 394 an ounce, up Dollars 2.25 on the day. Dealers suggested it would not be long before gold was driven through Dollars 400 by the weight of money behind recent options buying and other technical factors. Silver, the best performer in the recent precious metals rally, traded near three-year highs, reaching Dollars 5.20 before determined selling after the New York market opened saw it retreat to close unchanged in London at Dollars 5.08 1/2 an ounce. Platinum touched a 28-month peak before closing at Dollars 406.25. 'Low interest rates are forcing hot money into fairly thin markets such as those for precious metals and gold shares,' said Mr Andy Smith, analyst at the Union Bank of Switzerland. 'We must not try to attach any logic to it.' He pointed out the gold market was ignoring what should be bad news such as 'discordant noises from Beijing about cooling the Chinese economic boom, US long bonds flat at all-time lows, oil prices at their lowest for more than two years and Taiwan's announcement today that gold imports in June plunged by 40 per cent'. Other analysts saw the gold market in a different light. Mr Jeffrey Christian, managing director of the New York-based CPM consultancy group, insisted the recent rise was 'not merely a 'paper' rally but there is a strong, broad-based physical demand'. More important, according to Mr Christian, there were a wide range of reasons given by investors for their present interest in gold 'which suggests the rally might continue longer than would be expected if only one or two reasons were given'. Nevertheless, in CPM's latest Market Timing Advisory publication, he warns that in August and the third quarter some holders of long gold futures positions could reverse their tactics and knock prices back. Also, 'some of the central banks which sold call (buying) options over the past two months are prepared, even eager, to allow these positions to be exercised. Should this happen, there could be several million ounces of bullion entering the physical market, helping to halt any further rally'.

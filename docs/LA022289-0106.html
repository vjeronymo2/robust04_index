			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EPA CITES 23 MUFFLER SHOPS IN CALIFORNIA  </P> <P> The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday that 109 muffler shops  throughout the country are violating federal law by installing improper  after-market catalytic converters on cars.  </P> <P> The agency said that violation notices totaling more than $1 million in  proposed fines have been sent to the shops, including 23 in California, two of  which are in Orange County. Of the 23 California shops, 15 were identified as  Midas Muffler outlets.  </P> <P> Most of the violations involved the installation of what the EPA said were  "cheaper, less effective" two-way catalytic converters on vehicles requiring  three-way converters. Three-way converters control emissions of nitrogen oxide  in addition to hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide.  </P> <P> Nitrogen oxide is a major ingredient in photochemical smog. It combines in  sunlight with hydrocarbons to form ozone.  </P> <P> However, Richard G. Kozlowski of the EPA's enforcement office said the 109  shops represent only a small percentage of the estimated 250,000 muffler  outlets nationwide.  </P> <P> Kozlowski said three-way converters are clearly more expensive than two-way  converters. Retail prices on a three-way converter could run from $20 to $50  more. But, Kozlowski said, shops will sell a cheaper two-way converter either  to draw in customers in a very competitive business or to "maximize their  profits." In other cases, he said, incorrect installations could result from  honest mistakes.  </P> <P> Owners of several muffler shops that were cited, as well as a senior executive  of Midas International in Chicago, denied that there was a profit incentive for  a shop to install a two-way instead of a three-way converter because the price  difference is small.  </P> <P> "I don't believe that is the case. All the franchisees I spoke to said it was a  misapplication. It was not a matter of cost," Russell Richards, senior vice  president of franchises at Midas International, said in a telephone interview  from Chicago.  </P> <P> Gordon F. Bowley, attorney for the California Midas Dealers Assn., said: "It's  not a fair characterization that it was something installed because it was  cheaper to install. It was an error from the manufacturers."  </P> <P> One Midas dealer, Charles Margolin, whose shop on Centre Drive in El Toro was  cited for five improper installations, said he already has replaced the  converters on three of those cars at no charge and is attempting to contact the  owners of the other two cars.  </P> <P> Margolin, whose shop was honored by the Midas chain in 1987 for being the  highest-volume franchise with no customer complaints, said the errors were  inadvertent.  </P> <P> "We comply strictly with the law, and we are trying to correct the mistakes,"  Margolin said Tuesday. "There were some errors made because the converters have  the same shape but different numbers. The mechanics inadvertently installed the  wrong ones."  </P> <P> Albert Beattie, a Midas dealer in Palmdale, said, "I don't think any of the  shops that did it did it intentionally."  </P> <P> They added that all affected customers are being notified and that the correct  converters are being installed at no further cost.  </P> <P> An attorney for one of the converter manufacturers, Car Sound Exhaust System of  La Mirada, said that there have been no errors in either the instructions or  part numbers for several years and that mistaken installations were probably  the fault of the shop employees.  </P> <P> "There's not that much money involved. It sounds like they're moving so fast  they're not paying much attention to what they put in," said Car Sound attorney  Stephen Gigliotti.  </P> <P> Gigliotti said the wholesale price for a two-way converter is $49.95. The  wholesale price of a three-way is $54.95. The retail markup is usually about  300%, he said.  </P> <P> Following is a list of California muffler shops that the EPA said were in  violation:  </P> <P> Midas Muffler, 22752 Centre Drive, El Toro; Mesa Muffler Service, 2177 Harbor  Blvd., Costa Mesa; Mike's Muffler, 12222 Garvey Ave., El Monte; Bay Area  Muffler, 1924 14th St., Santa Monica; Leo's Body, Radiator &amp; Muffler, 901  E.

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / International Company News: Daf shares dive as shake-up planned SHARES in Daf, the Dutch truckmaker, touched a new low yesterday as it admitted that further retrenchments would be made. The shares sank to Fl 5.40, down Fl 0.80 from Wednesday's close, before being suspended briefly ahead of a joint statement by the company and its unions. They recovered to close steady Fl 6.20, compared with a high for the year of Fl 26.90. DAF, which also controls the former Leyland truck and van-making operations in the UK, gave no details of the planned restructuring and job losses. Daf's UK plants have taken the brunt of the previous job losses. But with the UK commercial vehicle market having stabilised, and some key continental European markets now turning down, it is expected that the main focus of job-cutting will shift to DAF's Dutch and Belgian facilities. In a further bid to reassure markets, yesterday's statement also declared that long-running negotiations with its banks and the Dutch and Belgian government on additional state-guaranteed credits of Fl 210m should soon reach a 'positive' conclusion. Daf has said it would have to defer payment of a dividend this year on an issue of preference shares made a year ago to raise Fl 250m to strengthen its finances.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, assistant secretary general </F> of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party and President Hafiz al-Asad's  representative, at a speech rally marking the 31st anniversary  of the 8 March revolution in Damascus--live]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] On this glorious occasion,  the 31st anniversary of the 8 March revolution, I am honored and  pleased to represent the secretary general of the Arab Socialist  Ba'th Party [ASBP], struggler President Hafiz al-Asad  [applause], and to congratulate you and all our struggling Arab  nation's masses. I am honored to convey to you and through you  to all strugglers of our great party and all Arab strugglers  wherever they are, the congratulations of the leader of the  victorious march of party and people, comrade struggler  President Hafiz al-Asad [applause], secretary general of the  ASBP and president of the Syrian Arab Republic. I also convey  his greetings and wishes for further success in our steady  militant march toward the achievement of the objectives of the  party and masses, represented by unity, freedom, and socialism  [applause]. I also convey to you the congratulations of the  command of our great party, the initiator and leader of the  revolution, and its greetings and warm wishes on this cherished  occasion. [passage omitted]    A simple comparison between Syria now and Syria before the  revolution provides clear evidence of the great miracle that the  revolution has achieved after the Corrective Movement and under  the leadership and guidance of great leader Hafiz al-Asad  [applause]. Achievements surround us everywhere we look, and  they are constantly increasing, complementing each other in  quality and quantity. These achievements speak for themselves,  and show that the Syria of the revolution, the Syria of al-Asad,  is no longer a backward, marginal country, but a modern state  and a society that is firmly proceeding toward further progress  and prosperity. [passage omitted]    All this has established a solid basis for political  stability and security that is considered an exception in a  tense region and a turbulent world that has recently been shaken  by major events. This stability has contributed to the  consolidation of a major, ambitious development process within  the framework of a multi-sector economic system based on  cooperation and participation within the state's plan. This  plan is aimed at ensuring the country's progress and advancement  within the instructions of the ASBP to build a new society. It  will be a society based on equality and the eradication of  exploitation, poverty, illiteracy, and diseases by improving the  people's living standards and by increasing the state's  capabilities on the basis of self-reliance. In this brief  address, we cannot cover all of last year's indications of  growth. However, we will run through some of them to show the  continuity of the battle for an advanced society. Comrades, we  notice that in less than one year the production and  distribution of electricity has stabilized. This has been a  great qualitative success that could not have been realized had  it not been for the direct instructions of the leader of the  homeland, comrade struggler President Hafiz al-Asad [applause].  Last year's economic growth rates registered satisfactory  figures and showed steady development in qualitative and  quantitative progress.    If we take the gross national production [GNP] as the most  comprehensive indication, we find that in comparison with 1992,  the GNP grew at a rate of 17.5 percent in 1993 in current  prices. This growth rate becomes 10 percent if it is measured  with fixed prices. This is a high and satisfactory rate. In  the same context, all sectors have registered good growth rates.  The agricultural sector has registered a growth rate of 17  percent, which signifies the importance of the revolution's  strategy promoting the agricultural sector through enhancing the  process of building the infrastructure of this sector and  applying appropriate pricing policies that do justice to the  human effort and encourage production.    As for the mineral and manufacturing industries sector, a  growth rate of 4 percent has been registered. The service  sector registered a growth rate of 22 percent. This helps raise  citizens' living standards through the various general services  that are offered to them for free. Among the very positive  phenomena that has been noted has been the rise in total  investment capital by approximately 9 percent. This capital's  contribution to the GNP has risen from 7 percent, versus 93  percent of the final consumption, in 1992 to 13 percent, versus  87 percent of the final consumption, in 1993. In view of the  measures that have been taken to boost economic plurality,  promote individual initiatives, and encourage citizens to invest  their funds in economic activities, total private capital has  risen from 57 billion Syrian pounds in 1992 to 86 billion Syrian  pounds in 1993. Perhaps what was most conspicuous last year was  the increase in goods production, which constitutes a source of  market value in the economy. Improvements in the mechanisms and  volume of economic trade with the world have taken place.  Positive qualitative developments have taken place through the  codification of economic cooperation with some sisterly  countries, such as Lebanon, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Stable and  developed formulas for this cooperation have been agreed upon.  This cooperation falls within the framework of a comprehensive  economic Arab integration, which is in the interest of all Arabs.    But, the major changes and achievements under the revolution  in all sectors and throughout Syria and its governorates do not  constitute the final picture of what we plan to achieve. Nor do  they represent all our aspirations. Rather, they are steps  along the road ahead of us within the limits of available  resources. They provide an incentive for continuing the process  of work and construction to arrive at our final goals. The past  few years have not been void of difficulties. Throughout the  years of the revolution, we have faced difficulties and  obstacles of various types. We have managed to overcome many of  them, and we will overcome all difficulties that will face us in  the future. We are optimistic and hopeful. We are determined  and resolved to continue the march until we arrive at our  pan-Arab objectives and defeat all the obstacles along this road.    Comrades, brother citizens: The Arab Socialist Ba'th Party  believes that the Arabs have no existence outside their pan-Arab  entity. It is a pan-Arab party in ideology, practice, and  organization. This is why it has put unity at the head of its  objectives and given it first priority, considering it the most  sublime objective of the contemporary struggle and the common  denominator of all Arabs. All the events and developments on  the pan-Arab and world level prove that the Arabs will never be  able to play their role in full in the march of world  civilization unless they are able to achieve comprehensive  unity. Unity is one of their rights as a nation. It is also  their duty as messengers of a humanitarian civilization that has  lit the darkness of history at several stages.    Comrades, the March Revolution took the objective of unity  as  a model that guides all its actions in the pan-Arab arena.  Since the Corrective Movement, the hero of the Corrective  Movement, leader struggler President Hafiz al-Asad [applause]  has been exerting every effort to urge the Arabs to close their  ranks and to entrench their solidarity, even at its minimum  level, especially since Arab solidarity reduces the possibility  for pan-Arab tragedies such as the Iraq-Iran war, the Iraqi  regime's occupation of Kuwait, and other tragedies and crises.  Solidarity enables the Arabs to achieve their transitional  objectives, liberate their land, restore their rights, and  reinforce their position in the world. Arab solidarity also  creates a positive atmosphere that paves the way for the  promotion of comprehensive cooperation among Arabs, that allows  them to make large strides toward their comprehensive unity, and  that allows the establishment of unity between two or more of  the Arab states that are ready to do so.    The Yemeni unity experiment has delighted the Arabs who  aspire for unity. However, the difficulties and crises that  have recently afflicted this unity have created a wave of  frustration and pain for the sons of the Yemeni people and for  all Arabs. They have all called on the Yemeni leadership to  work to overcome the current crisis, reactivate joint  institutions, entrench democracy, and to meet the people's  demands to safeguard unity and bolster its march. [passage  omitted]    O comrades; O brothers; O masses of our militant nation:  Since its inception, the Ba'th Party has been known as  Palestine's party. Likewise, since its inception, the  revolution has viewed the Arab-Zionist conflict as a top  priority, given that it is the paramount issue concerning all  Arabs, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Arabian Gulf. Syria has  been making dear sacrifices and spending a great deal of its  revenue to confront the continuous Israeli aggression, defend  the Arabs' pan-Arab rights, and liberate their occupied  territories. It is working with all fraternal Arabs to mobilize  their potential and unify their positions to settle the conflict  in a manner that will ensure the restoration of Arab territories  and rights, and that will also result in a just and  comprehensive peace in the region--a decent and honorable peace  that will be enjoyed by all, and that will allow the countries  and peoples of the region to live free from aggressions,  expansionist policies, and domination.    Thanks to this pan-Arab understanding of the Arab-Israeli  conflict, Syria's pan-Arab role has grown immensely. Syria now  speaks on behalf of all Arabs. As for its leader, struggler  President Hafiz al-Asad, [applause] he is meeting the leaders of  the big powers on behalf of all Arabs. Likewise, they hold  talks with him in this capacity. This confirms that Syria's  pan-Arab role now enjoys the recognition of everyone in the  region and the world at large.    The peace process was unleashed more than two years ago to  serve as a vehicle to achieve a clear objective, namely, a  comprehensive and just peace that will return the territories  and rights to their Arab owners and consecrate security and  stability in the region. Syria has taken part in this process on  the basis of this formula. Syria's participation was  instrumental in paving the way for the peace process. Under no  circumstances will Syria accept any distortion of the Madrid  formula, or any deviation from this formula. This is because it  is impossible to achieve peace unless it is based on the  essence, foundations, principles, and objectives of this  process, which constitute an embodiment of international  legitimacy. The honoring of the essence, foundations,  principles, and objectives of this process must result in the  implementation of the resolutions of international legitimacy.    Since the convocation of the Madrid conference, Israel,  which  was compelled to enter the peace process in the first place, has  used various means to obstruct this process. That is why it  decided to torpedo it from within. It has made several attempts  to achieve this objective. It started with procrastination,  with a failure to discuss substantive issues, and with an  attempt to render the Washington talks devoid of any meaningful  content to turn them into a marginal and insignificant parley in  the hope that it will buy time to promote its expansionist  objectives.    Faced with these attempts, Syria has underlined its  adherence  to the principles and bases of the peace process. Similarly, it  has underscored coordination with the Arab sides, given that  this coordination is conducive to Arab strength and cohesion.  This time, Israel sought to strike at inter-Arab coordination  and weaken the Arab sides by dealing with them one at a time and  offering them fragile, separate, and partial solutions, which  are designed to achieve Israel's expansionist ambitions,  circumvent the bases of the peace process, and wriggle out of  its obligations as enshrined in the relevant international  resolutions, as the course of events has shown.    Nonetheless, Syria has confronted Israel's attempts to deal  with the Arab sides one at a time and isolate Syria in  preparation for nullifying its pioneering pan-Arab role in the  peace process. It is true that Israel has managed to conclude a  unilateral deal with the Palestinians. However, Syria has  striven to enhance coordination with the Arab parties to the  Washington talks, particularly fraternal Lebanon, because  coordination and joint action are necessary if the Arabs are to  regain their rights.    Syria's efforts in confronting the Israeli maneuvers were  crowned with great success. This was clearly manifested in the  Geneva summit between struggler President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S.  President Clinton. Observers were unanimous in describing this  summit as the most important event in both the Middle East and  the international arenas, saying it was a summit between the  leader of a great nation, the Arab nation, and the leader of the  most powerful state in the world. It was the summit between  equals and the summit that restated Arab rights and Arab  constants. The summit effectively reconfirmed that the  solution, a just and comprehensive peace, must be based on the  Madrid formula and the implementation of international  legitimacy resolutions 242, 338, and 425. In Geneva, President  al-Asad said: I do not differentiate between the Golan and  southern Lebanon, between what is occupied from Palestine or  Jordan. When I ask for one part I ask for the whole. This is  elementary because, to me, they all constitute the same Arab  land.    Within this pan-Arab concept lies the secret of the success  of his Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad and the failure of  separate solutions to settle the conflict. Faced with this  success scored by Syria's pan-Arab policy, Israel found itself  cornered and unable to maneuver. That's why it carried out a  concentrated media campaign before and after the Geneva summit  to minimize the importance of this summit and to try to  marginalize its results. It did so in an attempt to obstruct  the peace process and hamper the U.S. role, which moved, though  a bit late, to push the peace process ahead and render it a  success after the Geneva summit. After the failure of all these  attempts, Israel returned to its aggressive nature. It  escalated its systematic terrorist operations, starting with the  escalation of its operations in southern Lebanon. It then  perpetrated its odious crime in the blessed Ibrahimi Mosque in  Hebron, a crime that is unequaled in atrocity, ugliness, and the  flouting of human values and international laws and norms.    This crime brings back to mind the picture of Israeli  terrorism in all its vilest forms, particularly since Israel's  stamp appeared in another terrorist crime, the explosion at the  Sayyidat al-Najah in Beirut, simply to divert the world's  attention from the Ibrahimi mosque crime and to try to return  Lebanon to a whirlpool of violence and internecine fighting.    The international reaction to these Israeli crimes has not  gone beyond condemnation. In order to tackle these actions and  confront Israel's scorn for human life, the condemnations and  denunciations must be linked to specific deterring actions taken  under the aegis of the United Nations and international law.    Comrades, we notice that the more the Israeli repression in  the occupied territories intensifies, the more the heroic  intifadah escalates, the more brave the heroic intifadah  becomes, the more the Palestinian struggle in the West Bank and  the Gaza Strip intensifies, and the more the steadfastness of  the kinsfolk in the Golan and the resistance of our people in  southern Lebanon increases.    Israel's odious crimes confirm that the settlement issue,  which represents the direct and specific features of Israel's  expansionism and aggression, stands as a basic and important  obstacle in the face of the peace process. It also violates  international laws and norms because it entails geographic and  demographic changes in the occupied territories. Thus, it is  imperative to tackle the issue of settlements and view it as a  focal point of the peace process. [passage omitted]</p>

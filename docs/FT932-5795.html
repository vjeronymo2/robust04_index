			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Letter: Czech trade minister seeks fairer access to Community markets Sir, When Czechoslovakia - now the Czech Republic and Slovakia - escaped from communism at the end of 1989, it faced an enormous task of political and economic transformation. Now, after more than three years, it is clear that the Czech Republic has performed better than expected. Despite the dissolution of the federation and the consequential setbacks, macroeconomic stability prevails and the privatisation process is progressing satisfactorily. All this is the result of enlightened economic reform combined with political commitment. Nobody denies, however, that there are many challenges and obstacles yet to be overcome. It is accepted that the Czech Republic is not yet ready for full EC membership; clearly, this will take some time. But it is starting to appear that the Czech nation may be institutionally and economically prepared for membership sooner than the EC is prepared to receive it. Although time is not the biggest issue, the real problem appears to be the Community policy in the interim period. The real issue is trade. The Association Agreement improved substantially the access of Czech goods to EC markets, although in recent months a substantial slow-down is being observed. It is noted that sensitive commodities, such as agricultural products, steel and textiles, remain serious obstacles. The EC and others should accept as a reality that there are sensitive commodities where countries in central Europe have short-term comparative advantages and that such commodities are neither subsidised nor dumped. Economic recovery is simply stifled if fair trading access is not assured, for trading is really the only long-term effective aid. Professor Anne Kruger, ex-World Bank, articulates this very conflict in her excellent, recently published book, Economic Policies at Cross Purposes: United States and Developing Countries. Ready access to neighbouring markets for the Czech Republic is becoming the imperative for the priming of economic growth while at the same time one of its greatest impediments. With respect, the Community will probably need its own structural and economic reforms, for this cannot be a one-sided process left solely to the post-communist economies. It may be, of course, that we all need further social and political reform as well, including changes in perception of the political cycle. In particular, pampered pressure groups, such as farmers, miners, steelworkers and others, should not be so attentively heeded just because of pending elections in this or that country. A profound change in economic policies, abandoning what are sometimes disastrous subsidies, will finally release all of us from this vicious circle of short-term political expediency. This crippling economic-political cycle, in which the west, in particular, now finds itself, will simply have to be broken before further progress for Europe as a whole can be achieved. Vladimir Dlouhy, minister for industry and trade, The Czech Republic</p>

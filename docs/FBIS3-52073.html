			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 28 Jan (NA) -- The Mercosur [Common  Market of the South] Industrial Council has demanded "long-term  financing" for the capitalization and retooling of industries.  It also requested lines of credit "at preferential and  promotional rates" for the Pymes [small- and medium-sized  enterprises organization].    The industrialists indicated that these "medium- and  long-term credit lines" are indispensable to guarantee the  competitiveness of all sectors against third countries.    During their meeting on 27 January at the Argentine  Industrial Union (UIA) headquarters, the Mercosur Industrial  Council -- which comprises the industrial organizations of the  four Mercosur countries -- agreed to promote the preservation of  the environment.    The industrialists also evaluated the need for the  government  to ratify the sectorial agreements achieved so far and committed  themselves to achieving a total consensus on this matter during  the meeting to be held on 4 March in Montevideo, Uruguay.    The businessmen lauded the task of the Mercosur Industrial  Council, indicating that it is indispensable as a way to submit  private policies to governments. "It legitimizes us as valid  interlocutors," they stated, and asked the states to follow the  example of the industrial sector.    "No retooling is possible without an effort from the public  sector," the industrialists stressed.    They emphasized the need to grant loans to the Pymes, "which  do not have access to long-term lines of credit."    The second consensus pertains to the need to preserve the  environment and agreement was reached on the need to "promote  industrial production without endangering the environment, based  on the principles of an economically sustained development."    The last agreement foresees the creation of a work group to  evaluate the Mercosur's negotiation guidelines with the other  members of the ALADI [Latin American Integration Association].    Within this framework, and regarding trade negotiations, the  industrialists urged their governments to remain faithful to the  objectives of the Treaty of Asuncion.    During this second meeting of the Mercosur Industrial  Council, the benefits and scope of Mercosur Resolution No. 13/93  -- which deals with the consolidation of Customs Union and  transit within Mercosur -- were discussed.    This measure "affirms the purpose of formalizing the Customs  Union on 1 January 1995 as an essential step toward the  organization of Mercosur."    The measure was lauded by the industrialists, especially by  UIA members who understood that the governments have  acknowledged that the deadlines established at the beginning for  integration were not appropriate.    According to UIA spokespersons, the Customs Union "leaves  the  door open" to postpone the guarantee clauses that are in force  until the end of the year and which establish a quota for  exchange between member countries. When this quota is surpassed  by a member country it pays tariffs as though it were a third  country.    The possibility of harmonizing industrial promotion programs  and the search for parity in industrial costs were also  discussed during the extensive meeting, in which industrialists  Dagoberto Lima Godoy (Brazil), Hugo Barral (Paraguay), Maxi  Munoz (Uruguay), and Luis Jose Vasallo (Argentina), among  others, participated.</p>

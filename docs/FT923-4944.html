			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Contracting-out trend helps Serco advance 37% to Pounds 3.39m THE TREND for both government and companies to contract out non-core services lay behind a 37 per cent increase in pre-tax profits at Serco Group in the six months to June 30. The company, which holds contracts as varied as the maintenance of Hyde Park, Ministry of Defence radars and one in three London traffic lights, increased profits from Pounds 2.48m to Pounds 3.39m on turnover up 40 per cent to Pounds 65.4m (Pounds 46.8m). The results were boosted by two months' contribution from International Aeradio Limited, acquired in April from British Telecommunications for Pounds 12.3m. Mr Richard White, managing director, said IAL contributed about Pounds 6m to turnover. For the year as a whole the acquisition is expected to be earnings neutral after profits of about Pounds 800,000 are absorbed by interest costs. Excluding IAL, the underlying business expanded at about 20 per cent, the same rate as in previous years. 'Our markets continue to be very strong,' Mr White said. The interim dividend is raised to 4.5p (3.9p). Fully diluted earnings of 17.1p (14.8p) maintained dividend cover at 3.8 times. About 70 per cent of turnover came from the public sector. The company's background is in defence contracts, which now account for 40 per cent of turnover, against 48 per cent a year ago. Serco successfully retendered for one large contract during the period, while a further four or five contracts will be re-awarded in the second half. However, less than 20 per cent of next year's expected revenues are related to contracts up for renewal.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on a news conference by U.S. Admiral Charles Larson </F> with foreign and domestic correspondents in Hanoi on 17 January]    [Text] Dear friends: Admiral Charles Larson, commander of  U.S. forces in the Asia-Pacific region, paid a visit to Vietnam  from 16 January with the aim of seeking more knowledge and  accelerating the cooperation between the U.S. and Vietnam in  solving the Americans missing in action [MIA] during the Vietnam  War.    Admiral Larson held an international news conference in  Hanoi  after his meetings with Vietnamese leaders. The following is  the report from a Vietnamese radio correspondent on the contents  of the news conference:    [Begin recording] [Correspondent] A committee to investigate  MIA cases during the Vietnam War was formed in January 1992 and  an office in Hanoi was opened. The committee has been in  operation for two years. In the past two years, this committee  of five American soldiers -- including Naval, Marine, and Air  Force personnel -- conducted 26 joint searches with the  Vietnamese side to seek information about American soldiers  dying and missing during the war.    From 6-28 March this year, the committee will form four  search teams and four recovery teams with 84 people to conduct  the 27th joint search -- the biggest search ever. Admiral  Charles Larson, commander of U.S. forces in the Asia-Pacific  region, paid a visit to Vietnam on 16 January in view of the  importance of this search. He directly met with Vietnamese  leaders to deal with the settlement of the MIA issue. He also  directly met with American and Vietnamese, who have taken part  in the searches and directly inspected the search sites. He was  the highest U.S. military official to visit Vietnam since the  end of the Vietnam War.    After two days, Admiral Larson held an international news  conference on 17 January in Hanoi to disclose the results of his  Vietnam visit and offer his opinions on the search activities in  Vietnam. Speaking to correspondents, he said:    [Larson, in English fading into Vietnamese translation] We  have conducted 846 searches and 59 excavations in Vietnam since  the formation of our special force in January 1982. And we have  learned many things. I am pleased to say that our country sent  5,600 notices to MIA families over the last year in a program  that provides information to MIA families. I am also pleased at  the efforts of the five people working on the sites. This  requires good leadership, planning, and great effort. I can  promise that I will try my best to achieve the possible in the  search for missing people. I come here to witness the  cooperation and effort from both sides. I met high-ranking  Vietnamese leaders, specialists, and archivists.    [Correspondent] In response to a Chinese reporter's question  about his assessment of the Vietnamese cooperation in this  aspect, Mr. Larson said:    [Larson, in English fading into Vietnamese translation] I  would say two things: First, we have found ever-increasing  cooperation over the past two years since the task force began  its work here. Second, if this cooperation was not good, I  would not be here and would not appear in this uniform to see  those people whom I have met. My assessment is that there has  been very good cooperation.    [Correspondent] Answering a question about the U.S. plan to  search for servicemen missing in action, Mr. Larson said:    [Larson, in English fading into Vietnamese translation] It  needs to take into account all issues. We will do all we can,  ranging from the evaluation of information on American  servicemen, who are reported to be alive, to disinformation and  other efforts. So far, throughout various searches and all the  things we have done, we do not find any evidence indicating that  there are American servicemen alive in Vietnam and Southeast  Asia. However, we cannot and will not rule out that possibility  until we have checked all the information available.    [Correspondent] A Radio Voice of Vietnam correspondent  asked:  Do you have any idea about the assistance the U.S. Government  will give to Vietnam in resolving its humanitarian issues?    Mr. Larson said: [Larson, in English fading into Vietnamese  translation] I think that the humanitarian issue exists and that  just like us, they view the humanitarian issue as a very  delicate matter. I think that our two countries have realized  this is an issue and the two sides are cooperating to resolve  it. I am very pleased to see that my government has realized  this and it knows how to undertake it. During his visit to  Vietnam in December 1993, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State  Winston Lord took with him a large dossier which I had the  opportunity to read this morning at the joint archive center.  We hope that this dossier will be useful in providing some  information to those families with missing relatives. We will  try to do what we can to help Vietnamese families concerned and  we hope that we will receive reciprocal assistance from the  Vietnamese people. [end recording]</p>

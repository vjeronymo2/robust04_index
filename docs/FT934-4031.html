			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / International Company News: Bahrain bank owns 6% of Rinascente Arab Banking Corporation (ABC), the Bahrain-based financial institution, has become the second-biggest shareholder in La Rinascente, Italy's leading retailer, with about 6 per cent of the total capital. Banque Pictet, a Geneva-based private bank, will also become a big Rinascente stockholder with about 2 per cent of the total capital as part of the same transaction. The two stakes stem fron rights to Rinascente shares not taken up by Ifi and Ifil, two stock-market quoted holding companies indirectly controlled by the Agnelli family. Through Ifi, the Agnellis control Fiat, the former owner of Rinascente. After a recent complex transfer of control of Rinascente from Fiat, Ifil now has a controlling 33 per cent stake in Rinascente. Under the terms of that transaction, Fiat offered its controlling 46.8 per cent stake in Rinascente to its own shareholders at L9,500 a share. Under an agreement with the Italian stock exchange authorities, Ifil and Ifi, its parent company, declined to take up the rights to Rinascente shares they were entitled to as Fiat shareholders. Separately, Ifil launched a public tender offer to buy up to 33 per cent of Rinascente's stock. Generali, Italy's biggest insurer, said group premiums, rose by 20.5 per cent in the first nine months of 1993 to L13,740bn (Dollars 8.02bn). Adjusted for exchange rate changes, the overall increase was 12.4 per cent, with life insurance premiums climbing by 17.7 per cent, while non-life premiums increased by 9.3 per cent. The group gave no profits forecast, but said its claims ratio on its domestic non-life business had continued to improve, while underwriting earnings abroad remained under pressure.</p>

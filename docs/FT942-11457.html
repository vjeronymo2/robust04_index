			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: Mellon Bank clears funds deal obstacle Mellon Bank yesterday received regulatory approval for its acquisition of funds group Dreyfus. This removes one important obstacle to the first big takeover by a bank of a mutual fund company in the US. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates federally-chartered banks, approved the deal after an unusual public consultation period, begun in February. The OCC's review had been undertaken in the wake of Congressional concern about the possible conflicts that could arise from allowing a bank to acquire a funds business. The OCC said the deal could go ahead subject to a number of conditions. These include Mellon's compliance with its own policy statement on mutual funds which, among other things, establishes procedures to ensure that customers understand that mutual funds are not covered by Federal deposit insurance. Also, the mutual funds will not be able to bear the Mellon name, and the Dreyfus management team and fund managers will have to remain separate from the management of the bank.</p>

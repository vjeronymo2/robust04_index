			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / International Company News: Testing time for French insurers  -The UAP sell-off heralds a new era for the sector Any day now, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, is expected to launch the FFr25bn (Dollars 4.28bn) sale of the state's remaining stake in Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the largest insurance group in France. The UAP privatisation, which will be followed by those of Assurances Generales de France (AGF) and Groupe GAN, marks a watershed in the French insurance industry's fortunes by heralding the end of the long tradition of state ownership. It also comes at a time when Victoire, the second-biggest private sector insurer after Axa, is up for sale thereby paving a way for a foreign group to emerge as a force in French insurance. However, these developments come at a difficult time when insurers are under intense financial pressure. UAP, AGF and GAN all recently reported weak results for 1993, due to the depressed state of the insurance market and the losses of their banking subsidiaries. They now face the dual challenge of stabilising their finances and adapting to the changes in the French insurance industry. 'This is an important time for the industry,' said Mr Stephen Dias, European insurance analyst at Goldman Sachs. 'Privatisation is a big factor. All the state-controlled insurers will have to adopt a more business-like approach in future. The industry was very depressed last year. It's now in an intermediary phase and, if all goes well, profitability should return to normal next year.' One consolation is that there is already evidence of recovery in the French insurance market. It reached its nadir in 1992 when the economic slowdown triggered a decline in demand and a steep increase in claims. The insurers were trapped in a vicious cycle of sacrificing margins to fight for market share: not only against each other but against the specialist mutual groups in the motor market and the banks in the life sector. Demand is still depressed but the big groups have begun to raise premiums and to be more rigorous about accepting new business. Mr Claude Bebear, chairman of Axa, and Mr Jacques Friedmann, his counterpart at UAP, have both noted an improvement in their French insurance interests. Meanwhile, demand should improve as the economy emerges from recession. Life insurance has particularly strong growth potential in the light of the government's long-awaited pension reforms. The threat from the mutuals is abating partly because they have been affected by the economic downturn. However, the banks are becoming even more competitive in life insurance. The insurers are responding by joining forces with the banks to tap into their formidably efficient distribution networks. UAP will use its privatisation to formalise old links with Banque Nationale de Paris. AGF is being courted by two banks: Societe Generale and Credit Lyonnais. Yet the recession dealt a double blow to the insurers by burdening their banking subsidiaries with heavy property losses. UAP, AGF and GAN were the chief casualties. They wrote off part of these losses in last year's results and transfered the rest to shell companies or to more robust subsidiaries. 'This isn't a final solution,' said Mr Tim Dawson, analyst at Lehman Brothers. 'All they've done is allow themselves to write off the losses over a longer period. But at least it alleviates the short term pressure on the balance sheet.' The 1993 'clean-up' is welcomed by observers such as Mr Dias of Goldman Sachs as evidence that UAP, AGF and GAN are preparing to be 'more business-like' after privatisation. All three groups should also have more financial flexibility as private companies. UAP has secured the government's agreement to stage a FFr3bn capital increase as part of its privatisation. AGF plans to follow suit. Ironically, the pace of acquisitions is likely to slow down in the mid-1990s. AGF and UAP are now intent on consolidating their acquisitions as is Axa after a difficult period with The Equitable of the US. These groups - and GAN - are considering expansion into Asia. But the focus for French insurers over the next few years is likely to be integration rather than expansion. Indeed, the flow of acquisition activity may well reverse if, as the industry expects, Victoire is snapped up by a foreign purchaser. A number of international insurers, including BAT of the UK and Germany's Allianz, have looked at Victoire - so far inconclusively. Suez, the French holding company that owns Victoire, is now considering various offers for the business. Mr Gerard Worms, chairman, hopes to clinch a deal next month. French insurers will then discover whether to add the threat of foreign competition to the other changes taking place in their traditional territory.</p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / People: Cruickshank answers another call The pull of the private sector has proved irresistible for one of the directors general of the government's new regulatory authorities overseeing former nationalised industries. Don Cruickshank, 51, has been director general of Oftel, the body watching the telecommunications industry, on a salary in the region of Pounds 90,000, for just under a year. He has now joined the board of Christian Salvesen, the specialist hire and food services group, as a non-executive director. It is his only such post, and might be worth about an extra Pounds 12,000 a year. None of the other DG's currently holds a non-executive post in the private sector, though when he was at Ofgas Sir James McKinnon did. His successor there, Claire Spottiswoode, is contractually free to follow in his footsteps should she choose - as are all the DGs - but Spottiswoode is understood to regard her formally part-time job as rather enough to handle for the time being. At Offer - the one dealing with electricity regulation - Stephen Littlechild regards his duties as fully occupying; he has taken a sabbatical from his professorial duties at the Birmingham School of Business Studies. Ofwat - the water authority - is headed by Ian Byatt. He too sees his duties as full-time and has no non-executive posts. Ofsted - the office for standards in education - is a different kettle of fish, being the body monitoring the new school inspection system. Its DG, Stuart Sutherland, is due to depart for the vice-chancellorship of Edinburgh University at the end of the year. Appointed the first chief executive of the National Health Service in Scotland between 1989-93, the Aberdonian Cruickshank's background is wide-ranging. First with Alcan, then an MBA at Manchester Business School, then to McKinsey and thence to the Times newspaper before joining Pearson Longman as finance director, in 1980. He joined the Virgin group in 1984 to prepare its flotation.</p>

			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Bank to issue new gilt stock THE Bank of England is creating a 20-year government bond in its first issue of a new gilt-edged security for nearly four years. The Bank's announcement yesterday that it is issuing Pounds 1.25bn of the 9 per cent Treasury stock due 2012 was well received in the gilt market. The issue will be available from Monday and is expected to appeal to domestic and foreign institutional investors such as pension and life funds. The Pounds 1.25bn gilt is too small at present to provide a useful 20-year benchmark, but the Bank is likely to issue further amounts of the stock to create a more liquid issue. With the government's return to borrowing in the gilt-edged market last year, the Bank will have issued a total of Pounds 15bn in gilt-edged stock in the present financial year, including the latest issue. The Bank took advantage of the strong performance of the bond market this week to sell Pounds 550m of medium and long-dated gilts. Economists at UBS Phillips and Drew expect the Bank to issue up to Pounds 33bn in the 1992-93 tax year.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / BT redundancy programme wiped out big pension surplus BRITISH Telecom's redundancy programme, under which it shed 29,000 workers last year, has effectively wiped out a Pounds 913m surplus in its pension scheme, forcing the company to resume contributions from April 1, 1993. The British Telecom Staff Superannuation Scheme report and accounts for the nine months to December 1992 shows that the effects of the redundancy scheme reduced the surplus to Pounds 119m by March 1993. The scheme has received advice from its actuaries that the level of surplus is too low to sustain further contributions holidays, according to the annual report. Employees have not had a pensions holiday, and have been contributing 6 per cent of their pay. BT, which has not had to make contributions to its pension scheme since 1988, is required under scheme rules to contribute 9 per cent of its employees' wages to the scheme when it does not have a surplus. A company spokesman said that the 1992 wages bill was Pounds 3.963bn, which equates to an annual contribution of roughly Pounds 357m. However, he said the resumption of contributions will have an 'insignificant' effect on BT's profits, which were Pounds 3.07bn pre-tax in the year to March, 1992. The elimination of the pension scheme surplus means that BT will also have to finance future redundancy costs out of its own profit and loss account. BT has said it plans to shed about 15,000 workers in the current year and 15,000 next year. The redundancy programme has also changed the demographic profile of the scheme, increasing the number of pensioners by nearly 10 per cent to 149,179 and cutting contributors by nearly 20 per cent to 113,186. This increases current liabilities and cuts cash flow. As a result of the redundancy programmes and the uncertainties created by the demographic shift, the trustees have taken the unusual step of requesting that annual actuarial valuations be performed over the next few years to ensure that the scheme is not falling into deficit. Typically, valuations are performed only once every three years. The annual report noted that relative to other large pension schemes, the fund managers underperformed in 1992, largely reflecting the scheme's heavy weighting in property.</p>

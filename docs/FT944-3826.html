			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Christmas Food and Drink: Simple, tasty canapes - Nicholas Lander sorts out some professional party advice For the past 18 months I have been working as a catering consultant for London's South Bank Centre where, from February 1995, there will be a much broader choice of what and where to eat and drink for the concert-goer or the visitor to the Hayward Gallery. One of the more pleasurable tasks involved a tasting of canapes prepared by companies keen to cater for receptions at the complex. In a spirit of goodwill they have submitted the recipes for some of their most popular canapes for you to enjoy during the party season. Mange on the Move, London NW1.

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Quayle ushers in freeze on regulations THE BUSH administration has launched its 90-day freeze on new federal regulations by calling on business groups to denounce the rules they find particularly burdensome. Vice-president Dan Quayle, who heads the Competitiveness Council - the administration's deregulation task force - said government agencies would use the 90-day moratorium to get rid of burdensome rules and set up 'pro-growth' rules. Federal regulations have grown rapidly under President George Bush, drawing complaints from business and from the right-wing of Mr Bush's own Republican party. The administration is now trying to use its executive powers to roll back regulations in areas where it cannot win new legislation from the Democrat-controlled Congress. 'I'm not going to test the courts too far, but we are trying to figure out ways of doing as much as we can administratively,' said Mr Boyden Gray, the White House general counsel. Administration lawyers are even examining whether it would be legal to order the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to index capital gains to inflation, thus circumventing Congress's reluctance to vote a cut in the capital gains tax rate. A recent study by Mr Thomas Hopkins of Rochester Institute of Technology estimates the aggregate cost of existing federal regulations at between Dollars 430bn (Pounds 237.5bn) and Dollars 562bn in 1990. Mr Hopkins says this could rise to between Dollars 542bn and Dollars 688bn by the end of the century. Major regulations now under study include acid rain emission controls, estimated to cost business Dollars 3bn a year while reducing sulphur dioxide emissions by 10m tons; requirements for pollution monitoring devices on light trucks, costing an estimated Dollars 1.6bn a year while cutting 176,000 tons of nitrogen oxides and 1.9m tons of carbon monoxide; and tighter standards for clinical laboratories, producing more accurate medical testing at an estimated cost of Dollars 1.6bn. Mr Quayle said the administration would focus on banking, biotechnology, energy and the environment, transport and property rights. In the banking area, for example, the Treasury is examining adjusting the capital adequacy rules to allow banks to count goodwill on mortgage servicing rights and credit card relationships as capital. The Internal Revenue Service, meanwhile, plans an overhaul of the federal tax deposit system which it expects to save businesses up to Dollars 6bn a year in compliance costs.</p>

The committee began to debate a document of pledge and  agreement between the parties to the dialogue of political  forces to build a modern Yemeni state. The document was drafted  by a subcommittee emanating from the political forces' dialogue  committee.    The draft document states the solutions reached by the  dialogue committee to the current issues and problems that  caused the current crisis. The draft is also a prelude to the  building of a modern Yemeni state as it sets forth foundations  for stability and order and ensures that such crises will not be  repeated. This is meant to protect and safeguard unity, enhance  Yemen's democratic process, and broaden popular participation  along the road of establishing a developed Yemeni state that  safeguards the rights of citizens and provides them with equal  opportunities. This will allow for the achievement of balanced  socioeconomic development.    The committee is still in session and continues to debate  the  draft document.</p>

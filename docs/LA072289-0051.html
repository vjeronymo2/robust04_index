			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A DANCE OF THE SPIRIT  </P> <P> Thank you for the excellent article by Chris Pasles on the Tibetan Buddhist  monks from Namgyal Monastery ("Tibetan Monks to Dance a Protest of Brutality at  Home," July 17). It is unfortunate, however, that the headline misrepresents  the monks' motivation for performing their ritual dances at UCLA and on their  forthcoming U.S. tour.  </P> <P> As the article itself indicates, Tibetan Buddhist rituals are spiritual  activities performed to eliminate negative states of mind and to generate  happiness and peace. These dances are not performed as a form of political  protest.  </P> <P> ROBYN BRENTANO  </P> <P> Program Director, Performing Arts  </P> <P> Tibet House  </P> <P> New York City  </P></p>

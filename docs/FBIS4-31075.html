			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [S.L.-signed report] </F>   [Text] The impossibility of the private sector becoming a  strong enough economic basis to compensate for the destruction  of the state-owned sector has by now become a concern. For  Tirana, the population of which has reportedly reached 500,000,  this problem has become rather pronounced. The figures made  available to us by the Tariff Office of Tirana Municipality show  that there are currently 2,322 Albanian companies employing  9,028 people, 586 foreign companies with 4,109 employees, and  1,007 joint ventures employing 4,100 people. In Tirana there  are now 26,000 people employed in the private sector. There are  also around 6,000 people trading a great variety of products  from stalls that have sprung up on Tirana's pavements.    However, unemployment in Tirana amounts to around 60,000,  not  to mention the influx into the capital from other districts,  which is estimated at 100,000 people. Yet, in this  overpopulation with a high degree of social wounds, there is a  lack of a regional development plan. This remains to be done  perhaps in the future.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Vladimir Oreshin, Pavel Spirin] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 28 Jan -- The "constructive partnership"  which Russia is offering its eastern neighbor China implies a  new, qualitatively higher level of contacts and ties between the  two states. This was stated in Beijing today by Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev at a news conference for Chinese and  foreign journalists. Replying to a question put by the  ITAR-TASS correspondent, Kozyrev explained: "We shall not  forget that China and Russia are two great regional powers, in  several regions simultaneously moreover, be it central, western,  or southeast Asia, that our regional cooperation embraces half  the world. Moreover both countries are global powers, permanent  members of the UN Security Council.    In the economy, the minister continued, saying "constructive  partnership" presupposes a transition to higher and more stable  forms of cooperation. First and foremost this applies to cross  border contacts in which, in the opinion of Andrey Kozyrev, "a  change over must be made from petty commercial deals to  long-term joint projects."    Summing up the working part of his visit to the PRC, the  Russian minister noted that in conversations with PRC chairman  Jiang Zemin, State Council Premier Li Peng, and Foreign Minister  Qian Qichen, a mutual striving to develop cooperation was  confirmed, and "the strategic, long-term nature of bilateral  mutual relations that is not subject to the vacillations of the  state of the market, the foundations of which were laid during  the visit of Russian President Boris Yeltsin."    "We have mapped out a program of mutual visits, the  culmination of which should be a trip to Moscow by PRC Chairman  Jiang Zemin," the Russian minister pointed out.</p>

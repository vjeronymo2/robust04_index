			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / VW aims to double its market share THE Volkswagen group, the largest European carmaker, is developing plans aimed at more than doubling the market share of the VW and Audi makes in the UK new car market by the late 1990s. Volkswagen acquired VAG United Kingdom, the distributor of Volkswagen and Audi vehicles in Britain, from Lonrho in December for Pounds 124m. Mr Daniel Goeudevert, deputy chairman of the Volkswagen group and chairman of the VW volume car division, outlined aggressive plans for the development of the two makes in the UK, which has been one of the German carmaker's weaker markets in Europe. He said that the VW brand would be aiming to gain a share of 7 per cent to 9 per cent by 1996/97, compared with a share last year of only 4.1 per cent. The Audi make would aim for 4 per cent to 5 per cent of UK new car sales compared with only 1.2 per cent in 1992. The German group's aggressive ambitions will cause unease among rival carmakers, whose profitability in the UK market has already been placed under heavy pressure during the protracted recession. VW faces a forecast drastic fall in sales in Germany, its most important market, in the next two years and the UK is one of the few markets expected to grow this year, albeit from a very low level. Competition is set to intensify in the UK market as the three Japanese carmakers, Nissan, Toyota and Honda, build up local production in Britain and VW's ambitions will pose a serious challenge to the established UK market leaders Ford, Vauxhall (General Motors) and Rover. Mr Goeudevert said: 'There is no reason why we should not reach in the UK the average level we have in the rest of Europe.' Together the VW and Audi makes captured about 14.7 per cent of west European new car sales last year, but held a share of only 5.2 per cent in the UK. 'VW missed the train in the past in not getting the share we did on the Continent,' said Mr Goeudevert. It is likely that the German carmaker will have to seek to increase significantly its penetration of the large fleet and company car sectors of the UK car market, which have already become the target of the Japanese car makers. Cars registered for company use account for more than half of all UK new car sales. Mr Goeudevert said that while VW sought to cut its cost base in Germany it had to continue to invest 'in the right direction'. VW working practices, Page 21</p>

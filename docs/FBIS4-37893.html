[Passage indistinct]  The forces of the mojahedin and the Islamic army aborted the  offensive of the militia in the first hours and started an  attack against their fortifications and positions. With the  help of God much success was achieved by the mojahedin. The  mojahedin were able by the conquest of Chman-e Hozori, Kasa Burj  hill, and security posts around Bala Hesar and finally of the  Bala Hesar fort, yesterday afternoon, the Golboddin-Dostam  militia suffered a heavy defeat [sentence as heard].    Bala Hesar fort was the Golboddin-Dostam militia's very  strong position. From the heights of this fort, militia fired  several times into the residential areas of Kabul, foreign  embassies, and installations of public utility. As a result of  the complete conquest of the Bala Hesar fort, militia have  suffered heavy losses. Corpses of the Dostam-Golboddin militia  litter the fort's surroundings. The forces of mojahedin and the  Islamic army were able to inflict losses on the militia as a  result of heavy weapons fire. In the course of the attack much  damage was inflicted on the militia. The precise number will be  announced later. According to a report by Bakhtar Information  Agency correspondents, mojahedin of the Harakat-e Eslami  organisation have captured large areas, including Darolaman  Palace, Doghabad, Pilawari, and a section of Khairabad hills, in  the west of Kabul, from the Golboddin militia.

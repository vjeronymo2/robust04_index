			<p>BFN     [Text] San Carlos de Bariloche (NA-DYN) -- President Carlos  Menem yesterday defended his plan to create a super-agency that  would combine much of Argentina's law-enforcement efforts in the  face of continued criticism even from Justicialist Party ranks.    The new Security Secretariat, unveiled last week, is not  intended "to suppress potential social unrest," the President  told reporters at the opening of the fourth Ibero-American  Information Science and Law Congress here.    Rather, Menem explained, the secretariat is the product of  six months of talks between himself and Interior Minister Carlos  Ruckauf. He noted that other countries (the United States,  France) and several provinces (Cordoba, Buenos Aires) already  have similar agencies.    Meanwhile in Buenos Aires retired Lieutenant Julian Licastro  remained press shy about his position as head of the future  Security Secretariat, but opponents of President Carlos Menem's  plan to create a new super-agency redoubled their efforts to  make their opinion heard.    The former military officer and ambassador to Peru met with  Interior Minister Ruckauf yesterday to analyze the structure of  the new secretariat. The agency will be charged with fighting  crime, terrorism, and drug trafficking and is to encompass the  Federal Police, Border Guard, Coast Guard, intelligence forces,  and Drug-Prevention Secretariat.    The secretariat will likely be made a full ministry  following  the reform of the Constitution.    Licasto declined to divulge details to the media following  the talks, reporting only that he would hold a press conference  at the "opportune moment."    Justicialist Deputy (Federal Capital) Miguel Angel Toma, the  head of the Lower House defence committee, met with Presidential  Chief-of-Staff Eduardo Bauza to express his reservations about  the new agency, which Menem may have to create via an executive  decree if Congress withholds its support.    "It is absolutely unviable, it has no legal basis and it  will  be quite difficult for it to provide results," Toma told the  press before meeting Bauza at Government House.    Charged San Isidro Mayor Melchor Posse, a Radical, in a  press  release: "(Menem) is more interested in purchasing  vomit-inducing gases and special weapons for suppression than in  attacking the causes of public misery."    Buenos Aires Province Radical leader Juan Manuel Casella  told  Radio Mitre that the President's plans, also solidly backed by  Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo, are "evidence of the executive  branch's hegemonic purposes."</p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Observer: No retreat for Norman Although the monk's cell was ready and waiting, Norman Lamont has decided not, after all, to go into retreat. The monastic community in question is Mount Athos in northern Greece, where the chancellor of the exchequer had been invited by Greek central bank governor Efthymios Christodoulou for a sojourn over the weekend after his make-or-break conference speech. However tempting the option might have seemed in theory, Lamont declined on the grounds of pressure of work. But in reality he may have been put off by John Gummer who took a trip to Mount Athos recently in the company of Sotiris Kouvelas, minister to the premier's office and reputedly the most devout member of the cabinet. The community, once a safe but austere refuge for Orthodox Christians in political disgrace, is still no place for the faint-hearted. The holy mountain's 20-odd monasteries still run on Byzantine time, which plays havoc with meals. The menu is usually beans and wine - meat is also banned. Pilgrims are supposed to walk from one part of the complex to another. What's more, there is a strict ban on females of any species, which is more than can be said for the Cambridge Union, where Lamont is billed to speak next Friday on a motion that 'Labour and the economy do not mix'. Interesting to see whether he cancels this engagement too.</p>

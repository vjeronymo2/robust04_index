			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / International Company News: Deficit cut to Dollars 32m at Time Warner Record operating earnings at Time Warner's publishing, music and cable-television channel businesses allowed the US entertainment group to report a net loss of Dollars 32m for the third quarter, sharply reduced from the Dollars 133m loss incurred a year ago. During the quarter, combined earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) for the group and its Time Warner Entertainment subsidiary (which reports operating results on a deconsolidated basis) reached Dollars 747m on revenues of Dollars 4.1bn, compared with Ebitda of Dollars 726m on revenues of Dollars 3.7bn a year ago. The group, which was left with a heavy debt and depreciation burden following the 1989 merger between Time and Warner, likes to focus Wall Street's attention on Ebitda as a measure of its underlying performance. Time Warner's music division posted the best results, with Ebitda of Dollars 172m compared with Dollars 132m a year earlier. Worldwide record sales and music publishing revenues were both significantly higher, with Warner Music artists such as Eric Clapton and REM releasing best-selling albums during the period. The group's publishing division also notched up record earnings from continuing operations, with Ebitda rising 20 per cent to Dollars 78m. Although the group's HBO television cable channel reported record Ebitda of Dollars 66m, up 16 per cent from 1993, Time Warner's filmed entertainment division saw the figure fall to Dollars 189m from Dollars 204m a year ago. The group said the comparison over the year was unfavourable primarily because the unit produced exceptionally strong earnings in the third quarter of 1993. Once again, earnings from cable operations declined, with Ebitda falling to Dollars 242m from Dollars 268m a year ago in response to the reduction in cable television charges imposed by Congress last year.</p>

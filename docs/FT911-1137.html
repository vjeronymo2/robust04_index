			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Corporate initiatives move individual share prices COMPANY NEWS moved individual share prices, but left bourses mostly short of inspiration yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. AMSTERDAM saw Hagemeyer and Internatio Muller suspended at Monday's closing prices of Fl 122.30 and Fl 77, before Hong Kong's First Pacific revealed that it had a 43.2 per cent stake in Internatio, and planned to merge it with Hagemeyer of which First Pacific owns 60 per cent. Internatio thwarted the takeover attempt by issuing 5.6m preference shares, but dealers were encouraged that investors were prepared to be aggressive in the face of Amsterdam's anti-takeover defences. Volker Stevin fell Fl 8, or nearly 10 per cent to Fl 74 following Monday's news that its fellow builder, HBG, will sell its stake of around 60 per cent and be allowed to buy Volker's dredging business. HGB jumped Fl 7.30 to Fl 220.30. Buhrmann Tetterode fell Fl 3.90 to Fl 56.70 on lower profits for the first quarter of 1991, and the lack of improvement in prospect for the rest of the year. The CBS Tendency index fell 0.5 to 94.6 in thin trading. FRANKFURT remained subdued. Volume only rose from DM3.6bn to DM4.2bn; the FAZ index by 1.08 to 690.08; and the DAX by 3.47 to 1,627.46. A 5 per cent decline in Bayer's first quarter profits left the shares DM1.40 higher at DM282.70 while BASF, with profits down 25 per cent at the same stage on Monday, slid another DM2.70 to DM247.50 for a two-day fall of DM7.20. Mr Reinhardt Fischer, who heads Europe ex-UK research, and the German team at Paribas Capital Markets, said that Bayer's results were as expected but that they underlined the company's better balanced, and more diversified product range vis-a-vis BASF. Just back from Germany, he said that sentiment was turning slowly for the better. The market is looking increasingly at an improving 1992 earnings prospect rather than the decline of 1991; in combination with improving industrial investment intentions, this is leaving the outlook much less gloomy than it was. Meanwhile SEL, the telecoms company owned 86 per cent by the French Alcatel group, fell DM23, or 6 per cent to DM350 as it passed the 1990 dividend on virtually non-existent profits. OSLO rose sharply, as falling interest rates, a rising oil price and optimism about the economy combined to outweigh worries about tax reforms. The all-share index gained 12.44 or 2.5 per cent to 501.27, passing the 500 level for the first time since March. Turnover grew to NKr517m from NKr302m. One analyst said that Norway had underperformed this year in spite of the relative strength of the economy, because domestic institutions had been sitting on cash. Yesterday's rise suggested that they could be back in the market. Norsk Hydro, regarded as a proxy for the market, gained NKr6 to NKr190.5. Aker rose NKr4 to NKr109 after announcing the purchase of a US marine engineering company. STOCKHOLM saw Ericsson weaken ahead of the publication of its first-quarter earnings. The free B shares lost SKr2 to SKr189. After hours Ericsson said profit had fallen 14 per cent, at the low end of market expectations. Trading in the share accounted for SKr22m of the total SKr343m. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 1.0 to 1,041.9. COPENHAGEN rose on a larger than expected Danish trade surplus in March, the CSE index adding another 1.03 to 350.34. DDL, which owns two-sevenths of Scandinavian Airlines, rose DKr100 to DKr2,730 on talk that SAS might sell part of its stakes in Continental Airlines, and the Chilean airline, Lan Chile. MADRID's general index rose 1.36 to 280.04 in turnover of about Pta10bn, down from Pta11bn. Focsa was suspended at Monday's closing price of Pta14,700. The construction company, owned by the Koplowitz sisters, is to be merged with the sisters' Construcciones y Contratas (Conycon) - a move that one analyst said made strategic sense. MILAN fell in thin trading on fears that the new government could come unstuck over budget discussions. The Comit index fell 4.21 to 581.69 in turnover estimated at below Monday's L125bn. Fiat fell back after Monday's rally on hopes that the 1990 dividend would be maintained. The stock was weighed down by news that its domestic new car deliveries fell 15.5 per cent in April, and 16.3 per cent in the first four months. Fiat closed L47 lower at L5,399. Cir, Mr Carlo De Benedetti's holding company, lost only L11 to L2,749 in spite of a cut in dividend and a sharp drop in 1990 results. The share is being supported by relief that the long battle for the publisher Mondadori has ended. PARIS approached two days of holidays in a quiet mood, with the CAC 40 index up 1.41 at 1,830.18. Rhone-Poulenc investment certificates gained FFr7.80 to FFr379.80 after Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, its US arm, announced first-quarter results, a higher dividend and a two-for-one stock split. Takeover speculation focused on CSEE, the electronics equipment company, which jumped FFr17.10 or 7.3 per cent to FFr252 on 208,630 shares - or 23 per cent of the company's capital - including one block of 156,080 at FFr260 each. Carrefour, the supermarket chain, rose FFr48 or 2.5 per cent to FFr1,995 after reporting better-than-expected four-month sales. CCF lost FFr4.70 or 2.8 per cent to FFr165. The bank said that economic conditions were too uncertain to make a 1991 forecast.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - MAY 7  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                         Hourly changes   Open     10 am    11 am     Noon     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm   Close  1126.13  1123.24  1125.61  1125.01  1125.52  1126.01  1126.30  1125.75             Day's High 1127.65            Day's Low 1123.10         May 3       May 2      May 1      Apr 30      Apr 29        1129.77     1128.32    1110.32*    1111.29    1120.75  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90) * Indicative.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Gardening: 'Plan in May and go away' is good advice - Viburnums are the lime-loving alternative to rhododendrons, says Robin Lane Fox, who has his favourites EARLY IN May, you do not want to be living on my sort of soil. It cannot grow azaleas, camellias hate it, and a rhododendron will not survive for more than a month. Elsewhere in Britain, plantations, woods and glens are near their best for this convenient holiday weekend. Sometimes, the best is too lurid; I have never reconciled myself to the bright rhododendrons which have intruded on the great 18th century garden at Stourhead. Elsewhere, the mauves and sugar pinks have been kept under control and the light, damp and shading make an Oriental flora look at home in Scotland. On lime, the rest of us have two options: to go visiting or to find an alternative which will put up with the conditions. This weekend, visiting is extremely tempting. The great gardens on acid soil are slightly ahead of themselves and near their best already: they include the Isabella plantation in London's Richmond Park, the Savill gardens in Windsor, Exbury or Leonardslee in the south, or Bodnant in north Wales. If you cannot grow it, view it: you do not have to live with all the dreary foliage out of season. In gardens, too, 'plan in May and go away.' Back home, gardeners on a lime soil need a mid-May alternative. In recent years, I have been looking for shrubs which can be clipped and trained into small pseudo-trees, or bushes on standard stems. It strikes me that the state of the art is to invent a touch of style which puts familiar plants in an original light. Shrubs on stems like standards give class, quality and scope for adventure. They need not be expensive, and I rather suspect that we have still scarcely scratched the surface of the possibilities. Mercifully, the best of them flower in the mid-May gap and will tolerate lime, compensating for absent azaleas. In the retarded Cotswolds, we have yet to see the best of this year's lilacs but, when they come, mine will be small trees, maintained at eye level by light pruning. Lilacs work wonderfully as specimen standards, spaced down a long border or used as upright sentinels instead of yet another columnar cherry. Admittedly, they are greedy shrubs which compete for good soil in a border; but when lucky gardeners are enjoying their white haze of rhododendron Loderi, these trained lilacs are no small compensation. My favourite is the purple and white-striped lilac Sensation, which grows into a tree about 6 ft high, but any of the heavy double purples and single sky-blues are almost as good if you avoid varieties of maximum spread and vigour. Take an ordinary bush of lilac; thin it down to one single stem; prevent it from making top growth until the stem is about 4 ft high - and then allow it to develop a cluster of shoots in a head which will be a substitute for any good camellia on alkaline soil. Honeysuckles respond admirably to the same styling if you tie one main stem on to a 4 ft cane and allow only the top growth to develop through a circular metal plant support fixed at the cane's summit. Early and late Dutch honeysuckles are excellent candidates for this job, but my favourite for mid-May is the heavily-scented Graham Thomas form, the pale, creamy blooms of which are just bursting into their stickily-sweet flower. Limit it to one stem; then, let it spread into a head which you trim without mercy next month after flowering. At a Gloucestershire nursery, I have been watching bushes of the white-flowered Choisya, trained similarly into the shape of little evergreen trees. They seem to work remarkably well and will hold their scented white blooms at the level of your face, leaving you to decide if you really like the smell. Here, too, if you can be patient for two or three years, you need buy only an ordinary shrub. Train it on a single stem up a cane and prevent any side shoots until it has developed the shape of a standard rose tree. In warm towns, wisterias are bursting with flower already and will work marvellously in the same tree format. But, lovely though they are, I think the best of all candidates are this month's viburnums. In May, viburnums are the lime-lovers' definitive answer to woods of enviable rhododendrons. As bushes, the most refined forms are the named varieties of viburnum Carlesii: Dawn Aurora, which have exceptional elegance of bud, leaf and pinkish white flowers, the star performers in the family. As standards or small trees, they are slow-growing and perhaps too refined. At the other extreme, evergreen forms like the obliging Burkwoodii and Park Farm Hybrid are too vigorous for tree training. The forms with horizontal branches are completely unsuitable, lovely though they are in May. Juddii is a much better bet, more robust than Carlesii and responsive to light clipping. Personally, I have majored on viburnum Carlcephalum and, in its fourth year, I am delighted with it. Among the hybrids, it has exceptional vigour. It has the biggest heads of flower plus the usual gust of scent, and its leaf is sufficiently grey not to look too coarse. Nonetheless, a refined taste suspects it of being vulgar. It is a typical breeders' variety, bigger and bolder than the delicate parents. Still, I am sufficiently vulgar to like it as my garden's main backbone, growing into the shape of standards. Do not judge it when the heads of flower are still in bud and have a drab buff tone to them. When they open, the effect is all white, luminous across a lawn when dusk descends on a bank holiday. I have clipped eight bushes of this variety into tall, upright shapes by trimming them after flowering. Like almost all forms of viburnum, it will reach you with one little trap. Nursery growers have grafted it on to much coarser stock. You need to watch carefully for stems with the wrong leaves and a russet-brown colouring, and to cut them off immediately below ground level. Otherwise, Carlcephalum gets on with the job. As a surrogate tree, I recommend it from happy experience. By a pleasant coincidence, every one of these shrubs for tree training reaches its best in mid to late May and tolerates lime in the soil. With ingenuity gardeners can, therefore, make up for the impossibility of azaleas. In nurseries, shrubs in standard shapes tend to sell for Pounds 20 or more, as if they are virtuoso features. Actually, they are dead easy. And although you will still want to visit our public glades of May-flowering shrubs from the east, you will find on returning home that these contrived little trees show old friends in a new light in any garden, however small.</p>

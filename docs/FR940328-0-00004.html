The controls necessary to implement the mandatory U.N. arms embargo against South Africa remain. In addition, restrictions on certain exports to the South African military and police continue. This final rule amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by revising the export licensing policy for exports to South African military and police entities in the following ways: By clarifying exemptions from general prohibitions on certain technology and software; by revising policy to permit the consideration of certain license applications; and by updating the list of South African military and police entities in the special country policies and provisions. These changes, while not diminishing U.S. compliance with the U.N. mandatory embargo against South Africa, and while maintaining U.S. ability to implement U.N. voluntary controls on certain exports to the South African military and police, will allow U.S. businesses to begin to compete with foreign suppliers, who are no longer bound by similar restrictions in their own countries. Thus, although it will likely result in an increase in export license applications submitted, this rule will be generally beneficial to U.S. exporters. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This rule is effective March 28, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  David Schlechty, Office of Technology and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, Telephone: (202) 482&hyph;4252.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In conformity with the United Nations Security Council Resolutions of 1977 and 1986, the United States maintains an embargo on the export of arms, munitions and military equipment, and items used in their manufacture and maintenance to the Republic of South Africa, as well as on certain items to the South African military or police that have a military capacity and are intended for military purposes. These controls continue. Beyond these controls related to U.N. Security Council resolutions, the United States has also maintained an embargo on virtually all exports to South African military and police entities. The recent historic political changes in the Republic of South Africa argue against the continuation of such global restrictions. This rule modifies existing controls to allow certain exports to the South African military and police under an individual validated license. For example, applications to export food, medicine, or items to meet emergency humanitarian needs, prevent acts of unlawful interference with international civil aviation, or counter international narcotics trafficking will generally receive favorable consideration on a case-by-case basis. Applications for export of items relating to arms, munitions, military equipment and their manufacture or maintenance, or that have a military capacity and are intended for military purposes, will be subject to either a strict or general policy of denial. All other exports will be considered on a case-by-case basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regardless of expanded opportunities to export under an individual validated license, return, repair or replacement commodities may not be exported under General License GLR at this time. Therefore, exporters should include an allowance for replacement parts on their original license applications. Repairs should be arranged in-country when practical, since GLR will not be available for returning the item to South Africa after repair elsewhere, and the need for a validated license could delay the return.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, this rule clarifies the opportunity to use General License GTDU for exports destined to South African military and police entities of sales data that are the minimum necessary to support a proposal; operation technical data that are the minimum necessary to operate equipment authorized for export; or software updates (bug fixes) that do not enhance the capabilities of the initially authorized package. While such exports have been allowed under the provisions of &sect;779.4(e), the availability of GTDU for these shipments was obscured by &sect;771.2(c)(11), which broadly prohibits use of general licenses for exports to South African military and police entities. This rule clarifies the exemption of sales data, operation data and software updates from the general prohibitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> General License GIT may now be used for shipments in transit through the United States destined to the Republic of South Africa, provided that the commodities are not related to arms and munitions or destined for military and police entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

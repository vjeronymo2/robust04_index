			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Government warned on Budget strategy LABOUR yesterday warned the government not to threaten economic recovery by increasing taxes in next week's Budget, calling instead for a temporary holiday from National Insurance contributions for employers who increased their workforces. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said Mr Norman Lamont should introduce a grants scheme for small businesses to enable them to expand and invest. It could be funded by closing a range of tax loopholes. Labour calculated that 400,000 jobs were at risk over the rest of the year.</p>

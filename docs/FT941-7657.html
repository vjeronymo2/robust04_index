			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Howl of rage over dog complaint Madrid's conservative city council has reacted angrily to a survey suggesting its pavements are the most dog-fouled in Europe, although the same survey said Madrid's Atocha station was Europe's cleanest, writes Bronwen Maddox. The comparison of nine European capitals by the Tidy Britain Group, a London-based charity campaigning against litter, ranked London as the cleanest city and Athens the dirtiest. Amsterdam had the most graffiti, Rome the most fly-posting and Berlin the most vandalism. Paris's Boulevard Haussmann was ranked Europe's dirtiest shopping street. The councillor in charge of cleaning Madrid said the report was biased, that Berne was much cleaner than London and that Amsterdam was dirtier than Madrid.</p>

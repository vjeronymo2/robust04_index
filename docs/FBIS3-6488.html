The article quotes the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as  saying:    "The unity and cohesion of the party will be powerful when  love for revolutionary comrades underlies it."    The paper further says:    Revolutionary comradeship is noble ideological and mental  feelings between revolutionary comrades who are fighting in the  same ranks to achieve common purpose and ideal under the  guidance of the leader.    Our revolutionary comradeship is, above all, a major source  of the close unity of the entire people around the illustrious  leader in ideology and purpose and in-morality and obligation.    For the revolutionaries, the leader is a great comrade and a  lifesaver who takes care of their destiny and future with full  responsibility. Loyalty to the leader is the supreme  manifestation of revolutionary comradeship.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a great comrade and  a  great father of our revolutionary soldiers and people. The  Korean people follow the dear leader with unshakable conviction  and a sense of obligation, holding him in high esteem as the  centre of unity, the centre of leadership.    Our singlehearted unity has an invincible might as we fully  display revolutionary comradeship, resolved to share the same  idea and destiny with the dear leader.    Unprecedented in history is such singlehearted unity based  on  revolutionary comradeship between the leader and the soldiers in  which the leader loves and believes in his soldiers and the  soldiers trust and remain loyal and devoted to him.    Our revolutionary comradeship also unites all members of  society in a big harmonious family by turning the relations  between them into true comradely bonds.    Being comradely love based on loyalty to the dear leader,  our  revolutionary comradeship closely rallies all the members of  society like kinsmen.    An increasing number of people unhesitatingly donate their  blood and flesh and cover handgrenades with their bodies on the  point of explosion to save their comrades. These noble traits  are a proud reality of our country today.    If they viewed the relations among people from the viewpoint  of equivalent compensations, they would not have saved their  downing comrades at the sacrifice of their lives. And young men  and women would not have volunteered to marry disabled soldiers  and adopted orphaned children and brought old men with no one to  support them to look after them as their family members.    As they value comradeship most, all our people are true  revolutionary comrades who share the same destiny on the road of  the revolution.    In the course of fighting under the guidance of the dear  leader, comradely love is regarded as most precious and our  singlehearted unity is unbreakable.    With this powerful weapon, we are firmly defending  Korean-style socialism and triumphantly advancing the revolution  and construction, decisively frustrating any challenge of the  imperialists.</p>

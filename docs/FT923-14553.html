			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Lecturer takes test case to the Lords THE Lords yesterday began hearing a test case to decide whether senior university lecturers can rely on keeping their jobs until retirement without fear of being made redundant on cost-cutting grounds. Five law lords will hear three days of legal argument in an appeal by Professor Edgar Page, 61, of Hull University, who in October 1988 became the first tenured lecturer to be made compulsorily redundant Prof Page's case, which is backed by the Association of University Teachers, is thought to hold job security implications for up to 18,000 senior university staff. The contracts of younger staff contain redundancy provisions. Prof Page was granted a tenured appointment at Hull in 1966 to run until a retirement age of 67. He claims the university's decision to make him redundant because of its financial difficulties was unlawful because it was contrary to its own charter and statutes, which state that staff can be dismissed only for incompetence or gross misconduct. The Court of Appeal upheld the university's case and ruled last year that it did have the right to dismiss Prof Page. He is now seeking to overturn that ruling in the Lords. The law lords are expected to reserve their decision at the end of the hearing and give judgment later.</p>

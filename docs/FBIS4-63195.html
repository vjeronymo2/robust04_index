			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ilya Bulavinov report under the "Generals on Military </F> Budget" rubric: "The Army and Hope Are the Last To Die"]    [Text] The Army does not indulge the press with  information too much. This is the reason why a news conference  by a high- ranking commander always promises something  interesting. The meeting with journalists by Colonel General  Vladimir Semenov, commander in chief of the Army, which is  scheduled for today, is doubly interesting: it will be held on  no specific occasion, but against the background of shock  experienced by the top brass following the allocation of what  the Defense Ministry sees as a negligible sum for the military.  General Semenov himself is known for his views that have been  fairly frequently at odds with Pavel Grachev's, in particular,  on ways of military organization in Russia.    The officially stated subject of the news conference -- "The  State and Development Prospects of the Army in the Conditions of  Military Reform" -- scarcely holds any interest for a wider  range of readers. Obviously, following cuts in the military  budget "the state and development prospects" of the Army are far  from bright. All the more so because these troops will receive a  lesser percentage of the defense appropriations than others.  Ironically, General Semenov, who formerly fiercely opposed the  current contract system of manpower acquisition, will evidently  have to be the first to halt this practice because of a lack of  funds.    What is of much greater interest, however, is how General  Semenov will comment on the overall military budget, not just  the army budget. Observers do not rule out that he, being a  well-known opponent of Pavel Grachev in military affairs, may  express the opinion held by a part of the top brass displeased  with the defense minister's inability to squeeze out sufficient  money for the Armed Forces. If General Semenov dares criticize  the minister's policy, this may mean that a serious opposition  to Grachev has emerged in the Armed Forces. To criticize  without the appropriate support would be rather dangerous even  for so high-ranking a commander: recently even multi-star  generals live in constant wait for drastic reshuffles.    If General Semenov does no overstep the limits of the news  conference agenda, however, this will also be full of meaning.  The refusal to exploit as advantageous a subject as the budget  to criticize an opponent will prove that to all appearances the  battle for the Armed Forces' money is not over yet and the  generals still pin their hopes on Grachev. If this is so, any  criticism of Grachev can be put off until better times, for the  infighting could only harm "the common cause:" A high-ranking  ministry official told your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that  "the main thing is to get the money, and what will happen  afterward is our own business." KOMMERSANT-DAILY will report the  results of the news conference tomorrow.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 25 Apr (AFP) -- A group of Cubans,  comprising three or four adults and a child, entered the  Canadian Embassy in Havana by force this morning and requested  asylum, it was learned from a diplomatic source.    Defying security guards, the Cubans forced their way into  the  embassy, located in the residential neighborhood of Miramar  (west of Havana) at approximately 0900 (1300 GMT). One of the  Cubans who tried to enter, however, was barred entry, according  to the same source.    A U.S. television crew from Miami, which arrived in Havana  to  cover The Nation and the Emigrants Conference, which for three  days brought together representatives of the Cuban Government  and Cubans living overseas, was in front of the embassy and  filmed the incident, the same source reported.    In recent months, several Cubans have attempted on various  occasions to enter the embassy garden, which is protected by a  large gate and guarded around the clock by several policemen.    The last time something like this happened was in late  January, when eight Cubans sought asylum at the residence of the  Belgian ambassador in Havana. In view of the Cuban authorities'  refusal to allow them to exit the country, they did not leave  the residence until one month later, on 24 February, after  obtaining the government's promise that they would not be  prosecuted.</p>

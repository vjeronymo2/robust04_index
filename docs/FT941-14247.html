			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Branson lottery bid in place soon Mr Richard Branson's Lottery Foundation is expected to announce within the next few days that all its financing is in place to mount a bid to run the National Lottery. There was some speculation that the foundation might have difficulty raising the capital because all the profits from the lottery would go to a charitable foundation. Agreement on financing has already been reached in principle and the legal details are set to be tied up by next week. The foundation, co-founded by Mr Branson, Virgin chairman, and Lord Young, the former trade and industry secretary, is expected to be one of eight bidders for the national licence. At the formal launch of the foundation yesterday, the organisation published an opinion poll saying that 72 per cent of the British public wanted all the profits from the lottery to go to good causes. Just 23 per cent believed the operating company should keep profits for itself. Around 64 per cent said they would be more likely to play the lottery if the profits went to good causes. Bids have to be in by February 14, and it is estimated that in three or four years the lottery could have annual revenues of between Pounds 3bn and Pounds 4bn.</p>

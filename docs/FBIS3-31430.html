He conveyed a message addressed by the  Ministry of Industry to the Confederation of Mining Trade  Unions, in which Industry Minister Dumitru Popescu agreed to  receive a five-man delegation representing the Lignitul Mining  Trade Union Federation at 1600 tomorrow. The two union leaders  acknowledged the message and said that future labor action would  depend on the outcome of these talks.    The Gorj County prefect told our correspondent that he  expects the majority of the miners currently present in Targu  Jiu to go home and await the results of the talks at the  Ministry of Industry headquarters.    The strike organized in Targu Jiu by the Lignitul Mining  Trade Union Federations proceeded today in a tense atmosphere,  as the participants were expecting some message to come from the  government or the Ministry of Industry, our correspondent Titus  Stoichitoiu reports. The several thousand miners that went  there from various mining units affiliated to this trade union  federation alternated between the headquarters of the Brown Coal  Mining Public Corporation and that of the Gorj County Prefect's  Office, accompanying Miron Cosma, who by noon was joined by a  group of mining union leaders from the Jiu Valley.    In the evening they told the miners that it had been agreed  that tomorrow a four-man delegation of the Lignitul Mining Trade  Union Federation, together with Ilie Ciortan, the chairman of  the Jiu Valley Miners' Trade Union League, should go for  negotiations to the headquarters of the Ministry of Industry.    The miners were disappointed by the news and requested that  all of them go to Bucharest. However, they were calmed down by  Miron Cosma, who said that it would be better to wait for the  results of the negotiations. Thus, they agreed to return  tomorrow -- if possible, in greater numbers -- to the same place  next to the Targu Jiu Mining Public Corporation, and if by 1600  the demands are not solved, they should leave for the capital.    The chairman of Romania's Mining Trade Union Confederation,  Miron Cosma, also said, quote, we will not give in under any  circumstances. This is the last chance that we will give those  who are responsible for the solution of our demands, unquote,  after which he appealed to the miners to go home.</p>

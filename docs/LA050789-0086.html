			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A judge in New Caledonia charged a hard-line separatist with murder in the  killing of two senior leaders of the independence movement in the French South  Pacific territory. Andre Tangopi was charged in the shooting deaths of  Jean-Marie Tjibaou, leader of the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front,  and his top aide, Yeiwene Yeiwene. Police did not say what role Tangopi, who  was wounded in an exchange of gunfire after the assassination, played in the  attack. The two leaders were shot and killed Thursday by Djubelly Wea, who was  then killed by Tjibaou's bodyguards. A witness has said five or six gunmen  participated in the assassination.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["All Matters Must Be Solved on Principle of National </F> Independence"--KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 28 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  comes out with a by-lined article calling for solving all  matters for national reunification on the principle of national  independence.    Noting that to adhere to the principle of national  independence is an urgent demand for removing the danger of war  created on the Korean peninsula and defending the exisoence of  the nation, the article says:    Keeping to the principle of national independence  constitutes  the starting point in achieving national reunification, the long  cherished desire of the fellow countrymen, and establishing  sovereignty of the nation throughout the country.    Outside forces which divided our country will never make a  present of reunification to our people.    If some forces intend to attain a sinister aim in reliance  on  the strength of outside forces, negating the principle of  national independence, it may cause grave consequences of  victimizing the whole nation at the hands of outside forces.    The reunification our nation wants is one to realize the  independence of the nation, not one to live, shackled to others.    The principle of national independence should be thoroughly  observed to realize the cause of national reunification in  conformity with the interests and demand of our nation.    It is a lesson of history that if one depends on foreign  forces and their interference is allowed, he will find himself  in a miserable position in which he is compelled to study the  pleasure of foreign forces even at the place of North-South  dialogue and can not do anything for the nation, restricted by  foreign forces.    Anyone who wants to establish the sovereignty of the nation  throughout the country by reunifying the country must naturally  take the patriotic stand of demolishing the wall of division,  joining hands with the fellow countrymen on the principle of  national independence.    Of importance at present in applying the principle of  national independence is to thoroughly reject the idea of  dependence on foreign forces, take the position of national  independence and rely on the forces of national independence,  not depending on outside forces.    Dependence on foreign forces is the road to division, war  and  national ruin, and only national independence is the road to  reunification, peace and prosperity.    If the North and the South achieve peace and reunification  by  joining hands with each other, firmly adhering to the principle  of national independence, the dignity and might of a reunified  Korea will shine brilliantly all over the world.</p>

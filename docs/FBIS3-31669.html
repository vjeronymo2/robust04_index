			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brno, South Moravia Feb 22 (CTK) -- Slovakia has  agreed on mutual recognition of national decisions and  certificates required for import only for goods where the same  norms are in effect on both sides of the Czech-Slovak border.    Slovakia thus rejected the Czech proposal of mutual  recognition of decisions and certificates for all commodities  regardless of differences in state norms.    The decision was reached at a meeting of representatives of  both the Czech Republic [CR] and Slovakia today, led by Michal  Tosovsky and Lubomir Sutek, chairmen of the National Offices for  Technical Normalisation, Metrology and State Testing.    As regards food products, as from April 1 the Slovak  Agricultural and Food Inspectorate will issue a single  certificate valid for Slovakia. The decisions taken by the  Czech authorities will form the basis of the issuing of the  certificate.    Until March 31 the Slovak customs authorities will require  the same documents it required before February 11, when the  Slovak customs authorities announced that food products without  a Slovak quality certificate would not be allowed to enter the  country.</p>

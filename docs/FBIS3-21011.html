The Artemis experimental satellite will be a precursor of  future European DRS [Data Relay System] satellite-relays. It  will be used to test and in-orbit qualify new payload  technologies for transmitting low and high output data between  ground stations in Europe and low orbit satellites.    As partner of the prime contractor, Alenia Spazio, Alcatel  Espace will develop the direct relay that receives data coming  from ground stations at 30 GHz [gigaherz] for S (2 GHz) and Ka  band (23 GHz) to users such as the Spot 4 or the future European  polar platforms Envisat and Metop. Alcatel Espace will also  build part of the return relay which receives data from these  same operators and retransmits same to the ground at 20 GHz.  Under this contract, the Toulouse premises of Alcatel Espace  will integrate equipment made by itself and by various European  firms such as SIAR (Italy), ANT (Germany), COMDEV (United  Kingdom) and, more particularly, by such Alcatel space-oriented  firms as Alcatel Espacio (Spain) and Alcatel Bell (Belgium).</p>

			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUMOR AND SEXISM  </P> <P> Concerning the Nov. 26 review of the rap album "Arsenio Hall Presents Chunky A  -- Large &amp; in Charge":  </P> <P> Dennis Hunt writes, "Some women, though, won't be able to see the humor for the  sexism." In this one sentence, Hunt makes at least three facile and  inappropriate assumptions.  </P> <P> 1 -- Fortunately for all of us, Hunt would not have been able to make the same  cavalier comments in this context: "Some blacks won't be able to see the humor  for the racism." Hunt and his editors are wrong to assume that offensive and  degrading references are generally more acceptable when applied to women.  </P> <P> 2 -- The large contingent of people disturbed by derogatory references to any  group includes men as well as women.  </P> <P> 3 -- It's not that people have trouble seeing the humor in sexism or racism or  any other oppressive thinking; most just don't think there's any humor in them  to see.  </P> <P> LYNN BAILEY MELTZER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

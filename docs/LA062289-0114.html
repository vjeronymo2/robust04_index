			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALL-STAR TEAM COLLECTS 15 HITS IN 13-10 VICTORY  </P> <P> A team of Ventura County all-star baseball players outslugged a similar team  from the Westside, 13-10, Sunday at UCLA's Jackie Robinson Stadium.  </P> <P> Ventura County had 15 hits, including three by Buena's Tom Lunsford, who hit a  two-run home run in the first inning and finished with four runs batted in. Rio  Mesa's Steve Soliz delivered a key blow in the fifth inning, blasting a  three-run double to give Ventura County a 6-4 lead.  </P> <P> Ventura County snapped a 7-7 tie with six runs in the eighth. Lunsford, Simi  Valley's Terry Hill and Jesse Anguiano, Royal's Jason Jones and Westlake's  Derek Tamburro each had run-scoring singles in the inning.  </P> <P> Five Ventura County pitchers issued 14 walks, but Camarillo's Steve Biggs went  the final 2 2/3 innings to earn the victory. Biggs was also the winning pitcher  last week for the South in the Ventura County All-Star game.  </P> <P> With the bases loaded and one out in the third, Rio Mesa's Jon Rust replaced  starter Rich Langford of Simi Valley and struck out two batters in a row.  Jones, the center fielder, made several fine defensive plays.  </P></p>

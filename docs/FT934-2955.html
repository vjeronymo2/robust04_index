			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (1): No let-up in the pace - The collapse of the Volvo-Renault merger has created fresh turmoil in the European truck industry. Overall, the market is continuing to shrink, but a strong upturn in demand has occurred in the US and recovery is in sight elsewhere The world market for commercial vehicles is continuing to shrink, under the burden of contracting demand in Europe and Japan. Japan is enduring its fifth year in succession of declining truck output, while sales in west Europe have suffered an unbroken four years of decline. The crisis in the European truck market has intensified this year with sales set to fall by around a quarter. In North America the picture is brighter. The market has turned from famine to feast, as the fortunes of the truck industry continue to follow their traditional wild fluctuations. Some US manufacturers are now struggling to keep pace with the strong upturn in demand, with production up for the second year running by around 19 per cent. US output of heavy duty trucks is expected to exceed 153,000 this year, the highest level for 12 years. Several leading European truck makers, notably Mercedes-Benz, Volvo and Renault, have a strong presence in North America, and the rapid financial recovery of the US operations is now helping to support the parent companies as they face mounting losses in Europe. Mercedes-Benz, Volvo and Scania are also benefiting from an upturn in the Brazilian truck market, where they are the dominant producers. Fluctuating market cycles, heavy investment demands and intensifying competition are allowing no let-up in the pace of rationalisation and concentration in the world industry. The restructuring has been most intense in Europe, where tens of thousands of jobs are being eliminated. Several producers including Mercedes, Iveco and Renault Vehicules Industriels are in loss. The restructuring process is proving unpredictable, however, and fresh turmoil has been created in the European truck industry by the collapse this month of the much-heralded merger between Volvo of Sweden and Renault, the French state-owned vehicle maker, which had been set to create the world's second largest heavy truck and bus maker and the only producer able to challenge the volumes of Mercedes, the world leader. At the same time, the recession in Europe has claimed its most notable victim this year with the financial collapse of Daf, the Dutch commercial vehicle maker. Daf plunged into receivership under the burden of debts of Fl 3bn and accumulated losses of Fl 880m in the three years to end-1992. However, many of the old Daf group's operations have survived, although they have been drastically rationalised with the elimination of more than half of the previous workforce. The rescue was led by the Dutch and Flemish governments which are now the majority owners of the newly formed Daf Trucks. This company no longer owns any UK operations other than distribution, whereas it previously included UK van and truck assembly, axle and components manufacturing and significant parts distribution in the wake of its takeover of the Leyland Vehicles business in the second half of the 1980s. The UK operations have also gradually been rescued individually from receivership, however, by a combination of management buy-outs and buy-ins, and they are still linked with Daf Trucks through long-term supply agreements. The Daf brand - Leyland Daf in the UK - still commands around 7 per cent of the European heavy truck market, and in spite of the severity of the recession, continues its battle against bigger rivals, which in some cases still confront restructuring challenges. The greatest uncertainty now faces Volvo Truck and Renault Vehicules Industriels, the commercial vehicle operations of the Swedish and French manufacturers. The two groups, which have been linked through a far- reaching alliance for the last three years, were set to complete a full merger on January 1 with the establishment of a unified management structure. Amid great drama the merger has been halted, however, because of the combined opposition of leading Volvo institutional shareholders and the group's senior management. As the two groups have already taken many important steps to combine their operations and because they are bound together through significant minority shareholdings - Volvo and Renault still hold 45 per cent stakes in their respective truck and bus operations - the failure of the merger plan has plunged them into serious difficulties. The two managements now face an agonising period of reappraisal, as they seek to examine what can be saved from their existing network of collaborative projects, which activities have been rendered impossible by the breakdown of trust between the organisations, and which areas may lend themselves to future collaboration with other rivals among the dwindling corps of the world's vehicle makers. Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the former Volvo chairman, has declared that 'the alliance will not remain. It will be dismantled by a Renault management which has lost its confidence in Volvo. To dissolve the alliance will require time, energy and will be demoralising.' Understandably, Mr Louis Schweitzer, chairman of Renault and the man who had shared Mr Gyllenhammar's vision for building Europe's second largest vehicle maker, has reacted with more caution. The choices facing the two companies are bleak, as the fiercely competitive landscape of the global vehicle industry, that encouraged the two companies to look at merger as a road to survival in the next century, has not changed. The world's car and commercial vehicle makers are still haunted by overcapacity, minimal growth in demand, continuous upward pressure on product development costs, increasing price competition and the need to overhaul radically their components and materials supplier bases to reduce components costs. The number of independent European manufacturers of heavy trucks has fallen dramatically in the past two decades from 40 in 1965 to 20 in 1980 and to only 10 in 1992. In trucks Volvo and Renault were making heavier weather of the alliance than in the car sector, but they had still embarked on a number of joint development projects for basic components (such as engines and transmissions), as well as on broad co-operation in procurement and research. The two groups had planned to establish a 'common architecture' for families of engines, which would lead to joint development of engine components. Common specifications were to be developed for rear axles and gearboxes. Production and procurement were to be co-ordinated to reduce the unit costs of components. From Renault's perspective, the merger was particularly important in commercial vehicles, where Volvo is stronger. Studies to assess the benefits had suggested that cost savings of up to FFr42bn could be achieved by the year 2000 from the combined car and commercial vehicle operations because of economies of scale in production, combined R&amp;D efforts and joint purchasing programmes. Renault and Volvo must now examine the financial weakness of the French group's truck operations and the Swedish group's car division. Both 'require significant equity injections in the near future to recapitalise their balance sheets following substantial losses over the last few years,' according to recent Volvo statements to its shareholders. As the two groups seek to limit the damage from the failed merger they can expect little help from the European market. Truck sales (above 6 tonnes gross vehicle weight) have been falling for four years from a peak of 302,000 in 1989 to a forecast 197,000 this year. Mr Rudolf Rupprecht, chief executive of MAN Nutzfahrzeuge, Germany's second largest truck maker, warned recently that sales next year were unlikely to show any significant recovery with registrations expected to be virtually unchanged at around 199,000. The pick-up in demand through the rest of the decade was also expected to be subdued with sales reaching only 239,000 by 2000, said Mr Rupprecht, although forecasts from elsewhere in the industry have been less cautious. Some comfort can be drawn from the UK, however, where the recovery from the depth of recession has been accelerating in recent months with overall truck registrations rising by 15 per cent in the first 11 months.</p>

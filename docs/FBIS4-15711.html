			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By UKRINFORM correspondent Viktor Demidenko for TASS] </F>   [Text] Kiev, 10 Apr -- "I think that today, despite the  imperfection of the law on elections which is a relic of the  former Soviet system, we will elect a new parliament which,  guided by the law, will take government into its hands and will  work for reforms, for democracy, for an independent state,"  Ukraine President Leonid Kravchuk told journalists at a polling  station today immediately after voting.    Speaking of the presidential elections on 26 June, Leonid  Kravchuk noted that he is personally not against them being  held. However, laws on the status of the president, on his  powers, on the structure of bodies of power must be adopted  first. Leonid Kravchuk stressed that unless these legislative  acts are adopted, he will not stand for the post of head of  state. He noted, moreover, that if only representative  functions are delegated to the president, then, in his opinion,  such a head of state is not necessary.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the above, FRA is revising &sect;234.3 to apply to all freight, passenger and scenic railroads which are part of the general system of transportation. Because the present definition of ``highway-rail grade crossing'' contained in &sect;234.5 includes both private and public crossings, no change is necessary to provide that this part applies to both private and public crossings over railroads which are subject to the rule. As a consequence, private and public crossings over general system railroads will be covered by this part. Additionally, this part will apply to all non-insular passenger railroads off the general system. FRA notes that a passenger railroad off the general system may be considered non-insular under FRA's listed factors, but have only private grade crossings on its line of railroad. Because of the non-insular status of the railroad, the private crossings will be subject to this rule. However, if based on an analysis of the listed factors which determine insularity, a tourist operation is considered to be insular, private crossings on its line would not be subject to this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Final Rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section provides that this part applies to all railroads except a railroad that exclusively operates freight trains only on track which is not part of the general railroad system of transportation, rail rapid transit operations conducted over track that is used exclusively for that purpose and that is not part of the general railroad system of transportation, or a passenger railroad that operates trains only on track inside an installation that is insular.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph 234.4&blank;Preemptive Effect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FRA proposed adding this section to Part 234 to inform the public as to FRA's views regarding the preemptive effect of these rules. While the presence or absence of such a section does not in itself affect the preemptive effect of this part, it informs the public concerning the statutory provision which does govern the preemptive effect of these rules. Section 20106 of title 49 of the United States Code, (formerly Section 205 of the Safety Act (45 U.S.C. 434)) provides that all regulations prescribed by the Secretary relating to railroad safety preempt any State law, regulation, or order, covering the same subject matter, except a provision directed at an essentially local safety hazard that is not incompatible with a federal law, regulation, or order and that does not unreasonably burden interstate commerce.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The California Public Utilities Commission commented that the ``Federal regulations do not explain the relationship between the FRA rules and the various state rail-highway crossing regulatory agency rules. Federal rules which preempt state regulation should clearly define a state regulatory agency's role.'' FRA views the terms of 49 U.S.C. 20106 as explaining such relationships. Any state regulatory agency rules covering the same subject matter as these regulations issued today are preempted. However, section 20106 provides that a State may adopt or continue in force an additional or more stringent law, rule, regulation, or order, relating to railroad safety when necessary to eliminate or reduce an essentially local safety hazard, and when not incompatible with any Federal law, rule, regulation, or order, and when not creating an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

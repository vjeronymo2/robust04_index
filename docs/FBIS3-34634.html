			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "Israel Refuses To Return the  Occupied Territories," the newspaper TISHRIN discusses the  outcome of the Cairo agreement recently signed between the PLO  and Israel. The paper explains that Israel has once again  confirmed that it does not want a just and comprehensive peace,  nor does it want to return the occupied Arab territories to  their owners.    TISHRIN says: What was accomplished in Oslo and what  happened in Cairo clearly shows that Israel is focusing on  separate deals and partial procedures designed to guarantee its  security and tighten its control of the situation in the  occupied territories. Moreover, Israel wants a partner to join  it in protecting its security under the slogan of repressing  terrorism. Rabin pointed to this issue in statements, carried  on Israeli radio, during a meeting held by the Labor Party in  Tel Aviv after the Cairo agreement was signed. Rabin said this  agreement will allow Israel to repress terrorism. Rabin added:  We can only do so if we have a partner who realizes that he  cannot achieve his objectives if our security is not guaranteed.  It is in our interest that this partner should take our  security concerns into consideration.    TISHRIN asserts that Rabin's remarks do not need any  comment.  It adds: These remarks, however, show that Israel still  adheres to all its pretexts and delusions, and places the Cairo  agreement in its real context; namely, this agreement is a new  gain for Israel.    The paper continues: All the Israeli statements that  welcomed this agreement apparently indicate that the Rabin  government will continue its policy of shirking the requirements  of a just and comprehensive peace, that it will continue its  subversive efforts to undermine the formula of the Madrid  conference, and that Israel will keep pursuing a policy in  conflict with the bases of a just and comprehensive peace.  Otherwise, what is the meaning of the Israeli insistence that  this agreement is a precedent for separate deals? What is the  meaning of Israel's refusal to seriously deal with the bases of  the Madrid conference and the resolutions of international  legitimacy? These resolutions call for full Israeli withdrawal  from the occupied Arab territories and for returning the  territories in exchange for peace.    TISHRIN adds: We pose all these questions in order to  emphasize that peace cannot be achieved or maintained unless  there is a just, comprehensive, and balanced solution whose  approaches and objectives take into account the regaining of all  Arab territories and rights. Israel is fully aware that partial  settlements and separate deals cannot make peace.    Concluding, TISHRIN says: Thus, these agreements cannot be  an alternative to a real, just, and comprehensive peace. Both  the world and the international community's will were unanimous  in demanding, with clear and unequivocal resolutions, a peace  that cannot be subjected to procrastination. Based on these  resolutions, the Madrid conference was held, and the principles  and elements of peace were crystallized. Also based on these  resolutions, the terms of reference and objectives of such a  peace were determined; namely, Israel's full withdrawal from the  occupied Arab territories first and foremost.</p>

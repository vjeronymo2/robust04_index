			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> SPILL CLOSES 3 FREEWAY LANES  </P> <P> A chemical spill forced officials to close three lanes of the northbound Golden  State Freeway near Gorman for more than four hours early this morning, the  California Highway Patrol reported.  </P> <P> Authorities said a truck rear-ended another truck carrying a shipment of  antifreeze and other chemicals.  </P> <P> The 3 a.m. accident occurred half a mile south of California 138. Antifreeze  spilled onto the roadway, but there were no injuries and only minor truck  damage.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County firefighters called for a hazardous materials unit after  learning that the truck carried a variety of chemicals that could be dangerous.  After firefighters determined that only antifreeze leaked, the emergency was  downgraded and sand was used to soak up the liquid. All freeway lanes were  reopened by 7:42 a.m., the CHP said.  </P></p>

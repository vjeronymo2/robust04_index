			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jackie Cameron] </F>   [Text] Police morale has hit an all-time low and many may  strike or resign -- unless their salaries are brought in line  with those of National Peace Keeping Force [NPKF] members.    This shock warning was issued to the Transitional Executive  Council [TEC] by the officially recognised South African Police  Union (SAPU) in a document which paints a picture of a police  force brewing with rage and turmoil. SAPU national secretary  Captain Peter-Don Brandt said in an exclusive interview  yesterday: "The threat of a police strike before the election  in April is not to be taken lightly. Union and non-union  members are not asking for an increase in salary, they are  demanding it."    Strong fears were also expressed that if the demands were  not  met, many policemen would join private armies. The police  medical aid, Polmed, has also cut its medical aid contributions  for psychological treatment from about R160 [rand] per visit to  just R30.    There is a massive discrepancy between the salaries of NPKF  and SAP [South African Police] members: NPKF constables and  lance-sergeants earn double the salary of their SAP  counterparts. NPKF members ranking from sergeant up to captain  earn about one-third more than SAP members of the same rank.    In addition, the daily allowance for NPKF members is almost  triple that given to SAP members, R61.50 per day compared to  R22.50.    "Policemen on the ground believe that a strike will work for  them because it worked for the NPKF," Capt Brandt said. He said  that he had to daily "pacify" those who believed a strike was  the only option. Trainee NPKF members were granted salary  increases earlier this month after they went on strike when they  discovered they were being paid at the lowest rate for their  particular rank instead of the highest -- which they had been  promised.    "SAP selection standards are much higher and our training is  much longer and more purposeful than those of the NPKF and see  what they get compared with us," Capt Brandt told the TEC. He  said that policemen would play as vital a role as the NPKF in  the pre-election, election and post-election phases.    With ordinary policing also continuing, SAP members would  have to work overtime constantly during the run-up to and after  the election. Already there is talk of 12 hours continuous  work, followed by 12 hours of rest, immediately followed by  another 12 hours duty.    "Should chaos break out, it could mean that these time  schedules will have to be maintained for an indefinite period  which could place unprecedented, indefinite pressure on the  police." Police are overworked and tired, suffering from stress  "and our families are disintegrating because of this".    While police were fully prepared to render impartial  service,  they were "sick and tired" after being abused by several  politicians in the past "to give of their best at a meagre  salary and no overtime pay".    Mr Craig Kotze, spokesman for Minister of Law and Order Mr  Hernus Kriel, said yesterday: "We will not allow policemen to  strike. There is no reason for them to do so and all the  channels are in place for them to voice their grievances. We do  not believe police morale is that low. Policemen chose their  career path because they wanted to serve the community," he said.    Chairman of the law and order subcouncil of the TEC, Mr  Peter  Gastrow, said last night the matter would appear on the  council's agenda at their meeting next week. Speaking in his  capacity as DP [Democratic Party] spokesman on law and order, he  said: "The unhappiness of members of the police force is  perfectly understandable in the light of the exceptionally heavy  burden which they are being asked to carry while others appear  to receive a better reward. I think they are justified in  taking this matter up at the highest level and if the minister  does not want a demotivated police force during the election  serious attention will have to be given to their demands".    SAPU has recruited more than 10,000 members since January --  more than 2,000 from the Western Cape. Major-General Nic Acker,  regional commissioner of police in the Western Cape, said last  night the morale of the men under his command was "a hundred  percent".    The head of the SAP's Police Psychology Unit, Dr Neel le  Roux, said it was a tragedy that just when policemen needed  psychological assistance more than ever the carpet was being  pulled from under their feet by the cut in medical aid  contributions for psychological treatment.    "At the moment about 80 percent of medical boardings in the  force are psychological and the suicide rate in the police force  is about seven times higher than the rest of the population," he  said. A spokeswoman for Polmed in the SAP, Major Marinda van  Rooyen, said they had introduced the benefit cuts in January but  said they were re-evaluating the cuts following numerous  complaints from members and practioners.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Salary Comparison                                                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Rank                     |NPKF                     |SA Police                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Brig                     |R10,534.25               |R10,534.25               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Col                      |R7,697.25                |R6,536.50                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Lt-Col                   |R6,536.25                |R5,418.75                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Major                    |R5,836.25                |R4,687.75                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Capt                     |R5,053.25                |R3,901.00                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Lieut                    |R4,354.00                |R3,297.00                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |W/O                      |R4,052.00 to R2,793.00   |R5,053.25                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Sgt                      |R3,599.00                |R2,288.00                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Lt-Sgt                   |R3,146.00                |R1,691.00                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Const                    |R2,389.00                |R1,265.25                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

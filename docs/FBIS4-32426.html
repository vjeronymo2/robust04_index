			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by vac: "Last Year, the Decline in the Gross </F> Domestic Product Was Halted"]    [Text] According to the expectations and estimates of the  most important economists, including even members of the  Economic Council of Ministers, the decline in the gross domestic  product [GDP] stopped in 1993. When compared with 1992, it  reached the level of 99.7 percent--that is to say, it was 0.3  percent lower. HOSPODARSKE NOVINY has already reported on these  fundamental preliminary data issued by the Czech Statistical  Office. In more detailed materials, the Czech Statistical Office  notes that the figures for 1992 and 1993 have been rendered  extensively more accurate. According to these materials, the GDP  for 1993 attained a value of 923.1 billion korunas [Kc]--that  is, approximately Kc89,400 per capita. Other facts that were  reported regarding these computations by the statistical  authorities are also of interest. The implicit deflator (the  cumulative price index) of the GDP attained a level of 115.3  points. For purposes of comparison, it is possible to state that  the measure of inflation, computed on the basis of the consumer  price index (a sliding average for 12 months compared with the  same period a year ago), reached a 1993 level of 120.8 percent.    From the standpoint of aggregate demand, the slight decline  in the GDP was brought about by the gross creation of fixed  capital (by declining by 7.9 percent), whereas all other  components increased: Consumption by households increased by 1.5  percent and consumption by the government by 1.1 percent, and  the asset portion of the foreign trade balance rose 44 percent.  A decline in inventories and reserves (approximately 6 percent  of the total volume of the GDP) in 1993 was approximately equal  to the level of 1992.    There was a more express rise in some expenditure components  of the GDP (computed in current prices). The share of household  consumption rose from 51.5 percent in 1992 to 54.2 percent in  1993, government consumption increased from 23.1 percent to 25.7  percent, and the positive balance of foreign trade rose from 1.2  percent to 3.1 percent. On the other hand, there was a decline  in the share accounted for by gross capital formation from 24.7  percent to 23.3 percent. There was a specific increase in the  share of inventory and reserve decline, which dropped from  - 0.7 percent to - 6.3 percent.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial report] Panama City TVN Television Network in  Spanish at 0109 GMT on 19 April, during its "Dialogue" program,  broadcasts a live or recorded interview with Panamanian  President Guillermo Endara by host Luz Maria Noli from its  studio in Panama City.    Endara begins by responding to why he released a video  montage of footage taken during the Noriega regime. He says:  "Past government actions are one of the first things open for  discussion in every political campaign."    At 0114 GMT, when asked whether more videos will be  presented, Endara says: "At this time, I see no reason for  airing any more videos. I would gladly air more, however, if it  is regarded as advisable."    At 0120 GMT Endara, commenting on the controversy following  the airing of his video montage, says: "I was unaware this  announcement would create such repercussions. I confess that I  am often spontaneous in my actions." He goes on to say: "I did  not want to create an expectation. I think these videos have a  great historical importance, at least that is how I felt when I  received the videotapes on 5 April, only a few days ago." He  adds: "I am convinced I made the right decision, and I believe  the people should know about this. I could not hide this from  the people. I believe it was my patriotic duty to do it; it was  a president's duty. I did not do it for political reasons but,  rather, because I wanted the truth to be known just as I saw it  on 5 April."    At 0128 GMT Noli asks Endara if the videos are the property  of the state or were received from a friendly government.  Endara replies: "No. These have nothing to with the famous  boxes in the hands of the U.S. Army." He goes on to say: "No,  they have nothing to do with those 15,000 boxes. These video  cassettes were in the Presidential Palace the day I assumed  office; they were there. I knew about them, but did not pay  much attention to them. I completely forgot they were there.  Truly, it was not until recently that I realized they were  there. I just recently became aware I had known they were there  for a long time, but I never took them into consideration."    At 0134 GMT Endara remarks on from where those videos came,  saying: "A few months ago, three or four months ago--I really  cannot remember how long ago--a Presidency official asked me for  permission to review the videos. I told him: You have much  work to do. Just stick to your work and forget those video  cassettes. The official addressed me again a few days later,  saying: Mr. President, I have a group of very serious people  who would like to review the cassettes. We will review them in  our spare time. Will you allow us to do so? I really wanted to  tell him no, as I had done previously, but I said to myself:  Well, let them see the videos if they are going to do so in  their off-duty hours. Thus, I authorized them to do so. They  reviewed the videos. They reviewed some of the videos, because  I do not think they could have reviewed them all. As a result,  on 5 April, they brought me an edited cassette containing most  of the scenes seen by everybody today. This was when, for the  first time in all my administration, I realized the importance  of those video cassettes. I thought it was truly  inconsequential to review those cassettes, but I was very wrong."    At 0138 GMT Noli asks Endara what the objective of his  airing  the video montage was. Endara responds: "My fundamental goal,  and which I hope to have fulfilled, was to report to the people  facts I could not keep concealed. I could not be an accomplice  or an accessory to those facts. I had to make them known,  because I think the theory that the past is not a subject of  political debate is completely wrong."    At 0146 GMT Endara says: "I did not do this to benefit one  candidate or to harm another. I did it because I had to. The  political effect has nothing to do with my decision. I did  consider it because I knew it would have a political effect. I  considered it but did not do so due to the political effect it  would have. I did it because I had to and for the reasons I  just explained. If it benefits young candidate Ruben Blades,  well, so be it. What can we do? I did not do it for that  reason. It does not bother me to know it might have benefited  someone. It does bother me to know it hurt someone, but then,  someone had to get hurt."    At 0153 GMT the network breaks away from the interview to a  live last-minute report on the Justice and Peace commission  issuing a statement on the video montage. The network then  returns to the Endara interview at 0159 GMT.    At 0208 GMT Endara comments on his partiality toward the  presidential candidates, saying: "I never pledged to be  impartial. I have with me a copy of the speech I delivered at  the time, and nowhere does it say I must be impartial. Allow me  to read just a few lines: I must point out and accept that all,  or at least the majority of those of us who are here--and they  were the government-- are politicians, belong to political  parties, have our preferences and sympathies, and profess  political creeds and doctrines."    At 0212 GMT, when asked if he would give up power if the  Democratic Revolutionary Party, PRD, wins the 8 May elections,  Endara says: "If on 8 May--I state it now clearly and  emphatically, as I have told all the members of my cabinet and  friends and, in particular, the Public Force--Perez Balladares  and the PRD win the elections, I will not only rightfully turn  over power to him on 1 September but will even try to do  something that has never occurred in Panama: I will establish a  transition period. I pledge that the day after the elections, I  will invite the winning candidate, either male or female, to the  Presidency to begin a transition period. I want the incoming  president who assumes office on 1 September to enjoy what I did  not have. I did not have a transition period."    At 0218 GMT Endara concludes his remarks, at which time the  network concludes its broadcast.</p>

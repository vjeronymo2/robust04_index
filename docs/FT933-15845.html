			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Anger over 'outrageous' hospital development remarks A FRESH controversy about the closure of some of London's hospitals has erupted after a leading firm of property advisers described them as 'the London development sites of the 90s'. Save, a conservation group, described comments by Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, chartered surveyors, about the development opportunities presented by hospital closures as 'outrageous' and showing 'complete insensitivity to the importance of the architecture of London hospitals'. It particularly criticised a description of the site occupied by St Thomas's opposite the Houses of Parliament as 'a prestigious residential development site with its unique picture postcard view'. The group said wholesale clearance of the site would destroy some historic buildings that gave St Thomas's an 'Italian skyline of cupolas and finials complementing the richness and intricacy of the Gothic silhouette of the Palace of Westminster opposite'. The group said the sites of historic hospitals in central London 'should be considered, not only as potential sites for penthouses and luxurious apartments, but as sites for lower cost and rental housing'. Mr Stephan Miles Brown, head of residential developments at Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, said that the scope for redeveloping sites of hospitals being considered for closure was highly relevant if their sale was expected to provide some of the funding for remaining centres. The site of St Thomas's could be worth more than Pounds 25m, he said. 'It is a true international piece of real estate,' he added. Many of the sites that were likely to become vacant would not attract developers because they are not in prime locations, he said. 'Most hospitals are not as valuable as people think they might be,' he said. Only two other London hospitals facing the threat of closure are in prime residential sites, the Royal Marsden in Chelsea and the Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Children in Hackney. St Bartholomew's in the City is the least suitable site for redevelopment of all nine London hospitals facing closure, according to Knight Frank &amp; Rutley. The oversupply of offices in the City would mean it was not viable to redevelop as office space, it said. Mr John Locke, chief executive of NHS Estates, which advises the health service on property management, said the health service conducted feasibility studies on the redevelopment of sites. The future of each building was considered on its own merits, he said.</p>

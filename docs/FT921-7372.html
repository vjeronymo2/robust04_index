			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Books: Parallel lives turned upside down EVER AFTER by Graham Swift Picador Pounds 14.99, 261 pages HOWEVER much he may wish it otherwise, Graham Swift is still branded as the author of Waterland, one of the most impressive and resonant British novels of the 1980s. Yet that book's dynastic breadth and pungent sense of place do set it apart from the rest of his output. The books that have followed over the last ten years have burrowed ever inwards, worrying at the ways in which we muddle through our lives, painfully map out our worlds, make emotional deals and compromises. So the tone and poise of Ever After are instantly recognisable. Although the first-person narration is rather querulous this time, the interlocking of narratives and their historical backdrop is distinctive. After the death of his wife Bill Unwin, third-rate academic and recently failed suicide, has washed up at an Oxbridge college courtesy of a fellowship set up by his step-father's fortune. As he surveys his own past and strives for academic credibility Unwin disinters the life of a distant ancestor - one Matthew Pearce, Cornish surveyor, whose notebooks and letters chart his intellectual struggles to come to terms with the rising tide of Darwinism in the 1850s, and reveal how eventually his marriage is torn apart by his loss of faith. Pearce sacrifices his wife and family to his unquenchable ideas, his total loss of religious certainty. The certainty that Unwin has just lost is his wife Ruth, a glamorous, successful actress; he shares the world's wonder at the perfection of their marriage, takes it perhaps as redemption for a life torn between the love for his mother and the knowledge of her part in his own father's suicide. Swift's subject matter and some aspects of its treatment seem oddly familiar. It's difficult not to compare his meshing of 19th-century ideas and mores with present-day academic life against that in A. S. Byatt's Possession (and even its pairing of a contemporary love story with a tragic Victorian one), while the reverberations of an intellectual world turned upside-down by the Darwinian revolution carry their own echoes of Carey's Oscar and Lucinda. But Swift's achievement does not attempt to compete with either of those Booker prizewinners; his scope and ambition are more narrowly focused than theirs, and his success more intermittent. Ever After moves in fits and starts. At one moment it seems too irritatingly knowing, keen to tease its readers and lead them on; at others it is limpid, unadorned and affecting. Along the way there are the hard little nuggets of carefully packaged historical fact - discursions on Brunel and the Great Western Railway, bee-keeping, the raising of the William pear. But it is the most intimate sections that burn fiercest, the fond remembrances of Unwin's marriage that move most. Pearce finally sets sail for America, seeking a new life to match the new world of ideas he has acquired at so great a cost; anticlimactically he is reported lost at sea. Unwin has survived, despite himself, to tell these parallel tales. 'You see what this new me is like', he self-consciously confides in the opening pages: the trouble is that we don't like what we see, and doubt whether we would have cared much for the 'old me' either. He botches his suicide, after rejecting the advances of an academic rival's wife, as if to confirm his earlier observation that 'No one dies from love'. And he lives on to celebrate the power of that love, even if he never seems to have done anything to deserve so much past happiness.</p>

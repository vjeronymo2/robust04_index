			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ibrahim Humaydi on interview with Ibrahim </F> Ghawshah, official spokesman for Hamas, in Damascus; date not  given]    [Text] Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for the  Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), has stressed that the  initiative made toward Israel before the end of last year by the  "'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions," the movement's military  wing, is "genuine and reflects our self-confidence." However,  he pointed out that Hamas is not presenting itself as an  alternative to anyone. "Those are delusions."    While he pointed out that this year will be a "year of war,  not peace," Ghawshah expressed Hamas' willingness to engage in a  dialogue with all parties. But he excluded the Jews, because  they are offering no "concessions" to the other side.    In an interview with AL-HAYAH Ghawshah stressed that the  statement made by the movement's guide, Shaykh Ahmad Yasin, on  participation in the elections "cannot be corroborated." He  pointed out that Hamas is committed to its position on  participation in any legislative elections, except  administrative self-rule elections, "on which our position has  been decided." He revealed that the Syrian Government has  offered some facilities to Hamas. He appealed to Arab  governments and Iran to provide financial aid, "because their  positions will be affected if we are hit."    In the interview conducted with him in Damascus Ghawshah  said  that Hamas' position on participation in the self-rule elections  and the institutions arising from it "is clear, namely the  complete refusal to take part in these elections at all." He  pointed out that the statement on this question by the  movement's guide, Shaykh Yasin, cannot be corroborated.  "Nevertheless, he spoke about a legislative council for the  Palestinian people -- which we are all demanding, but in  isolation from any political plan." He added that "Hamas will  participate in any elections that are not political. We have  always participated in these elections and will continue to do  so, because we do not want to abandon the movement's positions  and the Islamic presence, which should be secured whenever  possible."    On the movement's willingness to enter into a truce or  dialogue with Israel, Hamas' official spokesman said that the  "'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions'" initiative "was genuine and  true, and it reflects self-confidence. This is attested by the  fact that the Israelis considered it a humiliation for them."  However, he pointed out that this initiative "does not indicate  that we want to present ourselves as an alternative" to the PLO  and its leader, Yasir 'Arafat. He said: "Those are delusions;  we are not offering ourselves as an alternative to anyone." He  stressed the movement's willingness to engage in a dialogue with  all parties. "We consider ourselves in a state of war with the  enemy. And when we make a move, we proceed from our Islamic  principles. Our setting conditions for them (Israelis) is a  continuation of the Islamic tradition in the relationship with  the enemies." He pointed out that the important question in any  proposal "is securing the Palestinian' interests without any  concessions, and this initiative did contain all these meanings."    Asked whether Hamas is going to put forward other  initiatives  with conditions different from those set in the past, Ghawshah  said that "truce in wars is a recognized thing, but it differs  from the present capitulationist scheme (the Gaza-Jericho  agreement). We are for a temporary tactical truce in which  there is a gain for us." However, he said that a dialogue is  possible with all, "except the Jews. We know their mentality,  and no Jew can make concessions."    On the self-rule agreement and its future, Ghawshah said  that "it is doomed to perish. Anyone who reads it will realize  this." He added that "'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions'"  operations have brought to the surface "a very important  question, namely the impossibility of coexistence with  settlers." He pointed out that 'Arafat has suffered "a nervous  breakdown." He said that the Palestinian people will rally  around those opposed to the agreement and that "1994 will be a  year of war and struggle, not peace."    Ghawshah denied that Hamas backtracked on its position when  it agreed to form the leading committee of the "Alliance of  Palestinian Forces" on the basis of two representatives for each  organization. He said: "Our position was that, if we want to  form a front to implement an ambitious political program, we  must respect the influence of every faction. We also adhered to  the foundation of our alliance, and our decision to agree to  this formation (in the alliance program announced the day before  yesterday) was less than the ambitious ceiling." Replying to  the claims that Hamas is not strong outside [the occupied  territories], he stressed that "if free elections are held in  any areas in which the Palestinians are present, we will win  them. The Islamic tendency is the common tendency, and we are  not scared of any impartial elections." He pointed to the  results of the parliamentary elections in Jordan and those of  the Engineers Union elections, "in which we won 38 seats out of  42."    He said that one of the reasons for Hamas' strength inside  is  "its reliance on the young generation -- which is a problem  facing (Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq) Rabin. Every day we  have a new, young, and secret leadership."    On the movement's financial sources, Ghawshah declined to  name a specific quarter. He said: "We are pursuing a policy of  austerity, relying on charity and donations from Arab states and  Turkish, Arab, and Iranian businessmen, and a receipt is  provided." He appealed for Arab financial aid, "but only  provided it is not linked with political positions, because we  receive decisions from our leadership only." He pointed out  that this is what has made it difficult to "determine the  authority making these decisions in Hamas, as 'Arafat has looked  for this authority in Sudan, Jordan, and Iran." He added that  he would not express any objection if Iran -- together with the  Arab countries -- supports the movement materially and  politically, "because we are working for their interests, and if  we are hit, their positions will be affected." He pointed out  that the Syrian leadership "is opening the door for us, and we  are interested in Damascus' position, and they (the Syrians) see  us as a strong tendency."    Ghawshah expected a "war to break out in the region if the  bilateral negotiations within the peace process fail." He  pointed to "an integration between the honorable operations"  carried out by Hizballah from southern Lebanon and the military  operations carried by the "'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions" in  the occupied territories, But "the political program is  completely different between us and there is no coordination  between the two sides." He said that the "Islamic Jihad"  movement (led by Fathi al-Shiqaqi) is influenced by Iran "and  the victories of the Iranian revolution." He pointed to  "unionist plans" being conducted between Hamas and the Islamic  Jihad.</p>

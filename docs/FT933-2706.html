			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / British National party wins by-election THE far-right British National party last night won its first-ever local authority seat after a campaign fought on a rights-for-whites platform. Mr Derek Beackon, 47, the party's candidate, was elected by a majority of seven over Labour after a re-count in the east London borough of Tower Hamlets. Police in riot gear and on horseback fought to control clashes between BNP supporters and anti-racist campaigners as the result was announced. The result was: BNP: 1,480; Labour: 1,473; Liberal Democrat: 1,284; Conservative: 134. After his election Mr Beackon described the result as a great victory for the British people. 'The British people are no longer prepared to be treated as second-rate citizens in their own country,' he said. Mr Peter Hughes, Liberal Democrat leader of Tower Hamlets Council, said the result brought shame to the area and was a 'blot on the history of Tower Hamlets'. When Hitler bombed the area so heavily in the second world war he could never have hoped that he would eventually be so successful, he said. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said: 'This is very, very bad news for all those who are committed to democratic politics.' He urged mainstream politicians to make clear their commitment to tolerance and their opposition to 'racist-based parties'. There has recently been a series of outbreaks of racially inspired violence on the streets of Tower Hamlets and there are fears that increased BNP activity as a result of the election victory will aggravate the problem. Mr Hughes said the council would continue to treat all citizens equally and was determined that there should not be disorder on the streets. The by-election took place on the Isle of Dogs. Although parts of the area have become occupied by affluent residents in riverside apartments, the large majority of the population still live in council flats. Frustration over housing policies, according to all the main political parties, played a part in the election. The turnout yesterday was 44 per cent compared with only 31 per cent in another by-election contested by the BNP in the same area last year. Leaders of the three main parties believed that the higher turnout indicated that the electorate was registering a protest against the BNP, but the result proved them wrong. The far-right party more than doubled its 657 votes in last year's by-election. Police continued to patrol the streets of east London in force early this morning after the declaration of the result. The BNP victory will add to pressure on the government to strengthen Britain's race relations laws.</p>

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Arts: The Tempest - Theatre THE Path Theatre Company's Tempest at the Cochrane Theatre brings together able-bodied, physically disabled and mentally handicapped actors. The result is a difficult show, yet one which fulfils three criteria for fine theatre: it is morally challenging, informative, and better than staying in with Mozart. For all this, it is best seen as a piece of cultural therapy, an opportunity for actors and audience to meet on equal terms. Any and every effort to bring this kind of theatre to the public should be encouraged and applauded. Granted, standards of professional theatre cannot apply here. The whole production underlines the frailty of the human engine, and reminds us that perceived handicaps often turn out to lie in environment, or in others' attitudes. Just as theatre heightens the senses, so actors who cannot speak, walk, see or hear bring a special perspective to the part. The casting of The Tempest here is inspired in this regard. There is point and poignancy in seeing a blind Ferdinand led by Miranda, a signing Stephano eloquently explaining how he will supplant some of Trinculo's teeth, and a Down's Syndrome Ariel, delegating his work through two other bodies which sing and speak for him. The other felicities of the show are its music, a sly pastiche of Steeley Dan, Django Reinhardt and Mardi Gras jazz, and its dance. However, the actors were often left stranded by the direction and production. In effect, The Tempest for all its sprites and other-worldliness was a difficult choice. Perhaps a less formal approach would better serve the actors. The excellent Kaleidoscope Theatre Company (Love Lies Bleeding, 1991) has led the way, using mime, gesture, music and costume to produce fresh, exciting work with a community of disabled actors. Such work is possible, and it should be encouraged. At the Jeanette Cochrane Theatre, Southampton Row, London WC1, (071) 242 7040, until 22 August</p>

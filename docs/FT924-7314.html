Costs associated with the realignment, which will be completed early next year, were included in a Dollars 64.4m charge taken in April. Avon will phase out its three international region headquarters, creating nine streamlined units covering sales, marketing and distribution operations around the world. These new units will report directly to the office of the chairman, which will set growth initiatives, integrate global strategies and allocate resources to Avon's businesses around the world.</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1994 - Business Briefing (16): It's not science fiction - Groupware product devolopment / Pounds 13m 'awareness campaign' launched in the UK A Pounds 13m programme aimed at both developing groupware products and spreading awareness among UK businesses was launched by the Department of Trade and Industry last month, reports John Kavanagh. The DTI believes the computer-supported co-operative working programme will develop 'the next generation of IT after groupware.' Eight projects involving 40 information technology companies, user-companies and universities will receive government funding of Pounds 5.7m over the next three years through the DTI and the Science and Engineering Research Council. Participants will put in at least equal funds. The projects range from the evolution of existing products to the realms of virtual reality. The UK work flow software specialist, Staffware, is leading a Pounds 1m project involving Balfour Beatty, BP, Grand Metropolitan, Pfizer, Brunel University and Imperial College. This project will develop Staffware's product to enable it to show members of a team how a document they are working on has changed and explain the context in which the changes have been made. The system will also include an 'intelligent agenda', which will help individuals determine priorities and suggest what they should and should not do. 'The aim is to provide some of the clarity and immediacy of a meeting or telephone call without forcing people to fit their schedules around the needs of others,' says Staffware's technical director, Mr Jon Pyke. Digital Equipment is working with National Westminster Bank, Lancaster University and management science specialist Syncho to look at support for group working in retail banking, taking into account changing work practices and emphasis on customer service. Other teams are developing systems to support group working in areas ranging from boardroom decision making to planning big engineering projects. Virtual reality appears in a Pounds 3m project led by BT and bringing together nine organisations. One pilot system will enable specialists at different sites to 'visit' factories without leaving their offices, to work with others on production problems. The other pilot will create a virtual reality fashion catwalk and enable designers and buyers to discuss and change garments and transmit the final designs to manufacturer. Such projects are not science fiction but have commercial aims. Jon Pyke at Staffware says his project will produce facilities that his company's customers have been asking for. The Pounds 250,000 that Staffware is receiving amounts to 40 per cent of its investment in the development. Details of the development programme are available from Garth Shephard, telephone (0438) 718528 or 071-215 1311. The first main awareness event is a conference entitled 'The Virtual Corporation,' in central London on May 10-11. Details are available on 081-541 5040.</p>

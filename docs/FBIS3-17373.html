Speaking at a news conference in Vilnius on Thursday,  Slezevicius said that "if previously the administration of the  Kaliningrad region tolerated Vilnius' efforts to settle  Lithuania's ties with Russia on a mutually advantageous basis,  lately it has been trying to press for unilateral concessions  from Lithuania."    "However we believe that we must seek a way out for adopting  decisions which would be beneficial to both countries," he said.  Primarily, automobile transportation through Lithuania,  "simplified" visa procedures for the region's citizens and other  problems, he added.    About four months ago Lithuania sent a note to Moscow,  requesting to speed up the ratification of the signed package of  economic agreements. But there has been no reply since then,  the premier said.    He noted that a high-level delegation left for the  Kaliningrad region on Thursday to seek a "positive solution to  all questions on the spot, including the construction by the  Lithuanian side of housing for Russian servicemen returning from  Lithuania and Estonia."</p>

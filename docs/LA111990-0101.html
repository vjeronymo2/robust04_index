			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> ANTI-ABORTION COALITION FORMED  </P> <P> A new anti-abortion coalition at Cal State Fullerton hopes to generate debate  among students by holding weekly meetings and other activities, which already  have drawn speakers such as Archbishop Roger Mahoney and Rep. William E.  Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton).  </P> <P> "I'm hoping that by forming Students for Life Coalition, we can fight to defend  a basic human right -- the right to life," said Kevin La Point, a 21-year-old  psychology major who helped establish the group.  </P> <P> La Point believes a valuable lesson can be learned from the 1960s, when protest  and change was in the air, and the students became one of the single most  powerful movements during that decade.  </P> <P> "College students can make a difference," La Point said. "They can force change  when organized."  </P> <P> Abortion-rights advocates already have numerous organizations on campus.  </P> <P> "Based on our membership, I'm encouraged by student interest," he said, adding  that he hopes the coalition spreads to other campuses in the area. About 40  people have joined the organization.  </P> <P> La Point launched the coalition in September, believing there had to be people  on campus who shared his views.  </P> <P> "To me, abortion is no different in importance as issues of racism, sexism or a  government's domestic or foreign policies," he said. "I recognize that a lot of  people have differing views, but we still have a right to express our  differences."  </P> <P> La Point said the coalition, in addition to holding meetings and attracting  speakers, hopes to educate students who are undecided about the abortion issue  and to encourage student participation in anti-abortion politics.  </P> <P> Still, La Point distances the coalition from such anti-abortion groups as  Operation Rescue, which use civil disobedience.  </P> <P> "We don't advocate breaking the law," La Point said. "All our activities are  legal and nonviolent. This organization does not support other pro-life groups  which encourage violent, illegal or socially disruptive behavior." ERIK  HAMILTON  </P></p>

			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Drink: The baroness and the wine baron - Jancis Robinson talks to a Dollars 20m double act BARONESS Philippine de Rothschild was 30 minutes late for our hour-long meeting, which is not bad going for her. And she did have a very good excuse: 'It's so difficult for us women to get dressed in hotels]' she wailed as she sashayed in to one of the well-upholstered sitting rooms above London's Gavroche restaurant from her bedroom next door. Her business partner, 79-year-old Robert Mondavi, the biggest cheese in California wine, had got up in Paris at 5am to be at the meeting and had arrived, after checking-in at Claridge's, on the dot. The two partners were in London to make a noise about their latest joint spending spree, a luxurious winery for their famous co-production, Opus One, an ambitious red made in the Napa Valley to the same recipe as first-growth bordeaux Ch Mouton-Rothschild. So how much did this new winery cost? 'Oooch. That's difficult to say,' said Mondavi politely, before wandering off down precious minutes' worth of conversational byways, taking in gravity flow, cement floors, basket presses . . . 'Now,' broke in the Baroness next to him, impatiently stroking her geometric black and white silk shift. 'You asked about price and I think we should answer this because otherwise it sounds as though we don't want to talk about it, which is not the case. I would say Dollars 15m.' 'How much?' asked Mondavi, whose hearing is less keen than his forehand nowadays. 'I would say between Dollars 15m and Dollars 20m,' beamed the Baroness. Mondavi's jaw dropped. 'Okay, it's a little bit less than the real cost,' said the Baroness patting his knee, 'but I'm sure, Jancis, you'll agree with me.' 'I don't agree with you,' muttered Mondavi from his corner of the sofa, before mustering a brave smile. They make a great double act. Both with their own family-owned wine empires, each with a solid base of high-volume lines (Mouton-Cadet and Central Valley bottlings respectively) providing the cashflow for the world-famous, high-cachet products they concentrate on (Ch Mouton-Rothschild and Mondavi Napa Valley Reserve wines). They each have a 50 per cent stake in Opus One, originally devised as California's most expensive wine by the Baroness's late father. But, like Mouton-Rothschild, Opus One is finite. The winery has been lovingly sculpted to produce just 20,000 cases a year (rather less than the average production of Ch Mouton-Rothschild) which, even though Opus retails at around Dollars 65 a bottle, does rather obviously raise the question of when they expect this grandiose transatlantic pipedream to start making any money. Much whistling and rueful laughter from both corners of the sofa. 'I would say that . . .' Mondavi began. 'Can I answer that?' the Baroness asked. 'Our grandchildren's generation, not before then.' A mock-horrified Mondavi accused Philippine of spreading such gloom 'just to make this interesting', but if Opus One does reach profitability within 20 years, as it surely will, it will be faster than any Bordeaux chateau this century. Twenty million dollars certainly sounds remarkably modest given the project's scale. Although Philippine was at pains to point out that, for reasons of economy, she had nobly renounced having her own quarters incorporated into the winery. It was while telling me about all this that Mondavi used the phrase 'we didn't flinch', repeated several times. He talks as though what he has been through is an experience that would have had many a lesser man flinching. And he admits that his financial advisers have done more than their fair share of flinching. But, for both parties, Opus One is a big long-term project. Stuart Harrison, the outfit's sales and marketing director and in pre-winery times its only employee, surely has one of the world's easier jobs. Nowadays Opus One has merely to be allocated: three-quarters is snapped up in the first six weeks after release by America's avid collectors and the rest is carefully shared around the rest of the globe (just 150 cases for the UK). After my 30 breathless minutes with the two partners, I found myself sitting between Messrs Harrison and Mondavi comparing the extremely suave, definitively world-class 1987 Opus One with the much gawkier current vintage, 1988. Were these wines priced the same? I asked Mondavi. 'I certainly hope not,' he said, 'let's ask Stu.' The hapless Stu had to confess that, if anything, the younger wine was more expensive. Mondavi was furious. 'Now that's against everything I stood for]' But Robert Mondavi (who is currently busy 'looking at' Chile) is having to pay the price of age, and has handed over his business to his two sons, Tim and Michael. As chief winemaker, Tim makes the winemaking decisions about Opus One with Patrick Leon of Mouton, one of 90 Rothschild employees and associates who were flown to California at the end of May. The 1991 vintage was the first to be made at the new winery, as opposed to the Mondavi winery across Highway 29, and rumour has it that it will be one of the greats. For my money - or rather yours since I am so unsophisticated  -I want a bordeaux first-growth if I am paying a bordeaux first-growth price; the best Opus vintages have been the 1982, 1985 and 1987. Wine merchants Adnams, of Southwold, in Suffolk, list the 1985, drinking spendidly now, at Pounds 46.50 a bottle.</p>

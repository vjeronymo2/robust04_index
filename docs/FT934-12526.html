			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: Apple product links PC with TV and CD player APPLE Computer yesterday launched a Macintosh television that combines the functions of a Macintosh PC with a television set and a compact disc player, writes Louise Kehoe in San Francisco. Designed for home and higher education users, the Dollars 2,079 system is available only in the US. The product signals an industry trend towards combining computing and entertainment technology. In a single unit, the Macintosh television provides the functions of a personal computer with a cable-ready 14-inch colour television, and audio CD player for stereo sound. The system can also be connected to a VCR, camcorder, laser disc player or video game player. 'The computer industry and the consumer electronics market are converging,' said Mr Brodie Keast, director of product marketing for the Apple Personal Computer Division.</p>

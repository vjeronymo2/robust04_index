			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, March 24 (BTA) -- The National Assembly  today passed on second reading a Special Surveillance Devices  Act. It regulates the application of methods such as  photography, filming, opening letters and others, without the  knowledge of or against the will of persons under surveillance.  This is a priority law whose passage has been repeatedly urged  by the prime minister and the president.    Under the act, information acquired by special surveillance  devices can be requested and used by the Interior Ministry, the  National Investigative Service, the National Security Service,  the National Investigative Service, the Border Troops, the  Central Service for Organized Crime Control and the intelligence  and the counterintelligence services with the Defence Ministry.    Special surveillance devices can be supplied, installed and  used only by specialized services of the Interior Ministry.  Their use has to be ordered and permitted by the interior  minister. These devices may be used without such a permission  only in case of imminent danger of a crime against national  security, or if there is available data of preparations for a  terrorist act. In such cases the respective body should be  informed within 24 hours.    The act fixes a two-month term for the use of special  surveillance devices, which can be extended by another four  months.    Data collected by special surveillance devices can only be  used for detecting or preventing a crime. The act charges the  interior minister with the control on the application of these  devices.    Vasil Mikhaylov, MP of the Union of Democratic Forces,  suggested that the act provides guarantees that such devices  will not be used in the absence of data of guilt, but the motion  was rejected by a majority of mostly Socialist MP's. Mr.  Mikhaylov also suggested that the act comes into force after  texts are added to the Criminal Code providing for penalties for  the misuse of special devices and information thus obtained, but  this motion also failed to pass.</p>

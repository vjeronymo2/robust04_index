			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: UK retailing So much for a consumer-led recovery. After the devaluation, British retailers appear a gloomy bunch. Several stores groups, including Kingfisher and Sears, see sales bumping along the bottom, with little prospect of an upturn. Devaluation is more of a burden than a benefit, as price increases in imported goods will be difficult to pass on to consumers in a depressed market. Margins, already under pressure, are likely to be squeezed further. Even the more buoyant August sales figures were largely autumn purchases brought forward as the soggy summer fizzled out. To combat this, retailers are still focusing on productivity. Electronic systems allowing tighter stock control and more flexible staff working patterns have been introduced by companies such as WH Smith and Boots the Chemist. Head office overheads are being reduced. But measures such as cutting support staff only give a one-off boost to earnings growth. And many of the gains from electronic stock control have already been exploited. Admittedly, the gloom is not evenly spread. Lower interest rates may help the consumer durables and DIY sectors even in the absence of housing market recovery. These businesses are dependent on better-off homeowners whose spending is affected by mortgage payments. They were the first stores into recession and could be the first out. By contrast, jewellery and fashion retailing appeal to a younger market, which only felt recession as unemployment rose. They will take longer to recover. In any event, an '80s-style consumer boom is simply not feasible, as any rush of imports would have to be met quickly with higher interest rates. That limits the capacity of stores to lead the way out of recession. The large quoted groups such as Marks and Spencer, Kingfisher, Smiths, Boots and GUS are solid performers. But the sector does not offer the best way to invest for recovery.</p>

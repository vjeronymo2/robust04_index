			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / India eases bank reserve rules: Reserve Bank acts to increase credit to industry THE Reserve Bank of India yesterday announced a cut in the reserve requirements of commercial banks to help boost credit to industry, Reuter reports from Bombay. However, the central bank left the key minimum lending rate unchanged at 17 per cent. Mr Chakravarty Rangarajan, the bank's governor, said the statutory liquidity ratio of commercial banks would be lowered by 1 percentage point to 36.75 per cent. The banks' cash reserve ratio would be cut by 1 point to 14 per cent. Mr Rangarajan was announcing the central bank's credit policy for the first six months of the 1993-94 fiscal year. He said the cuts in the two reserve requirements would make an additional Rs49.5bn (Pounds 1.05bn) available for lending. 'The hesitant industrial recovery in 1992-93 must be converted into a strong revival in 1993-94,' the governor said. 'Adequate availability of credit will be critical in converting the weak industrial recovery into a strong revival.' Some bankers and businessmen had expected a further cut in minimum lending rate, which was reduced by 1 point to 17 per cent when the budget was announced on February 27. RC Murthy, in Bombay, adds: The central bank also announced restrictions would be lifted on some interest rates in an effort to encourage inflows of foreign currency. Lending rate curbs are scrapped for rupee funds issued against foreign currency deposits. In exchange, banks will have to absorb exchange rate fluctuation risk, which is currently borne by the Reserve Bank. The scheme is optional, which means restrictions will stay if banks choose not to take on the exchange rate risk. Analysts say the scheme would be attractive to foreign banks, which have to invest 37.5 per cent of their deposits in low-yield government bonds and to earmark 15 per cent of their loans to small businesses and exports at fixed interest rates.</p>

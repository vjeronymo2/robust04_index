These 20 characters precisely show the relationship between  reform, development, and stability. In recent years economic  development in Jiangsu and Shandong have greatly attracted the  people's attention. To know how they interpret and handle these  relationships, we interviewed Chen Huanyou, deputy to the  National People's Congress [NPC] as well as governor and party  secretary of Jiangsu Province, and Zhao Zhihao, NPC deputy and  governor of Shandong Province.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent] Secretary Chen, would you  please tell us your opinion on how to effectively handle the  relationship between reform, development, and stability in view  of Jiangsu's practical situation?    [Chen] Yes, I would be very happy to answer your question.  Reform, development, and stability are closely related. They  complement and promote one another. They are three important  aspects in our overall work, and can be seen as an entirety  because they dovetail with one another. Reform is the motive  force of development, and development and reform are the  foundation of social stability. Maintaining social stability is  the prerequisite for promoting development and accelerating  reform. Over the past year, Jiangsu developed its economy, made  major strides in reform and opening up, enjoyed social  stability, improved the people's lives, and coordinated and  promoted reform, development, and stability simultaneously.  This year is an important year for us to accelerate reform. In  light of Jiangsu's practical situation, we must first consider  giving reform a special position, seizing current favorable  opportunities, and mobilizing the broad masses of cadres and  people to enthusiastically participate in and support reform.  We should effectively resolve problems arising in the course of  economic construction and reform in Jiangsu by deepening reform  and accelerating development. Second, we should pay attention  to raising the quality and efficiency of economic development  and establish the idea in all fields that development is the  final word. We should proceed from actual conditions. We cannot  place undue emphasis on output value and blindly vie for the  growth rate. Third, stability is a major event vital to the  overall situation. While we should seize the opportunity of  development, we should also thoroughly estimate and promptly  discover difficulties and problems during the course of economic  advance. We should conduct bold analysis, do a good job, and  effectively deal with various contradictions and problems.    [Correspondent] Governor Zhao Zhihao, please tell us how  Shandong handles the relationship between reform, development,  and stability.    [Zhao] All right. To correctly handle the relationship  between reform, development, and stability, and to strive to  make the three promote each other and form a single entity, is  the general demand set by the CPC Central Committee for this  year's work. If the relationship among the three is handled  effectively, they will promote one another and enjoy coordinated  development. If the relationship is handled poorly, the three  could impede one another and affect the overall situation.  Therefore, our provincial party committee and government have  decided to give top priority to reform this year. Under a  responsibility system with proper division of work, responsible  comrades of the provincial party committee and government have  led groups of cadres in undertaking investigations and studies  at grass-roots units to find new situations and resolve new  problems, have popularized the practical experiences of  grass-roots units, and have provided guidance for reform.    [Correspondent] Governor Zhao, if new contradictions and  problems emerge in Shandong's economy, how do you deal with them?    [Zhao] If the economy develops too rapidly, many new  contradictions will arise and the economic relationship will  tend to be tense. For this reason, we generally do not demand  administrations at lower levels to reach certain goals or  accomplish certain tasks. All we emphasize is reforming the  economic structure, carrying out technical transformation, and  improving economic efficiency. In this way, we allow  lower-level administrations more leeway in avoiding tense  economic relationships. When making reform plans, we take the  timing and scale of reform into consideration in order to make  the plans feasible. Regarding social stability, we stress  managing society according to law. At the same time, we  undertake publicity and education campaigns among the broad  masses of people in various fields to dissolve contradictions  and arouse their initiative. We are especially concerned about  those enterprises with difficulties in production and those  operating at a loss; we would help them. We would also help  people in disaster and poverty-stricken areas to improve their  production and living standards. [end recording]</p>

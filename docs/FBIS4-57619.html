			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Tomas Borge, president of the Sandinist </F> National Liberation Front, FSLN, Congress, by unidentified  reporter on 20 May; place not give; from the "Extravision"  newscast -- recorded]    [Text] [Borge] Several foreign delegations have arrived.  Others will arrive this afternoon, and the remainder will arrive  tomorrow. There is a large number of foreign delegations from  many nations, from Europe.    [Reporter] How many delegations have arrived?    [Borge] More than 100. There is an impressive number of  observers. Observers are precisely that: They observe. There  are also invitees who have a right to speak out, who have been  designated by territory. These [words indistinct] are full  delegates to the Congress who have a right to speak and to vote.    My responsibility as president of the Congress, my  obligation, is to be above any differences. That is my main  responsibility. I must set aside all my opinions to lead the  congress in an aboveboard, [word indistinct], fair, democratic  manner, leaving no room for doubt. This is a very important  national event. It goes without saying that I am not in favor  of any faction. I do not favor factions. I say this before the  Congress starts because I will reiterate it once the Congress  begins and, if necessary, during the debates. As congress  president, I must lead it in due form, but I also have the right  to express my opinion.    I have the right to express my opinion and, as a matter of  fact, I have expressed my opinion on Daniel Ortega's candidacy  for FSLN secretary general. It was not an easy decision because  I have seen many contradictions over the years. Unlike other  comrades, some of whom are now confronting him, I have never  flattered him. I have always made things perfectly clear, as  Daniel himself can attest.    I have been critical of many actions, not just of Daniel's  but of other comrades' as well. One such example is the time  when the National Directorate decided to concentrate power --  under very special circumstances -- in the government's  executive, even though the Directorate always participated in  making the most important decisions.    From a historical point of view, I have had good, friendly  relations with Henry Ruiz. He and I belonged to one of those  tendencies. I must confess that I now regret having been a  member of one of those tendencies. I would have liked to have  been above the tendencies at those times, but such were the  circumstances. But, [words indistinct] with Henry Ruiz over all  these years I have had a good relationship with him. I could  say that I am more of a friend to Henry Ruiz that to Daniel  Ortega. When it comes to political decisions, however, one  should not consider friendship but what is more suitable for the  revolution.    I am totally convinced that beyond personal relations and  beyond the differences we have had in the past, it is much more  advisable for the FSLN to have Daniel Ortega as FSLN secretary  general. Mind you, I have had more differences with Daniel  Ortega than with Henry Ruiz. My friendship with Henry Ruiz is  greater than with Daniel Ortega.    Daniel Ortega has a great deal of support in the FSLN.  Moreover, he has demonstrated an enormous capacity for work and  innovation. In my opinion, and contrary to what others say, he  is the candidate for unity because he has the most support. He  is the candidate that will bring us together. My common sense  tells me this. The candidate of unity is not a candidate who  causes too much controversy inside the FSLN, as is the case with  my friend Commander Henry Ruiz. The candidate of unity is my  comrade Daniel Ortega, about whom I cannot say that I am not his  friend and his brother. I am Daniel's friend and his brother,  but I have been closer to Henry Ruiz. Nevertheless, when the  time comes to make a decision as an FSLN activist and as member  of Congress, I favor Comrade Daniel Ortega.</p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / The Danish Referendum: Anti-EC sentiment grows in Norway NORWEGIAN opposition to membership of the European Community swelled to 51 per cent this month, up 4 points from April, according to an opinion poll published yesterday in the Conservative newspaper Aftenposten. Uncertainty over the outcome of Denmark's second referendum on the Maastricht treaty was seen by political analysts as the cause of the rise. Although Danish approval of the treaty would have little affect on Norwegian public opinion, the analysts said, its rejection would reduce the chances of a Yes vote in Norway's membership referendum, expected in 1995. The Norwegian electorate narrowly rejected joining the EC in 1972, but Brussels and Oslo began fresh negotiations last month. Yesterday's poll suggested support for membership had fallen to 30 per cent, from 36 per cent in April, while the proportion of undecided voters had risen to 19 per cent, from 17 per cent. The survey also revealed that opposition was strongest among women, with just 23 per cent in favour, against 39 per cent of men. The toughest issues in the current negotiations will be Norway's exclusive right to its rich fishery resources, the role of the state in oil policy, and the extent of participation by state-owned companies in oil and gas licences. Brussels and Oslo are due to begin negotiations on fish this autumn. Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, prime minister, recently pointed out that it was just this issue that left Norway outside the Community in 1972. Mrs Brundtland also expressed strong disapproval last week of EC plans to introduce an oil and gas licensing directive at a time when the Norwegian government is struggling to convince a resistant electorate of the benefits of joining the EC. The directive is due to be discussed in Brussels on June 25. Mrs Brundtland warned that if it were adopted without Oslo's influence it would have an adverse affect on the outcome of a membership referendum.</p>

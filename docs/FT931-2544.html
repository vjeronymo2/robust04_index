			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Peru pays off arrears with IMF PERU yesterday regained its financial respectability by clearing more than Dollars 1.7bn of arrears to the International Monetary Fund and World Bank dating back to 1986. A short-term bridging credit extended jointly by Japan's Eximbank and the US Treasury was deposited on schedule to allow the immediate clearing of Peru's arrears with the Fund, totalling some Dollars 860m. The IMF board then gave its formal blessing to the country's 1993-95 economic programme. This allows extended fund facility to come into play, assuring the cash-strapped Fujimori regime a total of Dollars 1.4bn over the next three years and allowing repayments to the US and Japan. Through a further series of financial manoeuvres, Peru also yesterday cleared arrears of some Dollars 900m with the World Bank, which immediately activated credits of Dollars 1.03bn. Peru is a beneficiary of the IMF's 'rights accumulation approach', aimed at allowing a small group of countries to pay off deep arrears with the multilateral institutions. While settlement with the multilaterals is a crucial first step towards resolving the foreign debt problem, Peru is far from home and dry. Agreements must now be reached with the Paris Club over debts totalling some Dollars 8bn. Then there are the commercial banking creditors, owed around Dollars 6bn, plus a Dollars 1.3bn debt with suppliers. The last two categories of debt are almost entirely in arrears. In coming weeks Peru will be seeking extensive write-offs on its government-to-government debt in Paris. Experts say that, if the balance of payments is to become even remotely viable in the medium term, Peru will need to win conditions better even than those granted to Poland. Peru's total foreign debt currently stands around Dollars 21bn - Dollars 19bn of that is long-term, public sector debt.</p>

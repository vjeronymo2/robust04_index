			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A VARIETY OF WINES NOW AVAILABLE FOR PASSOVER  </P> <P> Wine is an important part of the observance of Passover (April 20 through April  27); at least four cups are poured during the seder service. I'm sure we have  all noticed how wines have changed since our childhoods, when only sweet syrupy  kosher wines were available.  </P> <P> This year at the seder table, our family and friends may choose from a wide  variety of kosher Passover wines, not only from California but from Israel,  Italy and France. Among them are sweet and dry wines -- red, white and rose in  many popular varietals -- Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon and Rieslings. You  will find many to choose from in markets and wine stores; even sparkling wines  and Champagnes are available. All Passover wines are marked with a special seal  and signed by the local rabbinical authority.  </P> <P> Beside the ceremonial uses of wine, you'll find wine to be a great way to liven  up Passover menus. Used in cooking and baking, it makes a welcome substitute  for the many seasonings, spices and sauces that are not permitted during the  eight days of Passover.  </P> <P> Remember, when you cook or bake with wine, the alcohol evaporates and only the  flavor and aroma remain, so you may serve the food to everybody in the family.  </P> <P> The recipes I'm sharing are not intended as a menu. You may not want to serve  all of them at one seder or Passover dinner, but used creatively, they will add  interest to holiday menus. Included is a California charoset developed for our  family seder. It contains only fruits, nuts and wine grown and produced in  California.  </P> <P> The Chopped Liver Terrine contains wine, chicken livers, apples, mushrooms and  chopped eggs. It makes a delicious appetizer served with matzo.  </P> <P> Then there's Beet and Horseradish Sauce that's great with gefilte fish or with  my recipe for Whitefish in White Wine. This whitefish is another family  specialty. It combines both broiling and poaching at the same time; the result  is fish that is lightly browned, but still tender and juicy.  </P> <P> A favorite main course is Lamb Shanks Roasted in Red Wine, which gives the  shanks a most delicious, robust flavor. The same recipe works well with lamb or  veal tongues.  </P> <P> For dessert, serve a sponge cake flavored with wine and spices, substituting  ground nuts and Passover potato starch for the usual matzo meal or matzo cake  flour. Or make Wine Custard Mousse using old-fashioned Concord grape wine. This  is especially good with your favorite Passover cookies.  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA CHAROSET  </P> <P> 1 large avocado  </P> <P> Juice of 1/2 lemon  </P> <P> 1/2 cup sliced almonds  </P> <P> 1/3 cup raisins  </P> <P> 4 pitted dates  </P> <P> 2 figs  </P> <P> 2 pitted prunes  </P> <P> Zest and sections of 1 orange  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons Passover sweet wine or apple juice  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons matzo meal  </P> <P> Cut avocado into halves; peel and dice into bowl.

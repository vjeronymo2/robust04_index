			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Boost for Indian lending INDIA'S central bank, announcing its credit policy for the next six months, yesterday trimmed the reserve requirements of commercial banks to encourage lending and support an industrial revival, Reuter reports from Bombay. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said that cutting the statutory liquidity ratio of the banks by 2.5 percentage points to 34.75 per cent would inject an extra Rs41.5bn (Pounds 879m) of lendable resources into the financial system. The bank left the minimum lending rate of the commercial banks unchanged at 15 percent. The bank cut the minimum lending rate by one percentage point last month, the fourth cut in the past 12 months, in an attempt to support India's economic liberalisation programme.</p>

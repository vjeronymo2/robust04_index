			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Magnet case damages could be up to Pounds 1bn Advisers and bankers to the ill-fated management buy-out of Magnet, the fitted kitchens retailer, face potential damages of up to Pounds 1bn, those involved in the litigation said yesterday. The total value of the claim is only likely to be settled by the courts, but with interest and costs may substantially outstrip the Pounds 629m cost of the original MBO in 1989. Parties involved include Bankers Trust, leader of the banking syndicate, Arthur Andersen, adviser to the management, and Arthur Young, Magnet's auditor. In its day Magnet was the largest MBO ever and the first involving 'mezzanine' finance. The case, which is due to be heard in the High Court in October, involves two separate sets of writs: GE Capital suing Bankers Trust, and Bankers Trust in turn suing professional advisers. It will raise a series of important legal precedents about the nature of diligence on acquisitions, and the duty of care of corporate finance advisers and lead banks to syndicate members. All parties involved yesterday vigorously defended their positions and maintained that the dispute was unlikely to be settled on the steps of the court. Bankers Trust is expected to argue that it believed it had a contract with Andersen to verify the figures which allowed the MBO to proceed. However, Arthur Andersen says there was no such agreement, that its duty was entirely to the management team of Magnet and that there would have been a conflict of interest if it had also acted for Bankers Trust. Mr Chris Nunn, a partner with Andersen, said: 'This is a pretty outrageous example of a deep pocket action. It is so outrageous that it makes some look respectable. Our role was never what those suing us have claimed.' As part of its defence, Andersen has drawn in to the litigation Arthur Young, now part of Ernst &amp; Young, which was auditor to Magnet and approved a series of profit estimates. Ernst &amp; Young said: 'Arthur Young had peripheral involvement in the exercise confined to reporting on a profit estimate prepared by the directors for the benefit of existing shareholders. It did not have a duty of care to the investors.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Volker Ruehe by Klaus-Peter </F> Siegloch in the ZDF studio in Mainz -- live]    [Text] [Siegloch] Mr. Ruehe, after Clinton's speech [in  Brussels tonight], can the reform states be satisfied with the  message of Partnership for Peace?    [Ruehe] Mr. Siegloch, I think that all Europeans can be  satisfied, for now it is clear that Partnership for Peace is not  a substitute for NATO membership, but that it makes a  step-by-step entry possible. It does not discriminate against  anyone; yet, it offers the possibility to differentiate. That  means that those countries that are seeking membership -- and it  is also in Germany's interest that our eastern border is not for  ever the external border of NATO and the European Union -- now  have the opportunity to closely cooperate with NATO and prepare  themselves for membership.    [Siegloch] Still, Poland and others were hoping for a  quicker NATO membership. Has this Clinton message also taken  Yeltsin's situation into account?    [Ruehe] Well, one could not expect that it would pave the  way for membership right now. The important thing is that NATO  is now fundamentally opening up and that the would-be members  will now use the time for working their way toward NATO -- for  example, to create military structures that will make real  membership possible. For German politics, it was also important  that one does not have to choose between Moscow and Warsaw,  because then one would have done everything wrong right from the  start. We need partnership with Russia, between NATO and  Russia, but we also need the possibility of expanding NATO by  those countries that are seeking such membership.    [Siegloch] Military cooperation has been offered. What  could that look like?    [Ruehe] There are very concrete proposals. As early as this  year -- and those who are seeking membership can pursue that  with particular intensity -- there should be joint exercises. I  think we will also participate in such programs. We should then  coordinate armament systems to make them compatible; the full  range of possibilities will be explored for such countries that  want to work their way toward NATO. I am in favor of initiating  concrete programs very soon -- sometime this year -- with, for  example, Poland, Hungary, the Czechs, and Slovaks.    [Siegloch] You have mentioned joint exercises. Let us  imagine a scenario of a real conflict in the East. What would  happen then? Would NATO stand idly by or would it intervene?    [Ruehe] I think that what the U.S. vice president said on  behalf of the President is right, namely that U.S. security is  linked to the security of East Central Europe. This applies, at  least, equally to West Europe, too. It means that as long as  there is no full membership, there can be no full guarantee.  However, West Europe can, of course, not at all be indifferent  to what is going on at its eastern border. At the moment, I see  no danger of a military conflict. Still, the political  revolution is not over yet in Europe. Its climax was in 1989,  and we are well-advised to strengthen this major anchor of  stability, NATO, in the future, too, and the Germans must  continue to make an important contribution with its Bundeswehr.  By the way, many of our neighbors in East Europe are hoping for  cooperation, particularly with Germany.    [Siegloch] That means that there will not be any security  guarantees in the real sense for the East and Central European  countries?    [Ruehe] No, not in the form that exists among NATO member  states. However, there will be continually improving and  intensifying cooperation. Besides, there will also be joint  peacekeeping missions, even before membership. I think that  this will also indirectly enhance security. Anyway, the  security of the Poles has a lot to do with the security of the  Germans. This applies for West and East Europe as a whole.    [Siegloch] One short question on the timeframe. Membership  not until the next century?    [Ruehe] I do not think that one should put it off  artificially for so long. I see a possibility still in this  decade, and, thus, also in this century.    [Siegloch] Thank you very much, Mr. Ruehe.</p>

			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Missing Lines -- In Sylvie Drake's Monday review of "Once in Arden" at South  Coast Repertory, some lines were omitted.  </P> <P> Writing of the predicament faced by the protagonist Helena Modjeska as to  whether to appear in vaudeville, Drake wrote:  </P> <P> Does she or doesn't she in the end? For all the talk we never quite find out.  So "Once in Arden's" only big decision is never adequately explored. The play  lacks tensile strength. Everything in it is too soft and predictable. Hellesen  writes around his subject rather than to it, endlessly circling his prey but  never coming in for the kill. . . .  </P></p>

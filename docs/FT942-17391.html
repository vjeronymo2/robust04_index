			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Buyers surface for sale of tunnelling machines Want to buy 200km of second-hand steel pipe or 110km of copper earthing cable? Maybe you are in the market for a fleet of used excavators or a crawler-crane capable of lifting 200 tonnes? One careful owner, and it must all go. Vast amounts of civil engineering machinery and surplus materials left over from building the Channel tunnel, which opens officially on May 6, are attracting possible buyers from Malaysia, Denmark, Abu Dhabi and the US. Some 85 per cent of the project's second-hand equipment has already been sold, raising more than Pounds 30m for Eurotunnel, the operator, and Transmanche, the consortium of five British and five French contractors which designed and built the tunnel. Still for sale is one of the 8.72-metre diameter tunnel-boring machines, the biggest of some eight machines used to cut the 50km-tunnel linking Britain and France. The machine, built in Glasgow by Howden Group, cost Pounds 7.5m and could fetch up to Pounds 2.5m on the second-hand market, according to agents Henry Butcher, who are handling the British end of the sale. Possible purchasers include builders of the proposed Channel tunnel rail link between London and the Kent coast. Other equipment may be bought by construction companies building London Underground's Jubilee Line extension. The agents have already sold a smaller tunnelling machine to build a stormwater drainage system at Brighton. Other tunnel-boring machines, which met mid-Channel, will remain entombed under the seabed. It would cost too much to dismantle and remove them. One of the French machines used to bore a section of tunnel from the French landward side is to be exhibited at the Eurotunnel terminal near Calais. Another may be shipped to Britain to be exhibited. Mr Peter Harriman, a Henry Butcher partner, says the agents have raised more than Pounds 16m from British sales. Purchasers have included tunnellers building the Boston metro in the US and the 18-km Storebaelt link in Denmark who have bought locomotives and muck wagons. A Hong Kong developer building hospitals in Malaysia paid Pounds 500,000 for desalination plants previously used in the cooling system during construction of the Channel tunnel. A 200-tonne crawler-crane was sold to Abu Dhabi. Others were sold to the US, Singapore and Portugal, raising Pounds 2.5m, said Mr Harriman. Mr Philippe Laboise, cost control and administration manager for the French works, says French sales have recovered about 12 per cent of the value.</p>

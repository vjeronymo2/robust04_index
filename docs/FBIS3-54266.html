Palestinian sources have told AL-HAYAH that the leadership  committee is discussing four fundamental issues. The sources  pointed out that the "10 factions" have agreed on political  tasks, "not a political program, and tasks are less binding on  participants than a program." The sources added that "after  strenuous efforts we formed the alliance and determined its  tasks. We did not discuss the political program question, so  that no faction will be under a total obligation and so that  this program will not conflict with its own."    On the issues dealt with at the leadership committee  meeting,  the sources said that disputed questions include the tasks of  the popular congresses, the share of every independent faction,  the position on the phased program for 1974 [as published], and  the factions' relationship with the National Islamic Command of  the Intifadah.    The Palestinian sources said that "the Islamic Resistance  Movement (Hamas) stresses that the popular conferences to be  held inside and outside [the occupied territories] should not be  granted any organizational capacity and that their role should  be confined to the political and propagandistic aspects "opposed  to the Palestinian-Israeli agreement."    The sources said that the representation ratio for every  faction in the leadership committee "has been deferred until  further notice, because it tends to provoke disagreement among  the factions more than any other issue. The same applied to the  position on the international resolutions."    The sources said that Hamas representatives reject these  resolutions and do not comply with them or with the phased  Palestinian program. And that they believe that this program  "is being used by (Palestinian President Yasir) 'Arafat as a  cover for all he is doing now, on the basis of the status quo  policy."</p>

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Grade appeals to OFT over football contract MR MICHAEL GRADE, chief executive of Channel 4, yesterday appealed to the Office of Fair Trading to review the issue of media concentration after the Premier League football deal with British Sky Broadcasting. He told the British Society of Magazine Editors that a new investigation would be in the interests of 'the poor viewer' whose sovereignty the 1990 Broadcasting Act was supposed to protect. 'On the evidence of the football deal and similar deals to come, Margaret Thatcher's Broadcasting Act is short-changing the customers,' Mr Grade said. He said News International told last year's Sadler inquiry into cross-media promotion that it had not used the editorial contents of its newspapers 'unduly to promote Sky'. Mr Grade said the assurances given to the Sadler committee were worthless. News International is the biggest shareholder in BSkyB, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake.</p>

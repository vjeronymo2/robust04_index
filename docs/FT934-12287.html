			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: Chevron operating profit up THE OIL price fall helped boost operating profits at Chevron in the third quarter, as higher margins on refined products more than offset the impact of lower prices on exploration and production activities. One-off charges of Dollars 145m - mainly related to the rise in the US corporate tax rate - led to a fall in net income to Dollars 420m, or Dollars 1.29 a share, from Dollars 467m or Dollars 1.37 a share the year before. Before special items, net income in both periods jumped to Dollars 565m from Dollars 410m. US refining and marketing income climbed to Dollars 164m, from Dollars 69m, while earnings overseas were up from Dollars 19m to Dollars 50m. Lower oil prices accounted for most of the improvement. Mr Ken Derr, chairman and chief operating officer, said the company had cut operating expenses by 14 per cent over the past two years, equivalent to a saving of Dollars 1 a barrel. US exploration and production income fell to Dollars 125m from Dollars 251m as higher natural gas prices failed to make up for a Dollars 3.94 fall in the price realised for a barrel of oil. Unocal, the Los Angeles-based energy group, lifted its third-quarter earnings to Dollars 70m or 25 cents a share from Dollars 11m or 1 cent a year ago, boosted by improved West Coast refining and marketing operations, Reuter reports. Higher domestic natural gas prices, lower worldwide exploration expense and lower interest expense contributed to the improved results. The quarter included a Dollars 14m charge on the effect of the higher federal tax rate on deferred taxes. The 1992 quarter included a Dollars 32m restructuring charge. Third-quarter operating earnings from petroleum exploration and production fell to Dollars 101m from Dollars 121m in 1992, reflecting lower worldwide crude oil prices and production. Higher domestic natural gas prices and production and lower exploration expense partially offset the drop.</p>

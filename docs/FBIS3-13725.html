Under the headline "The Peace Process and the New  Opportunity," AL-BA'TH says in its editorial: In a new effort  to activate the stalemated peace process, Syria has called on  the Arab parties to the peace process to meet to discuss the  resumption of the bilateral talks.    AL-BA'TH stresses that many factors call for this move.  First, it stresses Syria's commitment to the peace efforts and  the need to advance the peace process toward its aspired  objective. Second, it is completely in line with international  legitimacy. This is because it immediately follows the UN  Security Council resolution condemning the Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre and calling for the protection of our kinsfolk in the  occupied territories. Third, the decision to suspend the  bilateral negotiations was made after coordination among Syria  and the other Arab parties to protest the Hebron massacre.  Thus, Syria has reaffirmed its concern for the security of our  kinfolk in the occupied territories and the need to provide all  means of protection for them. This is in order to prevent the  occurrence of any new crimes, which the occupation may commit at  any moment if it is not deterred by the international community.  The paper indicates that Syria's decision, which was made after  intensive Arab and international contacts, will give the peace  process a new opportunity to achieve its objectives.    Concluding its editorial, AL-BA'TH says that the [UN  Security  Council] resolution, one way or another, reflects the  responsibility of the international community, which rejects  bloodshed and occupation. This responsibility must be carried  out by pressuring the Rabin government into responding to the  requirements of peace.    TISHRIN's editorial focuses on the UN Security Council  resolution, which strongly condemns the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre  and calls on Israel to confiscate Zionist settlers's weapons.  The resolution also calls for the protection of the Palestinian  people and an international presence in the occupied Arab  territories, as well as stressing the need to continue efforts  to boost the peace process.    TISHRIN says that, belated as it is, the UN Security Council  resolution is a positive step that will boost the peace process  and urge Israel to respect the Geneva Conventions and comply  with the UN Security Council resolutions. The resolution also  reflects an explicit commitment to the need to protect the  Palestinian people from the Zionist settlers' acts and  practices.    Referring to the contacts held among President Hafiz  al-Asad,  U.S. President Clinton, Lebanese President al-Hirawi, and King  Husayn of Jordan, TISHRIN says: It is obvious that the U.S.  Administration is interested in the resumption of the peace  efforts and that it realizes the dangers of the continued  Israeli prevarication. Stressing sincere Arab intentions toward  a genuine just, comprehensive peace in the Middle East, Syria  has announced that the parties to the Washington talks will soon  consider the resumption of the talks, which were suspended in  solidarity with the Palestinian people to express denunciation  of Israel's appalling crime. The paper adds: The interest in  continuing the peace process proceeds from the need to put  Israel to the test, expose its false claims about peace,  convince the international community to assume its  responsibilities, and to deduce lessons from two years of futile  talks in Washington.    Concluding its editorial, TISHRIN urges the international  community to rectify matters and to move after the Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre to confront Israel's ceaseless efforts to  obstruct the Washington talks.    Commenting on the same subject, AL-THAWRAH says that UN  Security Council Resolution No. 904 condemning the Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre clearly reflects the international community's  eagerness to enforce its laws and conventions and to prevent  Israel from continuing its defiance and disregard for  international legitimacy.    AL-THAWRAH adds: Hopes are now pinned on a firm  international will to find an appropriate mechanism for the  enforcement of the resolution to force Israel to comply with all  its paragraphs. Past experience has shown that the Israeli  rulers deal with UN resolutions with disdain and derision, and  that they will not abandon this provocative course unless there  is effective pressure to force them to do so. The paper urges  the influential UN Security Council member states to intensify  their moves and efforts to ensure the credibility of the  resolution and to spare it the fate of other resolutions, which  remained ink on paper without any effect on the ground.    AL-THAWRAH says that the circumstances that led to the  Hebron  massacre will continue to exist as long as the settlements  remain in the occupied Arab territories, as long as armed  settlers are roaming the streets, and as long as they have the  authority to open fire on Arabs.</p>

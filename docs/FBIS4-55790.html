The institute director, Dr. Sadri Fetiu, said in an interview  with ATA, that the institute will publish this year 32  scientific works.    Mr. Fetiu said: "The greatest difficulty is the isolation of  the institute from the scientific and intellectual world  especially with the scientific institutions of Albania because  of the obstacles put by the Serbian authorities who do not allow  the world literature to pass to the Prishtina Library and vice  versa.</p>

On 7 March, the Hanoi Vietnamese communists  ordered their lackey puppets in the two-headed government to  claim once again that the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea  [NADK] had used Thai territory to defeat them on the Anlung Veng  battlefield. This is a dirty and base accusation; no one except  the notoriously cunning Vietnamese communists could think of  playing the trick of the thief shouting: Stop thief!    II. For what purpose did the Vietnamese communists order  their puppets to level this accusation? It was based on the  following:    1. Covering their most shameful and severe defeat on the  Anlung Veng battlefield. The Vietnamese communists and their  alliance have claimed various unreasonable pretexts to fool  their lackeys into further inflaming the war to serve their  strategic policies.    2. Covering the shipment of Vietnamese forces and armaments  to Cambodia in accordance with what the Vietnamese communists  call Cambodian-Vietnamese military cooperation, which they  agreed upon with the puppet Chea Sim in Hanoi in early March.  The Vietnamese communists have painstakingly implemented the  strategy and tactics of launching attacks in western Cambodia  and shipping Vietnamese men and women to the eastern part of the  country.    3. The Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] and the NADK have  always respected and will always respect the Kingdom of  Thailand's sovereignty and territorial integrity. They have  never done anything that affects the Royal Thai Government or  the Thai people. The PDK and the entire Cambodian nation and  people want to coexist peacefully with all neighboring  countries, especially Thailand and the Thai people, who respect  other countries' sovereignty and territorial integrity. The  Thais are different from the Vietnamese communist puppets and  the two-headed government, who -- relying on the Vietnamese  communists and the Western alliance -- have implemented the  policy of further inflaming the war, both inside and outside the  country, and then denounced other people without any sense of  responsibility. [Dated] 9 March 1994 [Signed] The NADK spokesman</p>

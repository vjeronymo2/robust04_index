			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. REPORTEDLY PLANS TO TOUGHEN REFUGEE ADMISSION FOR SOVIET JEWS  </P> <P> Large numbers of Soviet Jews would be ineligible for admission to the United  States as refugees under plans drafted by the State Department and other  agencies, the New York Times reported today.  </P> <P> The newspaper said a likely effect would be to channel many would-be immigrants  to Israel.  </P> <P> In addition, the Bush Administration is opposing bills passed by both the  Senate and the House of Representatives that would make it easier for Soviet  Jews to come to America as refugees.  </P> <P> The paper quoted unnamed State and Justice department officials as saying that  allowing free immigration of Soviet Jews would impose immense resettlement  costs on the U.S. government.  </P> <P> Soviet Jewish emigration rose from 8,155 in 1987 to 18,9655 last year and  appears likely to exceed 48,000 this year.  </P> <P> Under the State Department plan, Soviet Jews who have no relatives in the  United States or ties to it would become ineligible for admission as refugees,  the newspaper said.  </P> <P> U.S. State and Justice Department officials were unavailable for comment.  </P></p>

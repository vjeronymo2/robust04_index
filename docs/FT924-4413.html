			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Thames TV forecasts turnover in excess of Pounds 100m next year THAMES Television, which ceases to be an ITV broadcaster at the end of this month, expects a turnover of more than Pounds 100m next year. Mr Richard Dunn, chief executive of the largest ITV company, outbid by Carlton Television, made the forecast last night at the Royal Television Society. 'We have moved within 12 months from team-player public service broadcaster to sole television trader, whose job it is to please viewers through any channels of any medium in any country,' Mr Dunn said. Thames expects its television production business next year to bring in between Pounds 45m and Pounds 55m. Its international distribution arm should have a turnover of Pounds 15m while Reeces, its US production arm, should have revenue of Pounds 30m. Thames' studios at Teddington should bring in Pounds 5m. UK Gold, founded by Thames and the BBC would, Mr Dunn forecast, be worth as much as all but the largest ITV companies by the end of the decade. Mr Dunn admitted last night that he did not have high expectations in 'the indiscriminate, unnecessary and destructive' auction for ITV franchises. 'We bid the maximum the London weekday licence was worth to us, close to Pounds 33m per annum. I would not have bid any more,' he said. Mr Dunn detailed how there were several series of talks for the sale of Thames to Carlton but that each time discussions collapsed on price. Mr Dunn said if Carlton had acquired control of Thames it would have had no qualified rival in the auction and 'could have saved itself Pounds 43m per year for 10 years'.</p>

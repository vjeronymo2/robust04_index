Mr. Salim has four days to negotiate with political  forces on the dispatching of about 200 OAU soldiers.    The deployment of the pan-African military mission was  requested by the Burundi Government after the failure of the  military coup attempt last October. The first elements of the  OAU mission arrived last month but the force charged with the  protection of the government and the reestablishing of trust has  yet to be set up. Violent demonstrations were organized recently  in the Burundi capital, Bujumbura, against the deployment of  foreign troops.</p>

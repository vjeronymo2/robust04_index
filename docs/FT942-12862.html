			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Hong Kong (11): Office costs hit peak - A look at the property market Last month 489 people sent off registration forms and deposits as evidence of their intention to pay up to HKDollars 15m apiece for flats that are little bigger than half a standard swimming pool. Just 70 flats were initially put up for offer, though Swire Properties, the developer, lost no time in releasing a further 76. These homes do not bear illustrious Peak addresses: instead, they are perched half-way down, in the more built-up residential Mid-Levels area. At an average HKDollars 9,728 a sq ft - or over HKDollars 10m for the smallest 1,094 sq ft flat - they are still within reach of the colony's newly rich, its speculators and families already on the property ladder. Within weeks (and after pleas from the likes of Mr Li Ka-shing, chairman of Cheung Kong and Hutchison) the government announced it would take action. Sir Hamish Macleod, the financial secretary, has not ruled out market intervention. But he faces a delicate balancing act if he is to avoid the risk of sending prices plummeting. For many - especially for those with memories of property booms and busts elsewhere in the developed world - that is the question: can it last? Mr Peter Churchouse, head of research at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong, says: 'I'm not expecting a crash here. We would have to see some sort of cataclysmic event first. 'We don't have the gearing, the banks are not in problems - there are no defaulting property landlords or developers and we are not seeing mortgage defaults, and I think the risk of that is pretty slight. I don't think we are staring a crash in the face, but at the same time I think the market's going to start slowing down.' A deceleration would certainly be timely. Hong Kong has already overtaken Tokyo as the world's most expensive location to set up office: according to agents Jones Lang Wootton, average top grade office rentals in the prime business district of Central have shot up 75 per cent year-on-year. Average net office rentals weigh in at HKDollars 75 a sq ft - although one-off units have gone for more than HKDollars 100 a sq ft - compared with HKDollars 71 in central Tokyo in December, since when rentals have fallen. According to agents Brooke Hillier Parker, shopkeepers field the biggest bills: at HKDollars 545 a month they were paying more than double the HKDollars 232 paid by their peers in Tokyo. At the luxury end of the residential market, Hong Kong prices have risen 350 per cent since 1989; for commercial property, values have increased by 150 per cent over the same period. Tracking the trend of housing costs - as dictated essentially by the cost of property and interest rates - against household income shows that, while the disparity is nowhere near as severe as in 1981, it is very much worse than in 1986-87, according to Morgan Stanley. It is a concern being taken on board at the highest levels: in February Mr David Carse, deputy chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, wrote to the Hong Kong Association of Banks calling on its members to review their exposure to the property market and endeavour to restrict their lending for house purchases to around 15 per cent a year. Total exposure to the property market should be kept to around 40 per cent of loans in Hong Kong, he said. By March, Mr Li was calling on the government to jack up the 50 hectares a year of land currently released under the Sino-British agreement. This was the way to curb prices, he argued, not by introducing new taxes which would simply serve to swell government revenues. Mr Stanley Ho, Macau casino magnate and chairman of Shun Tak Holdings, went one step further, leading a high-powered delegation from the Hong Kong Real Estate Developers' Association to meet Mr Lu Ping, director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and putting the request for more land direct to Beijing. Dissociating themselves from speculation, the developers blamed rocketing prices on lack of construction and an unexpected demand for flats from returning emigrants. Pre-empting them both, the colony's legislative council members have given voice to their concerns. The same week, Mr Lu warned mainland companies not to dabble in property speculation across the border, saying this could undermine stability and prosperity in Hong Kong. Finally, since actions speak louder than words, Unisys Corp, the US computer company, is to shift its regional headquarters from Hong Kong to Singapore. The action - and one which other multinationals are expected to follow - shows that corporates are no longer prepared to swallow the high cost of overheads in Hong Kong. It is a timely reminder that the colony does not have a total monopoly on sophisticated legal and banking frameworks or on bilingual labour forces. Others, too, may have a foot in the China door. While there is unlikely at this stage to be a mass exodus from Hong Kong, Mr Churchouse expects a phase of trading down: corporate Hong Kong refusing to pay HKDollars 150,000 a month to house staff in big-scale apartments. There is as yet no evidence of this happening, he says, but he believes the point is not that far away. 'Rental costs for housing in good quality apartments are now as expensive, or even more expensive, than they were in Tokyo at the top of the bubble, looking at what would be considered a big flat in each of those markets. However, on a square footage basis, Hong Kong is still cheaper than Tokyo was at the top.' There are other key differences between the two markets: Hong Kong's developers are a notoriously conservative breed, and keep their gearing very low. Individuals have only one mortgage on one house. Multinationals still want a foot in the Asia camp, and preferably close to China. Companies are already starting to rebel against office rentals, which are now as much as Dollars 100 a sq ft in Exchange Square, a development of shiny soaring blocks in the heart of the prime business district and home to the stock exchange and many of the colony's businesses. While few companies are reluctant to drop the cachet of an address on the square, many are starting to cut floor space and despatch staff to Swire's new development on the eastern part of the island. Here rentals are just one third of those commanded at Exchange Square, which is a 10-minute cab journey away. With the government now pledged to take action, it is not just the developers and young marrieds that await details with concern. Any steps that might derail the property market hit Hong Kong at its very heart: some 65 per cent of the stock market is estimated to be property-related.</p>

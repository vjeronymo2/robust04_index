			<p>BFN     [Text] The agricultural unions of the Transvaal and  [Orange] Free State have proposed the establishment of a land  commission as soon as possible to address problems and fears  regarding land demands. The presidents of the two unions, Mr.  Dries Bruwer and Dr. Piet Gouws, say in a joint statement that  irresponsible land demands by pressure groups such as the  National Land Committee will deter investigators. They added  that the new government would also not be able to provide jobs  if the future of agriculture was not clear. Mr. Bruwer and Dr.  Gouws were reacting to a warning by the land committee that  people's expectations regarding land should not be pushed aside.  The land committee pointed out that the new government could  expect protest action if land reform did not get immediate  attention.</p>

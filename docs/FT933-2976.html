			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Universities warned over training snub MR JOHN PATTEN, education secretary, yesterday threatened to close down university teacher training departments which refused to co-operate with independent schools. This follows last week's announcement that the government will create a new agency to control teacher training. Oxford University's education department does not work with independent schools and a Headmasters' Conference official described relations with the department as 'appalling'. Mr Arthur Hearnden, Independent Schools Joint Council general secretary, said it was well known that Oxford University's education department shunned partnerships with independent schools. Oxford said that no local independent schools had applied to it. Mr Patten, a former Oxford don, speaking at the Headmasters' Conference annual meeting in Oxford, said: 'Complaints have come about two or three universities which have refused to have anything to do with what they call public schools.' He described this as a 'very sad reflection on those institutions' and said he would not hesitate to withdraw government recognition from courses 'where institutions refused to co-operate with independent schools seeking to set up teacher training partnerships with state schools.' Mr Pattern also announced that from next year, independent schools could apply for government funds to offer teacher training of their own in consortia with state schools. He said state schools operating a pilot teacher training scheme this year received Pounds 4,000 for each of the 2,250 trainees involved. The headmasters gave these proposals a cautious welcome, although the government's decision to continue publishing 'league tables' of academic performance was attacked as misleading. Mr Patten also voiced his support for the tough public sector pay policy of the Chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke. The National Union of Teachers called for a salary increase of eight per cent, plus Pounds 1,000 for each teacher, which the union said was necessary to maintain recruitment. Mr Patten said that such a pay increase would mean the loss of 80,000 jobs. He added: 'In the present economic climate, in a very tight public expenditure round with no problem recruiting high quality teachers any such claim would clearly be unrealistic.'</p>

			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Caspian nations get together Representatives of all the countries surrounding the Caspian Sea will meet today to try to hammer out their differences over claims to the region's natural resources. The precise demarcation of borders has been in dispute following the break-up of the Soviet Union. Russia and Azerbaijan have recently squabbled over oil rights after a Dollars 7bn exploration and development deal was announced by the Azeri government. The sea is enormously rich in oil resources and has been the focus of much exploration activity by foreign companies. The other interested countries, which include Iran, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan, will discuss the division of mineral and fish resources and also navigational issues for shipping. The Russian government, which will be represented by Mr Andrei Kozyrev, foreign minister, will stress the unacceptability of unilateral action by any one government bordering the sea. Mr Kozyrev met a representative of the Iranian government yesterday.</p>

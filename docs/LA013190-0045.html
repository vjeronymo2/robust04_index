			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FDA'S PROCEDURES ON AZT APPROVAL  </P> <P> Your editorial "Get It to the Right People Faster," (Jan. 18) is mistaken in  accusing the Food and Drug Administration of needlessly delaying the approval  of zidovudine (AZT) to treat people at earlier stages of HIV infection. The  editorial even referred incorrectly to the agency as the "Federal Drug  Administration."  </P> <P> Even many of the FDA's severest critics recognize the circumstances surrounding  this case and have not blamed the agency for any alleged delays. They realize  that the agency, by law, cannot approve new uses for a drug until the drug's  sponsors provide clinical data showing that a drug is safe and effective for  its proposed use in its intended population. Without this clinical evidence,  the agency cannot reliably review or approve new indications for a drug.  </P> <P> Would the editorial's authors prefer the agency to callously approve drugs  without this knowledge, and thereby subject large numbers of patients to  unknown risks?  </P> <P> FDA is committed to expediting its review and approval once it has the  necessary evidence to show safety and efficacy. Just this month, for example,  FDA approved new lower dose recommendations for zidovudine after taking less  than a month to review the clinical data that had been submitted on this new  dose.  </P> <P> As a public institution, FDA expects, and even welcomes, informed criticism of  its policies and action.  </P> <P> But, when a publication of the stature of The Times chooses to use the agency  as a convenient scapegoat on such an important issue, without bothering to get  the facts straight, it serves no useful purpose to people with AIDS and the  rest of the public.  </P> <P> JEFFREY A. NESBIT  </P> <P> Associate Commissioner  </P> <P> for Public Affairs, FDA  </P> <P> Rockville, Md.  </P></p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Two channels on a single recorder Arguments over clashing television schedules could be eased by the development of a multiplexer unit for home videos that allows two television channels to be recorded simultaneously. The unit, which combines 3D recording techniques and computer memory chips, allows the user to record over an existing programme without erasing it. The technology, which was devised by 3D Video Plus, a Kent-based recording technology company, is being marketed by Foxmark International, a Tokyo consultancy.

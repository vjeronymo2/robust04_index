			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has  declared that the protocol to the Russia-NATO program due to be  approved in Brussels is not going to be signed.    Answering a question from Interfax before his departure for  Brussels on Tuesday he said the protocol does not require  signing. "It registers the understanding that Russia and NATO  are going to cooperate on key elements of the program the  Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev submitted to the NATO  headquarters about a month ago", Kozyrev said.    According to him, Grachev described the military aspects of  cooperation. "Now we are going to add a political element and  officially proclaim the cooperation of Russia and NATO," Kozyrev  said adding that he would sign the Partnership for Peace program  in Brussels. "We welcome this program too", he said.    The minister stressed that the protocol and program  supplement, not contradict each other.    According to Kozyrev, the protocol which is now getting its  final touch reflects the special relationship of Russia and NATO  and their potentials. "The interaction and mutually- beneficial  cooperation of Russia and NATO are possible and necessary", the  minister reiterated.</p>

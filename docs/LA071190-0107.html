			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOOKING AHEAD: CONSUMER APPLIANCES MAY SOON GO HIGH TECH  </P> <P> As computer chip technology grows ever smaller, more powerful and less  expensive, virtually everything that can be computerized will be computerized,  at least experimentally.  </P> <P> A range of new functions will be built into traditional appliances and systems,  both in the home and in the office. The key will be user friendliness: making  the appliances and their new capabilities simple to understand and operate.  </P> <P> Manufacturers worry, however, that in many cases consumers might see these  high-tech appliances as gadgets rather than as legitimate labor-saving devices.  Developing appliances and systems with remarkable new capabilities will be no  problem; the trick is to make sure consumers want and know how to use the  highly computerized products.  </P> <P> For example, a voice-controlled microwave oven that opens and shuts its doors  when you command it to is one of a number of user-friendly appliances that  could be on the market soon in the United States. But manufacturers are trying  to find out first if the public is ready for such equipment.  </P> <P> At Pennsylvania State University, associate professor of industrial engineering  Andris Freivalds is conducting response tests to see if consumers will accept  the voice-activated microwave as well as several other high-tech home  appliances now being developed by Daewoo Electronics Co. in Seoul. Daewoo is  also working on a remote-controlled vacuum cleaner.  </P> <P> The microwave oven can be programmed to open and shut its door on voice  command. When the command for opening the door is spoken, the door pops open  and a tray slides out; on the command to close, the tray slides back in and the  door shuts. The microwave also has two electronic display screens on which  prerecorded recipes can be viewed, together with a picture of the completed  dish.  </P> <P> The vacuum cleaner has an auxiliary engine that attaches to its underside and  can be driven by remote control. The vacuum cleaner can be guided forward,  backward, left and right.  </P> <P> Other high-tech consumer products such as voice-activated telephones and  cameras are already available. For example, Toshiba is now marketing a  voice-activated telephone in Japan that will dial a telephone number when the  caller picks up the receiver and says the name of the person being called. For  the initial input of a name, the telephone's user says a name three times to  give the machine a range of voice-spectrum patterns. Then, when the caller  picks up the receiver and says the name, the telephone can recognize the name  even though it may sound slightly different from the original version.  </P> <P> Another new product in Japan is Konica's compact camera that takes pictures in  response to sound. The camera is placed on a tripod, from where it  automatically points itself toward sounds it picks up and snaps a photo. The  result may a totally candid photo at a party or a photo taken at the moment a  baby laughs.  </P> <P> Computerized "add-on" technology will enable existing home systems and  appliances to be modified so that they can respond to voice commands.  Mastervoice Inc. of Los Alamitos has developed a product called Butler in a  Box. The computerized system allows homeowners to control up to 32 systems and  appliances -- ranging from heating and air conditioning, security systems and  indoor or outdoor lighting to lawn sprinklers and radios -- by using simple  voice commands. The "butler" can understand oral commands from four different  voices and can be programmed to give a voice-synthesized response.  </P> <P> Freivalds' tests at Penn State will gather the responses of both adults and  students to some of these high-tech products and will send their evaluations  and suggestions to their manufacturer. He believes that the average consumer  would find such appliances useful and time-saving. "I think the public is ready  for them," he says.  </P> <P> He also notes that such appliances "would be useful to the elderly or  physically disabled, allowing them more control over their world."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 8 (YONHAP) -- South Korea is to go ahead  with military improvement and exercise plans in a change of  stance from when Seoul wanted to avoid any act that could  provoke North Korea, government sources here said Sunday.    Schedule for deployment of Patriot missiles and Apache  helicopters, for example, will proceed as planned, and so will  South Korea-U.S. military maneuver "Team Spirit" and arms  improvement projects, they said.    These plans would change, as Seoul said, if North Korea  returns to negotiations with South Korean Government and if the  negotiations make progress.    But Seoul will separate these plans from the ongoing nuclear  talks, the sources said.    South Korea announced in March that it will no longer demand  inter-Korean dialogue as a condition to high-level talks between  North Korea and the United States. It was then that the  government decided to sever the link between the military plans  and the nuclear problem, they said.    "It's true that we did try to avoid provoking North Korea as  much as possible," said one official, "But despite such efforts,  North Korea hasn't given up its nuclear program. It's our  policy to pursue necessary security measures without linkage to  the nuclear negotiations. [no closing quotation mark as received]</p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Another 4,500 steel jobs to go GERMANY'S largest steelmaker, Thyssen Stahl, yesterday announced plans to cut 4,500 jobs in four steel plants, in a rationalisation of its output of girders, bars and semi-finished products. The news was announced as 20,000 workers in the rival Krupp-Hoesch group staged a 24-hour strike to protest at the likely closure of two plants making special steels, and an entire integrated steelworks. Blaming a substantial overcapacity in the European steel industry for all so-called long products, Thyssen announced it was abandoning production of beams and girders at its Bruckhausen plant, closing a combined steel rod and steel wire production line at Krefeld, and shutting down output of special steel products at the Witten plant. A total of 4,500 jobs would go, out of 7,000 redundancies which the company is planning in coming months. Thyssen has pressed ahead with the plan, in spite of parallel talks with Krupp-Hoesch and Saarstahl over greater specialisation in the overall production of long products, such as girders, reinforcing steel and wire rods, where European overcapacity is greatest. Earlier, Krupp-Hoesch announced the probable closure of its long products plants at Siegen and Hagen, with the loss of 4,000 jobs. The company is also deciding whether to close an integrated steelworks either at Duisburg-Rheinhausen, or at Dortmund. Mr Gerhard Cromme, the chief executive of the Krupp-Hoesch group, was booed by striking workers yesterday when he said redundancies were inevitable. However Mr Jurgen Harnisch, head of Krupp Stahl, said on Wednesday it might be possible to save 1,500 of the jobs at Siegen and Hagen by setting up an independent special steels company: all the products at the plants are high-value special steels. All the plants affected by the Thyssen and Krupp closures are in the heart of Germany's Ruhrgebiet industrial area, where labour militancy is now running high. The German steel industry federation estimates that 35,000 to 40,000 jobs will be lost in the rationalisation process, 10,000 of them in east Germany. The cuts are going ahead in advance of any final agreement in Brussels on a steel industry rationalisation plan, which would require capacity cuts across the Community.</p>

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / International Company News: DSM lifted by jump in sales A jump in sales allowed DSM, the Dutch chemicals group, to report a near 14-fold increase in net profit in the first quarter compared with the same, severely depressed period of 1993. Net profit rose to Fl 83m (Dollars 43m) from Fl 6m a year earlier, on turnover up 5 per cent at Fl 2.2bn. Sales by volume were up a strong 9 per cent, reflecting greater demand for plastics and caprolactum, a raw material used to make nylon. DSM said part of the sales rise may have been due to non-recurring factors, such as extra stockpiling by industrial customers and by a drop in exports from competitors in central and eastern Europe. Another factor behind the profit rise was a further decrease in fixed costs. The workforce stood at 19,774 people at the end of the first quarter, an 11 per cent decline from the same period of 1993. The economy in Europe, DSM's main market, showed signs of a hesitant recovery in the first quarter, with some growth reported by European car makers, an important customer group for the company. The company said it expected business in the current quarter to be similar to the first three months of the year. But DSM cautioned that results would be influenced by maintenance shutdowns in the second quarter. It declined to make a forecast for full-year results. Mr Simon de Bree, chairman, said the results, which were above analysts' predictions, were encouraging but noted the recovery was frail, and selling prices were still low. DSM's shares rallied strongly on the first-quarter results, closing up Fl 4.70, or 3.3 per cent, at Fl 145.00.</p>

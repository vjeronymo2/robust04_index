			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Strikers bring Paris to standstill Strikers in Paris yesterday brought the metro, bus and suburban railway systems to a virtual halt and caused massive traffic jams. The morning rush-hour saw tailbacks totalling 230km, and hundreds trying to cram on to the few trains running. Strikers were protesting against the planned transfer of responsibility for the RATP metro/bus and SNCF suburban railway systems from the central government, which subsidises them by FFr5bn a year, to the Ile-de-France region, comprising Paris and the surrounding area. Ile-de-France said yesterday there was no question of privatising the public transport system, but workers fear it will introduce competitive tenders, demand productivity increases and raise fares to replace the government subsidy.</p>

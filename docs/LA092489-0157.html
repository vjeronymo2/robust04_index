			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LIGHT-PLANE TRAFFIC OVER ORANGE AND L.A. COUNTIES  </P> <P> Government agencies must face the fact that there are too many aircraft in the  sky over Southern California. Are we to wait for another midair collision such  as the one over Cerritos before this problem is addressed?  </P> <P> According to reports in The Times, we have more than 39,000 licensed pilots in  Los Angeles and Orange counties, a number doubtless increasing pressure to add  more commercial flights. And we have a level of affluence that supports flying  as a recreational pastime. The central issue: to what extent can we continue to  permit unlimited recreational use of our skies? On a typical Saturday or  Sunday, the sound of light planes can be heard over my neighborhood almost  incessantly. I have more than once looked up to see two converging planes veer  off from each other at the last minute.  </P> <P> General aviation proponents argue that the proportion of recreational flights  is not that high, that limiting light-plane traffic would create hardships on  business activity. I don't buy that argument. The dramatic increase in flights  over my area on weekends and holidays compared to that on weekdays is surely  not due to business travel. And if one follows the stories in the press about  light-plane crashes and near-misses, it becomes apparent that the private  pilots involved are usually flying for reasons unrelated to business.  </P> <P> The time has come to find a way to limit the number of unnecessary flights over  Los Angeles and Orange counties. Already the computers controlling our air  traffic are overloaded. Adding more computers will still not solve the problem  of all the light planes lacking radar transponders. For the sake of the public  safety, the Federal Aviation Administration must start acting like a  responsible regulatory agency rather than merely a facilitator of general  aviation and recreational flying.  </P> <P> GORDON W.

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Light Relief Electricity for the Blackwall Tunnel in east London can be provided by any supplier and not just London Electricity, the industry watchdog Offer ruled yesterday. Professor Stephen Littlechild, director-general of Offer, confirmed that under rules governing the new competitive electricity market, the tunnel was a big enough customer to choose its own supplier. The Department of Transport and the Department of the Environment were in dispute with London Electricity because they wanted to take power supplies for the tunnel from PowerGen, the privatised generating company. Prof Littlechild said he viewed the two tunnels as a single site, with demand of more than 1MW over a three-month peak usage period - the threshold above which customers can choose their electricity supplier. The ruling might have implications for local authorities in purchasing electricity for street lighting.</p>

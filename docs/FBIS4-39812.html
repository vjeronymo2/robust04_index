			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS special correspondents Tigran Liloyan </F> and Mikhail Shevtsov]    [Text] Yerevan, 9 Jun -- Siting of Russian military bases  in Armenia, service by Armenian lads in Russian units stationed  on the state's territory, and also conditions of bringing  peacemaking forces into the region -- these questions are at the  center of attention at talks Russian Defense Minister Pavel  Grachev has been having today with the Republic's leaders. He  is making a working trip round the Transcaucasus.    As you know, at a meeting of military department heads of  Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Nagorno-Karabakh with the mediation of  Pavel Grachev, a protocol was drafted on the first stage of a  settlement -- cease-fire and disengagement of the sides. By the  end of May, it was planned to introduce about 1,800 Russian  peacemakers into the conflict zone, but the protocol was not  signed by the Azeri side, which insisted that practically  simultaneously with the disengagement of the forces Armenia  should start freeing the Azeri territories it seized in the  course of the conflict. This is the problem Pavel Grachev has  to discuss at his coming meeting on 11 June in Baku with  Azeribaijani President Heydar Aliyev.</p>

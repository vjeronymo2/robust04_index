			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / German training hit by cash crisis THE Federal Office of Labour yesterday announced that it had run out of money to finance new job training schemes in Germany. The announcement was greeted with dismay by politicians across the board, with the opposition Social Democratic party warning that unemployment could rise by a further 250,000 if such financing was cut off. A total of DM9.9bn (Pounds 4.2bn) was supposed to be earmarked this year for retraining 300,000 workers in the five east German states, and 60,000 in the rest of Germany. But the federal department overseeing the scheme has run out of money. The spectre of rising unemployment in eastern Germany coincides with renewed calls by IG Metall, Germany's giant engineering trade union, to step up protests in the five eastern states next week against the decision by the engineering employers to renege on a 26 per cent pay rise for 300,000 union members. Gesamtmetall, the employers' association, broke a contract with IG Metall agreed in March 1991, which would have brought east German wages up to 82 per cent of their west German counterparts on April 1 of this year, even though productivity is 30 per cent below, and unit labour costs 40 per cent above west German levels. However, in what might be first signs of a compromise, Mr Thomas Stach, spokesman for employers in Thuringia, said there was a 'positive signal' in talks with IG Metall. Talks broke down last week in the other four east German states after Gesamtmetall said the contract was no longer relevant because of deteriorating economic conditions in both eastern and western Germany. In Thuringia, Mr Bernhard Vogel, the state's prime minister, and other senior officials, have supported a compromise which might involve amending the timetable for reaching income parity with western Germany, due in April 1994, and the rate of wage rises. Gesamtmetall's decision to opt out of the contract in the other east German states was yesterday followed by an announcement from Nordmetall employers in Saxony and Berlin-Brandenburg that they too were reneging on the contract. Mr Franz Steinkuhler, head of IG Metall, told engineering workers in Jena on Thursday that strike action in the east would be taken from April 1 if the employers refused to pay the 26 per cent wage rise. The premiers of Germany's 16 states yesterday started a weekend meeting aimed at reaching consensus on a solidarity pact. They are discussing a 'federal consolidation programme,' primarily designed to finance reconstruction of the east German states.</p>

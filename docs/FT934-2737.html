			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Outdoors: Are those my skis? - Arnie Wilson makes a pair of his own, and is very reluctant to use them THE checklist could hardly have been longer if I had been about to undertake micro-surgery: undergloves; gloves; apron; industrial glasses; protective shoes; gallons of purple resin to slop and slosh all over the bench; all kinds of bits of pre-shaped fibreglass; triaxial-braided torsion box; carbon steel racing edges; Grateful Dead top-skins. On second thoughts, I felt more like a kid in a playgroup than a surgeon. Up to my armpits in purple grunge, I had serious doubts about whether the soggy, clammy, messy, viscous, sodden objects I was toying with would ever turn into anything, let alone brand new skis. But then, perhaps they didn't: perhaps the sleek, elegant Dark Star K2 TRC skis with Limited Edition Grateful Dead 'Lunatic Fringe' tops and my name lasered into them in red were substituted in the final stage of the manufacturing process. Perhaps the ones that I 'made' in Seattle were thrown laughingly on the scrap-heap. There was certainly plenty of time for a switch to be made between my putting the finishing touches to the skis and their arrival 24 hours later - after we had paced up and down the K2 ski factory on Vashon Island like fathers-to-be awaiting the arrival of new-born babies. Another possibility was that Tom, who had guided me patiently through the whole process - 'wet it out - then get a long, skinny bead and give it a uni-directional blast with your paddle' - could easily have substituted some he had 'prepared earlier'. The invitation to make my own skis was irresistible, especially to someone technologically illiterate such as myself. K2, which has dynamic, Himalayan-sounding connotations, actually refers to the Kirschner brothers (Bill and Don) who used to make splints and animal cages on Vashon Island, a short ferry ride across the spectacular waters of Puget Sound in Washington State. Then one day in 1961, using a pair of borrowed skis as a pattern, Bill Kirschner made himself a pair of fibreglass skis. By 1964 Kirschner Manufacturing produced their first commercial batch of skis: 250 pairs. By the following year, the figure was up to 1,600, and by 1966 K2 was selling 21,000 pairs of skis and the company had 83 employees. Today K2 is America's top-selling ski, selling 500,000 pairs annually worldwide - about 10 per cent of the world market. Skis you make yourself are rather different from rentals, and having made my own, I did not really want to ski on them. I became paranoid about the faintest hair-line scratch. Every run became nail-bitingly tense. At the slightest impact I imagined all those funny, sloshy bits of resin-soaked fibreglass spilling out like entrails from a punctured corpse. At least in America, in fresh snow, they had a chance, the poor wretches. Crystal Mountain, 76 miles from Seattle, was a pleasant surprise, although we did arrive in unusually good snow conditions. With almost 30 trails, acres of back-country skiing, and a vertical drop of more than 3,000 feet, the cost of a lift pass - Dollars 16 during the week, Dollars 28 at weekends  -came as a revelation after most prices in Colorado, Utah and California. Alpental, only 46 miles from Seattle and one of four interconnected resorts in Snoqualmie Pass, was also quite a find simply because of its challenging Internationale run and its exceptional back-country skiing. It is very rare to find great tree skiing on long, steep slopes in such a small resort. My new skis had a field day blasting their way down Draft Dodger Ridge, Great Scott Bowl and Trash Can. Alpental, and its neighbours - Snoqualmie, Ski Acres and Hyak - have 33 lifts between them and 16 runs are floodlit every night. However the owner, Dave Moffett, seems to have somewhat optimistic statistics about the annual snowfall, which he swears is between 400 and 450 inches. Independent estimates put this at 170 inches. Still, as with Crystal Mountain, it's extremely good value, especially on Mondays and Tuesdays when a ticket will only set you back Dollars 10] It's Dollars 15 dollars a day for the rest of the week and Dollars 25 a day at the weekend. Snoqualmy is Twin Peaks country, known in real life as North Bend. On the way back to Seattle, we called in at the cafe that doubled as the Double R Diner, where we were assured that 'no one here is investigating murders, insurance scams, shady land deals, committing adultery or joining secret societies', and paused for lunch at The Salish Lodge immediately above the spectacular 280-foot high Snoqualmie Falls which featured in the Twin Peaks opening titles (or so I am told). As for my skis, they are safely home in west London, leaning against the wall of my office, trophies to be gazed upon by a string of admirers, including my mother and the lady from Meals on Wheels. One day, perhaps, they will find their way on to the wall of a mountain restaurant in the Alps. Perhaps with a fitting label, such as: 'Arnold Wilson spent the latter part of his life under the misapprehension that he made these skis. They were actually made by a K2 employee called Tom.' Arnie Wilson flew to Seattle as a guest of American Airlines and K2 skis</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 30 May (AFP) -- This Monday,  Army of National Liberation (ELN) guerrillas ambushed and killed  Santiago Angarita, a community leader in the Colombian town of  Convencion, Norte de Santander, from whom the rebels seized  voting cards from this Sunday's presidential elections and  burned them.    Radio reports from Santa Fe de Bogota stated Angarita was  intercepted on his way to the National Civil Registry of Cucuta,  a provincial capital bordering Venezuela. The guerrillas  stripped Angarita of the sealed ballot box and then killed him.    The community leader transported the votes cast at the  Municipalities of San Jose, Las Pitas, and Cartagenita and the  town of Convencion.    Presidential elections held this Sunday in Colombia resulted  in a virtual tie between Liberal Party candidate Ernesto Samper  and Conservative Party candidate Andres Pastrana, who will vie  in a runoff election on Sunday, 19 June.</p>

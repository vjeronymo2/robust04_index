			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / International Company News: Statoil higher but gives warning Statoil the Norwegian state oil company, boosted first-quarter net profit to NKr1.2bn (Dollars 179m) from NKr605m last year, helped by higher oil prices, cost reductions and a substantially improved financial result. The group warned of a 'rather lower' second quarter, with uncertainty attached to earnings by petrochemical and refining operations and to oil prices in the short and long term. Group revenue rose by NKr1.8bn to NKr20.8bn as operating profit increased to NKr3.4bn from NKr2.9bn. Statoil said net financial revenue in the first quarter reached NKr653m, compared with net charges of NKr999bn in last year's comparative period. Mr Morten Woldsdal, a Statoil executive, said the value of the group's bonds and shares rose by NKr100m in the first quarter, while other financial instruments contributed about NKr500m to income. The group also had NKr1bn in unrealised foreign exchange gains. The price of benchmark Brent crude averaged Dollars 18.23 a barrel in the quarter, up from Dollars 17.94 last year. Mr Woldsdal said that because of harsh weather in January, the company had to postpone its exploration and North Sea platform maintenance programmes until the second quarter. As a result, associated exploration and maintenance costs would be charged against second-quarter accounts. He said the group would not feel the full effect of several major cost reduction programmes implemented last year until 1995 and 1996, after which costs will have been reduced by an estimated NKr2.6bn.</p>

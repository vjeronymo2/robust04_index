			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Republika -- The government seems to be  making more serious efforts to improve the investment climate.  The government's current step is unprecedented. Two laws which  have regulated investment in Indonesia will be immediately  revised and replaced with a new law. The old investment laws  are no longer considered relevant with the current developments.    The laws which will be immediately revised are Law No.  1/1967  on foreign investment and Law No. 6/1968 on domestic investment.    When asked by reporters, Ir. [academic title] Sanyoto  Sastrowardoyo, minister of state for investment affairs and  chairman of the Investment Coordinating Board [BKPM], confirmed  the planned revision of the two laws. "The plan is being  discussed by ministers in charge of economy, finance, and  development supervision," Sanyoto told reporters following an  'Id-al Fitr get-together with the BKPM employees and their  families in Jakarta on Friday (18 March).    According to Sanyoto, a special interdepartmental team will  be set up to review the two laws. Indeed, it remains unclear  who will chair the team because the matter will first be  discussed during the initial meeting of the team. "A new law  will be developed to replace the two laws if the team so  decides," he said. The new law will combine the two old laws.    Sanyoto considers such a step very appropriate and part of  efforts to improve the investment climate. Sanyoto believes  that Indonesia should have a single investment law without  sacrificing the interests and objectives of national development.    Furthermore, Sanyoto sees the review as very significant  because the old laws have been in force for about 27 years.  "The laws should be adjusted to the current situation," he  said. Sanyoto hopes that the review will further accelerate  investment in Indonesia.    Sanyoto denies that the step has been taken because the two  laws are hampering current investment. "This is purely intended  to suit globalization," he said.    According to Sanyoto, a number of neighboring countries  closed themselves when the laws were made about 27 years ago.  However, these countries, including India, Pakistan, and  Cambodia have gradually started opening up. Some of them have  even widely opened their doors to investment.    Sanyoto added that differences between foreign and domestic  investment will be further narrowed.    For example, Article VI of the 1967 foreign investment law  clearly states that such fields as ports, education, waterworks,  railway, mass media, aviation, production of atomic energy, and  the production and distribution of electricity for the public  are closed to foreign investment. On the other hand, all fields  are open to domestic investment.    Sanyoto, however, was unable to confirm when the review of  the two laws will be over because it is a long process. An even  longer process will be needed if the team decides to change the  laws. "A long process is needed to change a law, including the  consent of the House of Representatives," Sanyoto said.    In addition to reviewing the investment laws, the BKPM is  preparing a new deregulation package. Sanyoto declined to  reveal the package. However, he hinted that government decree  No. 50/1993 on share ownership in foreign investment companies  will be revised.    "Let us wait for a decision on this change," Sanyoto said.  However, several circles said that the revision will cover  several articles of the decree, including Article I on approval  of a foreign investment project and Article III on conditions  for establishing a foreign investment project.</p>

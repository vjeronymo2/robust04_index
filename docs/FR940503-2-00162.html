			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This notice of final priorities does  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  solicit applications. A notice inviting applications under this competition is published in a separate notice in this issue of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of the Comments and Changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the Secretary's invitation in the notices of proposed priorities several parties submitted comments. An analysis of the comments and of the changes in the priorities since publication of the notices of proposed priorities follows.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Notice of Proposed Priority Published on November 12, 1993  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter pointed out that technology projects are hardware intensive. The commenter therefore suggested that the portion of grant funding available for purchase or lease of appropriate hardware, software, and communications services or tariffs for use in these projects be greater than is traditionally available in many grants. Another commenter urged that the Department allow up to 50% of the total Federal portion of the project budget, rather than the 20% stipulated in the priority, to be used for purchase of items such as hardware. This commenter believed that this change would result in greater numbers of applications from districts that have relatively few resources for the purchase of technology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In this priority the Secretary wishes to emphasize professional development, rather than equipment purchase, and thus does not wish to reduce the proportion of Federal funds available for inservice education. The Secretary notes that, in their efforts to obtain additional funds to be used for purchase of hardware, software, and other such items, applicants should have available the joint resources of the partnerships that are to be formed under this priority. The Secretary acknowledges, however, that the type of projects to be supported under this priority may require a significant initial investment in technology-related resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The priority has been revised to state that up to one-third of the total Federal funds approved for year one and up to 15 percent of the Federal funds approved in years two and three may be expended to purchase or lease hardware, software, and communications services or tariffs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter urged that a portion of funds made available through this priority be used for preservice programs, such as those that would help faculty in schools of education to provide exemplary models of the use of technology in teaching.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary agrees that preservice programs can play a critical role in preparing teachers to use technology effectively in the classroom. The current priority, however, was designed for inservice professional development, where ample need for improvement exists. Given the relatively limited amount of funding available for these priorities, the Secretary does not wish to dilute the purpose or effectiveness of the priority by broadening it to encompass preservice programs. The Secretary will, however, examine possible opportunities to support preservice programs in future technology-related grant priorities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that partnerships formed to develop and implement project activities include representatives of the Statewide Systemic Initiative (SSI) program funded by the National Science Foundation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary believes that, insofar as the SSI program involves professional development, this comment is already addressed in the priority's requirement that projects coordinate their work with other professional development efforts in mathematics and science education.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter urged that principals be allowed to designate persons knowledgeable in technology to serve in the principal's stead on the advisory committees that will guide the projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary points out that the priority does not preclude participation on the advisory committees by persons who have been chosen by principals and who are particularly knowledgeable in technology. The Secretary believes that the presence of a principal himself or herself on an advisory committee represents a personal commitment that could be vital to the undertaking's success. In addition, in light of the many-faceted professional development activities envisioned in the priority, the Secretary believes that the advisory committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needs the breadth of knowledge and management perspectives that principals can bring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that the priority require the participation of teachers of English as a second language (ESL) to enhance the effectiveness of the program in schools serving underachieving students whose native language is not English.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary notes that the priority allows for inclusion of ESL teachers in project activities. The priority requires the involvement of two or more schools serving underachieving students and the inclusion of the majority of, if not all, the mathematics and science teachers in participating schools. ESL teachers who provide instruction in mathematics and science at project site schools are thus likely to participate in the professional development activities that are part of the project. In the interest of allowing the greatest amount of flexibility and variety in the projects that are funded, the Secretary does not wish to add further requirements concerning inclusion of teachers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that, in addition to requiring integration of academic content and pedagogical components, the priority should provide a focus on the interdisciplinary nature of mathematics and science education.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

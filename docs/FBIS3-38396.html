Government Spokesman Dieter Vogel added in Bonn today  that the observer group is to provide support in the creation of  a permanent peace in Georgia. The deployment of the German  soldiers is limited to six months. Vogel said it is the first  UN deployment of this nature on the territory of the former  Soviet Union and the first involvement of German soldiers in  such a mission.    Federal Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel stressed that  "preventive diplomacy" is becoming an increasingly important  element in peacekeeping as the main aim of the United Nations.  The mission in Georgia serves that purpose. As the first UN  deployment on the territory of the former Soviet Union, it aims  to back the efforts of the conflicting parties for a  comprehensive political solution in Georgia. The conflicting  parties have approved German participation in UNOMIG, he said.</p>

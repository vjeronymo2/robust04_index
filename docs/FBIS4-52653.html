			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Arms Buildup Aimed at Killing Many Birds With One Stone" </F> -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- The United States is  seeking to kill many birds with one stone by beefing up its  Armed Forces in and around South Korea, says NODONG SINMUN in a  by-lined article today.    The paper says:    First of all, the United States intends to stifle Korean  socialism with strength by reinforcing its Armed Forces in  South Korea. It is the invariable policy of the U.S. to  aggravate military confrontation and tensions on the Korean  peninsula, threaten the DPRK with strength and, furthermore,  stifle it.    The U.S. bellicose elements plan to send military strength  600,000 strong, over 200 combatant ships, more than 1,600  warplanes and other aggression forces which are far greater than  those hurled into the Persian Gulf war to the Korean front in 80  days in "case of emergency" on the Korean peninsula.    Another purpose of the United States in its arms buildup in  and around South Korea is to attain the goal of its  Asian-Pacific policy.    The keynote of the U.S. Asian-Pacific strategy at present is  to curb the expansion of the sphere of influence of the Western  countries in this area by relying upon its military predominance  and to establish U.S.-orchestrated dominationist order. In  this, it attaches importance especially to Northeast Asia and  intends to keep powerful frontline combat power in and around  South Korea and strengthen its domination and control over the  Asia-Pacific region by using it.    Another purpose of the U.S. war-thirsty elements in stepping  up arms buildup in South Korea is to turn it into its arms  market and bring fabulous profits to the U.S. military  monopolies. The U.S. ruling circles intend to make South Korea,  its colony and military base, open its door wider as an arms  market and drive out the puppets as a shock brigade in invading  the North.    The United States must stop the reckless arms buildup going  against the trend of the times toward disarmament and detente.</p>

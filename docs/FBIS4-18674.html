			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jacques Patoz: "The Gaullists' Agitation"] </F>   [Text] The selection [by the UDF--French Democratic Union]  of Dominique Baudis [as leader of the majority's European  election list] is creating controversy within the Gaullist  movement. But [RPR -- Rally for the Republic President] Jacques  Chirac is saying that the single list is not in question.    It must be said that the RPR did resign itself easily to  abandoning the leadership of the majority list in the European  elections to a UDF member. Jacques Chirac had to exert pressure  on his "comrades" for them to agree. He only did so because it  was anticipated that the list would be headed by Jean-Francois  Deniau. Giscard's former minister is not extremely  pro-European. It has not been forgotten that during the campaign  for the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, Deniau hesitated  for a long time before finally coming out in favor of the "yes"  vote. He could therefore be regarded as an acceptable list  leader. The need not to spark off a division in the  parliamentary Right one year before the presidential election  justified this sacrifice. With the obviously unexpected  selection of Baudis, everything could be called into question  again.    The mayor of Toulouse does not have the Gaullists' support  to  say the least. For the majority of them, who opposed the  Maastricht Treaty, the selection of Baudis, whose commitment to  Europe is extremely determined, looks like a provocation. For  the time being, Chirac is adhering to the status quo. He has  not commented in person. But he has delegated some of his close  aides in making it known that he does not think that his  partners' choice called into question the principle of the  single list.    The whole question is whether he will succeed in imposing  this viewpoint. While it was thought that the UDF would choose  Jean-Francois Deniau, Bernard Pons and Philippe Seguin had  reaffirmed that the liberal federation's decision should be  ratified by the RPR. What has happened will not encourage them  to remain silent. Jacques Chirac cannot ignore that. But what  solution can be found? Aware that the discontent is no less  within the Republican Party, some are proposing alternative  solutions which could be accepted by a section of the UDF.  Jean-Jacques de Peretti is reviving the idea of selecting Alain  Juppe. Pierre Mazeaud is suggesting that the RPR appoint its  own head of list and that the two parties then meet to make a  choice. Others are already envisaging the possibility of an  autonomous RPR list which Philippe Seguin could head. Whatever  happens, the parliamentary group in the National Assembly met  yesterday evening. The movement's political office will meet  today. The discussions are likely to be lively.</p>

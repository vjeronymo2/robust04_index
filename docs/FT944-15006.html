			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Observer: Sea trials Golfers in search of the ultimate water hazard need look no more. Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines has designed an 18-hole golf course complete with sand traps, trees and Scottish heather to go on top of its latest ship, Legend of the Seas. Royal Caribbean insists that it 'isn't one of those miniature golf courses with windmills, pirates and volcanoes'. The all-weather course has been designed to be as challenging as some of 'the great courses of the world'. Admittedly, the longest hole is 32 feet and the tees are only 5ft wide, but the shipping company insists that there is a big demand out there. It has even dredged up some statistics to prove that the number of rounds of mini-golf played in the US has risen from 100m in 1980 to 170m this year.</p>

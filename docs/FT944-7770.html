			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Putting Pounds 1bn down the mines - A look at RJB's controversial bid for British Coal's assets British Coal may have faced a serious decline in its markets for most of its 47 years of existence, but there is no chance of that happening to RJB Mining, the company chosen as preferred bidder to take over its English mining assets. That at least is the view of RJB and Mr Richard Budge, its chief executive, and explains why it offered the government so much more than its rivals. Even after 1998, when contracts inherited from British Coal run out, the company assumes it will be able to keep sales steady at about 34m tonnes a year from the three regions it is buying, much the same as the 35m tonnes next year. The problem is that RJB is thought by some analysts to have overestimated the size of the post-1998 market by about 40 per cent and compounded the error by assuming prices will be 20 per cent higher than they are likely to be. Even some coal and electricity industry executives who regard themselves as optimists think the 'conservative' estimates that underpin the bid are at the high end of the likely outcome. An assessment of the post-1998 market is central to RJB's efforts to raise up to Pounds 1.05bn to finance its Pounds 914m bid (the price is subject to negotiation). RJB can with relative ease persuade banks to lend some Pounds 628m. The inherited coal contracts with electricity generators provide a reasonable likelihood that the bulk of the debts can be paid back within three years. However, RJB's success in raising up to Pounds 425m through a share issue depends to a large extent on expectations of the company's prospects after 1998. The company, worth less than Pounds 160m at its suspended stock market price, says it can offer potential shareholders dividend yields of about 4.5 per cent in the early years. That is unlikely to draw in many investors, however, since it is only around the stock market average. An investment in coal is perceived as risky. RJB's big bait, therefore, is the policy, outlined to institutional investors in a series of presentations, of 'rapid dividend growth after reduction of debt' - mainly after 1998. If the pessimists are right, the company will fail to produce the Pounds 220m a year pre-tax profits it believes are achievable by the end of the decade. This would jeopardise dividend growth, with a consequent impact on the share price. It is not just investors who would suffer, however. Parts of Britain's coal base could be lost for ever, according to pessimists, as RJB struggled to make enough money to invest in pits. The government's reputation on privatisation, already under fire from opposition parties, would suffer a further knock. But isn't this all too apocalyptic? Surely RJB and its adviser Barclays de Zoete Wedd, not to mention the government's adviser, NM Rothschild, cannot all have got it wrong? In the past, Rothschild has been viewed as pessimistic about the coal market: its predictions three years ago on the size of the pre-privatisation market and the subsequent need for closures have proved to be accurate. Mr Keith Palmer, a Rothschild managing director, is thought to be in broad agreement with RJB's view of the post-1998 market. In its City presentations, RJB uses figures supplied by Caminus, the consultancy which advised the government in the coal review, for the worst and best scenarios for the English electricity supply market after 1998. The favourable case, for 54.6m tonnes including imports, will set shareholders' pulses racing since it could provide the base for pre-tax profits even higher than the Pounds 220m RJB is projecting in 1999-2000. For sake of prudence they will also need to examine the 'conservative' figure of 27.6m tonnes. According to some industry analysts, including McCloskey Coal Information, which provides editorial for FT newsletters, even this is too high. McCloskey says RJB's 'cautious' estimate for annual capacity available to English suppliers is about 6m tonnes too optimistic. It believes RJB has under-estimated the market share of nuclear power and import links from Scotland and France in the late 1990s, as well as the penetration of imports in 1999-2000. It also considers RJB's estimates for the domestic and industrial markets to be high. Industry executives adopt varying attitudes. According to one power company executive the overall impression of RJB's conservative case is that it does not allow for the worst possibilities for coal. But nor does he see the projections as 'way off beam'. This is supported by figures in the seven-year plan at the National Grid, power transmission company, which suggest coal burn in the year 2000 will be between 25m and 33m tonnes. Assuming RJB is right, the total market for coal in its conservative case is 35.5m tonnes. To achieve its aim of making Pounds 220m in 2000, RJB believes it can sell 33.8m tonnes. That leaves little room for rival companies, such as Coal Investments and Ryan Group, which will be fighting hard for market share and may drop their prices to get it. Yet RJB's projections for prices are also at the high end of expectations. Mr Budge believes an average selling price of Pounds 1.32 is reasonable and has been telling institutional investors that he believes the average price for power station coal will be about Pounds 1.25 at today's prices. Generator executives believe that is too optimistic, since coal can be imported at prices of less than Pounds 1 a gigajoule. Coal Investments based its failed bid for the two central England regions on prices of Pounds 1.10 or less and British Coal executives believe that is nearer the mark. Another rival bidder for some of the five regions, whose tender also failed, says RJB may be able to sell coal for an average of Pounds 1.32 a gigajoule in 2000 and it may be able to sell 33.8m tonnes. 'But I can't see how he can do both. If he wants to sell high volumes then he must keep prices low. 'The worst thing is that he will discover all of this around 1997 and if he decides to go for high prices, he will have to cut volume. Coal mine closures will be expensive.' Mr Budge thinks otherwise. In his institutional presentations, he points to rising prices on the international market and the expense of getting imported coal to the inland power stations - the bulk of them. He adds that if the worst came to the worst and the company did have to reduce capacity, it would not be a disaster. There would be little need for closures because opencast production, rather than that from deep mines, could be varied. Nor would redundancy costs be high since the industry employs several thousand contract workers. With so much adverse publicity, Mr Budge and his advisers still have to do some persuasive talking to be sure of raising the money they need. But Mr Budge is impressing investors and there are signs that institutions are believing his projections rather than those of his critics. Supportive comments, like those made yesterday by Mr John Jermine, executive chairman of NSM, another coal company, will add to the Budge bandwagon.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- ENGLISH ESI REQUIREMENTS FOR COAL  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                             Conservative    Conservative    Favourable                                     Case            Case          Case Year ended March 31              1994/95         1999/00       1999/00 M/tonnes of coal equivalent     M/tonnes        M/tonnes      M/tonnes  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Electricity Generation             115.2           122.3         122.3 (England and Wales) Nuclear                             26.6            29.7          22.1 Gas                                 16.1            50.6          40.9 Scottish Link                        3.5             4.7           4.7 French Link                          6.9             1.4           0.0 Stock Withdrawal                    12.0             0.0           0.0 Orimulsion                           1.4             8.3           0.0 Heavy Fuel Oil                       0.1             0.0           0.0 Total Non-coal                      66.6            94.7          67.7 Available for coal*                 48.6            27.6          54.6 Available to English Suppliers*     36.9            27.1          43.0  --------------------------------------------------------------------- *Imports account for the difference between these figures  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Caminus  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------- FINANCING STRUCTURE OF THE BID  --------------------------                      Pounds Value of tender         94* Total financing **  --------------------------  -bank debt             528  -corporate bond        100  -equity                425  --------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------- ** includes refinancing of RJB's existing bank debt, working capital and costs * subject to negotiation with the government and likely to fall  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Survey of Residential Property (5): Chalets for those who like Alps without snow - Audrey Powell explores resorts in France and Switzerland finds that properties by the slopes often sell to people who do not ski It is common knowledge that a large number of people who buy homes on golf courses do not play golf. It also appears that many people who buy homes in Swiss ski resorts never ski. 'Your average client for an upper price property is 50 or over. He has made his fortune and comes to the mountains to relax. He likes the peace and quiet, the civilised way he is treated. He likes to look at the view and go walking. To him skiing is totally irrelevant,' said a developer in Switzerland. 'He (and it usually is a he) does not want a lot of bedrooms. He has guests but puts them up in the local hotel. These are the kind of people who are able to pay Pounds 200,000 upwards for a ski-resort home. Not the yuppies. They go on package holidays or rent somebody else's chalet.' His remarks are a reaction to a report by Mintel Leisure intelligence which argues that the British Education Reform Act, which discouraged ski trips in school time, will, in the long term, reduce the appetite for skiing among British adults. The number of children going on school skiing holidays has fallen from 200,000 in 1990 to 60,000 in 1991/1992. Already, Mintel says, the mass market for skiing holidays has dropped sharply and only real enthusiasts have continued to ski. But if the developer is correct these trends may not affect the already slender British demand for ski-resort property. A London agency which specialises in selling Swiss resort property, David de Lara &amp; Partners, also notes a lack of commitment to the sport among buyers. The people who purchased his chalets or apartments were interested in summer activities. 'Skiing is never the primary motivation,' said de Lara. The market was 'not bad' at present. There were British buyers and other buyers. But new properties were getting more expensive in Switzerland. So something an intending purchaser might like to note is that not only are the rules about selling to foreigners different in the various cantons, but the related costs vary as well. Acquisition fees, based on purchase price, including notary fees, federal and cantonal charges for making the search, purchase tax, drawing up deed and land registry fees in Champery (Valais) come to 2.2 per cent. In Villars (Vaud) they are 5.5 per cent. Bank interest rates on mortgages in Valais are 5.5 per cent for both Swiss and foreigners. In Vaud they are 6.25 per cent for Swiss - and 7.25 per cent for foreigners. Annual taxes on a property, including tax (communal, cantonal, federal) in Valais come to 1.2 per cent. For a similar property in Vaud they are 2.2 per cent. The agency is offering property in Valais. At Champery, a traditional Alpine village of timber chalets on the Swiss-French border, it has apartments in two new chalets. In one, units are ready for occupation. A one-bedroom apartment costs from Pounds 134,000 (SFr290,000). There are two and three-room versions and a penthouse at Pounds 300,000. There are also chalets on the hillside, looking down on the village. Price Pounds 315,000 for four bedrooms. In Vaud, Lennards Properties International, a British-owned Swiss company, has apartments available to non-resident foreign buyers in a new 15-acre project at Villars. This is Domaine de l'Elysee, where the first apartment-let, L'Astragale, is being built. There will be 14 units in the five-floor building and some should be ready by December. A two-bedroom appartment is Pounds 216,000; a four-bedroom penthouse, Pounds 380,000. Five-apartment chalets will be built on the rest of the site, spread over several years. Villars is a pleasant, long-established village and its central road is soon to be made traffic-free. It is one of the few Swiss resorts which over the years has allowed foreigners. In France Zigi Davenport of Alpine Apartments Agency, notes how recent building and road work, and new lifts, have improved its access and general appearance in Meribel, in Les Trois Vallees, where the agency has property. There had been a lot of residential building for the Winter Olympics and at very high prices. 'Incredibly most of it has sold and more is taking place,' says Davenport. Last winter's excellent snow- falls resulted in some of the best skiing ever in the area and demand had returned for prestige property. Chalet l'Auberpine is a new stone and wood-clad apartment block set off the road, with views across the valley of bel. For those who do intend to ski, it has the advantage of being beside the new chair lift and on the piste, so they can ski back to the building. A two-bedroom apartment is Pounds 145,450 (FFr1.9m); a three-bedroom duplex, Pounds 240,000. Neighbouring Courchevel 1850 is still pricey, but popular with the French, who, in spite of recession, are buying again, says Davenport. But, with a thought for the low-budget purchaser, she suggests a one-bedroom and bunk-room apartment, which can be had for Pounds 34,000 at Val Thorens. Letting this for three weeks in the main ski season in February, could produce a rental income to cover running costs. Val Thorens claims to be the highest ski resort in Europe. But it has its detractors. In bad weather 'you may be forgiven for thinking you have been stranded amid the mountains of the moon,' says The Good Skiing Guide 1995 (Consumers' Association, Pounds 14.99, 624 pages). What of Italy? It was popular for skiing holidays last season because of the weak lira but not much of its ski resort property comes on the British market. When architect and mountain resort planner Laurent Chappis designed Sansicario, in northern Italy, 58 miles from Turin and nine miles from the French border, he knew what he wanted to avoid. Some modern ski resorts are stark when snowless in summer. Their tall apartment blocks lack the charm of traditional chalet design. Chappis was determined that Sansicario's buildings should have the minimum impact on the original scene; that the village would be vehicle-free and properties should have pistes 'on the doorstep'. The residences and hotels are built around a commercial centre on gradually descending levels. The buildings are spaced out and no more than three storeys high. Large underground garages accommodate cars. The properties are on the western slopes of Mount Fraiteve, with a view through woods of larch and fir. The residences, centre and ski-lifts are connected by pedestrian routes and there is a monorail for more distant buildings. There are 100 cable-cars, chair-lifts and ski-lifts, and few queues. The centre has shops, bars and boutiques. In 1976 the first buildings were ready. In 1997, along with Sestriere, Sansicario will host the World Ski Championship. Apartments are available from Pounds 100,000 (L242m) to Pounds 300,000. There is a swimming pool and cinema as part of the development. Indeed, UK agent Brian A French, in Knaresborough, which is offering the apartments, says Sansicario can be enjoyed equally in summer and by the family which does not ski. There is horse riding; tennis can be played from 9am until midnight and a golf course is promised, with construction expected to begin next spring.

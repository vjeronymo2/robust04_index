			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ion Botnaru, first deputy minister of </F> foreign affairs of Moldova, by Lyudmila Petrova; place and date  not given: "Will the Banks of the Dniester Meet?"]    [Text] The spectral Dniester Republic has been in  existence for more than three years now, and whatever epithets  are devised for it, the realization that it will no longer be  possible to return to the status quo and that the Dniester  region will have to be recognized in some capacity has appeared  in Kishinev [Chisinau]. In what capacity is the question. This  was the topic of an interview for a ROSSIYA correspondent  granted by Ion Botnaru, first deputy minister of foreign affairs  of Moldova.    [Petrova] Many people are saying that, following the  parliamentary elections and the Consultation With the People  poll, the situation in Moldova has changed and that it is now  highly propitious for a solution of the conflict between the  banks of the Dniester. Do you also believe this?    [Botnaru] Yes, I too believe that extra incentives for a  resumption of the process of dialogue have appeared. Why? First,  the results of the poll confirmed once again that we will not  unite with Romania. The realization of the poll was an  accommodatory step toward and, I would say even, a concession to  the left bank.    Second, a consensus of political forces came about during  the  elections, in my opinion. Everyone already recognizes that  special status is necessary for the Dniester region.    And, third, which political party could within six months or  a year be considered to be coping with its obligations as the  country's ruling party unless there is a change in the  situation? That is, from the political viewpoint the possibility  of a solution of the conflict is very favorable.    [Petrova] All the negotiations between Chisinau and Tiraspol  have become frozen in a discussion of the conditions under which  they should be held. Are there fears that things will get no  further this time also?    [Botnaru] Yes, because the Left Bank perceives each  concession of ours as a display of weakness and,  correspondingly, demands the next concession. But there should  be a different view of the situation: We are not weak, we are  adults and we recognize how dangerous the situation is, and we  are for this reason agreeing even to contacts with illegal  structures--just as long as the "cart" of the negotiations  starts to move. Now, after Russia has displayed good will and  the CSCE has expressed its recommendations, the process of  negotiations should move ahead.    [Petrova] What kind of status is Moldova prepared to offer  the Dniester region?    [Botnaru] First and foremost, the status of the Dniester  region must in no way impinge on the territorial integrity of  the Republic of Moldova. Consequently, there must be one  constitution, a common foreign policy, a common monetary system,  a common macroeconomic policy, and common borders and customs.  We must take account of the variegated ethnic composition of the  population of the country and the existence within it of areas  with the compact residence of Gagauz, Bulgarians, and  Ukrainians. If we take the path of comminution, we will create a  very dangerous precedent for Europe. We can, however, find  formats whereby the local structures operate in the central  government.    [Petrova] But the Dniester region is as yet sticking to the  idea of a confederation or, at least, a federation and declaring  that such an arrangement of the state would not mean a violation  of its integrity.    [Botnaru] The declarations concerning a federation are  connected more with a desire to preserve some structures. But if  there is a common budget, and it must be common, the need for  the elimination of all parallel structures will naturally arise.</p>

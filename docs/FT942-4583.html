			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / C&amp;G studies ways to beat takeover ban Closing Cheltenham and Gloucester Building Society to new members was one of the boldest moves suggested yesterday by which the society could get round the High Court judgment against the takeover by Lloyds Bank. Once the society had closed, it would simply have to wait until all its members had acquired at least two years' standing. But, although that would be a theoretically elegant conclusion, it would be likely to disrupt the original takeover timetable. Halting the growth of the society would also make it less attractive to Lloyds. The court ruling may well make it hardest for banks to take over the most attractive societies because those that are growing fastest will have the highest proportions of new members to whom payments are not allowed to be made. C&amp;G is one of the fastest-growing of all societies - as indicated by the fact that 27 per cent of its members are of less than two years' standing. A society with only a small proportion of new members is likely to be moribund and small. A possibility canvassed as an alternative to a cash bid was that Lloyds could make payments of preference shares as an alternative to cash. However, any easy exchange of such shares for cash could make such a scheme illegal. The society may consider other alternatives to closing itself to new members: Giving members' of less than two years' standing some value for the surrender of their voting rights. Provided that there was no vote against the takeover from these investors, Lloyds' bid could well pass the the voting thresholds. This possibility is raised by Sir Donald Nicholls' ruling that a third party can make payments to non-voting members of a society. Lloyds might be able to make payments to people who chose to become non-members using this provision. Dividing the Pounds 1.8m among those of two years' standing. Mr Andrew Longhurst, C&amp;G chief executive, who has been keen to show the widespread benefits of the Lloyds' offer, discounted this possibility last night. However, it could be used if no alternative was found. Because only a 50 per cent majority of those eligible to vote is required, the society could well gain such a majority from the 73 per cent whom it was paying. The problem would be if members of under two years' standing voted against. C&amp;G takeover, Page 10</p>

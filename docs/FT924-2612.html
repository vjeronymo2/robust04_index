			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Recession blamed for ERF loss THIS YEAR'S deep recession in the UK commercial vehicle market, the most severe since the second world war, was awarded much of the blame by ERF (Holdings) for its descent into a pre-tax interim loss of Pounds 2.73m, compared with a profit of Pounds 330,000. Described as 'disappointing' by Mr Peter Foden, chairman of what is now the UK's last quoted independent heavy truck maker, the result was, nevertheless, little worse than the market had been expecting. The shares closed down only 5p at 135p. About one third of the loss was attributed to exceptional costs associated with developing a new product range, the group's first sales expansion into Europe and further redundancies. Severe trading conditions in the UK, with heavy discounting further eroding profit margins, was the main factor in a loss at the trading level of Pounds 1.77m after interest, compared with a profit of Pounds 612,000. Weakness in some overseas markets outside Europe also took part of the blame. Some analysts last night expressed mild reservations about ERF's seeming determination not to slow the pace of any of its market expansion or product programmes. Mr Foden said yesterday these would result in further exceptional costs of about Pounds 1m in the second half of the year. But he pointed to the first signs of recovery in the UK truck market and a relatively mild deterioration in ERF's gearing, as justification for the company staying on its present course. Currently, gearing was 26.7 per cent. There is no interim dividend, compared with 2p, and Mr Foden said payment of a final would depend on second-half trading performance. The results were achieved on turnover of Pounds 54.64m (Pounds 58.42m). Pre-production costs of the new truck range, to be launched next year, accounted for Pounds 450,000 of the exceptional costs, including interest. The setting up of a distribution infrastructure in continental Europe accounted for a further Pounds 343,000. Redundancy costs totalled Pounds 152,000.</p>

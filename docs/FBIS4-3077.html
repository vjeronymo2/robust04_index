			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Stealing Secrets Is Not Gathering News; Never </F> Defy the Law"]    [Text] The hearing of Xi Yang's appeal has ended.  Yesterday, the Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court  announced its decision to reject Xi Yang's appeal and uphold the  original verdict of the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's  Court at the first hearing, namely, a 12-year prison sentence  with two-year deprivation of political rights.    The court charged Xi Yang with ignoring the law of the land,  stealing and prying into state financial and economic secrets,  and publishing the stolen information abroad in the press. His  act constituted the crime of stealing and prying into state  secrets and was an especially serious case at that. Tian Ye, in  the capacity of a state functionary, violated the state security  ordinance and stole, pried into, and illegally provided state  secrets. His act constituted the crime of stealing, prying  into, and illegally providing state secrets, and was an  especially serious case also. The truth of the crime committed  by Xi Yang and Tian Ye is clear and the evidence conclusive and  sufficient.    What criteria were used to measure the penalty? Was the  penalty too heavy or not? The "Supplementary Stipulations on  Punishing the Crime of Disclosing State Secrets" made by the  National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee contain the  following clauses: "He who steals, pries into, buys, and  illegally provides state secrets for institutions,  organizations, and personnel outside Chinese borders," "in an  extra serious case, shall receive a prison sentence of 10 years  or above, life imprisonment, or the death penalty and  deprivation of political rights." The lightest penalty is a  10-year jail sentence and the heaviest is the death penalty.  Because the two people adopted a positive attitude in pleading  guilty and showed signs of repentance, they were handled  leniently. Some people set the "Criminal Procedural Law of the  People's Republic of China" against the "Supplementary  Stipulations on Punishing the Crime of Disclosing State Secrets"  of the NPC Standing Committee, criticizing China for  "inconsistency" in the choice of legal provisions for  prosecuting Xi Yang. This is sheer nonsense. Quoting the  "Supplementary Stipulations" was to establish a basis for the  measurement of penalties and quoting the criminal procedural law  was to classify the criminal prosecution as a case involving  state security and theft of state secrets, which required a  nonpublic hearing. Since it involved state secrets, the court  was duty-bound to protect state secrets from being divulged in  the course of the trial, so a nonpublic hearing was required.  No country would, while taking legal action against theft of  state secrets, exhibit the secrets to be protected, still less  publish to the outside in great detail the confidential figures  of the losses caused to the state after the defendant has denied  any losses to the state. If China had done so, it is certain  that foreign hostile forces would have been able to find out  more about China's capabilities in meeting contingencies,  various plans for handling crises, and resources and means that  can be employed. The big slippage and fluctuation of renminbi  last June and July was not good for the national economy, the  people's livelihood, or the overall situation in the country.  The Chinese Government treated it as a major matter and handled  it accordingly. If all the operational measures for stabilizing  renminbi were divulged, the contingency measures were bound to  lose their effect, giving speculators something to take  advantage of. It would cause further slippage of the renminbi  rate and undermine the stability of China's political situation.    Xi Yang grew up in mainland China and once served in the  army. He was at one time a reporter with a newspaper publisher  in Beijing. Someone like him who received long periods of  education in citizen ethics and the legal system naturally knows  the state security law and the serious consequences of violating  it. His obtaining secrets through Tian Ye by illegal means  points to his awareness that he was stealing state secrets,  which he candidly confessed afterward.    Some people believe that "one country, two systems" means  using Hong Kong's legal standards to handle the issue of guilt  and innocence in the mainland. If the executive personnel of a  newspaper published in Hong Kong wish to obtain some  confidential information, they can instruct reporters to "run  the risk to overcome the obstacle" and get hold of it. Even if  it is a state secret or confidential document, they can also  take as they like without being restricted by the law of the  mainland system. What is the "risk?" And what is the  "obstacle?" They regard the criminal act banned by the mainland  law as a "risk" and refer to the act of obtaining the secrets  that the Chinese authorities have time and again requested  functionaries at all levels not to divulge as "overcoming the  obstacle." This means some people are openly despising and  challenging the laws of the Chinese mainland. This dangerous  argument finally led Xi Yang into a dangerous situation and  landed him in the misfortune of imprisonment.    Xi Yang's case is in essence a criminal case of violation  of the mainland China's law. It is a question of abiding by the  law or violating the law, not an issue of freedom of press. Hong  Kong has its own security laws. If, when the exchange rate of  the Hong Kong dollar plummeted to the level of one U.S. dollar  to 9.6 Hong Kong dollars in September 1983, someone had colluded  with some official in the financial department and got hold of  the relevant confidential documents, facts about the abortive  effort to salvage the market by flight from the U.S. dollar and  the proposal for pegging the exchange rate, both the official  and the reporter who had pried out the secrets through the  official would have violated the law and faced prosecution.    Each year, thousands of Hong Kong reporters go to the  mainland to gather news. There are many reports that criticize  China and cases of fabricating stories to vilify the Chinese  Government have also happened. But no reporter involved has  ever been subjected to criminal investigation by China.  Therefore, the freedom of Hong Kong reporters in conducting  journalistic reporting is protected. However, Xi Yang ventured  into the forbidden zone of the criminal law and colluded with a  civil servant to steal and pry into secrets. This act of  violating the criminal code is naturally punished according to  law. Therefore, it does not make sense to equate a criminal act  with news gathering. The implication of Xi Yang's case is this:  No matter who you are, you must not test the law in your own  person, but must respect and observe the laws and regulations of  the mainland. While in the mainland, one must abide by the  mainland's law; while in Malaysia, one must abide by Malaysia's  law; while in Taiwan, one must abide by Taiwan's law. This is  an easy point to see for anyone with some common sense.    One aspect of "one country, two systems" is that the  mainland  should enforce mainland laws and Hong Kong should enforce Hong  Kong laws. After 1997, even the People's Liberation Army forces  stationed in Hong Kong must observe the law of the Special  Administrative Region. Why do some people advocate that Hong  Kong people do not have to observe mainland laws when they are  in the mainland? This idea that one does not have to observe  the law is detrimental to the implementation of "one country,  two systems."</p>

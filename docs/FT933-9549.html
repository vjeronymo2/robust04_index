			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Italian Bonds: Activity brings great expectations ITALY'S bond dealers will be wondering whether the week ahead will live up to that just passed, when investors ploughed into Italian paper to lock into relatively high yields before expected interest rate cuts. The market had not been so active for months, with prices and volumes for 10-year futures rising particularly fast. Futures prices jumped by about L5 on the week to close at about L109 on Friday. Just 11 months ago, when currencies were in turmoil and confidence in Italy was fading, futures prices were hovering around L90. The reasons for investors' new interest is reflected in figures from JP Morgan showing that Italy was Europe's best-performing government bond market in July, with a return of 2.77 per cent in local currency terms - more than double the European average of 1.33 per cent. 'Last week started with euphoria and ended little less exciting. We expect some consolidation now, but confidence in Italian bonds has clearly been re-established,' said one trader at Caboto in Milan. The market has regained much of the support lost after the lira left the exchange rate mechanism, and the pace of the political corruption scandal accelerated last year. After having ditched lira paper on the back of political uncertainty and currency risk, foreign investors are back in force. Ironically, the reasons for buying lira bonds are virtually identical to those before the flotation. Then, as now, lira issues offered a substantial spread advantage over comparable German or French paper, while the outlook for inflation looked encouraging. With interest rates across Europe expected to fall, investors wanted to guarantee their returns. The difference now is that the lira is outside the ERM. But with the mechanism in tatters, and participating currencies observing 15-percentage-point fluctuation bands, that is no longer so relevant. For today's investors, the markets set to gain most from the less strict ERM standards are those with higher yields, such as Italy, where interest rates have furthest to fall. 'The political picture is also looking up,' says Mr Sergio Siotto, of Albertini in Milan. 'Last week saw approval for electoral reform, opening the way to new elections, and the Senate passed the government's broad 1994-1996 budget plans.' The political news gave the markets an additional fillip, pushing prices for 10-year futures to almost L110 on Wednesday. Most dealers expect a period of stability now. Few expect the Bank of Italy to cut rates before its European counterparts. And any temptation to act independently would only follow further steps on tackling the budget deficit, meaning that it will probably have to wait until parliament returns from its summer recess. Some dealers warn against over-enthusiasm, however. 'The timing of new elections and privatisations are still up in the air,' says one London-based dealer. 'Italy still has many obstacles to overcome.' 'The danger is the market has moved too quickly. Prices are looking very toppy now,' says a Milan colleague. 'Central banks will want to restore their reserves, so it will be a while before interest rates fall any further.'</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Richard Ovinnikov, doctor of historical </F> sciences, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, under  rubric "Diplomatic Paths": "Russia's Inalienable Rights:  Memorandum for Foreign-Political Partners"]    [Text] The East-West confrontation and the Cold War have  come to an end. On the horizon is the coming into being of a new  model of the world. In overall features that model must be based  on cooperation among states and, naturally, must include the  Russia Federation as an integral part.    Nevertheless there is something not quite right in this rosy  haze, in any case for us Russians. Too many questions have  accumulated to make it possible to ponder on them aloud. But the  most important point is the following: on the part of certain of  our partners, unlike the rather good declarations, one actually  senses the deaf imperception of Russia's legal rights in the  international arena, which are equal to other inalienable rights  of Russia. Such as those that the carrying out of which, for  themselves, these partners reckon in the rank of natural  national interests. Such as those that Russia intends to promote  not in order to bypass the generally accepted behavioral norms  for states, but strictly within their confines.    In this situation it is apparently beneficial to prepare a  business memorandum for our partners (as well as for ourselves)  that is aimed at removing any misunderstandings. A memorandum,  first of all, about the healthy and constructive, in our view,  strivings of Russia in the outside world, and, secondly, about  why it is difficult for us to accept our partners' lack of  readiness to take them into consideration.    The first is, indisputably, the right of the Russian  Federation to be reborn as a great power, the right to eliminate  the frustrated position in which it has found itself.    This task is not a challenge to anyone, but it is a defense  of national interests. Situations that were extremely similar  after World War II were De Gaulle's course aimed at restoring  the grandeur of France and the restoration by China of its  positions as a great power. No one saw anything unnatural in  this. Therefore one would scarcely think that it is possible to  agree with the fact that similar strivings by Russia are being  treated today as imperial vanities. Moreover, this is being  presented on the level of the most highly placed  foreign-political leaders of the recent past and as a conceptual  theory: allegedly the "constant threat" against the West is  immanently inherent through the centuries to any Russia,  "tsarist or Soviet" (H. Kissinger), or, as a subvariant, to  "Great Russian imperialism" (Z. Brezinski).    What are unacceptable are the sometimes cutting, albeit on  another level, expectations that are directly hostile to Russia.  Unfortunately, there are plenty of examples. A research study by  the Carnegie Foundation in Washington that was published on the  eve of last year predicted that the Russian Federation would not  survive the year 1993 and would collapse. The London ECONOMIST,  in its turn, gave the following predictions on the same subject:  "This disintegration is not necessarily bad... Everything  depends on whether that disintegration will be orderly."    The second is Russia's inalienable right to security that is  equal with other powers.    For every country the primary guarantee of security is to  assure that there are no complications on the part of neighbors,  and that their territory does not become a corridor through  which third forces can travel. The removal of this problem by  political methods, on the basis of voluntary cooperation, is  universally positive in its consequences. That was the situation  with the understanding between France and Germany, which  countries undertook, after confrontation in two world wars, to  establish smooth bilateral relations The United States and  Canada, which also waged war with one another at one time,  refused to reinforce their common border, actually integrating  their military organizations. That is their right.    The striving by the Russian Federation to prevent at least a  movement backward in its own security is therefore logical.  Hence the desire to preserve the reliable ties in this area that  developed among the current CIS countries. This is the sphere of  the previous single military structure, and one sees preserved  in it both the important strong points of Russia itself, and the  joint interest of the CIS participants in taking joint action.  But wherever, as in the Baltic and East Europe, cooperation in  guaranteeing security is rejected by the other side, Russia  proceeds from the critical minimum. Namely, not to be faced by a  situation in which the former republics of the USSR and its  previous allies are included in a military bloc of which Russia  is not a member.    The third is the legal right of the Russian Federation to  lack of discrimination in the world economy. Russians do not  feel that someone else is supposed to pull their country out of  its current difficulties. This is their own task. But what  Russia naturally expects if the proposal is made that it become  integrated into the world economy is to have completely equal  conditions.    The time has come to remove the trade, economic, and other  barriers. But, instead of this, quota limitations sometimes  appear. And it is completely improper to strive to use our  problems as a lever for exerting pressure. Just as, according to  the Russian Ministry of Finance, the creditor banks in the  London Club would like to pay off our debts by means of the  forced sale of Russia's property abroad.    Finally, the Russian Federation has the undisputed right to  have its special interests taken into consideration in the  international situations that are important to it.    The specific concerns of any country are more the norm than  an exception. It is only important for good will to be  manifested and for the partner's interests to be taken into  consideration. Just as, for example, it is typical for the  relations between the United States and Japan.    Thus, the present factual situation can scarcely cause  satisfaction. In the proclaimed postconfrontational world it is  still a long way to truly parity partner relations, at least to  the extent that this pertains to respect for the rights and  interests of the Russian Federation.</p>

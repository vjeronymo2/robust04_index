			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Argentina turns down IMF request ARGENTINA'S central bank has rejected International Monetary Fund demands that the government take measures to curb the heavy inflow of capital. A Fund mission in Buenos Aires has expressed concern at the heavy volumes of capital flowing into Argentina because of its economic liberalisation and strong growth. About Dollars 8bn in private capital entered the country last year, a figure likely to be repeated this year. Mr Roque Fernandez, president of the independent central bank, said IMF officials had called on the government to impose 'marginal reserve requirements to put a limit on capital inflows. We do not think this is a good idea. If capital inflows are too great, interest rates will decline sufficiently for (capital) not to come.' Under Argentina's 1991 convertibility law, the central bank can only print local currency if it is fully backed by gold, hard currency and a limited amount of government securities. This means that capital inflows are immediately monetised. The monetary base rose to Dollars 12.2bn in March, compared with Dollars 9.2bn a year earlier. Economists have warned that the heavy capital inflows, threaten to stimulate excessive consumer demand. Chile, the first Latin country to begin implementing free market economic policies, has revalued its currency to discourage capital inflows. Argentina's capital inflows are financing a heavy current account deficit of Dollars 8bn a year, which is leading to concern over the sustainability of its reforms. Mr Fernandez rounded on the IMF saying: 'Either we believe in market prices or we do not. It is not consistent to look for restrictions at a time when we are integrating Argentina with the rest of the world.'</p>

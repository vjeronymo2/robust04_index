			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Pounds 200m plan for Cardiff development TARMAC has put forward a Pounds 200m scheme to South Glamorgan County Council for redeveloping a site linking the commercial and shopping centre of Cardiff with its docklands waterfront. The proposed project falls within the boundaries of the urban development corporation set up four years ago to regenerate 2,700 acres of Cardiff Bay. It is the largest urban redevelopment being undertaken in Europe after London's docklands. Mr Sam Pickstock, chairman of Tarmac Atlantic Wharf Developments, said in Cardiff yesterday the scheme would go ahead even if the proposed Pounds 125m barrage across the entrance to Cardiff Bay was not built. The private bill to promote the barrage, which is seen as crucial to the development, collapsed in parliament last week. The government has since said it will sponsor a new bill of its own to get the measure on the statute book. Mr Pickstock said: 'This scheme means we are making a long-term commitment to Cardiff, into the next century. Nowhere in the south of England has the same potential for development and growth as Cardiff.' Mr Peter Mathias, director of Holder, Mathias, Alcock, the Cardiff architects which designed the scheme, said the centrepiece was a crescent based on London's Regent Street. Tarmac was the first developer to operate in Cardiff, arriving three years before the government set up an urban development corporation in 1987. It has already spent more than Pounds 50m and committed another Pounds 25m on houses, commercial building and site clearance in the area. Grosvenor Waterside, the property arm in Cardiff of Associated British Ports, has already announced a Pounds 150m scheme on 40 acres for a mixed development nearby.</p>

The parties agreed on all paragraphs of the document except  on the material value of the airfield compound. They decided to  view the issue separately.    The Russian military persons assess the total value of all  installations at 9 billion Russian rubles, or around 5.2 million  U.S. dollars. Latvia, however, prices the compound at 4 billion  Russian rubles, or 2.3 million dollars.    The sums have to be coordinated by the Northwest Army Group  command and the Latvian Finance Ministry.    The local authorities claim that the Lociki airfield was the  last Russian military installation in the Daugavpils region.</p>

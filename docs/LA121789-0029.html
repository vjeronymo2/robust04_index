			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOP MILKEN BASHING, AT LEAST UNTIL A VERDICT OF GUILT OR INNOCENCE HAS BEEN  DETERMINED  </P> <P> I note a recent letter to the editor concerning Michael Milken, which stated  that his 1987 compensation of $550 million "doesn't sound like he made it the  old fashioned way."  </P> <P> What is that supposed to mean? Have we gotten to the point where we now presume  someone is a crook if they're successful?  </P> <P> I do not have access to all of the facts and evidence concerning the Milken  case. Neither does the letter writer. I don't know whether Milken is guilty.  Neither does the letter writer.  </P> <P> I do, however, presume his innocence. And I am extremely offended by someone  who, based solely on what they understand to be Milken's compensation, implies  that he is rich, so he must be guilty.  </P> <P> RANDY YOUNG  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [National People's Congress, NPC, Standing Committee Work </F> Report, given by NPC Standing Committee Vice Chairman Tian Jiyun  at the Second Session of the Eighth NPC on 15 March 1994]    [Text] Beijing, 25 Mar (XINHUA) -- Fellow deputies: The  Eighth NPC Standing Committee asked me to report to you the work  it has accomplished since the first session, and the main  projects it will do this year. Please examine the report.  <H5>  I. The Main Projects Accomplished in the Past Year </H5>   The Eighth NPC Standing Committee's five-year term is an  important period for China to speed up building a socialist  market economic system and achieve the second-step modernization  goal. In accordance with the state's overall situation and  tasks, the Standing Committee has laid down the main points of  work for this term as well as these guidelines: Upholding the  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and  under the guidance of the party's basic line, we should regard  the strengthening of socialist democracy and the legal system as  the basic task, continue to improve the people's congress  institution, safeguard the implementation of the Constitution  and laws, and actively promote the development of the socialist  market economy. Over the past year, the Standing Committee, in  the light of this guiding thought, has earnestly discharged its  constitutional responsibilities and made new headway in  intensifying economic legislation, improving supervisory  mechanisms, promoting reform and development, and safeguarding  social stability.    (1) We Have Given First Priority to Economic  Legislation and Achieved Remarkable Legislative Successes    The constitutional amendment adopted by the First Session of  the Eighth NPC clearly provides that "the state shall institute  a socialist market economy," and that the "state shall intensify  economic legislation." In light of this constitutional  requirement, the Standing Committee has given first priority to  economic legislation and strove to build a basic legal framework  governing the socialist market economy. The pace of legislation  has accelerated noticeably over the past year. The Standing  Committee has drawn up and revised and adopted decisions on  legal issues on 21 laws, including 13 relevant to the socialist  market economy. The Standing Committee has also approved 17  treaties, conventions, and agreements.    To guide, promote, and safeguard the healthy development of  the socialist market economy, the Standing Committee has drawn  up some important laws for controlling the market, maintaining  market order, and strengthening macroeconomic regulation and  control. The provisions in the Company Law on the  establishment, organization, and property-related  responsibilities of limited liability companies and incorporated  companies have been helpful for controlling the main market  components, establishing a modern enterprise system, and  promoting the development of the socialist market economy. The  Law of Opposing Illegitimate Competition, the Law for Protecting  Consumers' Rights and Interests, and the Law for Registered  Accountants, as well as the Decision on Punishing the Crime of  Producing and Selling Counterfeit and Inferior Commodities and  the Decision on Interim Regulations Governing the Collection of  Value- Added Tax, Consumption Tax, and Business Tax from Foreign  Enterprises and Enterprises with Foreign Investment are playing  an important role in maintaining market order, stopping  illegitimate competition, improving macroeconomic regulation and  control, and protecting the legitimate rights and interests of  parties of economic activities. The Agricultural Law has summed  up China's experiences in carrying out rural reform and codified  the state's responsibility systems dominated by contracts linked  to family output, a system which has stabilized the rural areas.  The law has also improved the two-tiered system which  integrates unified management and separate management; and it  has safeguarded the legitimate rights and interests of  agricultural organizations and farmers. The Law on Protecting  Taiwan Countrymen's Investment was drawn up to protect Taiwan  countrymen's investment, encourage them to invest in the  mainland, and promote the economic development between the two  sides of the Taiwan Strait. To keep pace with the needs in the  development of the socialist market economy, the Standing  Committee has also revised the Economic Contract Law, the  Personal Income Tax Law, and the Accountancy Law; and it has  examined the draft Budget Law, the Securities Law, the Foreign  Trade Law, the Labor Law, and decided to present the draft  Budget Law to the current NPC session for deliberations.    For the sake of promoting scientific-technological and  educational development and the development of public health  services, the Standing Committee has adopted the Law for  Scientific and Technological Advancement, the Teachers Law, the  Law Governing the Popularization of Agricultural Technology, and  the Law for Red Cross Societies. The Law for Scientific and  Technological Advancement has provided the legal basis for the  state's basic policy that economic construction and social  development must count on science and technology -- which in  turn should be geared to the needs of economic construction and  social development -- and has safeguarded the strategy that  priority must be given to scientific and technological  development. The formulation of the Teachers Law is conducive  to safeguarding teachers' legitimate rights and interests; to  building a contingent of ideologically, ethically, and  professionally acceptable teachers; and to promoting the  development of socialist education. Moreover, the Standing  Committee has also adopted supplementary regulations for harshly  punishing the crime of organizing and delivering people across  the national borders, and it has examined the drafts of the  State Compensation Law and the State Law on Conferring Medals  and Honorary Titles.    The task of drawing up laws relevant to the socialist market  economy is an urgent and formidable one. During the course of  legislation, the Standing Committee has paid attention to: 1)  approaching and dealing with issues and problems encountered in  legislation, in following the guidance of the theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as the basic  party line, and on the basis of the Constitution; 2) carrying  out the comprehensive investigation and study of socialist  market economic laws, and drawing up legislative plans according  to needs and feasibilities so that legislative affairs can  proceed in a well- planned and selective manner; 3) fully  mobilizing the initiatives of all quarters and giving scope to  the role played by experts and scholars and the coordination  between actual workers and theoretical workers; 4) improving  organization, guidance, and coordination when laws were being  drafted, urging the drafting units to complete their assignments  on time, and ensuring the quality of the drafts; 5) proceeding  from China's actual situation and bravely assimilating and  emulating foreign countries' experiences, and making sure that  our laws are in line with the features and rules of the  development of the socialist market economy; that they are fair,  impartial, open, and effective; and that they can further  emancipate and develop productive forces.    (2) Strive To Improve and Strengthen Supervision, and  Continue To Improve Supervisory Mechanisms    While speeding up the reform and opening up process and  replacing the old economic system with a new one, the Standing  Committee has intensified its supervision over legislative and  other work. Over the past year, the Standing Committee and  special committees, in centering around the state's priority  projects and major issues about which the people are concerned,  dispatched 37 inspection groups to inspect the implementation of  18 laws. At the same time, the Standing Committee has also  heard and examined reports submitted by the State Council and  its departments as well as by the Supreme People's Procuratorate  on the work in eight respects, including finance, foreign trade,  education, administrative ethics, and civil aviation. The  special committees were also briefed at regular intervals on the  work of relevant departments.    The Standing Committee paid attention to actual performance  while inspecting law enforcement. In view of the fact that  people have responded strongly to public security problems, the  Standing Committee has inspected the implementation of the  Decision on Intensifying the Comprehensive Management of Public  Security, underscored the need to be firm on promoting material  civilization and socialist ethics at the same time, intensified  the work of special organs, mobilized and organize all social  sectors to deal with public offense, and exercised comprehensive  management through various ways and means, thus harshly cracking  down on railway and highway robberies, drug trafficking, the use  of narcotics, prostitution, and other crimes and thus protecting  the people's lives and property. In view of the rampancy of the  crime of producing and selling bogus and inferior commodities,  the Standing Committee has organized inspections of the  implementation of the Decision on Punishing the Crime of  Producing and Selling Bogus and Inferior Commodities, stressing  the need to educate the people about the law until producers and  traders understand that the quality of their goods must be  accountable to society, and until consumers know how to protect  their own rights and interests through the law as well as the  need to reinforce law enforcement authorities, combat local  protectionism, and ban the practice of paying fines in lieu of  serving prison terms. To meet the need of establishing a modern  enterprise system, the Standing Committee has also come up with  views and suggestions on implementing the Enterprise Law,  replacing enterprises' operating mechanisms, and making sure  enterprises are able to enjoy their autonomy. Relevant special  committees have also carried out extensive and deep-going  inspections of the implementation of laws for environmental  protection, and the media has achieved fairly good results with  its continual reports which have prompted certain departments  and regions to take measures to deal with pollution.    Strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control was an  important measure adopted by the state last year. The Standing  Committee heard and deliberated on the "Report on the Current  Financial Situation and Financial Policies and Measures"  delivered by State Council Vice Premier Zhu Rongji. The  Standing Committee members endorsed the series of measures  adopted by the State Council to improve and strengthen  macroeconomic regulation and control and to rectify the  financial order, and they made suggestions on deepening the  reform of the financial system. The Standing Committee heard  and deliberated on the reports of the State Planning Commission  and the Finance Ministry on the implementation of the state plan  and the state budget and examined and approved the 1992 state  final accounts. To promote the deepening of the struggle  against corruption, the Standing Committee heard and deliberated  on the Supreme People's Procuratorate's "Report on the  Investigation and Handling of Major Cases by Procuratorial  Organs in the Struggle Against Corruption," affirmed the  achievements of procuratorial organs in handling major cases to  deal with corruption according to the law, and expressed strong  support for law-enforcement organs' handling cases according to  the law. The Standing Committee members hold that strengthening  the building of a clean government and the fight against  corruption is an important guarantee for the establishment of a  socialist market economic structure and that this has a bearing  on the success or failure of the reform and the destiny of the  state. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out this work  constantly and unremittingly and see to it that it yields  results.    In carrying out its supervisory work, the Standing Committee  has paid attention to improving the supervisory mechanism and  has exercised supervision according to the law. On the basis of  summing up experiences in overseeing law enforcement in the past  few years, the Standing Committee drew up "Some Provisions on  Strengthening the Examination and Supervision of Law  Enforcement," thus further institutionalizing this work and  improving the procedures for carrying it out. To maintain a  unified legal system for the state, the Standing Committee has  examined the local laws and regulations submitted to it for the  record and rectified the provisions that were in conflict with  the laws. The Standing Committee's offices have also carefully  studied and answered questions raised by local authorities on  the implementation of laws.    (3) Deal Seriously With the Deputies' Motions and  Proposals and Maintain Close Ties With the Masses    The raising of motions and proposals by deputies at the NPC  session constitutes an important forum in which they exercise  their right to administer the affairs of the state. This is  conducive to putting state organs under the supervision of the  masses and will help state organs improve their work. At the  First Session of the Eighth NPC, the deputies raised 611  motions, of which the motion raised by the Guangdong delegation  on the establishment of the Preparatory Work Subcommittee of the  Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region was listed on the agenda of the session. Authorized by  the NPC session, the Standing Committee decided to establish the  preparatory work subcommittee, which has begun work. This is  very important to ensure that China will resume the exercise of  sovereignty over Hong Kong, to realize the smooth transfer of  power in 1997, and to maintain Hong Kong's long-term prosperity.  Ninety-three motions were examined by specialized committees.  Most of these motions concerned legislation. In making laws,  the Standing Committee has fully considered and adopted the  deputies' opinions. The other 517 motions were regard as  proposals, criticisms, and opinions. These, as well as 2,325  proposals put forward by the deputies, have been transferred by  the General Office of the Standing Committee to the relevant  units for study and handling. All of them have been answered.  With the efforts of the units handling them, the motions and  proposals have been handled more quickly than before, and the  quality of their being handled has improved.    Inspections are an important way for the deputies to  maintain  ties with the masses, to understand the situation, and to  reflect the masses' opinions and demands. Before the current  session was convened, the NPC Standing Committee and the  provincial-level people's congress standing committees jointly  organized in 1993 NPC deputies to carry out inspections  concerning the implementation of the development plan and  budget, the transformation of the operating mechanisms of  state-owned enterprises, the reduction of peasants' burdens, the  efforts to improve public security, and the fight against  corruption. They also organized the deputies from Hong Kong,  Macao, and Taiwan Province to inspect some areas in  Heilongjiang, Guangdong, and Fujian Provinces. During their  inspection tours, they were serious about trying to understand  the actual situation and offered some important opinions. The  results were fairly good.    Good attention was paid to people's visits and letters.  Over the past year, the Standing Committee handled 60,907  letters and received 13,248 people. Through handling letters  and receiving visitors, the Standing Committee urged concerned  departments and locales to solve a number of urgent problems and  thus promoted closer ties between state organs and the masses.    We have strengthened efforts to guide the work of standing  committees of local people's congresses and to support local  people's congresses in exercising their power according to the  law. We have held discussion meetings attended by responsible  comrades of standing committees of people's congresses at the  provincial level to hear their opinions, exchange experiences  with them, and study ways to further improve the work of  people's congresses. The chairman and vice chairmen of the NPC  Standing Committee made inspection trips to investigate  situations in various places, to understand the work of local  people's congresses, and to guide and assist local people's  congresses in legislative work and the supervision of government  work. The special committees and working departments of the NPC  Standing Committee jointly held discussion meetings and  symposiums with local people's congresses, and they have thus  maintained closer ties.    (4) Actively Develop Contacts With Foreign Parliaments,  Create a Favorable International Environment for China's Reform,  Opening Up, and Modernization Drive    Making contacts with foreign parliaments is an important  task  of the Standing Committee and is also a component part of the  state's foreign affairs. Over the past year, NPC delegations  led by the chairman and vice chairmen of the NPC Standing  Committee visited 26 countries. The NPC Standing Committee sent  delegations to take part in six international conferences and  received 37 delegations of foreign parliaments and international  organizations. The special committees of the Standing Committee  sent 12 delegations to visit 23 countries and to take part in 20  related international meetings. Those committees received 59  parliamentary committees and international organizations. The  NPC Standing Committee adjusted or established 35 bilateral  friendship teams between the NPC and foreign parliaments. The  NPC Standing Committee also invited responsible persons of  standing committees of people's congresses at the provincial  level and NPC deputies to take part in the NPC's foreign affairs  activities.    Chairman Qiao Shi's visit to the five ASEAN member countries  has promoted exchanges between the Chinese NPC and the five  countries' parliaments, strengthened contacts with the leaders  of those countries, and consolidated and developed friendship  and cooperation between China and those countries. His visit  was of great significance to maintaining stability and  prosperity in the Asia- Pacific region. Chairman Qiao Shi's  visits to Germany, Switzerland, and Austria not only promoted  exchanges and cooperation between the NPC and parliaments of the  three countries but were also, through extensive contacts with  the leaders of the three countries, conducive to increasing  China's influence and promoting the development of China's  relations with the three countries. His visits have  strengthened cooperation and promoted the further improvement of  relations between West European countries and China. The NPC  delegations also visited the DPRK, the ROK, five Central Asian  countries, three North European countries, and several other  countries. Through those multilevel and multichannel foreign  affairs activities, we have enhanced mutual understanding and  trust with those countries, increased the influence of our  country's reform and opening policy, and promoted the  development of state relations. Through parliamentary  diplomacy, we have promoted cooperation in economic, trade,  scientific affairs and technology, education, culture, and other  fields. Meanwhile, we have also paid attention to understanding  and borrowing foreign experiences in legislation and economic  construction.    The change in the international situation and the  development  of the domestic situation all require us to further strengthen  the NPC's foreign affairs to expand our influence, make friends,  promote friendship and cooperation with foreign parliaments and  people, and create a favorable international environment for  China's socialist modernization, reform, and opening up. From  now on, we will continue to implement our country's foreign  policy, give full play to the role of parliamentary diplomacy,  and further improve the NPC's conduct of foreign affairs.    (5) Strengthen the Building of the Standing  Committee's Organizational Structure and Bring the Special  Committees Into Play    In light of the new situation's demands on the People's  Congress, the Standing Committee has given strategic importance  to strengthening its own construction, particularly the building  of its organizational structure. It has drawn up the "Rules for  NPC Standing Committee Members," which urge Standing Committee  members to study hard the theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the Constitution and laws, to  maintain close ties with the masses, to be honest, and to obey  the institution of the congress and its work disciplines, and to  discharge their responsibilities strictly according to the law.  It has revised and perfected such work regulations as the  "Rules of Procedure for the Chairmanship Meeting" and the "Work  Regulations for the Secretariat" so that the Standing Committee  has some regulations to follow in carrying out its routine work.  Each special committee has also formulated or revised work  regulations and rules of procedure and has stipulated rules on  Standing Committee members' responsibilities, the institution of  the congress, and its work procedures.    The special committees are the NPC's permanent  organizations.  When the congress is not in session, they are under the Standing  Committee's leadership. Its work is characterized by regularity  and specifics. Giving full play to the special committees is  crucial to the Standing Committee in carrying out such tasks as  legislation and supervision. Last year, the Standing Committee  held two discussion meetings for persons in charge of the  special committees to study issues such as strengthening the  construction of the special committees and to help carry out the  special committees' work. Over the past year, each special  committee has actively discharged its responsibilities, has  helped the Standing Committee exercise its authority, and has  done a great deal and scored marked achievements in studying,  deliberating, and working out legal and other motions; in  monitoring law enforcement, in hearing reports from the  departments concerned, and in carrying out special  investigations and activities related to foreigners.    The Standing Committee attaches importance to strengthening  organizational construction. Its chairman and vice chairmen  have held many meetings of public functionaries in calling for  organizational construction. Over the past year, public  functionaries have earnestly studied Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and the Constitution  and laws and have improved cadres' political integrity and  professional level. Various departments and units have  instituted the responsibility system to accelerate the pace of  work, to improve work efficiency, and to ensure the completion  of various tasks.    Over the past year, with the support of all its deputies and  local people's congresses, the Standing Committee has made new  progress and scored greater achievements in various tasks. In  the meantime, we must also note that there are some  imperfections in our work. They are mainly: Legislation does  not completely meet the needs of reform, opening up, and  economic development; supervision is still weak, particularly  the checking and supervising of law enforcement; and the  building of the Standing Committee itself does not meet the new  situation's demands on the People's Congress. We should adopt  effective measures to overcome these shortcomings step by step.    II. The Main Tasks for the Coming Year    The year 1994 will be a crucial year for China to accelerate  the establishment of a market economic structure and to maintain  the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the economy.  Under the guidance of the theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, the Standing Committee will fully  implement the guidelines of 14th CPC National Congress and the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, make  the construction of socialist democracy and legality its  fundamental task, and earnestly carry out the functions vested  in it by the Constitution and other laws. We should go deeply  into the realities of life and mingle with the masses, carry out  research and investigations, solicit the views of the masses,  pay constant attention to and understand the new problems that  crop up in the course of economic development, assess various  situations that may affect social stability and the smooth  implementation of reform, offer constructive suggestions, and  properly handle the relationship between reform, development,  and stability. We should speed up the drafting of economic laws  and exercise efficient supervision over law enforcement and the  implementation of reform measures. All the Standing Committee's  work must be subject to and serve the overall tasks of seizing  the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting  development, and preserving stability.    (1) Continue To Give Top Priority to Economic  Legislation To Meet the Needs of Developing a Socialist Market  Economy.    This will be a year in which relatively more reform measures  will be announced. Therefore, laws are needed to guide,  promote, and ensure reform. This presents a rather urgent  demand for speeding up the pace of legislation, and economic  legislation in particular. We will continue to give top  priority to economic legislation and develop, step by step, a  system of laws that meets the needs of developing a socialist  market economy.    The Standing Committee has adopted a five-year legislative  program. At the top of the legislative agenda are major laws  that standardize market practices, strengthen macroeconomic  regulation and control, and perfect the social security system.  Also on the agenda are laws that are designed to promote  socialist democracy, strengthen the organizational system of  state organs, punish crimes, safeguard public order, promote the  development of science, education, and culture; protect the  environment, and strengthen the national defense buildup. When  the program is accomplished, a general framework of laws  governing the socialist market economy will have come into being  and laws governing other areas will have been strengthened. The  Standing Committee should provide more effective guidance,  coordination, and supervision over the implementation of the  legislative program. In addition to fulfilling their own  law-drafting tasks, the NPC special committees should step up  coordination with other law-drafting units. All units with  law-drafting responsibilities must assign personnel and set a  schedule to ensure that their law-drafting tasks are completed  on time with high quality.    According to the legislative program, quite a number of laws  will be formulated this year. We should draw up a plan on the  basis of their importance and urgency so that urgently needed  laws will be formulated first. It is necessary to sum up in a  timely fashion the experience gained from reform measures being  implemented and, wherever possible, to standardize and codify  into laws what has been learned. We should step up the  formulation of the central bank law, the commercial bank law,  the auditing law, the foreign trade law, the futures trade law,  the real estate law, the securities law, the instruments law,  the guarantor law, the trust law, the insurance law, the  arbitration law, and the labor law. We must also speed up the  drafting of laws in other areas whenever conditions are ripe. We  should embrace new ideas in regard to the socialist market  economy, be bold in exploring new ways, dare to experiment, and  increase the pace and quality of legislative work to meet the  needs of reform and development.    (2) We Must Successfully Carry Out Inspections of and  Supervision Over Law Enforcement To Promote the Implementation  of Various Reform Measures.    Reform is an undertaking of all the people across the  country  and is in their greatest interests. The Standing Committee must  proceed from the fundamental interests of the people, bring  every positive factor into full play, and give full support to  and promote the smooth implementation of various reform  measures. On the basis of the duties and powers prescribed by  the Constitution, the Standing Committee must represent the will  of the people to further carry out inspections of and  supervision over law enforcement and strengthen its supervision  over administrative, judicial, and procuratorial work by making  its efforts revolve around the major issues of reform and  construction.    The Standing Committee must place the inspection of and  supervision over law enforcement at the top of its work agenda,  conscientiously carry out "Certain Regulations on Strengthening  the Inspection of and Supervision Over Law Enforcement," and  step up supervision to produce more concrete results therefrom.  This year, it must focus its inspection and supervision on the  enforcement of the laws on the market economy, and in particular  it must organize a force to carry out in-depth inspections of  the enforcement of the newly adopted laws on maintaining order  in the market and strengthening macroeconomic regulation and  control in a bid to promote the healthy development of the  socialist market economy. It must continue to successfully  conduct inspections of and supervision over the enforcement of  the laws on maintaining public security and cracking down on  various criminal activities so as to maintain social order,  protect social stability, and promote the building of spiritual  civilization.    To promote the development of economic construction as well  as reform and opening up, the Standing Committee must hear in a  time manner work reports by the State Council and its relevant  departments, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme  People's Procuratorate; supervise the implementation of various  reform measures; and support and urge them to do a good job. It  must strengthen supervision over the implementation of the  national economic and social development plan as well as the  state budget, and it must guarantee the smooth implementation of  the plan and budget approved by the NPC session. The Standing  Committee must intensify its supervision over the work ethics of  elected and appointed personnel of the NPC and the Standing  Committee itself. Whenever corrupt personnel who have committed  graft or have accepted bribes are discovered, those deserving  dismissal should be dismissed, and those who have broken the law  shall have their criminal responsibilities investigated  according to the law. We must support and urge law-enforcement  authorities to enforce the law strictly and we must intensify  their efforts in handling major cases. We must seriously handle  the masses' appeals, accusations, and reports. We must also  constantly sum up the experiences that we have gained while  exercising supervision so that our supervision will be even more  standardized and institutionalized.    (3) We Must Create a Good, Law-Conscious Environment  by Heightening the Entire Society's Sense of Law.    Heightening the entire society's sense of law is an  important  aspect in building our socialist system and an essential  requirement for the modernization drive to move forward  smoothly. The development of reform, opening up, and  modernization requires people in society, especially leading  cadres at all levels, to have a higher sense of the law.  China's feudal society had a several- thousand-year history,  and we do not have a tradition of democracy and law. Because of  this, as well as the fact that we have become used to, over a  long period of time, managing and handling economic and social  affairs simply by means of administrative measures, some cadres  and people have only a faint sense of the law, and they do not  do things according to the law. Some cadres approach laws with  a pragmatic attitude and do not enforce those which are not in  their favor. Some have even abused their authority and openly  violated laws to protect the interests of their own regions,  departments, and units. This situation is incongruous with the  development of the socialist market economy. Solving this  problem is an urgent, protracted, and formidable mission which  must be accomplished earnestly by making persistent and untiring  efforts.    To heighten society's sense of the law, the most fundamental  measure is to educate the people. The Standing Committee must  consider it a routine but important task to publicize the  knowledge of the law and to educate the public about the legal  system. It should fully utilize the media, such as television  and radio stations and the press, to create a powerful momentum  for the propagation of the law. We must see to it that all  departments and local authorities make continual efforts in  educating the people about the law, publicizing the  Constitution, and popularizing legal knowledge about the market  economy so that the masses will understand the law, obey it, and  know how to use it to protect their legitimate rights and  interests. We must uphold the authority of the Constitution and  other laws. All organizations and individuals must consider the  Constitution to be their fundamental code of conduct, and no one  has the privilege of overstepping the Constitution or other  laws. Personnel of all state organs, especially those in  leading positions, must take the initiative in studying and  understanding the law, in setting the example of observing the  law, and in knowing how to handle all affairs using legal  measures. While electing or dismissing cadres, the NPC and its  Standing Committee should consider whether the cadres have the  necessary knowledge of the law and whether they are earnest in  enforcing the law as a yardstick of their competence. We must  build a stronger contingent of law enforcers, improve their  quality and competence, and make sure that all laws are strictly  enforced and that whoever violates the law is punished. In  short, in order to create a good legal system facilitating  reform and construction, we must take all effective measures to  gradually correct the situation under which people are unaware  of the existence of the law or do not strictly enforce laws if  they are aware of their existence, and to help the public  understand that it is an honor to obey the law and shameful to  break it, and that things should be done according to the law.    (4) The Standing Committee Should Strengthen Itself by  Creating a Strong Contingent of NPC Cadres.    Under the new situation, the tasks confronting the Standing  Committee are arduous, and it must build itself into a stronger  organ. Members of the Standing Committee and cadres of all its  organs must earnestly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's works and  arm their minds and guide their work with the theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics. We must fully  understand that building a socialist democratic legal system is  an important part of modernization and that the NPC works at the  forefront of building the democratic legal system. We must  concentrate our efforts, work cautiously, and earnestly  discharge our responsibilities so as to live up to the people's  high expectations.    The Standing Committee must continue to reform and improve  its organizational and operational systems and rationalize the  relationships between various departments so that its discussion  of state affairs can be even more efficient. NPC organs must  proceed with their structural reform in order to become more  consolidated, streamlined, and efficient. To adapt to the needs  caused by increasingly arduous legislative and supervisory  projects, we must have stronger legislative organs and research  and consultative organs. To this end, we must improve the mix  of cadres, improve cadres' proficiency, reinforce these organs  with specialists and experienced personnel, and intensify the  training of cadres so that the NPC will gradually have a  contingent of dedicated cadres who are armed with the theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics, who are  knowledgeable about the Constitution and other laws, who have  established close ties with the masses, and who discharge their  duties earnestly and honestly.    Fellow deputies! The people's congress system is a basic  political system of China. Upholding and improving this system  has extremely important significance for ensuring the people's  role as masters of their own house, for consolidating the  political power characterized by the people's democratic  dictatorship, for fully arousing the people's enthusiasm to  build socialism with Chinese characteristics, for safeguarding  the state's long-term peace and stability, and for expediting  the progress of reform, opening up, and modernization. This  year marks the 40th anniversary of the NPC's founding. We  should commemorate this anniversary by focusing on the brilliant  course which the NPC has traversed in its development, by  broadly publicizing the superiority of the NPC system, and by  heightening people's understanding of the importance of making  the NPC more efficient under the new situation so that the NPC  and its Standing Committee can play their parts more  effectively. Under the guidance of the theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and that of the party's  basic line, we must explore actively, press forward, and work  hard to do an even better job so as to play our parts in seizing  even greater victories in reform and construction!</p>

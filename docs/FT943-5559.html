			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Europe at odds over integration: Fears voiced about Franco-German plan for Union centred on five-nation 'inner circle' A new constitutional debate has broken out in Europe on the future pace of political and economic integration. Fears voiced yesterday in Italy and Spain indicated that the wrangling could prove as divisive as that over the Maastricht treaty. Concern has been aroused in countries that would be excluded from a 'hard core' of five nations - as defined by leaders in France and Germany - in a multi-speed European Union. Italy, one of those to be left out of the 'inner circle', openly attacked the idea yesterday. If it was put into practice, 'we would evidently risk a break-up of Europe, which is completely unacceptable', the Italian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. A senior official in Spain, another country to be relegated from the 'inner circle', also expressed fears at the prospect of being left behind within the EU. 'All countries are happy with a hard core, as long as they are in it,' the official said. In Brussels, a senior EU official said that plans for a multi-speed Europe, floated in France by Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, and in Germany by Mr Wolfgang Schauble, parliamentary leader of the Christian Democrats, might prove virtually impossible to implement. However, the British Foreign Office said the vision of a multi-speed Europe was preferable to a 'monolithic' concept of all countries travelling on the same lines. But pro-European British MPs expressed fears that the UK would be relegated to Europe's slow lane. Constitutional debate on the future of Europe has been in suspension after the arduous ratification last year of the Maastricht treaty, which struck a balance between Community-wide obligations and looser co-operation among governments. Many observers thought that a truce would hold until the inter-governmental conference to review the Maastricht treaty opened in 1996. But debate has broken out as France and Germany, the traditional motor behind European integration, have sought to reconcile Bonn's demand to embrace the former communist countries of eastern Europe with Paris's interest in preserving its political influence in a strong Union. In Germany the Christian Democrats, leaders of the coalition government, this week published a policy document proposing a future flexible Europe with expanded membership to the east, built around the core Franco-German alliance. Their vision of 'variable geometry' - apparently blessed by the party leader, Chancellor Helmut Kohl - would be configured around only five of the six founding members: France and Germany, as well as Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Italy, a founder member, as well as Britain and Spain, would be excluded in the initial phase. The German paper appeared a day after Mr Balladur sketched his vision of a three-tier Europe with France and Germany at the core. A second concentric circle would include weaker or less integrationist-minded states such as the UK, while an outer group would take in the nations of eastern Europe which could not hope to meet the criteria of EU membership for some time.

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Move to plug leakage of dollars RUSSIA yesterday unveiled a foreign exchange control system designed to force exporters to repatriate their dollar earnings. Developed with the help of France and Italy, which had similar foreign exchange controls in their recent past, the system will be operated with the extensive involvement of Russian commercial banks which are entitled to conduct hard currency operations. 'We have not re-invented the bicycle,' said Mr Victor Melnikov, head of the central bank's newly-reorganised currency regulation department. The scheme comes into effect in January for exporters of strategic commodities such as oil and precious metals and in March for all other exporters. It is to operate as follows: An exporter and his bank will be obliged to sign a 'passport' for any given export deal. The exporter will take a copy of the 'passport' to customs. Customs will then provide the necessary export documents. The 'passport' details will be fed into customs' data base. Customs will pass on to the bank a document confirming the goods have left the country. The exporter must also forward a copy of the export documents to the bank. The bank is obliged to alert customs if the money is not repatriated by the time payment for goods is expected. For their services in implementing the exchange controls, banks will be paid up to 0.15 per cent of the value of the contract by exporters. Banks caught violating the procedure face fines amounting to the value of the contract. Those which cannot cope with the extra burden of enforcing controls would lose prized licences to conduct hard currency operations. The biggest obstacle to the system's smooth functioning will be widespread corruption in customs and banks. Mr Melnikov said the system's main defence against fraud was its reliance on three separate sources of information: customs, exporters, and the banks. Mr Dmitry Tulin, deputy governor of the central bank, said the new system would mark a serious start to tackling capital flight which has hindered the country's ability to repay its debts.</p>

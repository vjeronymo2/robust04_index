			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / South African economy puts on 5.1% growth rate SOUTH Africa's economy grew by 5.1 per cent in the second quarter, according to gross domestic product figures published by the central statistical service yesterday, suggesting that the country's four-year recession has ended. The improvement compares with growth of 1.4 per cent in the first quarter. The news coincides with publication of data suggesting government finances are in reasonable shape after speculation the government would overshoot its deficit target. Most of the growth is attributable to the agricultural sector, which is recovering from a devastating drought.</p>

Rating Panels <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. General <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Rating Panel(s) shall ensure that all category 4 applications have been properly determined to be threshold-approvable. The Rating Panel(s) shall compile data furnished by Field Offices for category 4 (other) applications, and rate each application based on Field Office analyses, comments, and recommendations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A list of rated applications shall be forwarded to Headquarters, with copies of Field Office reviews and recommendations, and justifications for Rating Panel rankings. Headquarters shall not modify ratings of category 4 (``other'') applications unless a gross error has occurred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Examples of ``gross errors'' include, but are not limited to, errors in calculating the vacancy rate in the proposed community, or assigning points for development/management experience based on a PHMAP score that was successfully appealed, or simple errors of arithmetic.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Changes in ratings shall be fully documented, and a copy of the memorandum authorizing the change (and the basis thereof) shall be sent to the Rating Panel and to the Field Office for inclusion in the file and be made available for public inspection. Category 4 applications shall be approved within Areas, to the extent fair share funds are assigned, as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. ``Tight Market'' Determination <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Headquarters will separate ``other'' applications (category 4) on the basis of ``tight rental housing market'' and Rating Panel ratings and Headquarters rankings, and approve them (in the following order) to the extent fair share funds are assigned to their respective Area:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Applications within the same Area in tight rental housing markets which receive 80 or more rating points;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. All other applications in the same Area, in rank order, depending on ``metropolitan'' or ``non-metropolitan'' funding available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Reservation of Funds <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Funds will be reserved in an amount equal to the total development cost limit for the number, structure type, and size of units being approved, ``trended'' to take into consideration the anticipated cost of construction at the time the construction/rehabilitation contract is expected to be executed; acquisition reservations will be trended to take into account anticipated cost variations between fund reservation and Date of Full Availability (DOFA). The trend shall be calculated by multiplying the project total development cost limit by 6 percent (1.06), rounded to the nearest $50. No amendment funds will be available for these projects in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Partial Funding <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Partial funding of highly ranked ``other'' applications within an Area may occur (so long as such projects are determined viable and the PHA has indicated willingness to accept fewer units) to facilitate the funding in rank order of additional applications for highly ranked projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> VI.

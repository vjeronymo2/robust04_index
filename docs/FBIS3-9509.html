			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Electoral Package-Law Adopted"] </F>   [Text] During a yesterday session, the Macedonian [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] Government  adopted the package-law on elections. They discussed and  determined the proposed law on electing president of the  country. This law states the country's president will be  elected during general, direct, and secret voting, for a 5-year  mandate. It will take a group of at least 10,000 voters or 30  parliament deputies to nominate a presidential candidate. If no  candidate gets the necessary majority of votes in the first  rounds of election, the second round will include the two  candidates with biggest number of votes from the first round.    The Government also adopted the proposal on changes in the  law on appointing and replacing parliament deputies and  committee members. The Macedonian Parliament will be consisted  of 140 deputies. 120 of them will be elected by the majority  principle, and the remaining one by the proportionate one. The  number of members in township committees will be determined by a  Statute. The news in this law is that the second round of  elections will include only candidates who have gotten at least  12 percent of the total number of voters in the first round.    Government members also adopted the proposed law on  political  parties, regulating procedure and conditions for founding,  registering and ceasing to exist of political parties. The law  allows no registering of parties with a program, statute, or  activities aimed to forcefully overthrow the government, urging  or calling to military aggression, and introducing religious,  national, or racial hatred or intolerance.    The package of laws is expected to appear on the parliament  agenda during its 74th session, announced for March 29.</p>

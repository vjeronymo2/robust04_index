			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Technology: New breed of PC on the scene A new class of lightweight portable personal computer is emerging with the launch of the first A-5 sized machines from Italy's Olivetti and Vortec, part of Korea's Samsung group. The new machines are designed to fill the gap between palmtop computers, which generally have small keyboards and screens, and the larger A-4 notebook computers which dominate the growing portable computer market. According to an Olivetti/Dataquest estimate, the market in western Europe this year for the high-end palmtop and entry-level notebook computers which the A-5 or 'companion' machines are designed to replace, could be as high as 300,000 units. Not surprisingly, some established portable PC manufacturers question whether there is a market for the new machines. They point out that lighter and cheaper notebooks and more sophisticated palmtops such as the new PC-compatible Sharp 3,000 are already arriving. However, both Olivetti and Vortec are convinced that the particular features of their new machines - large-sized LCD screens, only slightly scaled-down Qwerty keyboards, hard-disk storage and full compatibility with the desktop PC MS-Dos standard all squeezed into a small 1kg package - will make them attractive options. Olivetti's new machine, dubbed the 'Quaderno' (which means 'schoolbook') is being produced by its Pegasus joint venture with Tokyo-based Y-E Data. It will run for eight hours using a rechargeable NiCad battery pack - double the battery life of most notebooks. Its most distinguishing feature aside from its Dollars 1,100 (Pounds 620) price, is its ability to record and play back sound. As Fabrizio Gimona, marketing director for Olivetti's PC range, puts it: 'You can even talk to the Quaderno.' Vortec's Handbook PC also measures about half the size of a conventional notebook PC and weighs 1kg. It comes with a bigger hard disk and a more powerful processor but will cost about Pounds 1,500 when it goes on sale next month. Both machines boast a suite of built-in functions including communications software which allows them to exchange data with a desktop PC using a plug-in cable.</p>

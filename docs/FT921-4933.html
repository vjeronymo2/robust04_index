			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Baltic neighbours seek to bridge east-west divide FOREIGN MINISTERS from all 10 independent states bordering the Baltic Sea agreed yesterday to revive historic trading and cultural links between them and to create a community with its own specific identity, but closely linked with existing European organisations, writes Robert Mauthner in Copenhagen. In his opening statement, Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the Danish foreign minister, said he expected that, 10 years from now, all the countries in the Baltic region would be either members of the European Community, or closely linked to it. 'It means that it will be possible to speak of a Baltic Community as a region within the European Community,' he said. 'Co-operation in the Baltic region should facilitate the linkage of the European Community with the non-member countries of the region.' The fundamental aim of the German-Danish initiative, which has brought together Germany, Russia, Poland, all the Scandinavian states and the three newly independent Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, is to bridge the divide between western and eastern Europe and to tie the former communist states into the free market system. The conference yesterday decided to establish a Council of the Baltic Sea States.</p>

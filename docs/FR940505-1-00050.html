By this NPRM, EPA is proposing to disapprove the plan with respect to the RACM requirement because of this single deficiency. EPA invites comment on whether other RACM exist for the South Coast CO plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Attainment demonstration.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted, ``Serious'' CO nonattainment areas were required to submit a demonstration that the plan will provide for attainment by December 31, 2000. The SCAQMD conducted an attainment demonstration using both areawide (Urban Airshed Model, or UAM) and hotspot (CAL3QHC) modeling analyses. The two modeling analyses and the selection of the design value (23.4 ppm, recorded in 1988 at the Lynwood monitoring station) are discussed in Chapter 4 and Appendix D of the CO plan. The modeling analyses are consistent with EPA's guidance (Guideline for Modeling Carbon Monoxide from Roadway Intersections, User's Guide to CAL3QHC: A Modeling Methodology for Predicting Pollutant Concentrations near Roadway Intersections, and Guideline for Regulatory Application of the Urban Airshed Model for Areawide Carbon Monoxide). The SCAQMD's modeling analyses predict attainment of the 8-hour CO NAAQS by the year 2000, based upon the control strategies included in the plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, since attainment depends upon large CO emissions reductions (587.4 tons per day) assigned to the enhanced I/M program, which has not yet been adopted by the State, EPA proposes to disapprove the attainment demonstration portion of the plan. In the future, the attainment demonstration could be approved if the State submits approvable enhanced I/M legislative authorization and regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Quantitative milestones and reasonable further progress (RFP).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CO plan must contain measures which demonstrate RFP toward attainment by the applicable attainment date. Reasonable further progress is defined in section 171(1) of the Act as such annual incremental reductions in emissions of the relevant air pollutant as are required by Part D or may reasonably be required by the Administrator for the purpose of ensuring attainment of the NAAQS by the applicable date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has reviewed the attainment demonstration and control strategy for the area (see Chapter 6 and Appendix C of the CO plan). EPA concludes that the plan would provide for RFP but for the fact that the State legislature has not yet adopted legislation authorizing an enhanced I/M program and California has not submitted implementing regulations for the program. Therefore, EPA proposes to disapprove the RFP provision. Again, however, this defect could be cured by State action to authorize, adopt, and submit an approvable enhanced I/M program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Adoption of mandatory control measures.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Act mandates State adoption of four control programs for CO areas such as the South Coast.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Enhanced Inspection and Maintenance (I/M)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 187(a)(6) requires implementation of an enhanced I/M program in the nonattainment area's urbanized portions (as defined by the Bureau of Census) with a CO design value greater than 12.7 ppm. EPA's regulations respecting this requirement were issued on November 5, 1992 (57 FR 52950). The reader should refer to section III.D.2.c. for a detailed discussion of the purpose and components of the enhanced I/M program. As noted, the California State Legislature has to date failed to enact legislation that would authorize such a program. While EPA is not now required to propose a FIP enhanced I/M measure (as discussed in section III.A.1.), the Agency has chosen to do so as part of the FIP attainment demonstrations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Oxygenated Fuels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 211(m) and 187(b)(3) mandate SIP provisions prohibiting the sale of gasoline during winter months containing less than 2.7 percent oxygen by weight. Increasing the oxygen content of gasoline causes motor vehicle engines to run with leaner overall fuel/air mixture, thereby reducing the amount of CO generated during the combustion process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California's adopted regulations (California Wintertime Oxygenates Program for the years 1992&hyph;1995, and Phase 2 Reformulated Gasoline regulation for the years after 1995) provide for the sale of 1.8 to 2.2 percent oxygenated fuels. On October 30, 1992, the CARB applied for a partial waiver from the 2.7 percent level specified in the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA intends in a separate NPRM to propose to conditionally approve the waiver under the provisions of section 211(m)(3)(A), which authorizes the Administrator to waive, in whole or in part, this fuel requirement if the State demonstrates that use of oxygenated gasoline would prevent or interfere with the attainment of a NAAQS or a state or local ambient air quality standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CARB's waiver petition argues that an oxygen content above an average of 2.0 percent would interfere with attainment of the California standards for ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter, because the higher oxygenated fuel levels have the potential to increase emissions of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , which is a precursor to ozone and (in the South Coast) nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

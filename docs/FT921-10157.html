			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Egyptian court rebuffs Moslem Brotherhood EGYPT'S banned, but tolerated, Moslem Brotherhood has been denied legal status by an Egyptian court, in a decision which comes at time when the government is edgy about an apparent upswing in Islamic militancy across the Arab world. The Brotherhood, which was outlawed in 1954 after President Gamal Abdel Nasser accused it of plotting his overthrow, has been pressing unsuccessfully for registration as a charitable organisation. Egypt's constitution bans political organisations based on race or religion. The Moslem Brotherhood, the country's mainstream Islamic force, is allowed a fair degree of latitude to organise, canvass politically and operate schools and clinics. It has gained seats in parliament in partnership with the tiny Liberal and Socialist Labour parties.</p>

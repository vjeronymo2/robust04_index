"It's the first  time he's ever taken phone calls like that," said Sandler. "He really dropped  the Diceman act and talked to people." She said he explained that what he does  is only an act. "Some people were hostile at the beginning, but to my surprise,  there wasn't one person who went away angry," said Sandler. Clay fielded 25  calls. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

The petitioner claimed that the lower dash panel on the non-U.S. certified 1992 Ferrari 348TB is identical to that found on its U.S. certified counterpart, and that a knee bolster is not supplied on the U.S. certified vehicle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standard No. 209 Seat Belt Assemblies: installation of seat belts labeled in accordance with the standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standard No. 214 Side Door Strength: installation of reinforcing beams. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standard No. 301 Fuel System Integrity: installation of a rollover valve in the fuel tank vent line between the fuel tank and the evaporative emissions collection canister. The reader is referred to that notice for a thorough description of the petition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment was received in response to the notice of the petition, from Fiat Auto U.S.A., Inc. (Fiat), the United States representative of Ferrari. In its comment, Fiat stated that Ferrari, and other companies within the Fiat Group, have invested considerable resources in the design and production of vehicles that comply with the Federal motor vehicle safety standards. Although it stated that it has not determined what modifications are necessary to bring a vehicle into compliance with the Federal safety standards, Fiat contended that it is not possible to achieve such compliance by simply retrofitting a vehicle built for the European market, without conducting extensive development and testing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA accorded Champagne an opportunity to respond to Fiat's comment. In its response, Champagne stated that the entire passive restraint system that it proposes to install in the non-U.S. certified 1992 Ferrari 348TB, including the control unit and the wiring harness, is available from Ferrari in kit form. Champagne further stated that it is simple to install this equipment because all mounting points are supplied on the non-U.S. certified vehicle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As they have been performed with relative ease on thousands of vehicles imported over the years, none of the other modifications described in the petition would preclude NHTSA from determining that the non-U.S. certified 1992 Ferrari 348TB is eligible for importation. NHTSA has accordingly decided to grant the petition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Vehicle Eligibility Number for Subject Vehicles <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The importer of a vehicle admissible under any final decision must indicate on the form HS&hyph;7 accompanying entry the appropriate vehicle eligibility number indicating that the vehicle is eligible for entry. VSP 86 is the vehicle eligibility number assigned to vehicles admissible under this decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Final Determination <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, on the basis of the foregoing, NHTSA hereby decides that a 1992 Ferrari 348TB not originally manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards is substantially similar to a 1992 Ferrari 348TB originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States and certified under 49 U.S.C. 30115, and is capable of being readily altered to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 49 U.S.C. 30141(a)(10(A) and (b)(1); 49 CFR 593.8; delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1.50 and 501.8. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued on: December 13, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> William A.

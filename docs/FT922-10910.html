			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / World Trade News: Brussels disputes Gatt panel view in Airbus row EXCHANGE rate guarantees to the German arm of Airbus Industrie were suspended at the beginning of this year, EC officials told Gatt's subsidies committee yesterday. But the EC said it could not accept the legal reasoning behind condemnation of the exchange rate scheme by a disputes panel in January. The call by the US for immediate adoption of the committee's report was backed by Japan and Canada. The US brought a complaint to Gatt in early 1991 as part of its wrangle with EC over state support for the four-nation Airbus project. It claims the German exchange-rate scheme led to Dollars 2.5m (Pounds 1.4m) export subsidy for each of 95 aircraft delivered worldwide by Airbus in 1990. Bonn has suspended the scheme for claims after January 15 1992, but it will remain in place until the contract with Deutsche Airbus, now owned by Daimler Benz, is renegotiated. The guarantee mechanism, designed to compensate losses incurred by Deutsche Airbus for a drop in the dollar's value against the D-Mark, was introduced in 1989 to sweeten the privatisation deal involving the merger of Daimler Benz with Messerschmidt-Bolkau-Blohm (MBB). The EC claims the panel's argument is partial as it ignores provisions governing support for the industry in Gatt's civil aircraft code. It denies the exchange rate scheme was an export subsidy, saying it affected only Deutsche Airbus' financial position, not the competitive position of Airbus aircraft in the market. The panel ruled it constituted an export subsidy on deliveries of fuselages from Germany to France, but the EC says trade between EC member states does not constitute an export. The EC is sole signatory to the subsidies code and speaks for all 12 member states in Gatt. The subsidies committee will consider the panel report at its next meeting.</p>

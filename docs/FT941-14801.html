			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Hurd will visit Bosnia as decision nears on presence of British troops Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, confirmed yesterday that he would visit Bosnia on Friday to assess the situation of the British troops serving with the UN protection force. The visit appears to be smoothing the way for a possible decision on a withdrawal of the troops, just five weeks ahead of an informal deadline set by Mr Hurd for such a decision. British officials yesterday stressed that the fact-finding visit, which has replaced a visit to Greece, had come at Mr Hurd's own initiative and had only been surrounded by secrecy for security reasons. The officials denied that a decision had already been taken about the troops, and stressed that a withdrawal would depend on the current peace talks in Geneva. However, pessimism about the prospects for peace prevailed in Geneva after a day of bilateral talks among the heads of the three warring communities and separate meetings with Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators. Without concealing their contempt for their Moslem adversaries, Serb leaders last night said they were close to cementing an alliance with their Croat counterparts. Such a union would amount to a Serb-Croat carve-up of Bosnia, leaving the Moslems without a homeland. They also indicated that they would renege on their promise to surrender land if Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic failed to endorse an agreement on the republic's partition. Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, accused his Moslem foes of wanting 'more war' by posing new demands. In closed-door meetings, the Serbian delegation raised the stakes by threatening to proclaim as permanent the current borders of their self-styled state, which, after 22 months of war, comprises 70 per cent of Bosnia. In a scathing indictment, Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian prime minister, described the partition talks as 'futile', accusing the international community of 'supporting fascist aggression' on Bosnia at the expense of a 'multicultural, multi-ethnic state' The toughened stance, suggesting that they do not take seriously the threats of Nato air strikes against Serbian targets, was agreed at a session of the Serbian 'parliament' on Monday in Bosnia. UN officials said yesterday that Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, had asked Mr Yasushi Akashi, his special envoy in former Yugoslavia, to draft concrete plans to open up the airport in Tuzla, the biggest Bosnian stronghold, in an effort to renew pressure on the Bosnian Serbs. Mr Akashi also said yesterday he had not ruled out the use of air power, as threatened last week at the Nato summit. But a diplomat admitted air strikes were not 'high on the agenda at this time'.</p>

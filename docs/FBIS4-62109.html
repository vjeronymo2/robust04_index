			<p>BFN     [Text] The Latvian army has not conscripted soldiers for  compulsory service since the end of April. The call-up was  suspended due to lack of funds in the budget needed to maintain  and train soldiers. Aleksandrs Doniks, head of the state  service department, told the LABRIT newspaper that the call-up  has been suspended until the number of soldiers on compulsory  service falls and there is enough money to maintain them.    According to estimates made by the Defense Ministry at the  beginning of this year, the maintenance of a soldier for the  duration of his service costs approximately 1,050 lats,  excluding the funds needed to buy machinery, arms, and  ammunition. If the call-up is suspended for a longer time, then  toward the fall there will be a shortage of about 750 soldiers  on the border.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Boris Saltykov (prepared for publication by </F> Vladimir Khrustov); ``Approaches Change, Priorities Remain:  Boris Saltykov, RF Minister of Science and Technical Policy, on  Priorities in State Scientific and Technical Policy'']    [Text] In the present day socio-economic situation we have  been forced to lay aside our former approaches when research was  carried out on a broad front in all directions of world science.  Today, due to the shortage of funds, this is impossible.  However, the acute problem arises, under conditions of economic  decline, of preserving the best part of the scientific and  technical potential of Russia and at the same time adapting it  to the requirements of a market economy. Accordingly, the  priorities in the development of science and technology are  clearly defined. First and foremost among these are production  technologies and new materials, information science and  communications, power engineering and transportation, biology,  ecology, and space.    We are seemingly implementing the priority policy at three  levels. The first is state scientific and technical programs.  Forty-one such programs have been drawn up and implemented,  within whose framework 117 priority technologies and new types  of production will be introduced.    In addition, priorities have been defined among scientific  institutions. These are what we today call state scientific  centers. This is the second level.    After the entire old (ministerial) control system had  collapsed, the branch scientific research institutes found  themselves in a most difficult situation, especially those in  the defense sector. The danger appeared of their complete loss  due to the fact that the ordinary sources of funding had  disappeared.    Today 33 state scientific centers are therefore being  funded,  these including 55 organizations and enterprises, which is  making it possible to preserve key national scientific schools  in the high technologies field. These include the group of  aviation centers headed by the Central Aerohydrodynamics  Institute, five nuclear groups headed by the Kurchatov  Institute, shipbuilding, electronics, chemical, and other groups.    Finally, there are priorities at the level of small research  bodies and laboratories, which, in academic science, for  example, has been realized through the Fundamental Research  Fund, already established in 1992. Reference is to the  development of new organizational forms of innovative activity:  business incubators, industrial parks, etc. For this purpose a  special decree of the government has established a fund which is  designated for support of small entrepreneurship in the  scientific and technical field, also including the financial  field. Most importantly--promising projects with a heavy  scientific orientation have been initiated.    However, the situation in the scientific and technical  sphere  is deteriorating. Science, as before, is being funded on the  residual principal: during 1993 the funding of civilian  scientific research and experimental-design work was only  72.9%  of the planned annual amount; scientific organizations thus did  not receive about 300 billion rubles.    It is true that in the ``scientific budget'' proper there  are  some interesting ``internal'' peculiarities. To be sure,  everyone has suffered. But they have lacked to an unequal  degree. The academic-university sector received approximately  82% of the planned sums and the Russian Academy of  Sciences a  little more than 84% and its departments also received  different percentages: Far Eastern--88%, Ural--81%.  Incidentally, here there is some confusion which sometimes  bursts onto the pages of newspapers: why does the Ministry of  Science and Technical Policy not give the Academy of Sciences  money? The fact is that the Russian Academy of Sciences (and  also the Academies of Medical or Agricultural Sciences) has its  own item in the federal budget and receives money independently.    What is true is that the Ministry of Science and Technical  Policy is funding only priority scientific and technical fields.  The most important of these are state scientific and technical  programs, international and regional projects. We also have a  program for assistance to the innovative sphere: business  incubators, commercial and industrial insurance policies,  industrial parks, of which there already are about 30. This  program today is being separated off into a separate program and  we have succeeded in creating (as I have said, a government  decree has already been issued) a special individual fund which  will support this program, assist inventors and new structures  to get on their feet and to turn projects into realities.  However, our ministry has received only 59% of the planned  funding.    Who are the favorites? The space program: it has been  allocated 148% of that planned by the budget. I do not  regard  such a situation to be entirely normal. Unfortunately, it is now  not impossible that space also will soon experience the negative  consequences of such a policy. Because if we no not develop  electronics, chemistry, and new construction materials which are  ``stagnating'' under other programs, after 3-5 years we will  exhaust the substantial advances which today are working for the  space program. Accordingly, corrections are unquestionably  necessary here.    Such disproportions cannot but be reflected in the fates of  scientists and specialists. The trend of a continuous reduction  in the scientific work force, beginning in 1991, also is  persisting in 1993, and at rates outpacing the numbers in the  economy. The prestige of scientific work has fallen. Including  because of the low wages, which in November 1993 were 38%  below  the average for the economy. The percentage of university  graduates linking their career to scientific work is declining.  Thus, not only the personnel potential of Russian science is  decreasing, but also the possibilities of its reproduction. The  ``brain drain'' problem has grown appreciably worse.    As indicated by the beginning of the year, the situation not  only is not improving, but instead is worsening. And this is  related to a considerable degree to energy prices. After they  had ``retreated'' in the autumn, they rose sharply and by the  end of the year many scientific centers had suffered seriously.  For example, the High-Energy Physics Institute at Protvino,  where the accelerator for just one session (and that for 2-3  weeks) requires so much power that the bill is in the billions.  There are a great many other power-hungry enterprises,  especially those in the chemical industry.    In general, the situation is as follows: whereas earlier the  expenditures for power were 7-10% of the budget, at a  number of  institutes they have now risen to 60% or more. Since no  improvements are foreseen here, we have raised the question of a  reduction of electric power rates for budgeted organizations. As  well as on the indexing of expenditures on goods and materials.  Because today the situation has taken on a near-catastrophic  character: we pay little more than a meager wage, we light and  heat facilities, and that's it. There is no money for carrying  out scientific research (instruments, equipment, reagents, etc.).    Meanwhile January-February showed: from the Ministry of  Finance we received from 27 to 40% of the planned amount.  The  situation with funding, I repeat, not only has not stabilized,  but also continues to deteriorate.    However, despite the difficult situation in the country, the  scientific and technical potential of Russia remains extremely  strong. Many of our country's research and development projects  are not simply competitive in the West, but sometimes are above  and beyond the world level. Russia retains parity in such fields  as power engineering, new materials, chemical technologies,  genetics, and others.    It is a shame that the existing achievements are being put  to  practical use slowly. For example, up to 30-40% of the  development work of scientific organizations in the agricultural  field are finding no application at all in production and the  genetic potential of varieties and hybrids of agricultural crops  and breeds of animals is being used no more than 60%.    And what do we see as our principal goals in the immediate  future? An individual item was introduced in the budget for a  program for maintaining the largest national  instruments--telescopes, experimental reactors, etc. This  ``forces'' institutes to use this expensive equipment for its  intended purpose.    We intend to shift the emphasis from the macro- to the  micro-level. Several funds have been established for broadening  the possibilities of choosing funding sources for scientific  institutions and scientific workers. Today we are convinced that  the principal problem is the micro-level: it is necessary to  decide what to do within a scientific institution under the  prevailing conditions.    One of the methods for implementing the priorities is a  changeover to a contract hiring system. The principal obstacle  is the archaic and conservative Labor Law Code. But meanwhile  precisely a contract will make it possible to pay people for  their work, not for the job which they fill.    The second acute problem: what in general to do with the  network of scientific institutions? Today there is a clear-cut  answer: categorically refuse to support from the budget those  scientific structures, those scientific organizations which are  unneeded by the state. The state must support fundamental  science, which, incidentally, is by no means the case in all  countries. It developed in Russia, it is our national tradition,  it must be preserved, and we are doing everything possible for  this. We will be able to maintain activity in a number of  fund-hungry fields only, as we say, in a ``monitoring mode.''  This is necessary in order to keep an eye on the world level,  and if, speaking figuratively, a ``supernova'' flares up, if  some promising research field takes form, we can immediately  jump in on its development, there could be ``nuclei'' on the  basis of which new creative teams could be organized. But we  acknowledge that the maintenance of all fields at the state  level is today unrealistic.    We also will insist on such an aspect as keeping in contact  with industry. We will develop a program for state scientific  centers. Today, as I already mentioned, we are funding 33, and  another 217 are standing ``in line.'' Some of them are entirely  worthy of support, but we cannot include in this pool more than  a score of new centers. We also will strive to establish a State  Fund for Research in the Humanities.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F> Hayim Zissowitz; place not given -- live]    [Text] [Zissowitz] Will Israel be ready to accede in any  manner whatsoever to one or several of the demands raised  yesterday by Yasir 'Arafat in order to persuade him to return to  the negotiations table?    [Peres] Look, I think the best way to conduct negotiations  is not by constantly acceding to demands but rather by sitting  down together to examine ideas. The problem is not whether to  accept the PLO demands. The problem is the degree to which the  PLO's proposals are effective. For example, even had an  multinational force been stationed in Hebron, it is doubtful  that it would have been capable of preventing the catastrophe  that took place. Therefore, one has to search for ways to  prevent the recurrence of such events.    [Zissowitz] Such as the outlawing of the Kakh and Kahana Hay  movements, for example?    [Peres] That definitely constitutes one measure, but it is  not the only one. We are taking the entire issue very  seriously, without any connection to the PLO's demands.    [Zissowitz] Sir, keeping that in mind, are you disappointed  that the PLO has failed to respond to Israel's recent steps,  even after these movements have been banned and their most  radical activists disarmed and interrogated by the police?    [Peres] Look, the word disappointment does not appear in my  dictionary. I will be very sorry if the Palestinians continue  to put off the resumption of the negotiations, considering that  they are pressuring us to meet the timetable, especially with  regard to wrapping up the negotiations; however, as the Greek  saying goes: No one can tell you how long it takes to walk to  town if they do not know when you started or how fast you are  walking.    [Zissowitz] I understand that the steps recently taken by  the government, such as outlawing these movements and  interrogating their leaders, were designed to placate Yasir  'Arafat and....    [Peres, interrupting] No. These steps were taken to  preclude the recurrence of such catastrophes. We are not  engaged in placating anyone. We are dealing with  practicalities. We would have taken these steps even if we were  not negotiating with 'Arafat. This makes no real difference.  These are practical issues, and in this case, I believe it is  in the interests of everyone, both Jews and Arabs, that people  do not shoot worshipers in the back, be they Jewish or Muslim.    [Zissowitz] Mr. Peres, do the disappointing results of  yesterday's meetings in Tunis mean that the talks will stop or  will the dialogue continue on other tracks?    [Peres] I do not think that the dialogue has been broken  off. Look, people are a bit confused about the negotiations.  Let me explain what is being discussed with regard to each  party. With the United States, the PLO is mainly negotiating  about the impending Security Council resolution. The United  States has a problem. It has promised not to change the status  quo with regard to Jerusalem. Moreover, the autonomy agreement  stipulates that Jerusalem remains outside of its framework. On  the other hand, the United States does not want to torpedo the  Security Council's resolutions. The Americans say they are  prepared to either support the proposed resolution or abstain on  condition that the PLO returns to the talks. In other words,  the negotiations between the PLO and the United States center  around the Security Council. Personally speaking, I believe  that the PLO is giving too much importance to the Security  Council resolutions. We have seen that Security Council  resolutions have not changed the situation in Bosnia or Angola,  Somalia, or here. That is one thing.    Now, the PLO and Israel are discussing three separate  issues.  First is the conclusion of the negotiations on the Gaza Strip  and Jericho. We have concluded most of them, and we still need  a little bit of time to wrap up the remaining details.    [Zissowitz] Will we meet the schedule?    [Peres] Look, it depends when we start. Two weeks have  already been wasted. That is what I am saying.    [Zissowitz] Is there still a possibility of completing the  IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] redeployment by mid-April?    [Peres] That possibility is gradually slipping away because  Pesach is almost here. Let us assume that we start negotiating  next week. We would only have a very short week, because the  Pesach holiday starts in the middle. There are also Muslim  holidays. So if we do not start work very soon, more time will  be wasted. Israel is telling the Palestinians that the best and  most impressive thing that can happen between our two peoples is  to transform the mountains of agreements and declarations into a  new reality. Constantly making additional declarations will not  help. I am convinced that the moment the Palestinians start  managing their own affairs, everyone will see a real change in  the situation with regard to both Arabs and Jews.    [Zissowitz] Do you feel that Yasir 'Arafat is trying to  exploit the aftermath of the Hebron massacre in order to try to  extort concessions from Israel that we had rejected earlier in  Oslo?    [Peres] I do not like such expressions, which are more  suitable for newspaper headlines. I must use more moderate  language. In order to complete the picture, I would merely like  to add that there is a third issue: What should be done in the  wake of the Hebron massacre? We are not denying that the Hebron  massacre brought home the conclusion on the need to take steps.  These measures, however, must be logical, effective, and within  the framework of our capabilities -- and I am also talking about  legal constraints, as we cannot just take arbitrary steps.  Therefore, we are asking the Palestinians to sit down together  with us in order to discuss the agreement on the Gaza Strip and  Jericho, as well as the aftermath of the Hebron massacre. Let  us have an open exchange of views. One cannot negotiate by fax  or in separate meetings.    [Zissowitz] Mr. Foreign Minister, with your permission, I  would like to ask you one more small question. After the  massacre, Furayh Abu-Middayn, one of the senior PLO officials in  the Gaza Strip, was quoted by TIME magazine as saying that if  the Palestinian police had been operating at the time of the  massacre, the Palestinians would have entered the settlements  and killed at least 100 people. We will not sit quietly, he  said.    [Peres] That is a thuggish statement of which there is no  shortage in the Middle East.    [Zissowitz] But he is considered one of the most moderate of  the PLO leaders.    [Peres] I am not talking about the man but about the  statement he made. That kind of language is intolerable, and if  anyone tries to carry out such actions, he will encounter all  the necessary resistance. I suggest that we quote people a bit  less. The history of the Middle East is so full of words and so  void of actions. Everyone is constantly quoting somebody else.  A lot of people in our region tend to go off at the mouth, but  they are not the ones who decide things. We need less talk and  declarations and more actions to change the reality on the  ground.    [Zissowitz] Thank you, Foreign Minister Peres.    [In a report on an interview on Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in  English at 0500 GMT on 15 March, correspondent David Ze'ev  reports that Foreign Minister Peres said "he believes Prime  Minister Rabin's meeting with President Clinton in Washington  will be a push in the right direction with the peace talks" and  that "while no agreement was reached in consultations between  Israeli officials and PLO leaders in Tunis, the fact that they  took place at all is a positive sign."]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 23 Jun (EFE) -- The Haitian "de  facto" government announced today that it will restrict the  movement of journalists within the country's interior as part of  the state of emergency declared more than a week ago.    An Information Ministry communique released today indicates  that media representatives will have to obtain special  authorization to move outside Port-au-Prince. With this  decision, the "de facto" government led by Judge Emile  Jonassaint is attempting to limit the movement of journalists in  Haiti.    On 17 June, the Information Ministry disclosed a decree in  which it bans the presence of unauthorized people at military  installations, on the coasts, along the border with the  Dominican Republic, and other "strategic areas."    The "de facto" government also urged the owners of hotels  nationwide to inform the police within a 24-hour period of the  identity of foreigners staying at their facilities in order to  maintain a record of new arrivals to the country in light of a  possible foreign invasion.    The Haitian People Armed Revolutionary Front -- known as the  Front for Haiti's Advance and Progress until 21 June --  suspended the general strike called for tomorrow. The strike  was called to protest U.S. policy toward Haiti.</p>

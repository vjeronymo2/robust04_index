			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Mineyev] </F>   [Text] Brussels June 17 TASS -- Russia's Minister of  Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev will sign the framework document  of the Partnership for Peace programme in NATO's headquarters in  Brussels on June 22, an official spokesman for the North  Atlantic Treaty Organisation announced today.    Sources in NATO headquarters and the Russian Embassy told  ITAR- TASS that negotiations will be held here on Saturday  between the NATO chief's political adviser Gebhardt von Moltke  and Russian officials to specify the programme of the Russian  foreign minister's visit.    On Wednesday, the North Atlantic Council called on Russia to  hold a discussion of its relations with the alliance in  pursuance of the accords reached at the meeting of the NATO  foreign ministers and their East European partners in Istanbul  on June 9 and 10.    At the Istanbul conference, the North Atlantic alliance  welcomed Russia's intention to join without any preconditions  the programme of cooperation for East European and former Soviet  countries proposed by the leaders of the NATO member-countries  in January. The NATO ministers at the same time agreed to "a  broader dialogue" with Russia with due account of its size and  weight in international affairs and its nuclear status.    Over the past six months, the question about Russia's  special  relationship with NATO was in the centre of talks about Moscow's  membership of this programme which provides for cooperation in  military planning and training, joint exercises and interaction  in peacekeeping and rescue operations.    Russia proposed a formal announcement of its special status  and asked for NATO's pledge to hold mandatory consultations with  Russia before making important political decisions. The  alliance which recognizes Russia's role, sought to put a deeper  dialogue with Moscow on "a more informal basis."    As concerns the framework agreement, Brussels position is  firm: it is one and the same for all partners and gives all of  them equal access to cooperation with the alliance.    The framework agreement will be signed by Russia in the same  form as it was signed by 20 partner-countries, including states  of the former Warsaw treaty and the former Soviet Union,  ITAR-TASS learned in NATO headquarters.    It is possible that two other documents will be agreed,  although it is not yet clear what name the first one will be  given: it may be a statement, a declaration or a protocol of the  meeting between the Russian minister and members of the North  Atlantic Council. NATO expects Russia to put on the table a  presentation document which contains proposals for cooperation  and is submitted by every partner.    Andrey Kozyrev is due to meet first of all NATO Deputy  Secretary- General Sergio Balanzino (Secretary-General Manfred  Woerner is away for treatment). He will then attend a meeting  of the North Atlantic Council to sign the framework agreement.  NATO sources did not rule out the possibility of changes to the  habitual procedure. One of them is that the council meeting  will be attended not only by permanent envoys but also by U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher and probably some other  foreign ministers who will arrive in Brussels for the occasion.    A day before the signing, Andrey Kozyrev is due to hold a  meeting with Warren Christopher to discuss key international  issues, including the tension on the Korean peninsula.</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Auditors censure Brussels over financial weakness and waste The Court of Auditors of the European Union attacked the European Commission yesterday for its poor financial management, weakness in tackling fraud and obstruction of efforts to track down waste. Mr Andre Middlehoek, president of the Court of Auditors, identified 'numerous administrative and control weaknesses' in Brussels and among member states in spending on regional aid and farm subsidies. He told a meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels that the Commission would like to pretend that the problems reported were no more than isolated 'accidents' which the Court had extrapolated in an 'irresponsible' way. 'The contrary is true,' Mr Middlehoek said. The Court's report on the 1992 Ecu68bn (Pounds 51bn) EU budget calculated that some Ecu170m had been wasted in irregular outlays and lost receipts. But only 7 per cent of the amount deemed recoverable had been clawed back, Mr Middlehoek said. The UK, the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany are pressing for tougher action against fraud and tighter controls on spending. Britain will tomorrow propose that member states make fraud against the EU budget punishable in the same terms as fraud against a national budget. The Commission will respond this week with measures to combat fraud, including a blacklist of companies and individuals found violating EU rules. Mr Peter Schmidhuber, the EU budget commissioner, will also press for extra staff and closer co-operation with national police and customs forces. The Luxembourg-based Court of Auditors has assumed a higher profile following the Maastricht treaty, which urges EU institutions to co-operate more closely to save money and stop waste. Mr Middlehoek criticised the practice which gives the Commission a right of reply to comments in the Court's annual report. It was disturbing that the Commission 'seems to consider that it should always have the last word, even with regard to those conclusions of the Court which can only be finalised in the light of the Commission's replies to the Court's comments'. He added that the Court's staff had difficulty verifying the Commission's internal audit because of 'restrictions placed by certain services of the Commission', including access to the main computer system.</p>

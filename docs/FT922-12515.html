			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Government Bonds: ERM rumour gives short-lived boost to gilts SPECULATION that sterling and the peseta were about to be brought into the narrow band of the Exchange Rate Mechanism gave a temporary lift to the UK and Spanish government bond markets yesterday. However, both rumours had been largely rejected by markets by the end of the day. For gilts, the rumour helped give a further lift after the seven-point rally of the past week. Much of the increase has been fuelled by foreign investors, and it was these investors who were again reported to be buying on speculation about a move to the narrow band. While many in the market now expect such a move to be on the horizon, few expect it imminently. A more likely time, suggested one analyst, would be after the UK takes up the presidency of the European Community, when it would have a more powerful political impact. A rise in gilt prices on the back of the rumour was largely reversed later. The benchmark 9.75 per cent gilt maturing 2002 closed at 104 9/32 on the day, compared with 104 5/32 on Tuesday, shaving a fraction more off the yield to take it to 9.1 per cent. The 9 per cent gilt maturing 2011 closed up at 100 1/16 . In a moderately busy day on Liffe, with 30,000 long gilt futures contracts traded, prices moved in a narrow range, closing at 99 9/32 , down from the opening of 99 3/8 . SPANISH government bonds had reached the end of their recent strong run before yesterday's rumour helped prices to a partial recovery of around 10 basis points. Yields on 10-year Spanish bonds had fallen from 10.92 per cent to 10.81, cutting the spread over German bunds back to under 3 per cent. This recovery has been helped in part by favourable inflation data - showing a 0.4 per cent rise in consumer prices in March - published earlier this week. The figure apparently had not been leaked to the bond market in advance, unlike inflation data in recent months. THE GERMAN government bond market drifted towards the long Easter break with few signs that traders were willing to take positions ahead of the holiday. Bund futures on Liffe traded in a narrow range of 88.06-88.21 as the market marked time, awaiting developments in the two areas most likely to give an immediate direction to prices: the political situation in Russia, and the outcome of the public sector pay dispute. FRENCH government bonds marked time with the German market, though there was reported to be some buying of five-year bonds at the expense of longer-dated issues. By the end of the day, five-year BTANs showed a yield of 8.78 per cent, compared with a yield on the benchmark 8.5 per cent OAT due 2002 of 8.62 per cent, pointing to a slight flattening of the yield curve. That left 10-year OATs at around their highest against German bunds for some time, with a spread of some 74 basis points. Most in the market have been expecting a narrowing of the yield spread since the appointment of Mr Pierre Beregovoy as prime minister last month. US TREASURY prices eased slightly across the board in quiet trading dominated by technical manoeuvring. By late afternoon, the benchmark 30-year government issue was down 3/32 at 101 13/16 , yielding 7.870 per cent. The two-year note was also slightly weaker, down Dollars  3/32 at 101 1/32 , yielding 5.170 per cent. The absence of trading on the flood-hit Chicago Board of Trade futures market again hampered the Treasuries market, although dealers were able to do some futures trading through London. The day's only economic news - a 0.2 per cent rise in March industrial production and flat February business inventories - were in line with expectations and had no impact on sentiment. That left trading to be dominated by profit-takers and dealers testing the market's downside. The Federal Reserve arranged overnight system repurchase agreements with Fed funds trading firm at 4 1/8 per cent. The intervention was meant to bring the rate down to its new target of 3 3/4 per cent. By midday, Fed funds had eased to Dollars 3 7/8 per cent. A BOUNCE in the Japanese equity market and a firm yen gave some support to the nervous Japanese government bond market. However, after the share price volatility of recent days, few gained much confidence from the news. Official data also gave some support to the market, with confirmation of a 0.1 per cent decline in industrial production in February (the previous estimate had been a decline of 0.6 per cent). The benchmark bond No 129 closed unchanged on a yield of 5.46 per cent, having traded in a narrow range.</p>

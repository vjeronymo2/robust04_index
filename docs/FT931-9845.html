			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Disposals planned by Metallgesellschaft METALLGESELLSCHAFT, the Frankfurt mining and industrial conglomerate which has in recent years been one of Germany's most acquisitive companies, is now planning large-scale disposals. Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, chief executive, told analysts yesterday the group plans to make disposals to raise around DM1bn (Dollars 606m) over the next two years. Capital investment is to be reduced by 40 per cent to DM1bn for the current year. He gave no indication of which companies were for sale, apart from saying they would be non-core businesses and would not include any famous names. This rules out Buderus - the heating products company which now has a separate listing on the German stock-market - or any of the other industrial companies acquired last year from Stora of Sweden in a DM1.45bn acquisition. A list of potential sales targets has been drawn up, but a final decision on which of the group's 258 subsidiaries are to be sold has yet to be taken. Mr Schimmelbusch indicated that the group would be reducing the workforce - which rose through acquisitions from 38,173 to 62,547 over 1991-92 - during the the course of the year. But he gave no details of how many jobs would be cut and in which divisions. The disposals programme is a reaction to difficult market conditions for the group. In the year to the end of September, group pre-tax profits fell 23 per cent to DM245m - the second successive year that profits have declined sharply.</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Observer: Union banker A hint of uncertainty hangs over the next clutch of appointments at the Bank of England. The Court of Governors has three vacancies, following the expiry of the terms of Warburg's Sir David Scholey, Sir Adrian Cadbury, and Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEEU engineering union. Sir Adrian says he's had enough after 24 years; Sir David has just been made a governor of the BBC, so probably won't mind if he's not reappointed. But the trade union lobby is getting itself in a tizzy about who will replace Laird. Since the Bank was nationalised in 1946, it's been a convention to have a trade union leader as a non-executive director. Laird was appointed in 1986 by Margaret Thatcher, no less. Given the TUC's efforts to enter the modern world, surely the government will not refuse it a job for one of its boys?</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputies of the Croatian Democratic Union [HDZ] from  both chambers of the Croatian Assembly held a session of their  club today. These are excerpts of a statement containing the  reaction of the HDZ deputies to a letter sent by Josip Manolic  and Stipe Mesic, the presidents of the Assembly's chambers of  counties and deputies, to the U.S. Congress on 4 May this year.    The HDZ deputies say that this is an unprecedented act in  Croatian political history and they therefore unanimously  condemn such an unheard-of act. Abusing and usurping their  official posts of president of the Croatian Assembly and  president of the Chamber of Counties, Stipe Mesic and Josip  Manolic, without any consent of the assembly, of their own  accord sent the above-mentioned letter to members of the U.S.  Congress, monstrously slandering their own state institutions in  which they were duty-bound to protect the Constitution and laws.    In their condemnation, they go so far as to equate the  heroic  struggle of defense and liberation by the Croatian people for  freedom and independence with the imperialistic, fascist,  chetnik, aggressive regime of the greater Serbia of Slobodan  Milosevic. By this they even want to suggest that the top  Croatian officials should be charged with instigating the  aggression.    Despite huge efforts and the successes of the Croatian  president and the Croatian Government and assembly in the  implementation of the Washington agreement, the creation of the  federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the historic agreement  between the Croats and the Muslims, Manolic and Mesic  fraudulently and completely unfoundedly condemn the entire  Croatian authorities and state policy of undermining the  Washington agreement, and call on the United States to overturn  the legitimate Croatian Government and replace it with another  government, which would not be an expression of the political  will of the Croatian Assembly.    The HDZ deputies in the assembly's Chambers of Deputies and  Counties most vehemently condemn the defamation, lies,  intrigues, and insinuations by Manolic and Mesic, which may have  far-reaching and destructive consequences for the survival of  the Croatian state and the freedom of the Croatian people.</p>

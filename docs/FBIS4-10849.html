			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 15 Apr (NA) -- Lieutenant General  Mario Candido Diaz, the Armed Forces Joint General Staff [EMC]  chief, stressed today that Chile "has a slight military  supremacy over Argentina" at the military level, although this  "does not represent any problem" because "a small imbalance is  compensated for by good understanding and good relations."    The EMC chief described military relations with Chile as  "superb" and emphasized: "They have been enhanced during the  past few years thanks to bilateral contacts between politicians  from the two countries."    In remarks to NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS news agency, Diaz  emphasized the visit that Vice Admiral Patricio Arancibia Reyes,  the Chilean national defense chief of staff, will pay to  Argentina on 18 April.    The goal of Arancibia Reyes' visit is to enhance the mutual  cooperation system existing between the two countries to face  possible natural disasters in border areas. Therefore,  Arancibia Reyes will hold various meetings with local military  leaders.    Hinting at the tension over border disputes that had been  marking bilateral relations for many years, Diaz said:  "Fortunately, the distrust with which we have been living for a  long time has disappeared."    Concerning the military side of bilateral relations, Diaz  pointed out: "There is a total closeness [acercamiento] that  has been enhanced with constant cooperation between the forces."  He added that this mutual assistance "has allowed officers from  the two nations to take refresher courses."    Diaz admitted that Chile "has a slight supremacy over  Argentina at the military level."    Diaz said this point "does not represent any problem"  because  "a small imbalance is compensated for by good understanding and  good relations."    The EMC chief emphasized that for the cooperation tasks that  will be discussed during the meetings with the Chilean military  officer, "Argentina will contribute with all the experience it  has gained during the peace missions carried out throughout the  world within the UN framework."    In this regard, Diaz added that the Argentine Armed Forces  "have gained worldwide prestige thanks to these missions in  which their high level of professional training was demonstr?ed."    Diaz later emphashat in the entire South American region  there is a "total balance of forces," for which reason "peace in  the area is guaranteed and a possible crisis is not being hinted  at."    In this regard, Diaz stressed that relations with all the  [South American] countries "are very good," especially with  Brazil, Peru, Colombia, and Venezuela, with all of them the  exchange of know-how has been increased.    Diaz said Mercosur [Common Market of the South]'s formation  "has revitalized joint actions by the armies" of the countries  forming it.    The general also explained that military relations with the  United States "will be enhanced this year within the assistance  program" and announced that Argentina "will receive 14  helicopters that will be assigned to the Army."    Diaz added: "We also have scheduled a visit this year by  General McCaffrey, the commander of the U.S. Southern Command  headquartered in Panama; and a meeting with General John  Shalikashvili, the U.S. Armed Forces joint chief of staff."    Diaz later ruled out the possibility of joining NATO because  this organization does not accept the participation of countries  far from the Northern Hemisphere. Nevertheless, he guaranteed  that Argentina would receive communications and military  doctrine technology.    In conclusion, the EMC chief discussed the exercises that  will be carried out this year to face the situations arising  from natural disasters like floods, fires, and earthquakes.    In this regard, Diaz, who is responsible for these  exercises,  pointed out that in this field, "a large-scale specific exercise  will be carried out with the participation of the three  branches, an exercise that will be prepared by the 5th Army  Corps, headquartered in the city of Bahia Blanca."</p>

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / People: Top teams at PW and Ernst &amp; Young Howard Hughes (left) plans to help stitch Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, into a 'seamless' international practice in his new role as world managing partner. Hughes, 54, is the first incumbent of the position, created at the same time as Sir Jeffery Bowman and Shaun O'Malley, both 57, were appointed joint chairmen of PW World Firm. Hughes was managing partner of PW in the UK during the second half of the 1980s, joint managing partner of PW in Europe from 1989-91 and then deputy chairman there from 1991-92. Sir Jeffery and O'Malley were joint chief executive officers of PW world organisation for the past two years. They will now concentrate on supporting Hughes in his new management role. Hughes told his partners this week that his role is to develop PW's worldwide objectives and further develop its international network. 'We must maintain and strengthen the co-operative efforts across firm and industry lines to provide clients with a truly seamless service,' he says. Meanwhile, at Ernst &amp; Young a new team has moved into the top jobs as their mentor departs the UK for responsibilities in Europe. Harold Cottam, 54, who was responsible for bringing in a youthful management team in the early 1980s, is stepping aside as managing partner to take charge of building the firm's pan-European consulting business. Elwyn Eilledge has been re-elected as senior partner for a second three-year term, and has announced a new team, mostly in their mid to late 40s, moving up one place from their previous jobs. The new UK managing partner - who takes charge of day-to-day administration within the firm - is Nick Land (right), formerly managing partner of the London office. Michael Boyd, former head of the audit practice and energy and natural resources group, becomes London office managing partner in his place. Land says: 'The marketplace is pretty murderous and the profession is not entirely flavour of the month. But we are internally in a strong position to meet these challenges. Operationally we are in good shape. We can say the merger (of Ernst &amp; Whinney with Arthur Young) is truly behind us.' The firm has no great ambition to be the largest in the UK, he says, but wants to focus at the top end of the market. He will be placing particular emphasis on developing the tax and management consulting practice areas. ***** Peter Kingston, ENTERPRISE OIL's managing director (technical), has resigned from the board in order to set up his own management consultancy. Kingston, 49, a petroleum engineer who first made his mark in Shell UK's North Sea development, was a consultant before joining Enterprise in 1984. He will continue to work for Enterprise as a consultant, with particular emphasis on the further development of Enterprise's business in Italy and Norway. His board responsibilities have been reassigned to Iain Watt as technical director (UK operations) and Edward Harris, technical director (international). ***** N BROWN, the Manchester-based home shopping group which specialises in serving niche markets that few other companies think about, has appointed Martyn Pass as managing director of its Langley House subsidiary. Langley House sells a wierd and wonderful range of products through advertisements in national newspapers. Its diverse products include ladies' fashion wigs, cast-iron garden rocking chairs and mini-size camera clamps. Pass, 42, has worked at N Brown for the past decade but gained his marketing knowledge at GUS, the mother of mail order companies. He then worked at Plumbs Mail Order, a stretch-cover company, before joining N Brown. ***** The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) has appointed two new deputy chairman, in place of Nick Durlacher who was elected chairman of the exchange earlier this year. David Heron and Jack Wigglesworth represent the two different sides of Liffe's business, which is split between equity derivatives and interest rate products. Durlacher says there is 'merit in having a balance between the exchange's equity and interest rate businesses' - represented respectively by Heron and Wigglesworth. Heron, a director of James Capel, was previously on the board of the London Traded Options Market, which merged with Liffe earlier this year, while Jack Wigglesworth, business development director at JP Morgan Futures, has served on the Liffe board since 1982. ***** Ken Scobie, deputy chairman and chief executive of BRENT WALKER, is to take over as chairman of its William Hill subsidiary on the retirement of Lord Kindersley. ***** Joe Goasdoue has been appointed director, quality and corporate affairs at ICL; already director, quality, he takes on the increased responsibility from Aodh O'Dochartaigh who has been appointed director of group communications at BASS. ***** Lawrence Post has been appointed company secretary of WACE GROUP on the retirement of Scott Ritchie. ***** Jeremy Campbell, formerly director of human resources at Rothmans International, has been appointed company secretary and solicitor of EAST MIDLANDS ELECTRICITY on the retirement of Derek Wells. ***** David Carrick, group finance director, has been appointed md of ABI LEISURE GROUP; he succeeds David Eastwood who is to become a non-executive director. Rob Carmichael is promoted to finance director of ABI Caravans. ***** John Neerhout (above), who is on secondment from Bechtel as project chief executive, has been appointed to the board of EUROTUNNEL. ***** Kees Bokmans, previously global business director of ICI Films, has been appointed md of the polymer products division of EVODE. ***** David Jackson, general manager airline services, is now the senior representative of AER LINGUS in Britain. ***** Tony Reid, formerly president and md of Continental Netherlands Oil Company, has been appointed director and general manager, business development, of CONOCO (UK); he replaces Ian Gray who has been appointed president of the Dubai Petroleum Company. ***** John Maples, the former Conservative minister and new chairman of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Government Communications Worldwide, has added another directorship to his portfolio. He has gone back on to the board of SEP Industrial Holdings, the small USM-quoted engineering company, where he had been a director until he was made economic secretary to the Treasury in July 1990. The 49-year-old Maples, who owns 2.89 per cent of SEP's equity, rejoins the company at a low point in its fortunes. When he resigned two years ago it had just reported half-yearly profits of Pounds 1.2m and increased its dividend by 10 per cent. By contrast, in the year to September 1991 the company's profits fell sharply and the dividend was cut, although yesterday it reported a modest recovery in half year profits and raised its dividend again. SEP has also put John Davis, managing director of its UK distribution division, on the board.</p>

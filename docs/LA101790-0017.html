			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Occidental Petroleum Corp.: The Los Angeles-based oil, natural gas and  agribusiness concern posted third-quarter profit of $109 million, about the  same as a year earlier.  </P> <P> Sales totaled $5.4 billion, a gain of 13%. The results were attributed to  improvement in oil and gas, natural gas transmission, agribusiness and coal  operations. The figures also included an after-tax charge of $16 million  associated with the previously announced settlement in the Wyoming Tight Sands  litigation, partially offset by an after-tax gain of $8 million from the sale  of domestic gas properties. A net loss of $2 million was recorded due to the  early retirement of debt, which was partially offset by a federal income tax  benefit.  </P></p>

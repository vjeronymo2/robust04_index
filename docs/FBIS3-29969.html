			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Letter from Wirasak Futrakun, Thai Ambassador to Burma, </F> published in the "Letters" section]    [Text] In the column, "Burma Notes", in your newspaper  published Feb 5, in the section entitled, "Repatriation for  students," it was stated that "The project (to repatriate the  Burmese students) is said to be jointly worked out between  powerful Slorc [State Law and Order Restoration Council] leader  Lt Gen Khin Nyunt and the Thai diplomatic mission in Rangoon."  In this connection, I wish to state categorically that there has  never been any discussions about the Burmese students in  Thailand between H.E. Lt Gen Khin Nyunt and me or any members of  the Thai diplomatic mission in Yangon [Rangoon]. Furthermore,  during the past two years since I have been the Thai Ambassador  to the Union of Myanmar [Burma], no member of the Government of  the Union of Myanmar has ever requested the Thai diplomatic  mission in Yangon to do anything regarding the Myanmar students  in Thailand. 1, therefore, hope that any fantasies of collusion  between the Myanmar Government and the Thai diplomatic mission  in Yangon to repatriate the Myanmar students in Thailand back to  Myanmar will finally be put to rest.    However, I wish to remind the Myanmar students in Thailand  that their continued presence in Thailand has been due to the  humanitarian consideration of the Thai Government. Verbal  attacks against the Thai Government by them will sap the  humanitarian reservoir of Thailand. So will their political  actions in Thailand against the Government of the Union of  Myanmar, of which they may question the legitimacy, but which is  a member of the United Nations and is recognized by the  Government of Thailand: I do hope that the Myanmar students in  Thailand will spend their time as guests here in our country  investing in themselves in acquiring knowledge that will be of  practical use in developing their country when the time comes  for them to decide on their own will to return to their homeland.</p>

Correspondent Cha Man-sun reports from Vienna. [Begin Cha  recording]    (Feriscos,) director of the inspection bureau of the IAEA,  revealed that in a telephone contact, (Yun U-chin), counselor at  the North Korean Embassy in Vienna and the working-level  delegate of the North Korean side, said that he has not received  a reply from Pyongyang to the IAEA's telegram, and therefore,  holding the third working-level contact is difficult this  weekend.    Concerning this, the IAEA inspection-related officials show  that their position is to wait for the North Korean reply by  taking a little more time. But they hope that the third working  contact can be held next week.    Meanwhile, it was learned that the list for checking seven  nuclear facilities which IAEA presented to North Korea on 10  January was prepared based on the Nuclear Safeguards Accord  which became effective on 10 April between the IAEA and North  Korea, and the list calls for compliance with the accord.    Article 74 of this accord stipulates that independent  measurement of nuclear materials, including examination of  diaries of operation of nuclear facilities, and mobilization of  all technological inspection measures, are possible, and Article  75 prescribed that North Korea must cooperate in extracting  additional (?testing) materials.    North Korea accepted overall inspections in 1992 in  compliance with the Nuclear Safeguards Accord. However, North  Korea, which is withholding its withdrawal from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty, shows its position of regarding this  accord as invalid. Therefore, the reply from North Korea will  attract public attention in the future. [end recording]</p>

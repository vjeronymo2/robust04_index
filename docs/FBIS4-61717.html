			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Russian President Boris Yeltsin at a Victory Day </F> rally in Moscow --live]    [Text] Dear veterans, fighters of the Russian Army,  esteemed compatriots, dear Muscovites: Today we are all marking  once again the great Russian festival of the Victory. The  bloodiest, the most destructive war in the history of mankind  ended 49 years ago. It ended with a thunderous Russian shout of  Hurrah which rolled over defeated fascist Germany, over the  liberated countries of Europe, over the whole world.    Probably, 9 May 1945 was the happiest day in the whole of  the  20th century. That happiness was brought to mankind in the  first place by the valiant fighters of the Red Army, which  included Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Kazakhs, Uzbeks,  Georgians, and people of other nationalities who were at one in  defending their homeland.    The whole of mankind bowed its head low as a sign of  immeasurable gratitude to the Soviet, the Russian soldier,  because without him the fate of the world could have turned out  differently.    It was Russia which stopped and turned the brown plague to  dust. And it was Russia, as often in the past, which saved the  world in the 20th century.    We won victory at a very great cost. There is not a family  which did not suffer a bitter loss, and since then it has become  the custom to bow our heads to the memory of those who died in  bloody battles, in bombardments, exchanges of fire, and in  concentration camps. We remember those on the home front who  worked till they dropped.    May you be for ever remembered, and with boundless  gratitude!    Dear Muscovites and guests of our city, as we return to  those  years of the Great Fatherland War, we try to find answers to  today's questions. What was it that helped us endure? What  helped us to defeat that mighty army which was sustained by the  resources of the whole of Europe? I think the most important  thing was a firm belief in victory. Even in 1941, when the foe  was occupying town after town, when Leningrad was blockaded,  when the Baltic states, Belarus, and the greater part of Ukraine  fell, when the foe was approaching Moscow -- we believed and  knew that victory would nevertheless be ours. It was this that  enabled everyone to do the seemingly impossible.    Veterans recall how difficult life was at that harsh time.  But it was at that very time that people found strength of  spirit. A great truth was revealed to us -- man's best  qualities have lost none of their value. Without honesty,  decency, charity, and self- sacrifice, we would not have been  victorious, would not have endured. These qualities are in our  blood, in our character. No tests of endurance can destroy them.    I cannot fail to mention the unity, the breath as one which  helped us overcome all difficulties and deprivations. Today we  know how hard it was to achieve that unity. The roller coaster  of prewar repressions corrupted the life of millions of people,  leaving bitterness and resentment in their hearts. But in the  face of the chief danger, all this faded into the background.    Quite a few emigres -- former enemies of Soviet power --  sided with its defenders in order to save the homeland.    Today we also commemorate the anti-Hitler coalition formed  by  hitherto hostile states. Faced by deadly danger, they abandoned  mutual hatred and took joint action against the common enemy.  The second front, though opened late, did bring closer the end  of the hateful war. It was then that the strategic partnership,  which we are now striving to strengthen, came into being.    We have differences with the West, but there is also a  unique  opportunity to put an end to distrust between each other  forever. The only important thing to remember always is that  Russia must be treated with respect. Our people will never  accept any other language from any state whatsoever. This is  because they will always remember how much blood was shed for  the sake of peace, and because this is the sacred precept of  those who died for our motherland's honor and independence.    One of the most important lessons of the great victory is  that the strength of unity, the strength of accord is  invincible. This is significant for us, particularly today. We  all want our country to become free and flourishing, and the  people's life dignified and prosperous. Surely we can unite  around this main aim?    Today I call upon all those who hold dear the name of the  citizen of the Russian Federation [Rossiyanin], those who hold  dear the glory of the fatherland: let us unite in peace! We  managed to be united in the great war: I believe we can be  united in building civic peace.    The first steps on this road have been taken. Many parties,  movements, unions, and associations joined the Treaty on Social  Accord. Let those who are always displeased grumble and let  instigators shout away. We will continue, because the difficult  path to peace is always better than political squabbling and  war. Let the tears and the grief of mothers in Armenia and  Azerbaijan, in Georgia and Tajikistan, and the bloodshed in  Yugoslavia be a stern warning to those who value political  revenge more than human lives.    By signing the Treaty on Social Accord, we did not and are  not seeking victory. We seek overall peace. We do not regard  as our enemy those who refused to join the Treaty. There are no  quick solutions or simple formulas in the building of a new  Russia. We are prepared to hold a dialogue and on-going  consultations with parties and factions, which is the meaning of  the Treaty on Social Accord.    Esteemed veterans, I know that the beginning of the war has  a  particular place in your memory. We retreated then. We did not  dare look into the eyes of women and old people then. We had to  learn to conquer in action. We mastered this difficult skill,  though not immediately. The people gave its Army the best  weapons in the world, the best equipment in the world, the best  soldiers, and the best military commanders. In the name of the  triumph of justice and as a mark of nation-wide respect and  nation-wide gratitude, a monument to Georgiy Konstantinovich  Zhukov, the great Russian commander and true son of Russia, will  be unveiled in Moscow in exactly a year from now, on 9 May 1995.    A decision was taken today to found a Zhukov order and  medal.  Honor and glory to the great Russian military leader!    The year 1941 was especially difficult and bitter for us.  But 1945 was a year of victory. It is important for Russia  today to remember this during the current transformations. We  began these transformations without the necessary experience,  and at first we were compelled to draw on the practice of other  countries. But now, more than two years on, we have been able  to accumulate our own priceless Russian experience. No other  state has it. You will read about it in any book. Now we will  go further, clearly understanding what needs to be done in  Russia in order to revive its greatness and dignity, and how.    Recent years have been especially difficult for all of us.  Everything could very easily have been wrecked, but we held out.  This is due in no small measure to you, dear veterans, to your  wisdom, courage, and steadfastness, to the fact that you know  the true price of peace and reject hysteria, panic, and cheap  demagogy. I have no doubt that veterans will continue  persistently to defend stability and civil peace in Russia.    Dear friends! Today the splendid central museum of the Great  Patriotic War, built by Muscovites, opens here on Poklonnaya  Gora. Many defenders of the fatherland did not live to see this  day. Many of them could not come here because of old age and  illness. May the memorial complex being built on Poklonnaya  Gora be the general homage of Russia and our people to the  heroes and simple soldiers of the war, to their feat of arms!    Yesterday the victory memorial was blessed by the Russian  Orthodox Church.    Henceforth, this place will become one of the shrines of  Russian history. We failed to keep safe the Church of Christ  the Savior, or the church built to commemorate the faith and  soldierly glory displayed in 1812. But I believe that the fate  of the Victory Memorial will be different, will be better. I  appeal to you, dear veterans, and to your children and  grandchildren, our descendants: let us jointly preserve the  Victory Memorial, let us jointly preserve our shrines!    In exactly one year's time, we will mark the 50th  anniversary  of the great victory. Preparations for this great event start  from today. The coming year will be a year of commemoration, of  making sense of our peacetime and wartime history. This history  includes difficult and bitter pages. We will have to restore  those pages which were mercilessly torn out and record those  which have not yet been fully recorded. It is our duty to put  in order all monuments, all graves of the homeland's defenders.  It is our duty to restore the shining names of those who are  still listed as missing without trace.    But the most important thing is that all of us, all Russian  citizens, should change a little and become more tolerant,  charitable, and wise; it will then be easier to deal with  everything which poisons our lives today. As true sons of the  fatherland, we will be proud of the heroic deeds of our  forbears, draw conclusions from their mistakes, and will  remember that one of the most important lessons of our history  is the lesson of unity. When we are in agreement, we are  strong. When we are together, we are invincible.    Glory to the veterans of the Great Fatherland War! Glory to  the Russian Army! Glory to Russia! Glory to Moscow! Hurrah!</p>

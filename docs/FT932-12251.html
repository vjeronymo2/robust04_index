			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Business Schools (7): Tempo steps into Europe - Cranfield's emphasis is on the practical CRANFIELD is about to change its title from 'institute of technology' to 'university'. It is a sad commentary on the status of vocationally-oriented higher education institutions in Britain that Cranfield finally felt it had to join the crowd. The assumption of university titles by the former polytechnics was the last straw. 'If we could have sold our name like MIT (the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at Boston, in the US), we would have stuck to it,' says Professor Leo Murray, Cranfield School of Management's ebullient director. 'But with every primary school in the country now calling itself a university, people simply don't understand what we are about.' Murray is adamant as to what his school, the largest of Cranfield university-to-be's four centres, is about. 'The practical and applied is our concern: high quality training to produce effective managers - whether on our MBA courses, or in our growing short-course market.' 'Management is an intensely practical subject,' he says, deflecting criticism of the School's mediocre performance in the Universities Funding Council's recent assessment of research quality. 'Our research is unambiguously applied: grand theory really has little or nothing to do with management studies as they should be.' 'The emphasis is, and should be, on practical training for practical problems; and research into issues that will help students and managers to do that.' It is for such practical skills that a steady stream of top executives and upwardly-mobile young managers drive to rural Bedfordshire, or make the 20-minute cab ride from Milton Keynes. Cranfield started life in 1946 as a school of aeronautical engineering - on the site, and in the buildings, of a wartime aerodrome, appropriately enough. Until Sir Norman Foster designed for the school a magnificent steel-and-glass library, which was opened last year, the campus resembled a prisoner-of-war camp; now that the giant hangar-style library is complete and open, it looks as if might house the Royal Flight. Murray does 'not for a moment' doubt that his charge is among the elect of the business school fraternity. He is particularly proud of Cranfield's range of tailored-courses, and of the 'Cranfield 2000' project to keep its MBA up-to-date. For the moment, Cranfield 2,000 means 'breaking down the old baronies' which divide the MBA into hard-and-fast subjects (marketing, finance and so on) and, instead, 'conceiving of it in the context of the company, where the various specialisms inter-connect and overlap.' In everyday terms, this means laying stress on group working and company case studies; and a growing emphasis on international business - together with the skills that go with it, including languages. Like most UK business schools, behind the rhetoric of 'internationalisation' Cranfield is Britannic to the core. Language training apart, Murray's response is not, a la London Business School, to seek to change radically from within, but to forge new partnerships from without. The imminent creation of a Top European Management Programme ('Tempo') is a significant step on the way: a consortium of Cranfield, Group ESC Lyon, Instituto de Empresa in Barcelona and USW Schloss Gracht in Germany, Tempo is intended to enable each of the four to design tailored in-company programmes drawing on the resources and facilities of other members. Cranfield is also working with Groupe ESC Lyon and Koblenz University's Forum Mittelstand to launch a joint European Management programme - 'designed', says the blurb, 'to teach participants to Think European and Act Local.' Numbers on the part- and full-time MBA courses are roughly equal, at between 140 and 160 apiece. The part-time course is not an add-on: equal resources are devoted to it, with special efforts made to strengthen links with sponsoring employers. These include regular 'parents' days' (Cranfield's jargon) when sponsors are invited to spend a day at the school to review progress and discuss suitable project work for the last stage of the course. However, the MBA is playing a declining role in the School's funding. Last year three-quarters of its income came from other sources - not much from the government, which accounted for less than 10 per cent, but mainly from research and contracts (27 per cent) and, most important of all, short courses (37 per cent). In common with other schools, the emphasis is increasingly on company-specific tailored courses. Cranfield's client base now extends well beyond the UK; it takes programmes out to the Community, Scandinavia and the Far East. Murray even has designs on China, 'a more attractive long-term proposition than eastern Europe, which seems to me to be a swamp.' Back home, the public sector is tomorrow's expansion. In 1991 the School of Management merged with the School of Policy Studies, and a range of courses targeted at public sector managers have followed on. The most illustrious recruit is the Bank of England - a contract agreed before last October, Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, might care to note.</p>

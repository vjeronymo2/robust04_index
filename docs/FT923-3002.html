			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Speeding up of ship order sought MR DAVID CLARK, shadow defence secretary, urged the government to bring forward its order for a Pounds 150m helicopter carrier in order to prevent more shipbuilding job losses. The Ministry of Defence has said a decision on who will build the aviation support ship, for which tenders are due on October 1, will not be made until next autumn. But Mr Clark, visiting Swan Hunter on the Tyne, said the government should bring forward the design work so that teams with valuable skills are not broken up. Swan Hunter and VSEL, of Barrow-in-Furness, which are both shedding jobs and are in need of more orders, are both bidding for the vessel.</p>

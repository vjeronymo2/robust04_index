			<p>BFN     [Text] Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic supports the  plans of the International Committee of the Red Cross to  evacuate non-Serb residents of Prijedor in order to protect them  from violence. Human lives are most important, even if that  helps the Serbs in their ethnic cleansing, Silajdzic told  journalists. Around 9,000 Muslims and Croats and 55,000 Serbs  live in Prijedor at the moment.</p>

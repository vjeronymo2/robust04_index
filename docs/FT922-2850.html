			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / International Company News: Dorling Kindersley to seek full SE listing DORLING Kindersley, the international publisher of such best-selling titles as The British Medical Association's Complete Family Health Encyclopedia, is to seek a full listing on the London Stock Exchange this autumn. The proposed flotation, which should capitalise the company at between Pounds 75m and Pounds 100m, is expected to raise in the region of Pounds 30m which the company plans to use to fuel the company's already rapid development. Sales, which four years ago amounted to Pounds 10m, are expected to increase 80 per cent this year to Pounds 71m. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.4m last year are predicted to rise accordingly. Mr Peter Kindersley, the chairman who co-founded Dorling in 1974, said the company's new US publishing operation was also ripe for expan-sion. The US is Dorling's biggest market accounting for 36 per cent of turnover, compared with 27 per cent in the UK. Dorling is also developing a multimedia package with Microsoft which the US computer software group predicts will generate sales of Pounds 1bn a year by the end of the decade. The share issue is being sponsored by Barclays de Zoete Wedd with Cazenove appointed as broker.</p>

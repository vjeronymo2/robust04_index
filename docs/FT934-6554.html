			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Vodafone improves to Pounds 174.5m but warns of downturn Vodafone, the UK mobile communications group, reported interim pre-tax profits up 8.9 per cent from Pounds 160.2m to Pounds 174.5m for the six months to September 30, but warned that high start-up costs for overseas licences were likely to depress profits for the next two years. Mr Gerry Whent, chief executive, also projected additional heavy start-up losses next year should Vodafone win the licence to run the new national lottery in its consortium with Hambro's, Carlton and Associated Newspapers. Mr Whent raised the possibility that in spite of Vodafone's large cash reserves - Pounds 186.3m at September 30 - it might take on a 'relatively small' amount of debt to meet investment obligations next year. Group turnover was up 22 per cent at Pounds 389.8m (Pounds 319.8m), but operating profit fell from 48 per cent of sales to 43 per cent, mainly because of new overseas licences. Through its expansion programme, Vodafone's overseas licences now cover a population equivalent to 42 per cent of its UK base, adjusting for relative income. New networks opened in Greece in July and Australia in October. To achieve its goal of a 50:50 population split between UK and overseas licences, adjusting for income, the company intends to bid next year as part of consortia for new cellular licences expected in Belgium, Italy, France and the Netherlands. Overseas operations incurred net losses of Pounds 13m for the six months, projected to grow to about Pounds 25m over the full year because of start-up costs. Mr Whent anticipated losses of about Pounds 50m next year, with networks in the first year of operation in Germany, South Africa, Fiji and Australia. In 1994-95 overseas investment will for the first time exceed UK investment. With only 4,500 customers between them, Mr Whent said the growth of the company's two new UK digital networks was 'slower than expected'. He denied it was due to the successful launch of Mercury One-2-One's digital service in the London area, attributing it to the poor availability of handsets and the robustness of the existing analogue network. Vodafone achieved 130,000 net new connections to its UK network in the six months, up 130 per cent on last year. Earnings per share rose 8.7 per cent to 11.7p (10.8p). An interim dividend of 4.12p (3.43p) is declared. See Lex</p>

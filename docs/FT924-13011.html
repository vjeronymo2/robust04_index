			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market surges after surprise rate cut THE BANK of England clearly emerged as the winner in the latest game of cat and mouse with the markets. The latter were caught on the wrong foot by the one percentage point reduction in UK base rates, a move which saw share prices race higher before boiling over and closing well below the day's best levels. Nevertheless, the reduction was the trigger for a sharp upward spiral in the stock market, with the Footsie 100 Index ending a turbulent session a net 17.3 higher at 2,563.9. Over the week the Footsie 100 has risen 22.7. The Footsie Mid 250 Index, which made its market debut this week, rose 12 yesterday to 2,385.9, while the Footsie 350, which combines the 100 and 250 indices, edged up 7.9 to 1,231.3. The session began with share prices opening easier, reflecting overnight declines on Wall Street and Tokyo, and ahead of the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) for September. The initial easiness in the market was attributed to ongoing nervousness about the economy, and end-of-account selling. The market began to scent the possibility of a rate cut in the morning, and tended to ignore the worse than expected PSBR which, at Pounds 4.1bn, compared with market forecasts of Pounds 2.5bn to Pounds 3.2bn. The Footsie, down over 10 points at the outset, was 12 points higher at midday, minutes before the Bank of England signalled its willingness to allow a further one point fall in rates. The equity market reacted by surging to a day's high of 2,588, up just over 41 points, within 30 minutes. Thereafter, bouts of profit-taking and a disappointing opening by Wall Street saw the Footsie 100 backtrack to its closing level of 2,563.9. There was genuine relief in the market at the rate cut, but also widespread caution. Mr Richard Kersley, equity market strategist at BZW, explaining the late decline in the market, said; 'the cut is good but the way it was carried out is not good. The key factor is to get overseas investors into the market but it will be hard work with a cloud over the currency.' Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull said; 'Only a madman would not have cut rates. It should have been done earlier in the week and I feel one per cent is too aggressive, a series of smaller steps would have been seen as controlling events.' Long-dated Gilts posted gains of over a point, with short sterling indicating a base-rate of 7 1/2 per cent. Retail, or customer, business in London, fell sharply at the start of the week, but picked up as the market sensed the likelihood of a reduction in UK interest rates.</p>

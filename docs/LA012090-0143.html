			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE;  </P> <P> CITY STUDIES ISSUE OF HOME HEIGHT LIMITS  </P> <P> Responding to concerns of neighbors that they are losing their views, the City  Council voted this week to spend $8,800 on a study of whether legal  restrictions on home heights are needed in some areas.  </P> <P> The complaints stemmed mostly from older neighborhoods, where homeowners are  adding second and third stories to small, single-level houses.  </P> <P> "There are three big, ugly, humongous homes on our street that will take away  our views and our privacy," said Irv Paul, who lives in one of the older  neighborhoods.  </P> <P> Other homeowners said it would not be fair for the city to limit views that  cannot be owned through a property deed.  </P> <P> Frederick Jenner, executive vice president of the South Orange County Board of  Realtors, said home expansion regulations would be unfair because they could  take away the potential for a homeowner to increase his property value.  </P> <P> In a related item, the council voted to require that proposals for home  additions must be accompanied by proof that the plans have been approved by  their respective homeowners' associations.  </P> <P> Using a checklist provided by the city, applicants for home additions will be  on an honor system to produce evidence that their proposed plans meet  homeowners' association standards.

			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Economic forecasts can endanger your wealth IF FORECASTERS cannot predict the future, should they have one? This is a question that business people and ministers are bound to ask themselves. True, forecasters have done well enough when economies perform in line with their long-term trends. But so would simple extrapolation. Forecasting has been breaking down whenever sharp changes come along, which is precisely when accuracy is most needed. Consider the recent performance of that doyen of forecasting institutions, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. As late as June 1990, the OECD forecast US economic growth at 2.3 per cent in 1991 over 1990. This prediction was then cut in every subsequent forecast. Most recently, the economy is estimated to have declined by 0.7 per cent. For OECD Europe, the 1991 error was similar in nature to that for the US, but not as large. Meanwhile, Japan's economy was better behaved than both the US and the European in 1991, but is now making up for its past good behaviour: the December 1990 forecast of 3.8 per cent for economic growth between 1991 and 1992 has already drooped to 1.8 per cent. Further reductions in the forecast are likely. People who wagered their wealth on what the OECD was predicting two years ago have a good chance of being bankrupt today. Not, it should be stressed, that they would have done better by relying on other mainstream forecasters. Like sheep, these have all gathered closer to one another than to the truth. Forecasts published in the International Monetary Fund's World Economic Outlook have been virtual twins of those from the OECD. The British Treasury failed to forecast the boom in the UK economy between 1986-88, the recession that started in late-1990 and its subsequent persistence. Many of those who make their living in the City have followed closely on the Treasury's heels. The Gulf war is one reason that many forecasts for 1991 went awry. But it is only a part of the story. Despite 50 years of practice and huge increases in computer power, the ability of economists to provide precise forecasts, even for the near term, is very much in question. One explanation for persistent failure is change in policy regimes. Capital market liberalisation, for example, makes past behaviour almost irrelevant to the future. Time might remedy this problem, though not if such changes will themselves be a persistent feature of economic life. There is a more fundamental worry. Forecasting assumes that people's responses to past data will be repeated. Suppose, instead, that people's expectations of the future are determined not by past economic data but by far more complex visions of how the world functions. Behaviour then would not repeat itself, because history does not. In response to past forecasting failures, some economists are abandoning economics - the favoured approach being use of a Bayesian Vector-Autoregressive (BVAR) model. Professor Michael Artis of the University of Manchester has followed several US economists in this direction. The name is fancy; the reality less so. Under this approach the computer simply looks for statistical relationships in the data. Even if such methods were to work, however, they would be of no help to policy-makers. They want to know what would happen if the rate of interest were lowered, to take one example. Economists cannot abandon economics completely. What are the lessons? First, forecasters should recognise the imprecision of what they do by putting explicit intervals around all their forecasts; second, they should rely still more on judgment than they already do. Anybody who remembered Irving Fisher's debt-deflation theory of the Great Depression would have had a better understanding of the forces recently driving the main economies than would the orthodox modellers. As with chess at its highest levels, human intuition and experience can still rival the power of the computer. They are likely to do so for a long time.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------      INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: PRODUCTION AND EMPLOYMENT  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Yearly data for retail sales volume and industrial production plus all data for the vacancy rate indicator are in index form with 1985=100. Quarterly and monthly data for retail sales and industrial production show the percentage change over the corresponding period in the previous year, and are positive unless otherwise stated. The unemployment rate is shown as a percentage of the total labour force. Figures for the composite leading indicator are end-period values.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                              UNITED STATES

Includes mining, manufacturing, gas, electricity and water supply industries except Japan (mining and manufacturing only) and UK (also includes construction industries). Unemployment rate: OECD standardised rate which adjusts as far as possible for the different definitions of unemployment used in official sources. Vacancy rate indicator: relevant vacancy measure divided by total civilian employment, expressed in index form. Derived from OECD series. US - help-wanted advertising, Japan - new vacancies, Germany and France - all jobs vacant, Italy - no data available, UK - unfilled vacancies. Composite leading indicator: OECD data. Each is a combination of series, cyclical fluctuations which usually precede cyclical fluctuations in general economic activity.</p>

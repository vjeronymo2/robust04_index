			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Norwegians plan German gas pipe investment Norwegian oil and natural gas producers Statoil and Norsk Hydro yesterday announced they would invest in a natural gas pipeline in Germany. The agreement, signed with Germany's Ruhrgas, the biggest German gas importer, and BEB, Germany's biggest producer of gas, establishes a new company, Netra. Netra will complete and operate a large-diameter pipeline requiring a total investment of more than DM1bn (Dollars 650m). The agreement comes just two weeks after completion of a competitive pipeline transmission system, jointly owned by Gasprom of Russia and Wintershall of Germany, and intensifies the battle between Norway and Russia over new European gas supplies. Netra will build a 290km pipeline between Etzel, near Wilhelmshaven in Germany, and Salzwedel on Germany's former east-west border. The Etzel facility is supplied via Emden, Germany, from the natural gas fields in the Norwegian North Sea. It will link up with the gas pipeline from Salzwedel to Bernau, north of Berlin, being built by Ruhrgas and Verbundnetz (VNG) and will be connected to the VNG pipeline network as well, allowing it to be used for Norwegian gas volumes contracted by VNG in 1993. Between 70 per cent and 75 per cent of the Netra pipeline has already been built by the German partners. The Norwegian partners will therefore be making the greatest share of the remaining investment. Under the terms of the deal, Statoil and Norsk Hydro will jointly own 25 per cent of Netra with an option to increase this to a third should the pipeline system be extended. The remaining Netra shares are equally distributed between the German partners in the venture. Dr Burkhard Bergman, a Ruhrgas executive, yesterday said the Netra pipeline was 'not a common carrier but it's an investment for the shareholders,' referring to the European Union's plans to open pipelines to third party users. The companies said their co-operation would increase natural gas supply volumes from Norway to Germany and central Europe. Another aim of the venture is to cut unit costs of the pipeline which will be completed in 1995. Netra believes the pipeline will be an important link in the growing European gas grid integrating the gas industries of western, central and eastern Europe by a cross-border pipeline network. The pipeline - with annual transport capacity of up to 18bn cubic metres - will have the potential to supply Germany and neighbouring countries with volumes of Norwegian gas greater than those already contracted. Existing contracts with Germany alone call for the annual volume of Norwegian gas imports to climb from 11bn cubic metres at present to over 30bn cubic metres in 2005, raising the share of Norwegian gas to 31 per cent of German supplies, from 14 per cent.</p>

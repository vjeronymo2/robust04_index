			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Educated Respondents Approve </F> Meciar's Downfall"]    [Text] Bratislava--More than two-fifths of Slovak citizens  (44 percent) accepted the removal of V. Meciar from the position  of prime minister. Almost the same number of citizens (39  percent) disagreed with Meciar's having to step down. That is  indicated by the results of the opinion poll conducted by the  Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic made public yesterday.  According to the statisticians, almost one-fifth of those asked  (17 percent) did not follow the events taking place in the  parliament.    The results of the poll show that the more educated the  respondent, the more often he or she approved the recall of the  prime minister. The change was very well received by citizens of  Hungarian nationality, entrepreneurs, employees and adherents of  the newly formed parties of "dissidents" from Meciar's camp. The  vote of no confidence given to Meciar was welcomed by 70 percent  of those queried who came from the ranks of supporters of the  Christian Democrats and the left. Disapproval understandably was  predominant among adherents of the Movement for Democratic  Slovakia, somewhat less so among supporters of the Slovak  National Party.</p>

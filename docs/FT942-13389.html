			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news Monday: Figures for the UK's gross domestic product in the first quarter of 1994 are expected to show that the recovery is still on track. The consensus is for quarter-on-quarter growth of 0.7 per cent, in line with the last quarter of 1993. The government's forecast of full year growth is 2.5 per cent. Non-European Union figures for UK trade are published for March, only 11 days after the January figures for EU trade were produced. The non-EU figures, apart from being gathered more quickly, are regarded as being more reliable than the EU data. The consensus forecast for March's deficit is Pounds 750m. Tuesday: The Confederation of British Industry's quarterly trends survey has a good record of predicting developments in the UK economy. The last survey was upbeat, and this report will be closely watched for any signs that the tax increases are weakening the recovery. Friday: French unemployment was 3.3m in February and the markets are not expecting a fall in March, with the consensus forecast for the percentage out of work at 12.2 per cent, the same as in the previous month.</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / People: Gurr's taskforce of one sets sail What does life hold in store for a man who stops being chief executive of a Training and Enterprise Council? He could always become chief executive of a set of islands. Indeed, Andrew Gurr, chief executive of the North and mid-Cheshire Tec, is to take up his new post as chief executive of the Falkland Islands government, in Port Stanley in September, replacing Ronald Sampson, who has completed an extended five-year contract. Gurr, 49, who joined the Tec after spending many years in industry, says that running a Tec demands a complex range of skills which are applicable to his new job. 'The key to the job is running the government as a business, while stimulating local entrepreneurship and ensuring sustainable growth in the economy,' he says. The Falkland Islands government selected Gurr - who will assume the role of acting governor when the governor is absent from the island - from over 250 applicants; it says it considered that he met the requirements of the Islands' rapidly evolving economy and society.</p>

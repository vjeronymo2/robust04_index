			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / International Company News: Air Russia set-up costs to be Dollars 900m, says BA BRITISH AIRWAYS expects the development of Air Russia, its new Moscow-based joint airline venture, to cost up to Dollars 900m, Sir Colin Marshall, BA chief executive, said yesterday. The overall investment to set up the airline would include Dollars 100m in equity, another Dollars 100m in construction costs for a new terminal at Moscow's Domodedovo airport, and the balance in working capital and aircraft funding. BA will hold a 31 per cent stake in the venture with the remaining 69 per cent held by Russian partners, including the international commercial division of Aeroflot, the Domodedovo division of Aeroflot, and the Russian Republican Innovation Fund. Sir Colin, speaking at an FT aerospace conference in Berlin, said Air Russia was expected to start operations in 1994, or possibly earlier. The new venture would create about 1,000 jobs with no more than between 30 to 40 expatriate managers and training personnel, he added. The airline plans to initially operate a fleet of seven jet aircraft, with the Boeing 767 the most likely candidate. Sir Colin said the project had survived the political turmoil following the break-up of the Soviet Union last year. The joint venture's newly-constituted board held its first meeting last January in Moscow. BA and its Russian partners plan to turn the proposed new terminal at Domodedovo airport into the base of a new international East-West airline hub. The new airline would operate a network of flights from Moscow to western Europe and North America and another to destinations in the Far East. Sir Colin said the biggest current problem facing the new venture was a regulatory one with the new airline requiring its operating licence and specific route licences.</p>

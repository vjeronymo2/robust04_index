			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 19 (CNS) -- China, being at a  stage of rapid economic growth, is suffering from inflationary  pressures now, the Vice Minister of the State Commission for  Restructuring the Economy, Mr. Wang Shiyuan, said in reply to a  number of sensitive questions raised at a press conference held  today. He noted, however, that the government had done much  work on the prevention of inflation and many measures had been  adopted to achieve this end. It is expected that the price rise  for this year as a whole will be kept under 10 percent.    Mr. Wang said that the inflationary pressures at present  mainly came from several fields. First, the adjustment of  prices for production means in the past consecutive years and  the continuous great scale of investment caused the rise in  costs which in turn led to inflation. Second, a price rise of  13 percent last year made a high start for the expected  inflation during this year and adverse effects resulting from  that inflation will appear this year. Third, a unified exchange  rate for the renminbi and price reform to be carried out at a  suitable time during the year will cause a price hike. Fourth,  an excessive supply of money for maintain continuous economic  growth last year will also lead to a price rise this year.    Mr. Wang said that the government was aware of the potential  inflationary pressures and made the curbing of inflation and the  maintenance of economic growth at a rapid, continuous and  healthy pace for this year its priority.    The key to the controlling of inflation, according to Mr.  Wang lay in the balance between general supply and demand, in  the keeping control of economic growth to a suitable rate and  control on the scale of investment.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Observer: Chain of events Publishing group Emap is a prolific launcher and buyer of magazines. Purchases alone have brought it 17 consumer magazines, 28 business magazines and five newspapers in the past half-decade. But its pride and joy, besides being much the most profitable is Motor Cycle News, a tabloid bought in 1955 for Pounds 250. Quite the reverse of a glossy, it is definitely the favourite of Emap's group chief executive Robin Miller who was once its editor. He still likes to to roar about town on test bikes supplied to Motor Cycle News. The weekly, whose financial success is based on small ads for second-hand bikes, was founded by Cyril Quantrill who, unable to make a go of it, sold it on to a printer. Some time later, the printer sold it to Emap. But the present owner finally bumped into the creator of the money-spinner a couple of years ago on buying the south England local press group Senews. It was discovered that Quantrill, then aged 70, still worked as a sub-editor on the acquisition's paper in Hastings. Whereupon Emap's top brass mobilised for a trip there to present him with a silver figure of an old motor-cyclist sporting the inscription 'Motor Cycle News'. The figure cost far more than Emap had paid for the title.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by George Jones: "Major Scorns Opposition's </F> `Craven Euro Surrender'"]    [Text] The European elections campaign came to life  yesterday following Mr John Major's call for a "multi-speed"  Europe.    Domestic rows over economic policy and street beggars were  bypassed as Labour and the Liberal Democrats rounded on the  Prime Minister, claiming he was relegating Britain to Europe's  second division.    But Mr Major again made the campaign running launching a  strong defence of his call for a more "flexible" Europe and  accusing opposition parties of a "craven" surrender to Europe.    He said his call for a Europe in which member states were  free to do "some things in their own way" was in tune with  public opinion.    With the campaign past the half-way mark, he said the  Conservatives were the only party addressing the important  European questions and resolutely committed to a realistic  assessment of Britain's place in Europe.    "So far we are the only party which has not played fast and  loose with the national veto. We are the only party  unequivocally committed to maintaining the veto," said Mr Major.    Addressing a Tory campaign conference in London, Mr Major  stood by his call for a "multi-speed, multi-track, multi-layered  Europe."    He said it did not contradict his original aim to see  Britain  at the heart of the Community and described talk of Britain in  the "slow lane" of Europe as defeatist and old-fashioned.    A multi-speed Europe was already happening, and he cited an  agreement between France, Germany and the Benelux countries to  dismantle their border controls -- a policy not adopted by other  EC members.    European governments had to note a "sourness" among voters  towards the way the Community was developing.    "I approach this question from the angle of someone who  wishes to see Europe succeed. This is a very great venture. It  is vitally important it is not pushed aside by sourness and  moving too rapidly. We have to carry the people with us."    Emphasising the Government's determination to maintain the  veto on policies affecting Britain's vital national interests,  he said Labour and the Liberal Democrats would be at the "tail  of Europe," following policies advocated by other states.    "That is the most craven foreign policy I have ever heard  from any British political party. If that is the policy of  Labour and the Liberal Democrats, they have forfeited every  conceivable right to be trusted in Government with British  foreign policy."    Labour's foreign affairs spokesman, Mr Jack Cunningham,  accused Mr Major of trying to play "hokey pokey" with Europe:  "In-out, shake it all about. It is a recipe for a weak Britain  in a strong Europe."    He said it was vital for Britain to be up with those in the  fast lane in Europe.    But the message from Conservative Britain to its EC partners  was "go ahead without us," he added.    Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader' said Mr  Major's two-track Europe speech could mark a "historic" turning  point in British politics -- which could pave the way for the  Tories to become Britain's anti-European party, like Labour in  the 1970's.    In Edinburgh, he said: "It was a speech which revealed at  once the weakness of his leadership and the poverty of his  ambition for Britain."</p>

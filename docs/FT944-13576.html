			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Council wins in MetroCentre case Gateshead Borough Council has won a test case ruling that a unit at the MetroCentre retail development requires planning permission for a change from retail to restaurant use. But in a second decision, also announced yesterday, the Department of the Environment found in favour of the Church Commissioners, the MetroCentre's owners, with a ruling that the erection of a sign and glazed shop front at another MetroCentre unit did not require permission.</p>

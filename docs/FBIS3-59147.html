The  Independent Commission for the Examination of the Property of  GDR Parties and Mass Organizations has now released 400 million  German marks; 60 percent of the money is to benefit economic  restructuring and 40 percent is for social and cultural  purposes. The Federal Government wanted to provide the funds  for current expenses, but the Commission insisted on their  exclusive use for investment or promotion of investment. A  legal dispute over the money, particularly with the Party of  Democratic Socialism [PDS], cannot be ruled out. Therefore, the  Federal Government is guaranteeing the funds provided to the  laender, it was stated.</p>

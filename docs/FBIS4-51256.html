			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By XINHUA reporters Yang Futian (2799 4395 3944) and Li Can </F> (2621 3503): "Vice Premier Li Lanqing Inspects Suzhou Industrial  Park; He Noted That Suzhou Industrial Park's Development and  Construction Was a Major Task Not Only for Suzhou But Also for  Jiangsu and the Entire Nation"]    [Text] Accompanied by Chen Huanyou, secretary of the  Jiangsu Provincial party committee and governor; and Wang  Rongbing, vice governor; Li Lanqing, member of the CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of the State  Council, on 13 May braved the rain and muddy roads to inspect  the Suzhou Industrial Park, a project which had just been  officially launched, and which was under intensive construction.  He called for coordinating actions, strengthening unity, and  carrying out all fields of work around the project so as to  foster Suzhou-style efficiency.    Vice Premier Li Lanqing and his entourage arrived at the  lakeside of Lake Jinji in eastern Suzhou, where the Preparatory  Committee for the Suzhou Industrial Park Administrative  Committee conducts its business. He heard a briefing on the  park's planning and design. He then braved the rain and arrived  by car at the construction site of a small demonstration zone  developed during the first stage of the industrial park, as well  as the construction site of a road for exclusive use by the  Jiangsu and Shanghai airports, where he inspected progress in  construction work.    In the evening, leading comrades from Jiangsu Province and  Suzhou city briefed Vice Premier Li Lanqing on progress made by  the province and city over the past few months in expeditiously  launching the Suzhou Industrial Park. After hearing the  briefings, Vice Premier Li delivered an important speech.    First, Vice Premier Li Lanqing expressed his satisfaction  with the speed and efficiency with which the Suzhou Industrial  Park had been launched officially in just over two months after  the Chinese and Singaporean Governments officially signed the  relevant agreement. He said: This project is one of  cooperation between the Chinese and Singaporean Governments.  This model of cooperation has never been adopted before; it is  South-South cooperation. The project's success will prove to  the world that South-South cooperation is practical and  feasible. The project represents overall interests. Its  success will also advance reform and opening up in Suzhou, as  well as in Jiangsu and the rest of the country. The Suzhou  Industrial Park's development and construction is a major task  not only for Suzhou but also for Jiangsu and the entire country.  For this reason, central leading comrades, such as General  Secretary Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, and Vice Premier Zhu  Rongji, are all very concerned about the project. We should  unify our thinking, coordinate our actions, support each other,  strengthen unity, and carry out all fields of work around this  project; we should never compromise our overall interests. Vice  Premier Li emphatically pointed out: A pressing task of the  moment is to do a good job of building the small demonstration  zone. Because the Suzhou Industrial Park's development and  construction is a very complicated task, we must carry out  relevant work carefully and efficiently.    Vice Premier Li Lanqing said: In developing and building the  Suzhou Industrial Park, we should stress both material and  spiritual civilization. We should stress spiritual civilization  in the initial stage of construction. We should uphold  socialist spiritual civilization and should never allow  unhealthy things in. Despite our implementation of a socialist  market economy, we should emphasize spiritual things, such as  the spirit of dedication and the practice of taking pleasure in  helping others. We should not take the market economy to mean  that we can benefit ourselves at the expense of other people and  concern ourselves exclusively with the pursuit of profit.    Vice Premier Li also discussed the issue of learning from  Singapore's experience in economic development and public  administration. He urged the authority in charge of the Suzhou  Industrial Park to explore some experiences that can be promoted  nationwide while taking account of China's realities in  practice. He said: The Suzhou Industrial Park administrative  agency should perform its functions efficiently and in  accordance with laws and regulations, improve the transparency  of its work methods, and foster Suzhou-style efficiency.    In closing, Li Lanqing asked the authority in charge of the  Suzhou Industrial Park to make every effort to open up more  avenues for training skilled personnel. To provide skilled  personnel of various levels for the park's construction, it may  recruit personnel to undergo training in Singapore, ask  Singapore to send people to China to provide training, or  entrust China's institutions of higher learning and vocational  schools to train people with Singapore's assistance. He said  hopefully: To restructure its industry and transform its old  enterprises along with the park's construction, Suzhou should  encourage some technologically advanced enterprises in other  parts of China to set up factories in the park while, at the  same, attracting foreign investment into the park.    Accompanying Vice Premier Li Lanqing on his inspection tour  of the Suzhou Industrial Park were responsible people from  relevant state departments, including Xi Dehua, deputy secretary  general of the State Council; Gan Ziyu, vice chairman of the  State Planning Commission; and Zhao Guanghua, deputy director of  the State Council's Special Economic Zone Office.</p>

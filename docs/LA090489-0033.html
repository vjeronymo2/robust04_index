			<p><P> September 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL SCREENINGS: 'THE JESTERS' CONCLUDES UCLA FILM SERIES  </P> <P> Subtitles are inadequate to convey the political and historical complexities of  Jose Alvaro Morais' stunningly ambitious but virtually impenetrable "The  Jester," the concluding film in "The Cutting Edge II" series that screens  Tuesday at 8 p.m. in UCLA's Melnitz Theater. Morais' elegant  10-years-in-the-making film intercuts the rehearsal of a 19th-Century play on  the establishment of the Portuguese state in 1125 with its producer's attempt  to finance its production with the sale of a cache of weapons. It is 1978, a  time of disillusionment in the wake of the loss of empire in Africa and the  1974 defeat of political radicals. (213) 206-8013, 206-FILM.  </P> <P> The series of Akira Kurosawa's earliest films continues at the Little Tokyo  Cinema 2 this Friday with the week-long engagement of "The Most Beautiful"  (1944) and "One Wonderful Sunday" (1947). Teaming one of Kurosawa's four  wartime pictures with his first postwar film creates an ironic impact, for "The  Most Beautiful" pays tribute to the extreme sacrifices that were made by  ordinary people on the home front, whereas the second concerns the struggle of  the same kind of people merely to survive in a corrupt and disillusioned  postwar era. It was a time when it seemed, in the words of its beleaguered  hero, that "decent people don't have a chance."  </P> <P> "The Most Beautiful" is one of the least embarrassing World War II pictures  made by anyone on either side of the conflict. Not only does Kurosawa avoid  jingoism and racism but he also never once endorses Japan's aggression. Instead  he reveals the utterly selfless dedication of a group of young women, clearly  of unsophisticated rural backgrounds, who are working at a lens factory on the  outskirts of Tokyo. As the film opens, the factory director (Takashi Shimura,  destined to be a Kurosawa regular) announces that the men must double their  production whereas the women are to increase their output by half, since lenses  are crucial in so much weaponry. Watanabe (Yoko Yaguchi), a group leader,  persuades the director that the women can do two-thirds, rather than merely  half, of the men's quota.  </P> <P> The determination and the solidarity with which these young people proceed on  their grueling task, suffering frostbite even in grinding the lenses, is  genuinely touching. Seen today, "The Most Beautiful" seems a remarkably honest  depiction of the toll exacted on the Japanese people by a clearly worsening  war. The pretty and talented Yaguchi made only one more film before wedding her  director, to whom she was married 40 years before her death in 1985 during the  production of "Ran."  </P> <P> "One Wonderful Sunday" is the first Kurosawa masterpiece and is also the first  of several Kurosawa films done in a style virtually identical to that of  Vittorio De Sica in his Neo-Realist period. (It has aptly been called his  "Miracle in Milan.") Working with writer Keinosuke Uegusa, Kurosawa has created  a film of timeless poetic impact, concentrating on an engaged young couple,  Yuzo (Isao Numasaki) and Masako (Chieko Nakakita), who are so impoverished that  they are able to meet only on Sundays, when Masako arrives in Tokyo by train.  As intimate a film as "One Wonderful Sunday" is, it has the epic scope and  visual bravura that was to become typical of Kurosawa.  </P> <P> In the course of the couple's single day we get a very clear view of what life  in postwar Tokyo was like, overridden with black marketeers and signs (some  misspelled) in English to attract the business of the forces of Occupation. At  every turn -- a trip to the zoo being an exception -- the couple finds  themselves frustrated by being so very nearly broke; propriety, we discover in  one long and poignant scene, forbids them the pleasure of premarital sex. In  many ways "One Wonderful Sunday" is very venturesome, especially in its use of  music, which ranges from a couple of tangos to a banjo rendition of "My Blue  Heaven" and Schubert's "Unfinished Symphony." At a crucial point, Masako  addresses the audience, daring to involve us in making the couple's dreams come  true. The series concludes with the two-part "Sanshiro Sugata" (1942-44), which  opens Sept. 15. Information: (213) 687-7077.  </P></p>

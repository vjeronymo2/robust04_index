			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Bulgaria's ex-Communists win Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev yesterday urged the Socialist party of former Communists, the clear winner of the December 18 elections, to form a government without any ally. Confirming previously announced unofficial results, Ms Ralitsa Negentsova, a spokeswoman for the Election Commission, said the Socialists won an absolute majority of 125 seats in the 240-seat parliament. Their main opponent, the staunchly anti-Communist Union of Democratic Forces, gained 69 seats. The Socialists have been seeking a multi-party government, which they say is necessary to deal with Bulgaria's deeply rooted economic problems.</p>

			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONRAD'S JERUSALEM CARTOON  </P> <P> Conrad either has not bothered to read your paper's news reports or has chosen  to create his own facts upon which to base his false and misleading cartoon. As  reported in these pages, approximately 150 Jewish settlers moved into a  building in Jerusalem's Jewish quarter.  </P> <P> Contrary to Conrad's depiction, the building was not the site of the Last  Supper, nor is it a holy site at all. No places holy of any faith were violated  in any way by the act of the settlers.  </P> <P> When Jordan seized the Old City of Jerusalem during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war,  all Jewish inhabitants were expelled and denied access to the Western Wall and  Jewish holy places; edifices and cemeteries were desecrated.  </P> <P> Israel reunited Jerusalem after the 1967 war and the Israeli government passed  the Protection of Holy Places law guaranteeing the preservation of all holy  sites in the city in accordance with Israeli law which protects the freedom of  religion and worship for people of all faiths.  </P> <P> The settlers broke no law in their actions; any illegality relates to the issue  of tenancy and subtenancy. Israel's Supreme Court has upheld the eviction of  the settlers and ordered that they must leave the site.  </P> <P> While the settlers and the Israeli Housing Ministry were rightfully condemned  for their insensitivity, this was not and should not be wrongfully portrayed as  an Israeli attempt to conquer the holy sites of any other faith. Conrad's  placement of Prime Minister Shamir and an Israeli flag on the table of Da  Vinci's Last Supper is inaccurate and is not based on the facts as they were  reported by The Times.  </P> <P> TZIVIA SCHWARTZ  </P> <P> Associate Western States Counsel  </P> <P> Anti-Defamation League  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Observer: Open and shut case The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is now well and truly inaugurated, but mercurial president Jacques Attali has as yet failed to fill what is probably its second most important position: the vice-presidency of the merchant banking division. It is vacant because he could not land Ernest Stern, the World Bank senior vice-president, who was in line to be his number two. The job has to go to an American, and Attali says he wants someone with strong investment banking credentials. But he has decided to take his time in filling it, otherwise 'the person would be happy for five minutes and I'd be unhappy for four years.' It seems that the 'excellent' recruit he seeks should not be nervous about working with him. 'I've always thought that only weak people are afraid to work with strong people.' Indeed, opinions about Attali and his bank seem even stronger than before this week's celebrations started. Despite a commitment to 'openness', Attali has yet to come to grips with the concept. For example, he has been trying to limit - no doubt for good practical reasons - the access of the bank's 23-strong board of directors to the staff of the bank. Originally, his suggestion was that board members would be able to access staff only through him or one other person, the bank's secretary-general. Now he appears to be willing also to allow approaches through the bank's five vice-presidents. The topic is far from settled. He has also made much about press freedom: a free press will be one factor which will condition the new bank's approach to operations in a borrowing country. However, the condition seems not to apply to the bank itself. Copies of a newsletter, Annual Meeting News, published for the meeting were withdrawn from circulation because of the rude comments about Attali it contained. A libel suit has been threatened.</p>

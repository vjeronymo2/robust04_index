Party Chairman Tomiichi Murayama made the remarks at a  two-day party convention which started Tuesday. Hosokawa also  addressed the convention as a guest.    Hosokawa told the delegates that enacting political reform  bills in the current parliament session is a mission of the  ruling coalition.    SDPJ sources said there is a strong dissatisfaction among  party members with the party leadership, which is regarded as  having compromised too much on crucial issues such as political  reform and the partial lifting of the rice market.    The 60th party convention, a continuation of a meeting held  on September 25 last year, is scheduled to adopt an action  program for this year advocating political reform.    Some 400 delegates made up of SDPJ Diet members and local  representatives from the country's 47 prefectures have  registered to attend the meeting, party officials said.    At the opening of the convention, Murayama said, "political  reform bills aimed at stemming graft-ridden politics should be  legislated during the current Diet session at any cost."    The government-proposed political reform bills are currently  in the House of Councillors for further deliberation after being  passed by the more powerful House of Representatives in November  last year.    The bills call for replacing the multiseat electoral system  for the lower house, which encourages lavish campaign spending,  with a system combining single-seat constituencies and  proportional representation, as well as tightening curbs on  political fund-raising activities.    Murayama reiterated the party stance to continue in the  seven-party coalition government, saying, "if the SDPJ does not  remain in the coalition, politics might be dominated by  conservative forces."    "An axis gathering broad-based liberal forces has to be  formed as early as possible to square off with strong  conservative groups," he said. The SDPJ is the biggest party in  the coalition.    On the dissolution of the lower house, Murayama said,  "general elections which causes a two-month void in politics  should not be held in the current harsh economic climate, but  (I) cannot definitely say what kind of decision Hosokawa will  make in the wake of political upheaval."    Last month, Hosokawa gave up his initial target to get the  political reform bills into law by the end of 1993 and set a new  deadline of January 29, when the extended extraordinary Diet  session ends.    If the bills are not passed by then, there is a possibility  that the government would resign or dissolve the lower house for  an election, political commentators said.    Murayama said the SDPJ has to win more than 100 seats in the  next general election.    In the last lower house general election held in July last  year, the SDPJ suffered a historical setback, seeing its  strength almost halved from 134 before the polls.    The election, however, dislodged the Liberal Democratic  Party  (LDP) from a 38-year-old grip on power, bringing about the  coalition government.</p>

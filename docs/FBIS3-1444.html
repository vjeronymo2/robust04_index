Joint forces of the Futungo de Belas  regime and mercenaries tried to take Quibala District, which is  under the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola's  [UNITA) effective control. Capalandanda, the Voice of  Resistance of the Black Cockerel correspondent in the area,  reports that the Popular Movement for the Liberation of  Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] forces launched a major offensive  along three lines -- Gabela, Ebo, and Waku Kungo -- from the  area of Conde. Since the fighting erupted in the area of Waku  Kungo, the FAPLA forces have already suffered heavy losses at  the hands of the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola  [FALA].    Capalandanda gives us a preliminary report from Cuanza Sul  Province:    [Begin Capalandanda recording] [Words indistinct] this is a  preliminary balance of the losses incurred by the enemy forces  up to (?28) March. One (?BMP-1) was destroyed and 46 FAPLA  soldiers were killed. Our forces also captured two 76-mm  cannons, one 85-mm cannon, and two [name indistinct] vehicles  captured [words indistinct]. [end recording]    Under the command of Lieutenant General Antas, the FAPLA  forces have been suffering serious military defeats in Cuanza  Sul Province.

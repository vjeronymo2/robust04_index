			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Letter: Consultant says no conflicts in MMC research Sir, You will be aware that some motor vehicle producers alleged conflict of interest in the comparative car price research that we as consultants carried out for the Monopolies and Mergers Commission study of the UK car market. The allegation was made in a letter from Vauxhall published by you (October 11 1991) and repeated in your article about the MMC report (February 6 1992). Our consultants carried out highly technical research, analysis and reconciliation of car prices in a rigorous manner, strictly in accordance with the methodology agreed in advance with the MMC. Had conflicts of interest led their work to be biased in any way this would surely have become evident with the publication of the report, to the detriment of our professional reputation. The MMC report provides ample and convincing evidence that Ludvigsen Associates was impartial and objective in all respects in its work for the MMC. In its report the MMC stated its satisfaction that our work 'in providing specification-adjusted list prices was not undermined by any bias or potential bias or by any suggested conflict of interest and can be relied on for the further detailed work we ourselves carried out in order to establish the extent of price differences'. K E Ludvigsen, chairman, Ludvigsen Associates, 105/106 New Bond Street, London W1Y 9LG</p>

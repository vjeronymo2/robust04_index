The nine-member group is composed of eight deputies from the  former HSDMS and one deputy (Jiri Drapela) who joined the group  after leaving the group of the Liberal Social Union (LSU).    The change in the group's name followed the transformation  of  the HSDMS into the CMSS in January 1994.    The party electoral program remains valid, but the group  will  try to work out a detailed strategy in some points, including  unemployment and housing policy, which the group's members want  to view as national problems, one of the group's deputies,  Rudolf Opatril, told CTK.    There are 12 groups in the 200-seat Czech Parliament: The  groups of the government coalition Civic Democratic Party (ODS),  the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), the Christian Democratic  Union- Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL), and the Christian  Democratic Party (KDS), and the opposition groups of the  Assembly for the Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party  (SPR-RSC), the CMSS, the Self-Governing Democracy  Movement-Society for Moravia and Silesia (HSD-SMS), the Czech  Social Democratic Party (CSSD), the Left Bloc (LB), and the  Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM).    Deputy Josef Jezek, who left the ODS in January, is the  single deputy in the house, who is not a member of any party.    Immediately after the last elections in June 1992, there  were  nine groups in the parliament. Most changes have affected the  groups of non-government parties.</p>

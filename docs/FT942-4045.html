			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: London International in Pounds 115.2m rights issue - At a Glance London International group, best known for its Durex condom brand, announced a restructuring and a Pounds 115.2m one-for-one rights issue when it produced its annual results this week. The group lost Pounds 173.7m over the year to March 31, including a Pounds 91.4m loss on the sale of its ColourCare International photo-processing division to management. The group is disposing of many of its non-core activities, in order to focus on the condom and surgical glove business. Gearing will remain high even after the rights issue. The group is currently precluded from paying dividends.</p>

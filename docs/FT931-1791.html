			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Wilson Bowden declines 39% - Housebuilder confirms revival in UK property market WILSON BOWDEN yesterday reported a 50 per cent increase in agreed house sales in the first 11 weeks of the year, confirming the revival in the UK property market reported since the new year by estate agents, building societies and other builders. The increase follows a dreadful 12 months for the housing market; Wilson Bowden yesterday announced a 39 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 16.9m last year. Since the new year net reservations, sales upon which a deposit has been paid less cancellations, have risen by 50 per cent compared with the corresponding period last year. Completed sales over the same period rose by 15 per cent. Most encouraging was the fact that reservations, after dipping the week before the Budget, rebounded back to previous high levels last weekend following the Chancellor's statement. The final dividend is held at 6.2p, making a maintained total for the year of 8.7p. This was despite a 40 per cent fall in earnings per share to 14.6p (24.5p). The results, although disappointing, were better than many housebuilders would be reporting for 1992, said Mr David Wilson, chairman and chief executive. He said the company was well placed to take advantage of increased sales. Net debt of just Pounds 16.8m, compared with net cash of Pounds 7m 12 months previously, meant that gearing was still only 10 per cent of shareholders funds. The group, therefore, did not need a rights issue to finance increased sales but could purchase all the land it needed from its own resources and borrowings. Gearing was expected to rise to no more than 20 per cent to 25 per cent this year. During the past 14 months the group has increased the number of housing sites it owns with planning permission from 7,900 plots to just under 10,000. The share price rose 3p to 384p following the statement that the group expected to build at least 20 per cent more homes this year. Housebuilding profits fell by more than a third last year, from Pounds 21.5m to Pounds 13.8m, despite a 3 per cent increase in the number of houses sold to 1,367. Operating margins slipped from 20.3 per cent to 13.5 per cent, reflecting pressure on house prices, the need to offer discounts to buyers and other sales incentives as well as higher operating costs. Commercial property profits fell from Pounds 6.7m to Pounds 4.4m as turnover from property sales slipped from Pounds 30m to Pounds 25.2m. Mr Wilson said that there was no sign of a pick up in the industrial and commercial property market which he expected to lag the housing recovery by at least 12 months COMMENT Following its rights issue two years ago, Wilson Bowden largely stayed out of land buying in 1991. It made up for this last year, raising the number of plots with planning permission by about a quarter as well as significantly increasing the number of selling outlets. The timing looks to have been perfect coinciding with a recovery in house sales. The decision to raise gearing rather than equity is to be applauded and reflects the strength of the balance sheet. Margins should increase as sales incentives, worth about Pounds 2,500 to Pounds 3,000 a house, are eroded. Profits, given a fair wind, could approach Pounds 20m this year putting the shares on a prospective p/e of more than 20. A class act but one which, unfortunately for stockholders, is already recognised in the share price.</p>

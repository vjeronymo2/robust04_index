			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Conrad Seidl: "Much Discussion, Little Resolve"] </F>   [Text] Linz -- More than one in four Austrians are still  undecided as to how they would vote in a referendum on European  Union [EU] entry.    According to Astrid Koller, of the Market Institute, this  has  mainly to be seen in connection with the fact that the EU  negotiations are currently accompanied by a particularly large  number of political statements: "The potential of the undecided  is in great motion. In quiet months such as June and October,  when there was less discussion on entry policy, people were much  more certain on how they would decide."    Koller points out that even among educated people, one in  five does not know how he or she would vote.    As reported earlier, 39 percent would currently vote in  favor  and 34 percent against EU membership. Among university and high  school graduates, 47 percent are for and 33 percent against  accession. In the federal capital the support for membership is  even more marked: Every other Viennese would vote in favor of  membership, only 28 percent against, while 22 percent of people  living in Vienna have not yet made up their mind.  <H5>  Surprising Farmers </H5>   Resolve is remarkably high among farmers: Only 14 percent  are undecided, while the number of those in favor of membership  equals that of those who are against. This is surprising,  because the farmers had up to now taken a rather critical  position and because the headlines were dominated by  agricultural issues at the time of the survey.    The supporters of the Austrian People's Party [OeVP], Social  Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe], and the Freedom Party of  Austria [FPOe] also proved to be relatively determined as to  what they want, with the number of people without a clear  position toward Europe remaining under 20 percent for each  party. However, the Market survey for DER STANDARD's European  Barometer shows that a clear majority in favor of EU entry (45  against 35 percent) only exists within the SPOe. How the  somewhat more than 25 percent of the population, which has not  yet made up its mind, will finally decide, or whether it will  even abstain, is still entirely unclear.</p>

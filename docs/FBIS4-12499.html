			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, 10 Apr (MENA)--Palestinian information  sources have stated that President Yasir 'Arafat chaired a  meeting of the Palestinian leadership yesterday and the day  before yesterday to discuss the deteriorating economic situation  of the Palestinians due to the Israeli blockade that has been  imposed on the occupied territories for 45 days. This blockade,  the sources added, was causing poverty and hunger in the  territories.    The sources said that 'Arafat briefed the participants on  the  reports that he had received from Palestinian officials in Gaza  and Hebron. The reports indicated that poverty and hunger have  spread due to the Israeli military blockade and the ban on  130,000 Palestinian workers from reporting to their work inside  Israel.    According to the sources, 'Arafat had taken a number of  urgent measures to avert further exacerbation of the crisis and  to foil the Israeli attempt to import workers from abroad to  replace the Palestinian workers, who are prevented from going to  their work in Israel.    The sources said that, during his meeting with the  ambassadors of the UN Security Council permanent member states  in Cairo last week, 'Arafat briefed them on the tragic condition  of well over two million Palestinians. 'Arafat told the envoys  that this condition has been caused by Israel's disregard of its  international commitments and its evasion of implementing the  articles of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles.  'Arafat voiced his stern rejection of Israel's extortionist  policy, according to the sources.</p>

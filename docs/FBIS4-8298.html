			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 6/4/1994 -- American General  George Joulwan, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces of  Europe, said on 6 April in Bucharest that there was clear will  with the NATO to back Romania and the Partnership for Peace  would be paralleled by a "Partnership for Prosperity", the two  elements being considered as guarantees of lasting stability.  The general, now on a visit in Romania, met with Prime Minister  Nicolae Vacaroiu.    The main issue discussed was Romania's adhesion to the  Partnership for Peace and the prospects of the country's full  integration in the Euro-Atlantic structures. The Romanian  premier stressed that Romania's foreign policy laid stress on  the development of the relations with the NATO and all its  member states, an orientation backed by all political forces of  the country. Referring to the military domain, the premier  integrated the specialty problems in the general picture of the  country's economic situation, stressing that, although  administrating an austerity budget, the Romanian Government was  ready to back financially, more than in the past years, the  process of reorganization and updating of the Army.    "The main issue the Army is facing is the lack of financial  resources and specialty technical assistance, domains in which  the NATO support would be very efficient," the Romanian premier  added.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sudha Bhatia: "What GATT Means for India"] </F>   [Text] India's main objective in signing the new General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) treaty is to increase its  share in world trade, which in 1992 was a meagre 0.4 per cent of  the total $3,500 billion. Protagonists of the new treaty say  that India has all the policy instruments in place to increase  its share to at least the 1950s level of 3.6 per cent.    The question is, what are the likely gains for India's  exports? Can India capture a share of the additional expansion  of world trade following the Uruguay Round by AD 2005? The GATT  secretariat offers a clue when it says that the largest  increases in trade will come in textiles and clothing and in  agriculture--areas in which India is competitive. Movement of  personnel is another area in which India is expected to gain.    On the other hand, what is of grave concern is India is the  impact of the new intellectual property regime on the drugs and  pharmaceuticals industry and prices. A look at the sector  specific implications reveals the following:  <H5>  Services </H5>   A gain for India. The US has made one of the best offers  allowing global movement of 65,000 skilled professionals  annually in the software services sector, medical and  educational fields. However, Indian negotiators are disappointed  that the offers do not cover semi-skilled workers.    Australia and Canada have also offered no caps on movement  of  skilled personnel for individual professionals. Using a crude  indicator, even if 10,000 personnel move to the US in one year  and save $1,000 per month, the total remittances that could  accrue to India are $120 million, and that just from the US.  However, these gains could be substantially diluted if India  does not offer "significant" market access in financial  services. A "comprise" clause says that countries can modify  their offers, if there are no improvements in access for  financial services.  <H5>  Textiles </H5>   By far the biggest gain for India. The gains will, however,  be long term ones. India's potential as a leading exporter is  evident from the fact that out of the average imports by  developed countries in the six year period of 1986 to 1991,  which was to the tune of $66 billion, the share of the  developing countries, despite the import quotas, was half, at  $33 billion.    A measure of India's strengths in this sector can also be  gauged from the fact that in 1990-91, this accounted for a  quarter of India's merchandise exports.    According to industry analysts, India's main rivals--South  Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Malaysia--are expected to lose  their competitive edge due to high wage costs. India and China  are expected to emerge as the major players, says one of India's  chief negotiators.  <H5>  TRIPS </H5>   Trade related intellectual property rights (TRIPs) will have  the most serious implications for the Indian drug industry and  consumers who will have to pay higher prices. "Prices will go up  by as much as 10 to 15 times," according to B.K. Keayla of the  National Working Group on Patent Laws. The rise in prices is  estimated on the basis of comparisons with drug prices in  Pakistan which recognises product patents. Mr Keayla argues that  Pakistan is the most relevant comparison as it has comparable  living standards.    A complex world will be ushered in where Indian firms will  exploit the process patent regime, an area where it has  considerable expertise. Transnationals will exploit both the  process and the product patent regime. As a result, an  "anti-competitive situation will develop amongst both Indian  firms and transnationals." This tendency will be more acute  among the latter.    The benefits of the transitional period--10 years--for India  has also been considerably diluted as process and product  patents registered after the enforcement of agreement, will be  granted exclusive marketing rights. Mr Keayla also warns that  "transnationals can develop new processes claiming less toxicity  and side effects and secure exclusive marketing rights," even  though their products may have been registered before the date  of the enforcement of the agreement.    More importantly, industry sources say that as imports will  be granted the same patent rights as domestic production,  enhanced protection for intellectual pro-party will not lead to  significant foreign investment inflows in this sector.    Micro-organisms, which are useful for varying purposes,  including raising agricultural production to pharmaceutical  applications, are not covered under the IPR provisions. At the  same time, says a former Indian trade negotiator, "There is no  express clause that these will be excluded, leaving room for  dispute."    Seeds will become patentable, but farmers will have the  right  to store and re-use seeds. Estimates by the agricultural  ministry show that seed prices will go up marginally by 5 to 7  per cent, but farmers will be compensated by higher yields.  <H5>  Agriculture </H5>   Agriculture is expected to be the fastest growing sector in  the post-Uruguay world, according to Anwarul Hoda, deputy  director-general of GATT. This could open up India's opportunity  for exports of wheat and sugar, if production is according to  expectations. There are welfare gains in this as well, as these  are labour-intensive crops. However, it is not clear to what  extent US and the EC will cut subsidies on these crops, as the  cuts apply on overall volumes and not specific crops. This will  enable the countries to manage the cuts in such a way that their  export competitiveness is not hurt.    The cuts on subsidies are expected to help Indian farmers as  world agricultural prices will rise by 10 per cent. The gap  between international and domestic prices is expected to widen,  making exports attractive. For instance, using indicative  figures, the present domestic price for wheat is Rs 4,000 per  tonne, whereas the expected international price could be well  over Rs 5,000 per tonne.  <H5>  Customs Duties </H5>   Developed countries will have to cut import duties on  industrial goods from an average of 5 per cent to 2.5 per cent  over five years. On top of this, over 40 per cent of the imports  by the rich countries will be duty free. Duties will be scrapped  on items like steel, pharmaceuticals, furniture, paper--areas  where India enjoys a competitive edge.    Take a look at our potential: According to experts, our  integrated steel producers will gain as we are competitive in  semi-finished products like billets, blooms and plates. Our  export price of plates is approximately Rs 11,000 a tonne,  whereas the international price is Rs 12,000 a tonne. Our export  price of HR coils is $250 a tonne, whereas the international  price is $270 a tonne.    Chemical exports like dye stuff and oleo-resins should also  increase sharply due to the drastic cuts in tariff rates by  countries like the US from a weighted average of 7.2 per cent to  4 per cent over a period of five years.  <H5>  New Trade Body </H5>   This will give teeth to enforce the GATT commitments. The  powers of the US to take recourse to unilateral action under  Section 301 will also be significantly diluted. If a member  country does not comply with the commitments offered in the new  GATT discipline, a complainant will have to seek a consensus  from other member countries whether such a charge is just.  Again, even if the findings are in favour of the complainant, a  country cannot retaliate without a "multilateral authorisation."  However, the US is expected to find new ways to apply Section  301 to areas which are not covered by the GATT discipline,  according to a senior member of the GATT secretariat.  <H5>  Balance Sheet </H5>   In the final analysis, the new GATT package offers a mixed  bag of pluses and minuses for India. Whether India will be able  to capitalise on the opportunities will be determined by the  course of events and the support of countries like the US and  those of the EC. Imperfect as the GATT package may be in  addressing the concerns of developing nations like India, it  will be unwise to step out and lose the benefits that  multilateralism confers on member countries. If India opts out,  pressures to yield much more in bilateral negotiations will  intensify for acquiring similar benefits embodied in the new  GATT treaty.</p>

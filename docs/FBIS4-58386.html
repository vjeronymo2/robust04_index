			<p>BFN     [Text] The release of the 2,500 prisoners slated to return  home by Sunday, as stipulated in the Cairo agreement, began at  midday today. Our correspondents Nisim Qeynan and Moti Amir  report that seven buses carrying freed prisoners left the  Qezi'ot detention facility and headed for the Gaza Strip, but  were stopped at the Nahal 'Oz checkpoint. Meanwhile, a large  crowd of relatives was waiting for the returning prisoners on  the other side of the checkpoint. The hold-up is believed to  have been caused by the delay in the Cairo ceremony. The buses  with released prisoners were eventually permitted to drive on.    It has been learned that all the released prisoners are  affiliated with Fatah, with the exception of two Islamic Jihad  and two Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] members who signed a  statement of support for the Declaration of Principles, and that  about 1,000 prisoners will be released by the end of the day.    In Gaza city and in refugee camps in the Strip, the  returning  locals are being received with festive processions. In Jericho,  local inhabitants decorated the police station with flowers and  palm branches and hoisted a PLO flag. The city has been  declared a closed military zone.</p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (34): Office bores THE CHATTO BOOK OF OFFICE LIFE edited by Jeremy Lewis Chatto Pounds 14.99, 393 pages WHY THIS anthology? The predictable are here - Wodehouse's Psmith in the City, Sinclair Lewis' The Job, badly-aged 1970s horrors like The Death of Reginald Perrin, all quoted so extensively that Jeremy Lewis has to apologise: 'Repetition and familiarity are of the essence of office life'. But this will not do for a selection that aims to entertain. Cumulatively, it offers wry amusement of the self-disparagingly British kind, in the reflections on national character, on our unchanging class-ridden and irreverent attitudes to work. One-liners sometimes raise a smirk, but mostly this choice is mediocre, unfunny. Truly witty novels about work, like Scoop, are too sophisticated to retain their sparkle in the slimline extracts allowed into an anthologer's categories. Lloyd's most famous bank clerk was TS Eliot, and the best-loved life insurance salesman was US poet Wallace Stevens, but neither dwelt on the office out of hours. Kenneth Grahame, literature's most notable Secretary of the Bank of England, and Charles Lamb, of the East India Company, did; however, their hours were 10 till 4, and both wrote most of their books at their office. Could they have done so now? And what of Kafka, the world's most famous insurance clerk?</p>

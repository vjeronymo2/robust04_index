			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Grandees on parade: Jurek Martin on first day of congressional hearings If the first day of the Whitewater hearings in Congress produced only sound and fury, even so it offered an absorbing public contrast between three men  -Mr Henry Gonzalez, Mr Jim Leach and Mr Lloyd Cutler - all in their respective ways Washington institutions. Mr Gonzalez, 78-year-old, balding, Democratic chairman of the House banking committee, is a cantankerous Texan, one of Washington's great manglers of the English language, but a ferocious investigator of malfeasance in financial institutions. Usually rumpled, yesterday he was dressed in an immaculate white summer suit. Mr Leach, 52, is a previously mild-mannered, moderate Republican from Iowa who has made Whitewater his passion. He, too, was dressed for the occasion in smart dark suit and tie; the old sweater and jacket that used to be the trademark of this anglophile former Rhodes Scholar had been left in the closet. Mr Cutler, the white-haired 76-year-old White House legal counsel, is the epitome of Washington superlawyers, an adviser to presidents beyond number, opera buff and bon vivant. He wore his customary legal suit. It was Mr Gonzalez, with the power of the gavel, who struck first. He bluntly ruled out of order any questioning of witnesses on the circumstances relating to the suicide last summer of Mr Vincent Foster, then White House deputy legal counsel. A Republican demurred but the chairman rammed through his edict by voice vote - all 31 Democrats concurring and all 19 Republicans opposing. He then laid down the rest of the rules, as specified by the custom of his committee and Congress and by agreement with Mr Robert Fiske, the independent Whitewater counsel. These were five minutes per committee member for questions, though time could be yielded by one congressman to another; no straying from the committee's brief to confine itself only to the 'Washington end' of the affair; and any witness facing a question outside the remit would be told he was under no obligation to reply. He pronounced: 'As I have said repeatedly, ad nauseam, we're not here to prosecute anybody.' Democratic heads nodded, as they did all day. When Mr Leach's turn came, he naturally spoke at length - with an even longer statement put into the record. He is a man who recently has tended to blow hot and cold on Whitewater, hot on moral outrage but much cooler to some of the wilder conspiracy charges bandied around by right-wing Republicans. Whitewater might not be Watergate, Mr Leach said, but, in partisan tones matching those of the chairman, it was the product of 'one-party government'. It was also 'about the arrogance of power' by a government 'run by a new political class which takes short cuts to power with end runs round the law'. He complained bitterly about what had been proscribed from the committee's hearings (all that was left was 'one third of five per cent' of Whitewater), yet agreed that they should not come to resemble a trial. Public ethics were not an 'incidental' matter but at the core of a functioning democracy. 'In terms of symbolism, both of the disjunction of private and public ethics and as a case study on how not to handle a scandal, Whitewater takes on more significance. . . accountability is in order but a constitutional crisis is not.' Appropriately for a constitutional thinker, it then became Mr Cutler's day, as first he methodically presented his written testimony and then, in the afternoon, put to the sword ranks of frustrated Republican congressmen complaining about cover-ups. This he managed with consummate finesse, allowing no assertion and no fact to go unchallenged. He mixed the manner of the law professor teaching a particularly dumb class of students ('it is your committee which sets the rules, not I') with outrage that his own honour should be questioned. When Congressman Bill McCollum of Florida finished a diatribe (Whitewater 'stinks to high heaven'), the Cutler response was direct. 'I am not here as a special pleader for the president of the United States. . . I didn't ask for this job. I came in and took it and reported frankly to the best of my ability as a lawyer and a person of integrity.' When Congressman Toby Roth of Wisconsin made the most tenuous of comparisons with the prosecution case against O J Simpson (the retired American football star accused of double murder), Mr Cutler looked at him as if he were the lowest form of life. But he had no need to answer. In chipped Congressman Barney Frank, a Democrat from Massachusetts: 'That is the least appropriate analogy I've heard in my 14 years in Congress, even from the gentleman from Wisconsin.' Then Lloyd Cutler smiled.</p>

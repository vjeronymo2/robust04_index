A source  close to the president, who wished to remain anonymous, said  that the formal reason for the postponement could be the fact  that the Kremlin's Marble Hall is not ready to hold such an  event. However, it is not ruled out that the text of the annual  address of the president may undergo some changes. At today's  session of the Russian State Duma's Committee on Budget, its  chairman, Mikhail Zadornov, told deputies that they could become  acquainted with the text of the address, which had been received  by the Duma.</p>

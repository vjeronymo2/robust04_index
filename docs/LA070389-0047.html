			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE HISTORY TAKES CENTER STAGE AT LONDON MUSEUM  </P> <P> Designer Neal Potter spent more than a year translating other men's dreams and  documents into this city's new Museum of the Moving Image. His working credo,  written in block letters on a piece of tape across his drafting table, was a  simple one: "Don't forget the magic!"  </P> <P> They didn't. Uniformed guards have been replaced by costumed actors who oversee  everything from Hollywood sound stages to Russian railroad cars stocked with  propaganda films. Six huge statues of silent-film stars support a ceiling  papered with mug shots. Even the museum's high-tech control center has been  turned into an exhibit.  </P> <P> Run by the British Film Institute, the museum opened last September and had  more than 165,000 visitors its first four months. Potter and museum co-founder  Leslie Hardcastle believed they had "a magical story to tell and we shouldn't  become too academic or downbeat," Potter says. "This was entertainment, fantasy  and art."  </P> <P> More than 90 TV and film screens broadcast images drawn from, among others,  "The Birth of a Nation," British newsreels and films by French directors Renoir  and Clair. Potter estimates about 50 miles of cables and laser discs eliminate  rewind time. Visitors can star in TV and films, then play back their own work  instantly.  </P> <P> The museum capitalizes on an apparently insatiable fascination with movie  history and memorabilia. It opened about the same time as New York's American  Museum of the Moving Image, run out of a former movie studio in Astoria,  Queens, and in Los Angeles, the Hollywood Exposition broke ground in March on a  Hollywood Boulevard site near Mann's Chinese Theater. The Exposition, focusing  on film, TV, radio and recording arts, is operating out of donated office space  at Paramount, but president Phyllis Caskey says the $22-million,  31,000-square-foot first phase could open in 1992.  </P> <P> Thus far, the London museum's mission is more global than that of its American  counterparts. A large display on the making of a TV serial may center on  "Coronation Street," Granada TV's long-running drama, but there are still many  U.S. references, including information on the 1959 TV quiz-show scandals.  French films go as far back as the turn of the century, and films of the '30s  are shown above a miniature model of Parisian rooftops.  </P> <P> "The thing I respect most about MOMI is that in spite of the considerable  wealth of material they covered, there's a coherence about the experience,"  says Malibu-based Barry Howard, who will design the proposed Hollywood museum.  "You can trace what's happening in an easy way."  </P> <P> Getting there wasn't so easy, however. Museum founders Hardcastle, controller  of the British Film Institute South Bank, and David Francis, curator of the  National Film Archive, started planning the museum more than 10 years ago, but  it took all that time to raise the money. The museum's start-up costs of 12  million ($18 million) came entirely from the private sector, including such  donors as J. Paul Getty Jr.  </P> <P> The 30,000-square-foot museum is tucked under Waterloo Bridge in the massive  South Bank Arts Centre that also houses the National Theatre and Hayward  Gallery. Mostly chronological, the museum's displays start with an image of the  human eye, then move on to Asian shadow plays. Besides tracing how the shadow  plays moved on to Europe, the museum documents such things as magic lanterns,  the French Phantasmagoria and the zoopraxiscope of British photographer  Eadweard Muybridge.  </P> <P> They didn't forget early films either. Photo stills from D.W. Griffith's 1915  epic, "The Birth of a Nation," are accompanied by a page enumerating such  statistics as the film's cost of $500,000. (The film employed 18,000 people and  3,000 horses; it took 200 seamstresses two months to make the costumes.)  </P> <P> The fare varies. In the avant-garde section, there's a reproduction of the  robot from Fritz Lang's "Metropolis" looking down from a landing. Not too far  away is a huge padded hand crawling with bugs; it sets the mood for the grisly  film segment from Luis Bunuel's "Un Chien Andalou" playing on a near-by  monitor. Pictures from Salvador Dali's surrealist dream sequence in Alfred  Hitchcock's "Spellbound" are on a wall above a couch that Dali once designed to  represent Mae West's lips.  </P> <P> Inside a door marked "casting office" is a suitably red-carpeted room full of  movie star lore such as the metamorphosis of Theodosia Goodman, daughter of a  Cincinnati tailor, into Theda Bara. Among the photos: Harold Lloyd pool side in  Benedict Canyon with "one of his 65 Great Danes."  </P> <P> A barn-like room becomes a Hollywood sound stage with assorted film departments  on all sides. There's a re-created story board from "The Wizard of Oz" showing  a matte painting of Dorothy and friends in front of the Yellow Brick Road; it  backs up to a floor plan of the interior of the breakfast room from "Citizen  Kane." In the adjoining costume department, Fred Astaire's tail coat and  trousers from a 1936 film are on display. A video in the makeup department  starts when your body weight descends on the chair in front of the  makeup-mirror-cum-video screen.  </P> <P> From the sound stage, you exit through the glass doors just under a full-size  marquee advertising Claire Trevor and John Wayne in Walter Wangers'  "Stagecoach." But the '30s facade of the Odeon is deceptive. Inside you see no  movies but instead an award-winning demonstration of the Baird TV system and  other facts and artifacts about the early days of television.  </P> <P> Ever wonder what people thought about TV at its start? Right next to a display  of early TV sets of every size and style -- all of them tuned at that moment to  Phil Silvers as Sgt. Ernie Bilko -- are some early comments. Frank Lloyd Wright  called it "chewing gum for the eyes," and Bertrand Russell was even more  damning: "Television will be of no importance in your lifetime or mine."  </P> <P> Display panels also detail the televised coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in  June, 1953; an audience of 200 million people in Europe and the United States  made the coronation the biggest event in broadcasting history at that time.  Panels similarly recall that on Sept. 1, 1939, the BBC was ordered to cease  transmission because its broadcasts would have provided easy targets for enemy  aircraft. On June 7, 1946, the BBC came back on with the same Mickey Mouse  cartoon it was showing when it went down in 1939.  </P> <P> But the reading material is clearly secondary to the viewing material. Potter  figures most people have short concentration spans "and become quite lazy in a  museum setting," so exhibits are not only as visual as possible, but short and  visual. Twenty-four hours of British TV is condensed to three minutes in one  exhibit, for instance, while a film depicting the history of film sound rushes  by in nine.  </P> <P> There's plenty of time to linger in the gift shop, however, with its assorted  items sporting Mickey Mouse and Roger Rabbit logos, not to mention its date  book from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Or in the 3,000-square-foot  temporary exhibition showing -- extended until at least Aug. 30 -- "The Nine  Worlds of Charlie Chaplin," an exhibit on the actor's life and career,  including photographs, film clips, and personal belongings.  </P> <P> The museum's attendance is nearing the half-million mark, and Potter says many  visits run as long as five hours apiece.  </P></p>

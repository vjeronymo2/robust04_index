			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Group sees growing silver deficit THE SILVER market is facing a growing deficit which could reach 100m ounces this year, according to American Precious Metals Advisors, the consultancy group. This is contrary to a popular belief - based on faulty supply and demand data - in a surplus for the market, which is suffering from weak prices and growing warehouse stocks. 'Nothing is further from the truth,' says the group in a silver review. 'The silver market in recent years has been in deficit: industrial and coinage demand exceeds current supplies from mine production, scrap recovery and government disposals.' The review claims that most information on the silver market is wide of the mark. For example, most analyses estimate that annual photographic consumption in the past few years has been between 190m and 210m ounces. This does not include consumption by film manufacturing plants in Mexico, Brazil, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, it says. Similarly, the newly industrialised countries' use of silver in the electronics sector, the second biggest consumer of silver, is not properly accounted for in generally accepted statistics. In spite of the rapid growth of silver usage in the newly industrial countries, the accepted view is that demand outside the US, Japan and Western Europe has increased by only 10m ounces to 20m ounces since the 1970s, says the review. 'This is absolutely impossible: first, the industrialised nations have been major importers of manufactured goods - manufactured goods with high silver content - from these newly industrialised countries. Second, rising prosperity in many of those countries has led to rapid growth in domestic demand for silver-containing photographic film and electronic goods.' The review says its own statistics should be seen as 'presenting a blurred picture of reality', with total consumption, if anything understated, at 590m ounces. It puts total supply slightly down this year at 481m ounces. The real problem of the silver market is that investors, particularly in the US, 'no longer wish to hold silver that has been accumulated and hoarded for years if not decades. 'The declining price of silver reflects a continuing desire on the part of investors to reduce their portfolio holdings, But, each year, aggregate silver holdings can decline by no more than the annual deficit.' This disinvestment, which will be able to satisfy substantial market deficits for years to come, explains the declining price and the build-up in visible warehouse stocks. 'Given this situation, the only thing that will force silver prices higher during the next year is a change in investor and speculator sentiment towards silver,' the review says. While long term hoarders are abandoning silver, the market action will be dominated by the behaviour of traders and speculators. METALS Fax, weekly.

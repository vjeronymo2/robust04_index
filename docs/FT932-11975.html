			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Management: The art of guesswork - Economic forecasters can help companies predict where future profits lie Mick Marshall, economics manager at regional electricity supplier Midlands Electricity, has just handed himself a 'Golden Guru' award. Marshall's projection 18 months ago of how much electricity Midlands' customers would use in 1992-93 turned out accurate to within 1 per cent, enabling the company to gain maximum value from its power contracts. Kevin Mahoney, managing director of double-glazing company Caradon Everest, is similarly pleased. With an economic model of the hard-hit UK home improvements industry, he correctly diagnosed the broad trends in the sector over the past year, helping him to stabilise sales through cutting prices. At the Prudential insurance company, strategist John Cozens says his company made a 'very good' return last year on its Pounds 57bn asset portfolio, partly due to its foresight in converting a significant amount of its sterling holdings into other currencies months ahead of September's devaluation. These examples underline the potential for increasing business success by guessing correctly the path of economic events. In each case, the decisions owe much to companies' use of economic consultancy, a sector which has boomed despite the recession. The trend has been helped by moves within industry to contract out more specialised services on grounds of lower cost and improved flexibility. Partly because of rivalry among the consultancies, many offer services on the basis of what looks like good value for money. The typical cost of buying in a full economic service from a consultancy - taking in quarterly forecasts, reports on specific trends and access to a computer model of regional economies or specific industries - is perhaps Pounds 10,000 a year. That works out at around one sixth of the cost of hiring a full-time in-house economist. Many consultancies offer services for even less, based around individual meetings with clients or regular reports. One frequent advantage is that the customer can 'plug in' to a network of other businesses which use the same consultancy. This happens through seminars and other meetings. Leslie Gunde, chief economist at engineering group GKN, says his company spends 'a few thousand pounds' a year on services from Oxford Economic Forecasting, a UK consultancy. One spin-off is gaining access to ideas from other Oxford clients - which are in areas as diverse as computers, chemicals and banking. The move towards using economics consultancies has also been aided - somewhat paradoxically - by the unpredictability of recent economic events. Few economists foresaw the seriousness of the UK recession, the impact of the demise of communism or the high European interest rates which followed German reunification. Yet the uncertainties surrounding such changes have demonstrated the importance of having as robust a view as possible of what may lie ahead. 'In the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is king,' says Doug McWilliams, head of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, a four-strong consultancy which he started last year after a career as economic adviser at the Confederation of British Industry. It was McWilliams to whom Mahoney of Caradon Everest turned when he wanted a computerised model of the Pounds 2bn-a-year home improvements business, based on supply of double glazing for doors, windows and conservatories. For about Pounds 12,000, McWilliams provided computer software built up from consumer studies and sales data. The model predicted the 15 per cent decline in sales in the industry in the past year, a drop which Mahoney says has now levelled off amid signs of fragile recovery: 'It was a real help in our decision-making.' Midlands Electricity also used a computer model to simulate demand for electricity by its 2.1m customers. This was based on work by Business Strategies, a consultancy which specialises in UK regions and which charges Midlands about Pounds 20,000 a year. At the Prudential, the 18-strong global policy unit in which Cozens works uses the services of several economic consultancies, including the London Business School's centre for economic forecasting, Oxford Economic Forecasting and Tim Congdon's Lombard Street Research. Cozens says the outsiders are 'a comfort factor' which provides a check on in-house opinions. These views supported the suspicions of Pru economists last year that the UK would be forced to give up its fight to stay inside the European exchange rate mechanism. The UK division of International Business Machines is another member of the 16-company group - including Barclays Bank, the PosTel investment group, Sun Life and Salomon Brothers - which collaborates with the LBS on its thrice-yearly forecasts. Keith Telford, IBM's economist, says he finds invaluable the sharing of ideas with a wider group: 'The specific numbers in the forecasts are less important than the framework for trying to understand broad trends.' This point has not been lost on the UK Treasury, which has been severely criticised for the inaccuracy of its recent forecasts and is considering whether to contract out the supervision of its computerised model of the UK economy. Such a move, some believe, could improve forecasting accuracy and lead to greater openness in the Treasury's debate on the economy. Discussions about this possibility took place in January between the Treasury and DRI, a big US consultancy. If they reach a deal, the UK government would be replicating what already happens in many parts of the private sector. At United Distillers, part of the Guinness drinks group, the job of preparing economic projections which take in a broad view of social and consumer trends is left to Henley, one of the biggest UK economics consultancies. Another Henley customer is the Vauxhall car group, which asked the consultancy to prepare a Pounds 50,000 report on the potential market for its Frontera sports vehicle, launched two years ago. With the range of services on offer - the accompanying table, incidentally, does not claim to be comprehensive - companies can shop around for the consultancy which suits them best. ICI, for instance, left the LBS group for Oxford some years ago on the grounds that the latter gave a better view of world trends. Meanwhile Unilever, the big consumer products group, is examining the three consultancies it currently uses - LBS, Oxford and the US consultancy WEFA - with a view to dropping two of them in a bid to cut costs. However, Tony Romeo, Unilever's head of economics, says whichever consultancy it decides to concentrate on will continue to play a useful role in helping to give Unilever a wider view of the world.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       WHAT THE CONSULTANCIES OFFER  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Name                               Turnover**                Staff tel. number Business Strategies                Pounds 800,000            15 071-630-5959 Cambridge Econometrics             Pounds 1m                 19 0223-460760 Centre for Economics and           n/a                       4 Business Research 071-724-6260 DRI                                c.

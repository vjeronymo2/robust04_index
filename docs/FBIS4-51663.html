			<p>CSO     [Text] On 19 April, Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic  Organizations] (Keidanren) completed recommendations calling for  a review and maximum deregulation of information communications  industries regulated by the government in areas such as  telephone rate decisions and entry into class I electrical  communication industries. The recommendations state that there  is no special need to restrict market entry into the class I  communications industries currently covered by NTT and  Shindenden "because enormous capital investment requirements  preclude the easy entry of new participants merely for the  purpose of acquiring vested rights." Keidanren will work with  the government to provide for incorporation of its  recommendations in the government's information-communication  deregulation plan to be completed by the end of June.    Keidanren also compiled an opinion paper concerning the  construction of optical fiber cable networks in which the  government is attempting initiatives which calls for  "construction of optical fiber cable systems by private industry  as a matter of principle" and for the government to provide  assistance in the form of loans.    It appears that the government's Electrical Communication  Council will complete a report in June which calls for the  government to play a central role in the building of an optical  fiber cable network for use as a new information communication  network.</p>

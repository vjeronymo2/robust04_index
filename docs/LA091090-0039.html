			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> EXPOS KEEP PRESSURE ON THE PIRATES  </P> <P> The Montreal Expos never quite climbed into the pennant race in the National  League East, but they are doing their best to determine who wins it.  </P> <P> They've already prevented the Pittsburgh Pirates from running away with the  title. And they still have six games left with the second-place New York Mets.  </P> <P> Even though they lost starting pitcher Dennis Martinez in the first inning  Sunday at Pittsburgh, the Expos continued their success against the Pirates.  </P> <P> Martinez was knocked out when a line drive by leadoff batter Wally Backman hit  him in the collarbone. Although he scrambled to get the ball and threw Backman  out, Martinez couldn't continue.  </P> <P> Andres Galarraga and Mike Fitzgerald hit home runs to lead a 15-hit attack and  the Expos defeated the Pirates, 9-5. By winning two of the three games in the  series, the Expos kept the Pirates from extending their 3 1/2-game lead over  the struggling Mets.  </P> <P> For the season, the Expos, who won six of nine at Pittsburgh, are 10-5 against  the Pirates. They play three more at Montreal next weekend. The problem is that  the Expos, in third place, are 7 1/2 games behind the Pirates with 24 games to  play.  </P> <P> Martinez is 2-1 with a 1.69 earned-run average against Pittsburgh. Manager Bob  Rodgers juggled his bullpen until a four-run ninth broke the game open. Mel  Rojas (2-1) followed Martinez, giving up one run in 3 2/3 innings.  </P> <P> "We have to have the teams in front of us fall flat on their face to win it,"  Rodgers said. "Our bullpen has done the job against the Pirates."  </P> <P> The Expos built a 4-0 lead and had to survive home runs by Barry Bonds and Jeff  King. Bonds hit his career-high 26th. King hit a two-run homer in the fifth.  King has 13 home runs and seven of his last 15 hits have been home runs.  </P> <P> Philadelphia 6, New York 2 -- After another disastrous trip, the Mets return  home for the next 10 games. With the best home record (46-22) in the majors,  they expect to pull back into race in the East.  </P> <P> But they'll probably be facing mostly left-handers the rest of the season.  </P> <P> When Pat Combs held them to five hits in seven innings at Philadelphia, it was  the seventh time in their last eight games against left-handers that they've  lost. It also gave them a 2-6 record on the trip.  </P> <P> Dave Magadan, who hit a two-run homer in the top of the seventh to give the  Mets a 2-1 lead, put it succinctly. "We stink," he said.  </P> <P> Sid Fernandez (9-12) held the Phillies to four hits in six innings, but they  got three consecutive singles in the seventh to tie it. With one out, Dickie  Thon doubled in the go-ahead run.  </P> <P> Two of the Mets' most productive hitters are in slumps. Darryl Strawberry had  two hits, but he has just four hits in his last 24 at-bats. Howard Johnson has  two hits in his last 24 at-bats.  </P> <P> "We can't worry about the Pirates," Strawberry said. "We have to worry about  winning."  </P> <P> The Mets are 32-39 on the road.  </P> <P> "It hurts," Manager Bud Harrelson said. "We at least wanted to go home with a  win."  </P> <P> San Francisco 5, Houston 1 -- Giants' Manager Roger Craig almost gave slumping  Kevin Mitchell the day off at San Francisco. It's a good thing he changed his  mind.  </P> <P> Mitchell, who was hitless in his last 17 at-bats, had a run-scoring single in  the first inning, and with two out and one on in the sixth, he hit his 33rd  home run.  </P> <P> Mitchell's hitting helped Mike LaCoss (6-3), who gave up seven hits in eight  innings.  </P> <P> San Diego 5, Atlanta 4 -- With one out in the 11th inning at San Diego, Garry  Templeton hit a sharp grounder to first and Tommy Gregg's throw home was too  late to get pinch-runner Phil Stephenson.  </P> <P> Eric Show (5-8), pitched two scoreless innings to get the victory. Show has now  gone 15 1/3 consecutive innings without giving up a run.  </P> <P> St. Louis 9, Chicago 2 -- Rookie center fielder Ray Lankford had four hits,  drove in two runs and scored twice in the first Sunday night game at Wrigley  Field to lead the Cardinals.  </P> <P> John Tudor (12-4) pitching four shutout innings of relief.

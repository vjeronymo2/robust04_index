			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Arts: Mukhamedov and Company Irek Muhkhamedov has recruited nine colleagues from the Royal Ballet to join him in occasional gala peformances. Nothing wildly original in that, except that the artists are young and gifted, that Mukhamedov has had the wit to commission new choreography, and that the presentation is polished, well and honestly planned. The example of this week's Stars of the Bolshoy evening - its latter part mostly circus tricks - serves to highlight the merits of what Mukhamedov proposed for his troupe's first outing at the Derngate Theatre, Northampton. (This in itself a wise choice: the theatre has a lively policy in presenting dance and has built up a knowledgeable audience - who responded ecstatically to Tuesday's performance). No scratch orchestra, sawing Minkus into useful lengths, but two fine pianists (Paul Stobart, Tim Qualtrough) on fine pianos, and, for David Bintley's new Undine, the young Zoe Mather to play Ravel with grace. The statutory show-pieces were the Sleeping Beauty duet for Bonnie Moore and the elegant Sergiu Pobereznik, and Vaganova's Diana and Actaeon, in which Viviana Durante demonstrated a bright-edged attack, and Mukhamedov in heroic form and a gold lame mini-skirt roared into the air, making us gasp and cheer and hope that the stage was big enough to contain dancing of such scale and physical grandeur. It was the Royal Ballet's own traditions which shone in the rest of the evening, with the work of six company choreographers on view - four of them making pieces for the occasion. From Ashton's The Dream came the final duet for Titania and Oberon, lovingly done by Bonnie Moore and William Trevitt. In MacMillan's The Four Seasons, Durante and Mukhamedov blazed, and then melted into the siesta mood of the 'Summer' pas de deux. Bintley's Undine was a shimmering view of the water sprite reclaiming her faithless beloved, and, in Deborah Bull's brilliant dancing, seeming to glitter with drops of water. Portrait, by the young dancer Matthew Hart, was a sketch of a mad maestro and his lady - inventive but not fully worked out, despite sure performances from Larissa Bamber and Luke Heydon. Miss Bamber was also seen, with Michael Nunn, in an admirably judged duet by William Tuckett - The Unobtrusive Detail - set to a Chopin nocturne. It offered unisex dress (black shirts and trousers) but subtle interplay between the sexes - she dependent; he supportive - and was given with superb concentration and emotional alertness. A significant novelty was Ashley Page's Quartet. This uses a Liszt Hungarian rhapsody, and the insidious curves of the melodic line have brought a fascinating response from the choreographer. The costumes for the two couples - Deborah Bull and William Trevitt; Belinda Hatley and Michael Nunn  -are those designed for Page's Piano at Covent Garden three seasons ago. I found ideas stated in that ballet - about balance; about the potential of a distorted academic manner - shown more succinctly and more pungently in this short piece than in the ambitious (and over-decorated) Piano. Page has, in his earlier Pursuit and Carmen Arcadiae, started to re-form (and reform) a classic style. Quartet, by its simplicities as by its allusiveness, shows how well he can achieve this, and how well his dancers respond to his probing inventions. One last offering, Kasyan Goleizovsky's view of the Fledermaus waltz, looked a bit odd: it is Soviet kitsch, dependent upon a lot of roguishness with a fan, and it lies entirely outside the experience of British dancers. The gifted Belinda Hatley did what she could, but it is not a matter worth bothering her pretty head and feet about. The evening was, in all other respects, a triumph for Mukhamedov and company. At the Alhambra Theatre, Bradford, on Saturday April 18.</p>

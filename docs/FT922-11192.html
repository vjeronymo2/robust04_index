			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Arts: White Woman Street The Bush and the Irish have done it again. Sebastian Barry's White Woman Street is little more than talk, but it goes down very well on the tiny Bush stage that always manages to look bigger than it is. The setting is Ohio 1910 and, Barry being an Irish playwright, it is of course Easter. White Woman Street is the name of a town where there was once the only white whore for 500 miles around. Legend has it that she was revered like a saint; the Indian whores were not a patch on her and it was said that sailors preferred to lie with a dolphin rather than touch the Indian women. Trooper O'Hara visited the white woman some 20 years ago only to find an Indian in her place. It is widely believed that he murdered the Indian, although we learn later that she was a virgin who slit her own throat. Trooper (Jim Norton) is now on his way back to the town with a bunch of fellow drifters. They are also going to rob a train. Nothing much happens. The men talk, sleep and do a rather effective mime of riding across the Ohio landscape - a striking set designed by Kendra Ullyart. There are a mixed bunch, as big a racial mix as you can get in a quintet, including a black, a Russian whose mother was Chinese, and Blakely, the Englishman who came from Grimsby. Trooper himself came from Sligo. The only other character is the fairly westernised Red Indian barman. As an exercise in anti-climax, the build-up to the train robbery is cunningly done. We do not see it take place and are left to assume that the robbers have been fought off. Trooper emerges blood-stained, and dies thinking of Ireland. That is about it. The satisfaction is in the dialogue and the playing. Barry establishes a remarkable camaraderie between the diverse drifters. It is sentimental, as when talking about memories of Easter, but not displeasing. It shows wildly different people co-existing together and putting up with each other's moods. George Irving's Blakely perhaps stands out, but you can admire the group as a whole. The play is directed by Caroline FitzGerald, who specialises in Irish work. It is no more, and no less, than a good Irish tale. Bush Theatre, London W12, (081) 743 3388. Moves to Peacock Theatre, Dublin, May 21</p>

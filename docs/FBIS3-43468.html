Saro-Wiwa, a former national president of the Association of  Nigerian Authors, was placed under house arrest last Sunday by  soldiers in Port Harcourt, capital of the southern Rivers State,  was released on Tuesday [4 January] night. He heads the  Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People (MOSOP), a pressure  group representing about 500,000 people.    The troops surrounded his residence in the oil city and  prevented him from going out and from receiving visitors, said  the reports.    Two other MOSOP officials who were arrested on December 28  and taken to unknown destinations have also regained their  freedom, the reports said.    Saro-Wiwa was detained for about two months last year by the  regime of former president General Ibrahim Babangida for  championing the cause of the ethnic Ogoni, who have in recent  years been complaining about what they see as the neglect,  injustice and degradation suffered by their community. The  Ogoni area in Rivers State furnishes a large amount of crude  oil, the mainstay of the Nigerian economy.    The authorities arrested the three as officials called off  the celebration of "Ogoni week," scheduled to start on December  28 with a planned address by Saro-Wiwa as a guest speaker, the  reports said.    The Campaign for Democracy (CD), an umbrella organisation  representing some 40 human rights groups and pro-democracy  organisations, condemned the arrests of the Ogoni activists.</p>

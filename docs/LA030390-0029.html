			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAGAN'S TAPED TESTIMONY  </P> <P> Former President Reagan's taped deposition for the trial of Adm. John  Poindexter (Part A, Feb. 23) may act as a catalyst for some Americans to more  closely scrutinize the qualifications of future presidential candidates.  </P> <P> Iran-Contra was the stuff of mental midgets. It started as a preposterous  scheme to sell some of our most deadly weapons to a terrorist enemy in hopes of  gaining the release of some of our hostages. There was apparently insufficient  thought given to the plight of future hostages because of these actions, or to  the impact this would have upon the Iran-Iraq war.  </P> <P> According to the generally accepted account of Iran-Contra, once the President  approved of the arms for hostages plan, he stepped out of the picture, and by  so doing, gave his second-stringers the opportunity to rip-off the Ayatollah so  that the people of Nicaragua could enjoy the fruits of democracy.  </P> <P> President Reagan's defense of his actions in Iran-Contra is based upon the  dubious characteristics of lousy judgment in approving the plan, formidable  incompetence in not controlling the actions of his subordinates, and poor  memory in not recalling many of the key details. All of these traits belong out  of the White House.  </P> <P> The legacies of Iran-Contra are found in our rightful expectations of future  presidents. If we truly seek first-rate chief executives, then we should demand  the most rigorous scrutiny of candidates by our political parties and by  ourselves. On the other hand, if we are primarily interested in candidates who  make us feel good by appearing presidential, individuals who are able to  deliver good speeches, then we should hire actors.  </P> <P> MICHAEL A.

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / BBC plans 24-hour radio news network THE BBC will launch a 24-hours-a-day radio news network by early 1994, Sir Michael Checkland, the BBC director-general promised yesterday. The new network on Radio 4 long wave will cost Pounds 9m a year and be funded from efficiency and economy measures. It would allow, Sir Michael said: 'A broader range of issues and voices to be covered than is possible in existing bulletins.' He told the Radio Academy Festival in Birmingham that the money would be available in the next financial year for the extra staff. From 1995 the network would be based at the BBC Television Centre, west London, in a news and current affairs complex for radio and television. Work on FM transmitters would be brought forward so the Radio 4 audience would not lose its regular programmes because of the new network. Sir Michael also announced the setting up of a BBC Education Directorate to bring together all its educational work into a single multi-media structure. The BBC also plans to have 10 per cent of radio production made independently by 1996.</p>

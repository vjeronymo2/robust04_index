			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Management: An efficiency that runs in the blood - Public services management / Alan Pike visits Europe's biggest transfusion centre, where lives depend on a high-quality service For Belinda Phipps, the term lifeblood is more than a familiar metaphor used throughout business to describe the customers, capital and staff that are essential to success. Lifeblood really has been her business for the last three years. As managing director of South Thames Blood Transfusion Service - she is now a consultant to the London Ambulance Service - lives have depended on the quality of service she provides. Since Phipps and a new management team took over three years ago at the once poorly-regarded South Thames, efficiency has been lifted to levels that are widely admired elsewhere in the National Health Service. The reception area of the service's headquarters at Tooting, south London, gives visitors an accurate introduction to the organisation. Good lighting and plants make the best of an unexciting public-sector environment and generate an impression of calm and efficiency; yet all is done on a modest scale, avoiding any suggestion of excess or waste of money. On the wall, visible to staff and visitors, is the service's purpose statement: 'To help save and improve the lives of patients, with services and products provided through the generosity of donors.' While this might appear self-evident, it represents the outcome of a significant exercise in mind-clearing and is central to the recent efficiency improvements. When Phipps arrived from Glaxo, where she had worked for 10 years, to take up her first public-sector post she discovered staff were confused over whether the service's customers were the donors who provided the blood or the patients who received it. The purpose statement puts the patient at the centre of the exercise - the service's core job is to ensure that hospitals can always be supplied with whatever blood products are required. Britain relies entirely on volunteer blood donors, so it is essential for their confidence and co-operation to be maintained. But the practice of regarding donors as customers had led to some transfusion services, including South Thames when Phipps arrived, allowing volunteers to choose when to donate blood regardless of whether it was needed - even though, as some blood products have a short shelf life, it was sometimes never used. Phipps ordered a stop to this, setting out to ensure that amounts and types of blood collected at transfusion sessions were brought more closely into line with the requirements of hospitals. She tackled the potential problem of offending donors by approaching them individually and offering more information than they had been given in the past. The exercise has resulted in a reduction in wastage from red cells outdating to around 1 per cent, compared with a national average of 5-6 per cent. Phipps discovered that late afternoon and early evening were the most popular times for donor sessions; yet nine to five tended to be the working hours in transfusion centres, meaning much blood was not processed until a day after collection. Working arrangements of the South Thames staff were renegotiated and blood is now processed at night as well as day. Phipps, the first head of an NHS blood transfusion service to come from a non-medical background, describes the job as a combination of running a charity and a factory. This is perhaps an understatement - in addition to handling volunteers and processing their blood efficiently, the service must operate a just-in-time delivery service 365 days a year. Peter Garwood, the service's scientific director, admits that when Phipps arrived morale was low. 'She tackled this by consulting, involving and empowering all the staff with a campaign entitled '560 brains are better than one'. Now we have an organisation where change is accepted rather than feared.' The future may, however, hold more change than the innovative managers at South Thames will welcome. Under a government restructuring of blood transfusion arrangements, a new National Blood Authority has been established and the number of transfusion centres around the country is to be reduced. There are concerns in the transfusion service that this may lead to less autonomy for local managements to introduce the sort of changes that have lifted efficiency at South Thames.</p>

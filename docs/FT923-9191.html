			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Congress set to rewrite parts of the Nafta pact THE US House of Representatives will today lay the groundwork for a partial re-writing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which US, Canadian and Mexican negotiators are working to wrap up. The House is due to vote on a resolution, sponsored by more than half the members, warning that no trade pacts will be approved that jeopardise US environmental, public health and labour standards. Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, argues forcefully that the final pact will provide all the safeguards Congress desires. But Nafta is caught in the cross-fire of presidential politics and there it will remain throughout the election. The White House is apparently convinced that Nafta will provide President George Bush with a tangible link between foreign and domestic policy and an achievement which he can argue will create jobs and stimulate the US economy. Mrs Hills has been allotted a speaking role at the Republican convention later this month, where she can put the case for Nafta before the country. Governor Bill Clinton, Mr Bush's opponent, has praised the proposals put forth last week by Mr Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader. In a speech co-ordinated with other leading Democrats and the presidential campaign, Mr Gephardt called for a cross-border tax to help finance worker retraining, environmental clean-up and building infrastructure along the border. If the pact does not contain 'better wage and benefit replacement proposals' and a number of other conditions, Mr Gephardt suggested the Congress would write them into the implementing legislation. Congressional revision of Nafta would put Mexican President Carlos Salinas in an awkward position. He has sold the treaty to the Mexican public as a mechanism to push incomes up to the levels in the rest of North America. But the prospect of having to renegotiate a supposedly 'done deal,' combined with an explicit US role in drawing up Mexican environmental and labour law, raises its own problems. The overriding principle of Mexican foreign policy is non-intervention in the affairs of other countries, used largely as a way of defending itself against US interference. Unless Mr Gephardt waters down some of his more interventionist proposals, there is a possibility the Mexican government would refuse to go along with his revisions to the treaty.</p>

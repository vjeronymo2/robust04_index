But he did not rule out the  possibility of meeting with President Li Teng-hui. He said: "I  don't know whether I will meet him or not. Even if there is a  meeting, it will not be an official one. I think that it is  acceptable if one wants to have a private meeting with an old  friend."    He said that President Li Teng-hui's visit to Thailand is  simply a vacation trip which has nothing to do with the Thai  Government. Such a visit will not undermine Thai-Chinese  relations. He said that Thailand upheld the policy of having  political dialogue with Beijing only, and not Taiwan. Thailand  only has economic relations with Taiwan, which includes  investment, labor, and technology exchanges. [passage omitted]</p>

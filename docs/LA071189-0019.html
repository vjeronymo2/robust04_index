			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'PUTTING A FILM PROTEST IN FOCUS'  </P> <P> Del Olmo states that he was "at first reluctant to weigh in on the side of the  many Latinos who are angry about a recent UCLA film." He also goes on to state  that as long as the Latinos activists stick to the issue, he is with us.  </P> <P> What a gutless wimp. This is a film that insults him and our people and he is  worried about some moron's right of freedom of speech. Any real man when  insulted gets fighting mad but apparently Del Olmo has to think about it. Who  needs him.  </P> <P> Thank God we had some Chicanas at UCLA who protested against the film.  </P> <P> FERNANDO RUIZ  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

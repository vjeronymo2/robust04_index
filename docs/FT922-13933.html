			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / UK Company News: NatWest Bancorp returns to black with Dollars 16m in first quarter NATIONAL Westminster Bancorp, the US subsidiary of the UK's National Westminster Bank, returned to profit in the first three months of 1991. This was the first quarterly profit it has made in two years. Profit after tax but before extraordinary items was Dollars 16m (Pounds 9.3m), compared with a Dollars 191m loss in the first three months of 1991. The progress was due principally to a fall to Dollars 30.5m (Dollars 222m) in provisions for losses on loans. Mr John Tugwell, who took over a year ago as chairman of NatWest Bancorp, said: 'Things are looking a little more rosy.' He added that in underlying terms the US bank was making an 8 per cent annualised return on its equity, which compares with a target rate of 15 per cent. He hopes to reach that target rate in the next couple of years. It is understood that NatWest will review whether it wishes to continue owning the US bank when it is confident that the subsidiary is earning respectable profits again. NatWest Bancorp has been hurt particularly by the slump in the property market in the north-east of the US, where most of its operations are based. Mr Tugwell said that the rate at which customers were getting into difficulties had been declining rapidly. There has been a slight fall to Dollars 1.14bn (Dollars 1.15bn at the end of 1991) in the volume of loans classified as non-performing according to standards set by US banking regulators. In addition, the bank is managing properties and other assets worth Dollars 337m, down from Dollars 354m at the end of 1991, which it has taken under its control from borrowers in severe difficulties. Mr Tugwell said he has been making significant progress in reducing the costs of managing these foreclosed properties. He has, for example, negotiated discounts on the costs of insuring buildings and of hiring security guards.</p>

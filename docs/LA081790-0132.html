			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> BOYS CLUB DIRECTOR QUITS AFTER PROTESTS  </P> <P> The executive director of the Buena Park Boys Club announced his resignation  this week, less than a month after angry parents, athletes and children  protested the dismissal of Bob Eastland, a 30-year employee of the  organization.  </P> <P> Erik Larson, who was hired 11 months ago to run the club, resigned Wednesday,  according to John Leland, president of the board of directors. Leland declined  to provide details about Larson's departure; he said, however, that the recent  outcry over Eastland's dismissal played a part.  </P> <P> "I feel that there was a lot of misunderstanding as to what we were trying to  do at the Boys Club," Leland said. "He (Larson) just felt it was best."  </P> <P> Larson could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the board has offered Eastland another position which he has  accepted. Eastland, acknowledged a popular employee, was given notice in June  and told that his $40,000-a-year job had been eliminated because of a budget  crunch. Eventually, he was offered another position at substantially less pay.  </P> <P> Eastland's initial dismissal prompted about 120 protesters to picket the club  last month. Parents whose children participate in a wheelchair-hockey program  led the demonstration in an effort to reverse his dismissal. The protesters  said they were afraid that the program and others run by Eastland also would be  eliminated.  </P> <P> Eastland said he was thrilled over the recent offer despite a $10,000 pay cut.  "They are in financial trouble. Maybe as we get going, the salary will go up,"  he said, adding that the board told him he could apply for the executive  director's job vacated by Larson.  </P> <P> Since the issue over Eastland arose, two members of the board of directors have  resigned. Trustee Donna Bagley has since returned. Priscilla Atkinson,  assistant director of the Buena Park Chamber of Commerce, said that new  obligations with the city's VISION 2010 committee have forced her to leave her  post.  </P> <P> The club is not expected to fill the executive director's post for several  months, Leland said.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Budapest, 22 February (MTI) -- Four parties -- the  agrarian Federation, the Federation of Young Democrats (FIDESZ),  the Liberal Civic Alliance (Entrepreneurs' Party), and the  Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) -- signed an agreement on  Tuesday [22 February] to set up a liberal election coalition, as  preparation for the May elections.    The sides agreed that parties whose candidates cannot enter  the second round because they received insufficient votes would  support the candidate of the four parties to the agreement who  won the most votes in the first round.    Inasmuch as candidates of several parties from those signing  the agreement reach the second round, the number of votes cast  for the candidates of the signatory parties will determine who  will step down in favor of another candidate.    The parties will ensure that details of the agreement and  the  rules for stepping down be approved by their candidates.</p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Volvo underlines recovery with strong first quarter The scale of Volvo's recovery became clear yesterday when Scandinavia's biggest industrial group announced a SKr3.30bn (Dollars 418m) first-quarter pre-tax profit on higher sales, increased margins, cost-cutting and currency movements. The group has seized market share in many countries in spite of generally weak demand, helping it to swing from a loss of SKr331m a year ago to achieve its second-best quarterly result. The improved trend was highlighted at the operating level, where the company recovered from a SKr189m loss to a SKr1.96bn profit. Volvo said the performance took it back to the peak days of the late 1980s, even though the world car market was 10 per cent to 15 per cent below its 1989 level and truck demand was down 15 per cent. Asset sales played a part, as SKr1.3bn in capital gains were included at the pre-tax level. Volvo plans to sell off all its non-transport operations, including its holdings in BCP, the consumer products group, and Pharmacia, the drugs group, by the end of 1996. Disposals have reaped SKr7.9bn, helping to lower interest costs and cutting the group's net debt to SKr9.7bn at the end of the latest quarter from SKr14.5bn at the end of 1993. Second-quarter results will include a further SKr2.7bn in capital gains. Group sales rose 63 per cent to SKr37.4bn, although adjusted for currency effects and the acquisition of BCP the rise was 36 per cent. Sales of Volvo cars rose by 25 per cent to 102,200 units, taking the car group's quarterly operating income to SKr590m from a SKr150m loss. Truck deliveries were 50 per cent higher at 16,200 units. This was due to strong European demand for the new Volvo FH series and an expanding US market. Operating income was SKr821m after a SKr53m deficit. The performance helped lift Volvo B shares a further SKr10 yesterday to SKr768. This is twice the level in November, before the collapse of the group's planned merger with Renault. Volvo said it would set up a special unit on July 1, AB Fortos, to handle the sale of its remaining non-core operations. Excluding BCP, the market value of its intended divestments was SKr11.4bn in mid-May, with Pharmacia accounting for SKr8.9bn. The sale of BCP should bring in more than SKr20bn, after the company has completed its bid for the 26 per cent of BCP it does not own.</p>

			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Letter: Sovereignty and the road to interdependence Sir, Edward Mortimer, in his article on Czech/Slovak relations (Foreign Affairs, October 7), claims the viability of a constitutional half-way house is not affected by the starting point, whether it be a faltering federation such as Czecho-Slovakia or long-established nation states as in the EC. This is nonsense. In the latter case, independent states have come to comprehend the limits of their sovereignty and interdependence on others. In the former, nations of a faltering federation, by definition, resent their interdependence and one or more longs for sovereignty for the first time. It appears that interdependence can only be appreciated after experiencing full-blooded sovereignty. Klaus (economic liberal) and Havel (liberal) are correct in rejecting a half-way house. So, dare I say it, was Milosevic (communist) in the case of the former Yugoslavia. Y Kovach, 38 Lebanon Park, Twickenham, Middx TW1 3DG</p>

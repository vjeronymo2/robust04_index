			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Volvo plans SKr2bn cost cuts at ailing truck division VOLVO, the Swedish car and commercial vehicle maker, plans further severe cost cuts in the face of deepening financial problems. The company yesterday confirmed it intended to implement a SKr2bn (Pounds 196m) rationalisation programme over the next three years in its ailing truck division. The group is also believed to be considering the closure of smaller car production plants in Sweden. The most likely casualty appears to be the company's former showcase operation at Kalmar on the Baltic Sea, which employs 800 people producing the luxury 960 model. This plant was established in 1976 and won international renown for its new production techniques, involving the abolition of the traditional assembly line. The Uddevalla plant in south-west Sweden, opened in 1989, could be an alternative choice for closure. Volvo said the decision on the closure had not been taken, but last week Mr Soren Gyll, chief executive, said 'nothing was holy' in the company any longer. Any decision to close either Kalmar or Uddevalla would have social and political consequences as unemployment is climbing in Sweden. It would also be seen as a personal setback for Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo's executive president who pioneered the new methods of car production. After an emergency board meeting last Friday, Volvo told the Swedish trade unions the company was being forced to restructure its truck operations because of deteriorating market conditions in Europe and North America. All truck plant managers have been told to identify potential savings and rationalisation measures by the end of October. Mr Sten Langenius, head of Volvo's truck division, said he was convinced the cost savings and other planned moves would safeguard its future when the economic upturn came. Volvo told the unions that last year the total market for heavy trucks fell 13 per cent in Europe and in 1992 would decline a further 7 per cent. In the Nordic region, where Volvo was the market leader, there had been a 29 per cent drop in the first six months of this year. Last week Volvo announced an operating loss of SKr835m and deficit (after financial items) of SKr103m for the first six months.</p>

			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL YEARBOOK VOTED LEAST LIKELY TO SUCCEED  </P> <P> Palm Springs High School officials have sent the school's yearbook back to the  printer after finding copies filled with ethnic slurs and rude remarks about  female cheerleaders and gymnasts.  </P> <P> "Parents who have personally contacted me have said that the students would  have been devastated had the document gone out in its original form," Palm  Springs Unified School District Supt. Wilber Hawkins said Friday. "They were  pleased that it wasn't."  </P> <P> Among the offensive pages being replaced was one with a picture of a  Mexican-American club and a caption implying that the members were illegal  aliens, Hawkins said. Other pages in the book, which is named "The Chia," had  references to drug and alcohol use and sexual intercourse, officials said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Extra Cost: $11,000  </P> <P> The revisions will cost the student body an extra $11,000 and the yearbook will  not be ready for another six to eight weeks. Seniors who had been looking  forward to collecting friends' autographs in their yearbooks on Friday's final  day of school had to settle for a supplement to the yearbook that carried  photos from recent events, Hawkins said.  </P> <P> He said the district would not take any action against faculty yearbook adviser  John McKee or the students who produced the yearbook.  </P> <P> "I think that's an internal matter. That's up to the administration of the  school," Hawkins said. "There were several people who should have seen to it  that the yearbook was unpublishable in its original form."  </P> <P> Several messages seeking comment from Principal Darryl Stucker's office were  not immediately returned, his secretary said, because the principal was busy  with last-day-of-school activities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Promises Investigation  </P> <P> Stucker, who had earlier confiscated the yearbook staff's computer disks, has  promised an investigation. "We are going to look into our editing process and  find out what led to this," he said earlier.  </P> <P> However, yearbook staff member Tod Goldberg defended the book.  </P> <P> "They are worried about what parents or administrators might find offensive but  the book isn't written for them, but for the students," Goldberg said.  </P></p>

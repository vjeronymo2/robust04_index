			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / UK Company News: BCE deeper in the red at midway PRE-TAX losses of BCE Hold-ings, the distributor of snooker, billiards and pool products, grew from Pounds 20,000 to Pounds 168,000 in the six months to September 30, on turnover of Pounds 1.98m, against Pounds 2.53m. Mr David Fisher, chairman, said that the results, while disappointing, were within budget and reflected the seasonal nature of the business now that BCE had returned to its traditional core activities. The sale of the cue and snooker tables manufacturing divisions accounted for exceptional losses of Pounds 52,000 this time. Losses per share were 0.6p (0.07p) and there is again no interim dividend. In recent months, trading and profitability of the distribution division had been in line with budget despite the devaluation of the pound, but the company's amusement centres remained depressed.</p>

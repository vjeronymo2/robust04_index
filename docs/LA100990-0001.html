			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NEW DEFICIT PLAN NEARS SENATE OK;  </P> <P> BUDGET: BUSH APPEARS WILLING TO SIGN A COMPANION FUNDING MEASURE TO END  SHUTDOWN OF FEDERAL AGENCIES.  </P> <P> The Senate late Monday neared expected ratification of a new $500-billion  budget plan approved hours earlier by the House. President Bush was believed  willing to sign a companion funding measure needed to end the weekend-long  shutdown of many federal agencies.  </P> <P> The budget plan essentially revives the overall deficit-reduction targets set  by White House and congressional negotiators in the "budget summit" agreement  that was rejected by the House last Friday.  </P> <P> But the new plan junks provisions in the earlier accord detailing Medicare cuts  and new tax increases on items ranging from gasoline to beer. Instead,  Democratic-run congressional committees would be given wide leeway in drafting  the specifics of any spending cuts and tax hikes.  </P> <P> Largely in response to citizen outcries, the committees are expected to soften  Medicare cuts called for in the original plan. They also are likely to shift  more of the tax burden onto upper-income taxpayers.  </P> <P> As the Senate moved toward a vote on the new plan, congressional and  Administration officials said that they were close to agreeing on the  compromise stopgap funding bill that would enable shuttered federal agencies to  reopen and would avoid layoffs today of thousands of federal employees.  </P> <P> Democratic leaders indicated that they were willing to agree to slightly lower  domestic spending and slightly higher defense spending while the stopgap  measure would be in effect.  </P> <P> Earlier, Republican lawmakers had urged that Bush veto the stopgap bill if it  did not contain a provision requiring about $1.3 billion in across-the-board  spending cuts for the next 12 days. That is the time Congress intends to give  itself to pass implementing legislation for the new budget plan.  </P> <P> The House rejected such a provision in approving a stopgap bill early Monday.  </P> <P> Bush vetoed an earlier stopgap measure last Saturday morning and selectively  shut down much of the government in a move aimed at pressuring Congress to  approve a new deficit-reduction plan.  </P> <P> White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Monday afternoon that "we'll  send no signals" on whether Bush would sign the stopgap measure until after the  Senate had voted on the new deficit plan.  </P> <P> But a senior White House aide glumly speculated that "we're going to have to  swallow it" because of the behavior of rebellious House Republicans, who helped  sink the original package, which Bush had promoted heavily in a nationally  televised appeal.  </P> <P> House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash) said Monday night: "I am optimistic that  this can be resolved tonight, or early in the morning, and that this  unnecessary and artificial crisis can be ended."  </P> <P> Senate Republican and Democratic leaders also said that Bush appeared to offer  no objection to the new deficit-reduction plan.  </P> <P> However, Sen. Wyche Fowler Jr. (D-Ga.), who has represented Senate Majority  Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) in budget negotiations, said that "all  signals from the White House have been weak, spasmodic and intermittent the  last few days."  </P> <P> As he struggled to work out an agreement to speed consideration of the budget  matter, Mitchell told colleagues Monday night that prompt action was  imperative.  </P> <P> Alluding to federal employees who face being sent home from work today if no  operating funds are approved, Mitchell said: "We're not just dealing with  numbers but with individual human beings and their families -- their hopes and  fears and concerns."  </P> <P> Fowler and other Senate leaders were optimistic that the plan would be  supported by most of the 55 Democrats and by less than a majority of the 45  Republicans.  </P> <P> "I believe we are going to pass it with substantial Republican votes," Fowler  said. "Then we are going to roll up our sleeves and go to work on  reconciliation" -- budget jargon for the process of reconciling the plan's  vague money targets with specific tax increases and program cuts.  </P> <P> Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M.), ranking minority member of the Senate Budget  Committee, said that he, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and a number  of other Republicans would vote for the plan's outline "because it moves the  process along."  </P> <P> Domenici said that the current plan "maintains the basic framework" of the  original budget package approved by White House and congressional negotiators.  </P> <P> However, Domenici said after a GOP caucus that a number of other Republicans  will vote against it because they believe that implementing committees will  make unacceptable changes in the original plan's details, which were widely  supported by GOP senators.  </P> <P> Domenici said that he is drafting a letter in which Republican senators would  declare that they would not support implementing legislation unless it met  certain tests.  </P> <P> There could be no "smoke and mirrors" -- that is, ostensible cuts unlikely to  produce savings, he said. Further, he declared, final laws would have to  provide the full $500-billion in deficit-reduction over five years and revenue  increases could not exceed the $118.8 billion outlined in the plan's blueprint.  </P> <P> Moreover, cuts in Medicare and other entitlement programs would have to total  at least $107.4 billion. And spending-cut enforcement mechanisms and budget  process reforms spelled out by the budget negotiators would have to be  included, Domenici said.  </P> <P> Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), co-author of the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law  that helped force production of the current plan, said that he would vote  against the revised version.  </P> <P> "It's a promise, not a program," he said. "It's easy to pass a promise. It's  tough to pass a program."  </P> <P> In a related development, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen  (D-Tex.) said that he believes the final package will raise income taxes on  top-bracket payers in exchange for lowering the tax on capital gains, or  profits from investments.  </P> <P> Bentsen said that the change would be part of a Democratic effort to make the  tax increases more equitable for low- and middle-income payers, who would be  hit disproportionately hard by proposed tax hikes on gasoline, alcoholic  beverages and cigarettes.  </P> <P> "You just can't have a package that hits the average family that much," he  said.  </P> <P> A deal on capital gains faltered in the recent budget talks when Administration  negotiators resisted Democratic demands to raise the income tax rate on the  wealthiest taxpayers to 33% from 28%. The Administration reportedly refused to  go above 31%.  </P> <P> Sen. Robert W. Kasten Jr. (R-Wis.) said that he and most other Senate  Republicans and Bush are opposed to raising marginal income tax rates under any  circumstances.  </P> <P> "And in my discussions with the President and (his chief of staff, John H.)  Sununu, they have been opposed to that trade, too," he said.  </P> <P> Staff writers David Lauter and Michael Ross contributed to this story.  </P></p>

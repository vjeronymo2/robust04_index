			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NASA DENIES SPACE STATION FLAWS  </P> <P> NASA disputed a report Monday that a planned $30-billion space station is  seriously flawed because it would begin to wear out and require extensive  maintenance before it is completed.  </P> <P> William Lenoir, associate administrator for space flight for the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration, said problems outlined in a story in the  New York Times and repeated in the Los Angeles Times are not new and will be  overcome once the proposed station, called Freedom, reaches the construction  stage.  </P> <P> In a statement, Lenoir said questions about the space station's durability  "apparently result from a worst-case scenario that NASA used in a normal risk  analysis assessment during the station's preliminary design phase."  </P> <P> "This scenario is not considered credible," he said, adding that scientists  assume "unrealistically pessimistic" conditions to make sure the space station  can withstand the rigors of orbiting Earth.  </P> <P> The newspaper, citing NASA sources, said anticipated maintenance problems could  force a redesign of the 400-foot-long station, which is the centerpiece of the  U.S. space program in the 1990s and beyond.  </P></p>

			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: Finlay Packaging Pounds 576,000 in red As trading losses at Olympic Containers, its composite container subsidiary, rose from Pounds 176,000 to Pounds 844,000, Belfast-based Finlay Packaging finished 1990 with a loss of Pounds 576,000, compared to a profit of Pounds 270,000. At the halfway mark the deficit was Pounds 300,000. Reflecting confidence in the core activities, however, the directors are recommending a final dividend; it is 0.75p for a total of 1.5p, against 4p, from losses per share of 5.26p (earnings 2.02p). Olympic is being run down for closure on May 3, in view of the losses and no possibility of recovery. A provision of Pounds 650,000 is being made against further losses and cost of closure; along with Pounds 120,000 costs arising from litigation against the vendors of Olympic, that makes up a Pounds 770,000 extraordinary provision. Turnover for the year was Pounds 11.16m (Pounds 11.05m) of which discontinuing activities accounted for Pounds 2.34m (Pounds 2.57m).</p>

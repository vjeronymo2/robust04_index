			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Different aims, common cause: Complex pressures led 18 Asian-Pacific countries to form the Apec trading bloc A year ago the Seattle summit, this week the Jakarta summit, and now a big bang: all trade and investment is to be liberalised in a region accounting for half the world's economic activity. It is little wonder the 18 leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum felt exhilarated. The final statement required a consensus across enormous political and economic diversity, between countries with some seriously strained relations. Ranging from the US and Japan, two of the world's richest economies, to China, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, with among the lowest per capita incomes, Apec's members have reached agreement at remarkable speed. Their differences, and the extended timetable envisaged for liberalisation, raise questions about whether the plan can ever be fully realised. It calls for Apec's industrialised members to remove their trade and investment barriers by 2010, and for developing economies to do so by 2020. By then, most of the leaders who met in Jakarta will be long out of office, forgotten or dead. However, the importance of this week's decision lies less in the long-range targets that it set than in the commitment of Apec leaders to a continuing process of high-level negotiation. By calling for a detailed blueprint for regional liberalisation before their next summit, in Osaka a year from now, they have obliged themselves to produce at least some tangible short-term results or risk loss of political face. That they have got this far is due to the convergence of a complex set of domestic and external pressures. Last year's Seattle summit was prompted by a common desire to kick-start the Uruguay Round negotiations, which were then stalled. Many Apec members believe that, by presenting a united front in Seattle and hinting that the grouping could become an alternative to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade if the round failed, they prodded the EU into making the concessions needed to conclude the world trade talks. Beyond that, the 18 governments' motives differ. The US views Apec primarily as a tool for prising open fast-growing Asian markets and for pressing Europe into further trade concessions. Australia broadly shares these objectives and also sees the grouping as a way to prevent economic isolation by establishing itself as part of the Asian region. But for Japan and many other Asian countries, the main purpose of Apec is to guarantee their access to the US market. They hope the grouping will keep US trade policy engaged internationally, at a time when Washington's commitment to multilateralism appears increasingly ambivalent. China, meanwhile, believes that Apec membership will help buttress its bid to join the new World Trade Organisation, which is due to succeed the Gatt in January. Satisfying these disparate aims may not be easy in a grouping that prides itself on operating by consensus and is keen to avoid institutionalised decision-making. That consensus has already been strained by the evident reluctance with which Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister and long a sceptic about Apec's ambitions, went along with this week's summit declaration. How deep the 18 countries' differences run may become clear soon, when they start trying to hammer out a trade liberalisation programme. They face a daunting set of challenges. There is no agreement yet even on how far the plan should cover services as well as goods. Nor is there any decision on how to tackle agriculture, a sector that is highly protected and politically sensitive in much of Asia. Equally uncertain is whether the US will consent to curbs on its increasingly frequent use of anti-dumping measures against low-priced imports, most of them from Asia. The crunch question, though, is how far the benefits of freer trade within Apec should be extended to the rest of the world. This week's summit firmly rejected any move towards an inward-looking trading bloc. It declared that the removal of barriers in the region should be fully consistent with Gatt principles and designed to strengthen the multilateral trade system. The implication, to which most Apec members subscribe, is that the goal should be to achieve enough progress to trigger another Gatt world trade negotiating round. Views diverge widely, however, on how this objective should be achieved  - and, by extension, on what sort of creature Apec should aim to become. The US, and to some extent Australia, believe Apec should offer the benefits of its planned liberalisation to non-members only if they first agree to reciprocate by opening their own markets further. In Washington's case, this view is heavily coloured by domestic politics. The timetable agreed this week would oblige the US to remove barriers to imports from China and other developing countries 10 years before they opened their markets fully to US exports. The belief is that Congress would approve such a deal only if Apec also promised to help the US extract bigger trade concessions from other trading partners, notably in Europe. However, such an approach could accentuate concerns that the US will use Apec to narrow further national interests. Though fears of US domination are voiced openly only by Dr Mahathir, they are shared privately by countries such as Japan and China. Both have already been targets of increasingly aggressive US trade diplomacy, backed by the threat of unilateral trade sanctions. As a result, many Asian members are anxious to keep Apec as open as possible to the rest of the world and to ensure that it does not undermine the pre-eminence of the Gatt and the WTO. Indeed, Thailand argues that the grouping's priority should be simply to build support for another Gatt round, after which it should take a back-seat role. For all these reasons, there seems little immediate likelihood that Apec will develop into a bloc that is bent on putting its members' interests above those of the world economy as a whole. The prognosis could change quickly, though, if the US Congress failed to ratify the Uruguay Round in a fortnight's time. In that event, the risk of indefinite further delays and uncertainties about the future of the Gatt could induce some Apec countries to look again at the grouping as an alternative to the multilateral trade system. But even if that does not happen, Apec's leaders will remain under pressure to keep up the momentum generated by this week's summit. Though success is far from guaranteed, so much political prestige has been invested in the enterprise that the fall-out from outright failure would spread right through the Pacific rim region, and quite probably beyond. If only for reasons of self-esteem, that is a risk none of the leaders can contemplate with equanimity.  ----------------------------------------------               INTRAREGIONAL TRADE           Percent of total world trade  ----------------------------------------------                   1969     1979     1985   1990  ---------------------------------------------- East Asia          2.9      4.2      6.4    7.9 North America      6.9      4.2      6.4    5.3 Pacific region    16.9     15.6     24.8   24.6 Western Europe    28.7     29.3     27.1   33.8  ---------------------------------------------- Sources: World Bank staff estimates, Petri  ----------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A sewage spill Friday closed a small part of Mission Bay, county health  authorities reported.  </P> <P> The spill occurred at about 8:30 a.m. when grease in a line caused sewage to  flow from a manhole in the 3200 block of Bayside Lane. The sewage then traveled  into a storm drain at Ventura Place and Bayside Walk and emptied into Santa  Barbara Cove.  </P> <P> County health officials estimated that about 2,400 gallons of sewage reached  the bay before the spill was stopped at 10:30 a.m.  </P> <P> Warning signs were posted on the beach 100 feet in both directions from the  drain pipe. The signs will remain until the water is again safe for  recreational use.  </P></p>

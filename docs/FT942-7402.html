			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Tennessee (8): Excessive brain power - Profile / Oak Ridge High Technology Facility How do you create a new Silicon Valley, or a Research Triangle - the area in North Carolina circumscribed by three universities and home to many high-tech companies? If there is an answer, then Tennessee would like to know it. The nurturing of high-technology industries has become a priority in the area around Knoxville, in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains. The region boasts one of the highest concentrations of scientists in the country. Keeping them employed will provide a stiff challenge in the years to come. The area's excessive brain power is centred on Oak Ridge. A Department of Energy-funded facility operated by contractor Martin Marietta Energy Systems, Oak Ridge will forever be known as the place where the first atomic bomb was developed. It has developed skills other than building nuclear weapons since then: but the ending of the cold war has hit the facility's budget hard. Along with pressure to generate new sources of income by commercialising its technologies, this has forced Oak Ridge to try to turn itself into a centre for innovation of a different sort, a sort of godfather to new high-tech industries in and around east Tennessee. Oak Ridge employs 16,000 people, on an annual budget from the Department of Energy of Dollars 1.6bn - but is under pressure to cut back. 'Employment levels will drop. Budgets will drop,' says Mr Bill Martin, vice-president in charge of technology transfer at Martin Marietta. How far and how fast 'depends on how much private sector money becomes involved.' In the 1980s, Oak Ridge lost several thousand jobs when its uranium enrichment plant was closed. It was older and less efficient than similar operations elsewhere in the US, and shut in the face of overcapacity in the enrichment business. The threat now is gradual erosion of the Department of Energy budget rather than outright closure of facilities. Oak Ridge's workers are split roughly evenly into three units. A third works in the area of national security. Oak Ridge has not built an atomic warhead for three years. It is charged, though, with maintaining the US's supply of weapons-grade uranium, and developing the sort of advanced manufacturing techniques used in making warheads - from the latest machining and inspection technology to robotics. Those manufacturing skills, honed in a highly specialised area, are now being applied to more mundane industries. Two years ago, Oak Ridge began a project with the state of Tennessee to offer help to small businesses. Last year, its people worked on 350 projects for private sector manufacturers. Another third of the employees works on energy conservation and efficiency. This began more than two decades ago with work on the peaceful use of nuclear power, and extended into ways to make better and cleaner use of fossil fuels. Oak Ridge also broadened out into energy conservation, working on projects such as better insulation materials. Development work extends from 'roof insulation to devices that enhance the running of refrigerators,' says Bill Martin. The final third are involved in environmental technologies. This is one part of the Oak Ridge operations which has actually grown in the 1990s. What can these people do to help foster high-tech industries in the region - and in the process safeguard their own jobs? One aim has been to develop patentable technologies that can be licensed to companies in the private sector. To encourage innovation among its staff, Oak Ridge shares a quarter of the licensing income it receives with employees. Since 1984, it has signed 103 such licensing agreements. The income remains modest - a total of Dollars 2.5m in royalties so far, from commercial sales of Dollars 100m - but there are some promising developments in the pipeline. One example is a method for carrying out rapid blood tests, which has been licensed to a Californian company. Already used to analyse samples from animals, the process is awaiting approval for use on human blood, and could eventually find a market in hospitals and doctors' surgeries throughout the US. From the wide range of technologies that has been developed at Oak Ridge, Bill Martin singles out two as having the greatest potential: instrumentation and advanced materials. A second aim is to attract private investment to help commercialise developments begun at Oak Ridge. So far, some Dollars 200m of private capital has been committed. The bigger question, though, remains: Can Oak Ridge foster a local high-tech industry in east Tennessee? Optimists talk about a 'corridor' extending from Oak Ridge to Knoxville, home of the University of Tennessee - no doubt hoping to emulate the successful Austin-San Antonio high-tech corridor in Texas. Much work needs to be done before their dream becomes a reality. Local chambers of commerce, industrial development boards and marketing organisations have recently begun research into whether the region has sufficient infrastructure to sustain a thriving manufacturing base - from the availability of skilled workers and adequate telephone lines to the provision of finance. The results will not emerge until this summer. One significant challenge is to make the staff at Oak Ridge more responsive to the outside world. The nature of much of their work in the past, and their location - tucked away in a valley 30 miles from Knoxville - has encouraged an inward-looking, isolated community. 'There is a tremendous amount of resources in the area,' says Mr Martin. 'Has the region benefited enough from that? No.'</p>

Both the Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD] leadership as well as the Christian Social Union accused  Kinkel on Friday [18 March] of having overreacted by "summoning"  French Ambassador Francois Scheer, thus damaging relations  between Bonn and Paris. Kinkel, on the other hand, said in an  interview with SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG that German-French relations  are "of utmost and primary importance." After difficult years  Bonn and Paris have found a special relationship of a friendly  nature. This must be preserved at any cost. The German-French  relationship is of utmost importance for Europe. "I will not  permit any shadow to fall on that," Kinkel said.    Deputy SPD Chairman Oskar Lafontaine -- commissioner for the  cultivation of German-French cultural relations -- said that the  tensions that have now erupted between Paris and Bonn have been  building for some time. Since the fall of the Wall in 1989 the  Federal Government has made "several serious mistakes" in its  European policy, he said in an interview with SUEDDEUTSCHE  ZEITUNG. "We must make efforts to again improve the relationship  with Paris." As an example Lafontaine cited the fact that in  1989 Chancellor Helmut Kohl had not coordinated his 10-point  catalogue on German unification with French President Francois  Mitterrand. "This was not in the spirit of the German-French  treaty."    Later on, in the policy toward Yugoslavia or regarding  questions of German financial policy, chancellor and foreign  minister "did not exercise the necessary restraint and care in  dealing with France," Lafontaine added. In the future important  foreign policy decisions must "again be coordinated in the  spirit of classical diplomacy and partnership." [passage omitted]</p>

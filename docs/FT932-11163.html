			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Mixed performances from Continental bourses THERE were some mixed performances among bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS weakened in low turnover, the CAC-40 index losing 13.34 to 1,923.63, off the day's high of 1,943 and a low of 1,914. Turnover was just FFr1.7bn. Hoare Govett, in its latest strategy document, comments that after a strong first quarter the market has now entered a period of consolidation. 'Economic fundamentals and corporate results still have the capacity to disappoint, while the prospect of privatisations worth FFr30bn to FFr40bn by the end of the year, as well as a number of cash calls, is likely to weigh heavily on the market,' the brokers comment. 'In the short term we expect trading to remain volatile, but the immediate risks suggest that it is unlikely to be able to convincingly regain its levels of the end of the first quarter.' Peugeot slipped FFr6 to FFr544 as it reported a 17 per cent decline in new car sales for April, while Euro Disney eradicated all of Monday's gains, down FFr2.75 at FFr73.10. FRANKFURT fell back from a day's high of 1,636 with the DAX index closing down 1.79 at 1,627.37 in turnover of DM5.3bn. During the session a Bundesbank council member said that he favoured more rapid cuts in short-term interest rates to help economic recovery. However, a contrary view came from the Federation of German Banks which said that faster, deeper rate cuts would not automatically lead to recovery. Car stocks were mixed with Volkswagen gaining DM2.50 to DM325.50 and Daimler losing DM3.00 to DM574.50. Volkswagen has been one of the best performing DAX stocks in the first four months of 1993, according to data supplied by Merck Finck, showing a 33 per cent gain, while Daimler recorded a less impressive 7 per cent rise. In a recent report on the car sector Bank Julius Bar, notes that Daimler will face a drastic decline in results in 1993; but with cost reduction measures and the introduction of the new compact class from this summer, a turnaround can be expected in 1994-1995. AMSTERDAM was slightly easier ahead of today's results from Philips, off 30 cents at Fl 25.30. The CBS Tendency index closed down 0.4 at 107.2. Goldman Sachs has a positive view of Philips given its reduction in net debt, management changes, and significant job cuts, primarily in consumer electronics. The brokers estimate an eps of Fl 1.00 for 1993 and Fl 3.00 for 1994. They forecast a first quarter loss of 30 cents per share relative to year-ago earnings of 53 cents. MILAN maintained its firmer trend amid optimism that the political situation was stabilising although trading was restrained ahead of tomorrow's parliamentary confidence vote on the government's programme. The Comit index added 7.41 or 1.38 per cent to 546.03. Blue chips and telecommunications stocks that are widely held outside Italy were at the centre of buying attention. Stet, the state telecommunications holding company, rose L25 to L2,660 in the wake of Monday's announcement that 1992 consolidated net profit rose 0.8 per cent. Sip rose L7 to L1,948 in heavy volume of more than 11m shares on the telematic trading system. Among industrial blue chips, Fiat rose L75 to L6,850 and Montedison added L26 to L1,229. In the financial sector, Ras added L211 to L26,053 as the insurer said net profit fell 53 per cent in 1992 as a result of extraordinary charges. ZURICH was higher, helped by a firmer chemicals sector and renewed interest in Nestle. The SMI index rose 7.2 to 1,260. Nestle returned to favour, having been neglected for some time. The bearer and registered stocks each rose SFr15 to SFr1,100 and SFr1,090 respectively, ahead of next week's annual news conference. Ciba-Geigy, continuing to gain support from brokers' recommendations, rose SFr6 to SFr610. Holderbank bearers dipped SFr2 to SFr628 after it left the 1992 dividend unchanged. BRUSSELS fell back, the Bel-20 index finishing down 7.93 at 1,181.59 in turnover of some BFr1.2bn. Petrofina fell for the fourth consecutive day, down BFr160 at BFr8,220. COPENHAGEN gained 2.4 per cent in fairly sizeable trading due to foreign buying and a dearth of sellers. The KFX index rose 2.02 to 86.79. The KFX June future, indicating the market view of medium-term prospects, rose 1.85 to 90.35 with interest centred on the shipping and banking sectors. STOCKHOLM advanced in heavy trading led by gains in Ericsson and Astra. The Affarsvarlden index rose 9.2 to 1041.4 in turnover of SKr1.13m from Monday's SKr635m. An SKr11 advance to SKr687 by Astra's B shares was attributed to rising prices for pharmaceuticals issues in New York. LM Ericsson's B shares rose SKr13 to an all-time high of SKr284, boosted by news and rumors of major orders. Expectations of a strong first-quarter earnings report next week also played a part. OSLO fell sharply on disappointing results. The All-share index dropped 7.07 or 1.5 per cent to 475.65 in turnover of NKr490m. ISTANBUL fell nearly 3 per cent as investors took profits after recent strong gains. The index closed down 224.57 at 7,580.74.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- May 4                                               THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                 Open       10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100         1153.56     1153.43    1152.49    1151.07 FT-SE Eurotrack 200         1213.73     1211.72    1212.41    1210.85  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                13.00       14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100         1149.72     1148.70    1148.18    1148.16 FT-SE Eurotrack 200         1210.18     1208.28    1207.32    1207.82  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Apr 30    Apr 29    Apr 28    Apr 27    Apr 26  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1144.33   1143.23   1154.98   1149.08   1152.81 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1206.79   1199.62   1212.69   1213.85   1218.66  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1153.79; 200 - 1214.08 Low/day: 100 - 1147.10 200 - 1207.09.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "New Poll Encouraging For Christian </F> Democratic Appeal"]    [Text] The CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] and PvdA  [Labor Party] seem to be running neck-in-neck on which party  will be the biggest after the elections. This was revealed in a  poll conducted by the Inter/View office on behalf of ANP Press  Agency and Nova. The figures indicate that both parties would  attract exactly the same number of voters, i.e., 21.2 percent,  which would give them 33 seats each.    Inter/View gave the CDA more of a chance than NIPO  [Netherlands Institute for Public Opinion Polls], which forecast  the day before yesterday that the Christian Democrats would get  only 28 seats. Inter/View says that the divergent results  reflect the offices' different polling methods.    CDA leader Brinkman was happy with the figures published by  Inter/View: "A 10 percent gain in one day, that is what I call  an advance," he said during an electoral meeting in Assen  yesterday.    On that occasion, he criticized his colleagues Wim Kok  (PvdA)  and Bolkestein (VVD -- People's Party for Freedom and  Democracy). Last weekend, the latter expressed their intention  to govern with the D66 [Democrats 66] after the elections. A  third party, necessary for a parliamentary majority, could then  join them. Brinkman says: "I am not going to form a cabinet  right now. Let us first wait for the voters' verdict."    Lower Chamber President Deetman (CDA) also criticized the  present coalition partner, PvdA. Deetman agrees with Prime  Minister Lubbers, who blamed the PvdA last week for making a  "turn to the left." Deetman discerned the PvdA's more left-wing  orientation from statements by PvdA leader Kok. Together with  the D66, the latter wants to see to it that left-wing ministers  are in the majority in a new cabinet.    Yesterday night in Assen, the Chamber president cautioned  his  fellow party members for a progressive policy. "Social security  will fall apart then because, instead of changing the system,  all hopes will be placed on better times." Deetman also fears  that a cabinet where the "left" will be in the majority will not  cut the budget deficit sufficiently, which in his view will be  detrimental for employment.</p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: Accor earnings fall to FFr109m in first half NET profits at Accor, the French hotel and tourism group, fell to FFr109m (Dollars 18.8m) in the first half from FFr137m last time as the fiercely competitive condition of the European hotel business took its toll, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. The group, still burdened by heavy debts following the acquisition in 1991 of Wagons-Lits, the Belgian travel group, also warned of a fall in net profits for the full financial year. It said that although the seasonal nature of its business meant the second half would be better than the first, it expected net profits to settle at between FFr550m and FFr650m for the full year.</p>

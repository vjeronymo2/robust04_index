			<p>BFN     [Text] The Foreign Ministry says it believes that ties  between Singapore and the United States are robust enough to  weather any difficulties caused by Michael Fay's caning. A  Ministry spokesman says he hopes both sides would focus on their  larger mutual interests and put this incident behind them. He  said the United States and Singapore have always enjoyed the  strong relationship based on many common interests and shared  strategic objectives. The spokesman said it would be  regrettable if the action of one individual who transgressed  Singapore law and had been punished according to the law were  allowed to affect bilateral relations.    The spokesman was responding to a statement by the acting  spokesman for the U.S. State Department, Christine Shell. The  statement was issued after a meeting between Assistant Secretary  of State Winston Lord and Singapore Ambassador S.R. Nathan. The  statement noted Mr. Lord said the incident would have to be  taken into account in the overall relationship between the U.S.  and Singapore.</p>

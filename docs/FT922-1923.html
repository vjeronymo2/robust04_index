			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Maxwell's will: controlling an image beyond the grave ROBERT MAXWELL'S last will and testament reveals a man determined to control his image beyond the grave. He left a total of more than Pounds 2m to his family and friends, with the rest of his personal estate going to causes including world peace, the defence of Israel and the eradication of Alzheimer's disease and cancer. But beneficiaries who brought the Maxwell family or Maxwell companies 'into disrepute' would lose their inheritance. Any who unsuccessfully challenged the will would see their legacy cut to only Pounds 1,000. The Financial Times has obtained a copy of the will, drawn up on July 12 1987 and amended on December 30 1990. The will's authenticity has independently been confirmed by a lawyer involved in its preparation. Maxwell left money to an Israeli synagogue to ensure that 'prayers be said in perpetuity' for himself and his close relations on the anniversaries of their deaths. He asked to be buried in an orthodox Jewish cemetery in Jerusalem in accordance with orthodox rites. Ms Jean Baddeley, Maxwell's former secretary and a close friend, inherits Pounds 100,000 and 'shall continue to be employed in and about the management of my estate . . .on the most generous terms of compensation'. Robert Maxwell's widow, Elisabeth, inherits Pounds 500,000 and three apartments in France. Each of Maxwell's seven children is to receive Pounds 200,000. His sister, Sylvia Rosen, inherits Pounds 150,000. Helene Atkin and Michael Atkin, a niece and nephew, inherit Dollars 100,000 each. Maxwell left everything else in his personal estate to charitable organisations. For years, however, the ultimate owners of the Maxwell corporate empire have been secretive offshore trusts in Liechtenstein and, recently, Gibraltar. Investigators are now attempting to penetrate the confidentiality that shields these trusts. The named beneficiaries of the will may not receive anything. If creditors force the estate into bankruptcy, they will rank above anyone mentioned in a will. The document was given to the FT by Mr Frank Field, the Labour MP who chaired the House of Commons select committee on social security which held hearings into the Maxwell affair. Mr Field declined to identify his source except to say he was satisfied the person had intimate knowledge of Maxwell's personal affairs. In explaining his release of the confidential documents, Mr Field said: 'A person approached me who was mortified about what happened to the pensioners and concerned about the apparent lack of activity. I was asked to place this information with the FT in the hope that other people who know part of the story would come forward.' Mr Field said he had been told that the bulk of Maxwell's assets was stored in roughly a dozen charitable trusts based in Liechtenstein and that not even Mr Kevin Maxwell knew the location of all the assets at the time of his father's death. Much of the assets consisted of shares in various Maxwell companies and the value of current holdings is unclear. The will in full, Page 9</p>

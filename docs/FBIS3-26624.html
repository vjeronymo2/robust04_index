			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Xie Yicheng: "Transport Facilities To Gain Facelift"] </F>   [Text] Transportation facilities will get a major boost in  1994 to match the nation's expected economic growth rate of 9  percent.    To support this goal, greater efforts will be made to  recruit  foreign investment and technology, said officials from the  Ministry of Communications.    China is poised this year to add 18,000 kilometres of new  highways.    The figure includes 960 kilometres of expressways and other  high-grade roads, which will be funded by the ministry and local  governments.    These new road projects include the major cross-country  trunklines bisecting the mainland from north to south and from  east to west.    One of the two cross-country lines runs from Tongjiang in  northernmost Heilongjiang Province to Sanya in southern-most  Hainan Province. The other extends from Beijing to Zhuhai in  Guangdong Province, running parallel to the Beijing-Guangzhou  Railway.    The first of the two east-west lines runs from Lianyungang  in  coastal Jiangsu Province to Korgas in the Xinjiang Uygur  Autonomous Region, alongside the new Euro-Asian Continental  Railway. And the second line links Shanghai in East China with  Chengdu in Sichuan Province, largely following the route of the  Chang Jiang River.    The blueprint also calls for 59 new seaport berths with an  increased cargo-handling capacity of nearly 31 million tons per  year. Last year, 19 deep-water coastal berths were built, four  more than originally planned.    In addition, 370 kilometres of inland waterway lanes will  get  facelifts and l9 new river berths will be built, with an  increased handling capacity of 3.2 million tons.    The ministry seeks substantial foreign investment this year  in developing transportation facilities--above and beyond  existing loans.    Some State-owned firms, handling the building and operation  of highways, bridges or berths, may issue stocks and bonds  abroad to recruit foreign investment, a ministry official said.    Foreign investment for transportation facilities was at a  record high last year, the official said, although actual  figures were not cited.    Last October, the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa-led  consortium signed a major joint venture contract with China to  develop the Yantian Port of Shenzhen into a world-class harbour.    The project's first phase, including two 50,000-ton  container  berths and four general cargo berths, has already been placed in  service.    The project's second phase will consist of three 50,000-ton  container berths, scheduled to open in 1995.    Meanwhile, businesses from the United States, the Republic  of  Korea, Malaysia and other countries are negotiating with Chinese  authorities to build and manage such road projects as the  Jilin-Changchun and Fuzhou-Guangzhou expressways.    By the end of 1993, China's road and port construction has  used up to $1.7 billion in loans from the World Bank, Asia  Development Bank and the Japanese Government.    This year the ministry will continue to open the land and  water transportation market to the outside world in "a moderate  way," said the official.    By the end of last year, the ministry had endorsed 381  Sino-joint ventures for the development of highway  transportation, 86 for waterway shipping, and 66 for vehicle  repair work.</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Hongkong Bank may curb home lending Hongkong Bank, the colony's biggest mortgage lender, may tighten lending to 60 per cent on mass-market homes from the current 70 per cent following an 18 per cent year-on-year surge on loans last month. The bank, which is estimated to have a 28 per cent share of the domestic mortgage market, saw new loans tip HKDollars 2bn (Pounds 170m) in May. Mr Edwin Lau, head of retail banking at Hongkong Bank, said: 'We are concerned that we have been taking in a lot of new mortgages every month despite all earlier measures, and we don't want to reach the stage where we have to say to the market: 'Hongkong Bank will no longer accept mortgages. . . We feel we might have to do something sooner rather than later.' He said the bank was considering tightening lending by 10 per cent. Requiring home buyers to put up deposits of 40 per cent on medium-sized properties worth less than HKDollars 5m is unlikely to have more than a limited impact on property prices - it would follow two rounds of banking curbs in 10 months - but analysts say it may undermine government measures to damp rising house prices. Reduced loan ceilings could force buyers into the primary market, where special financing deals prevail. This pre-sale market is one of the key targets of the government measures: under the new rules, buyers cannot sell on the entitlement to an uncompleted flat - which in effect leaves them sitting on a non-liquid asset for some six months. Developers such as Hutchison Whampoa, the ports-to-property hong controlled by Mr Li Ka-shing, offer loans of up to 85 per cent of property price. Developers have been cutting prices by around 10 per cent in recent months, since the government's intentions on property were first signalled. Hutchison is bringing some 80 flats to market this week at HKDollars 5,112 per square foot, 10 per cent below the HKDollars 5,700 per square foot peak price achieved in the same development's last sell-off three months ago. The development, South Horizons, is exempt from government curbs on resale as consent to assign was granted to the entire development before the measures were introduced. Hang Seng Bank, the listed Hong Kong banking subsidiary of HSBC, is also keeping a watching brief on mounting loan applications, although it has no plans now to introduce further curbs.</p>

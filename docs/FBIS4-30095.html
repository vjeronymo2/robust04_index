			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Ill-Boding Military </F> Movements"]    [Text] The situation on the Korean peninsula has been  further aggravated due to the maneuvers by the U.S. imperialists  and the South Korean puppets to crush [apsal] the Republic. At  such a time, very ill-boding [simsangchi annun] military  activities have taken place at U.S. military bases in Yokosuka,  Iwakuni, Sasebo, Okinawa, and other places in Japan.    U.S. warships have frequently entered and left the Yokosuka  base, the sortie base of the 7th U.S. Fleet. The large  destroyer (Pipe) sailed into port, and the fleet's flagship,  Blue Ridge, followed suit on the morning of 17 June. The  missile cruiser Mobile Bay and four other U.S. warships are now  anchored at this base. The aircraft carrier Independence, which  participated in the Rimpac-94 joint military exercise, will  reportedly return there.    A U.S. Marine ammunition transport ship recently harbored at  this base and for two days unloaded a large amount of ammunition  for the (Urago) ammunition repository.    In the meantime, U.S. military planes from the Iwakuni base,  a U.S. Marine air base, busily conducted an exercise; and more  and more nuclear-powered submarines, ammunition transport ships,  and refueling ships entered the Sasebo base.    Also, U.S. Marines frantically conducted a special  operations  exercise at bases on Okinawa. They reportedly conducted this  exercise while simulating the imposition of sanctions on our  country, the use of armed forces against our country, and the  turning of Okinawa into a battlefield.    These busy movements at the U.S. bases in Japan are  phenomena  that can only be seen on the eve of a war and clearly show how  frantically the U.S. imperialists are running amok to provoke a  second Korean war.    The U.S. imperialists are running amok while talking about  sanctions or use of military force under the pretext of the  so-called nuclear issue. It has been clearly revealed, however,  that the nuclear issue is a byproduct of their anti-Republic and  antisocialist maneuvers and a falsehood that they fabricated to  crush [apsal] our Republic.    The Japanese prime minister recently stated in a speech that  he thought North Korea [pukchoson] did not have a nuclear weapon  and had no intention of making one. In this way, he admitted  that the nuclear commotions so far were groundless.    Nevertheless, the U.S. imperialists placed the U.S. Forces  in  South Korea and the puppet forces on combat alert and are  kicking up war commotions in U.S. bases in Japan at an  unprecedented scale under the pretext of the nuclear issue.  What is the reason?    This is related to their attempt to use Japan, which has  been  turned into their aggressive military base, to carry out a war  of northward invasion in case they provoke such a war. In other  words, they attempt to use Japan as a base for operations,  supplies, and repairs in waging a Korean war. We can also say  this is related to the fact that the U.S. imperialists secretly  inspected bases of the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force and  bases of the Air Self-Defense Force in Chitose, Misawa, and  Matsushima.    A Japanese newspaper disclosed that this is intended to  (?occupy) rear-area bases in an emergency on the Korean  peninsula. This disclosure is not accidental. It is a  well-known fact that during the Korean war, the U.S.  imperialists used Japan as their sortie base and supply and  repair base.    The U.S. imperialists even now attempt to invade the  northern  half of the Republic and realize their policy toward Korea and  Asia by using Japan, geographically close to the Korean  peninsula. However, this is a foolish dream.    Japan is not far from the Korean peninsula. If the situation  is aggravated on the Korean peninsula and if, as a result, a war  breaks out there, Japan, which has turned into a U.S. military  base, will never be safe.    We do not want war. However, we are not afraid of it.    We will in no way forgive those who attempt to provoke  [konduriryonun] the socialist system, which is our life, and  deal a retaliatory blow 1,000-fold or 100-fold.    The Japanese people have expressed their indignation over  the  imperialists' maneuvers to envelope Japan in flames of war and  are waging a vigorous antiwar struggle.    The U.S. imperialists must clearly see the people's  aspirations and demands and act with discretion.</p>

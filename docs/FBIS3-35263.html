This is because they have faith in their  invincible, strong, and unconquerable will. They are sure of  their steps toward a free independent Palestinian state. The  Palestinian people's self-confidence is drawn from, among other  things, their national unity and great intifadah, which gives  the Palestinian national consciousness an idea about its future  prospects, and qualifies it to proceed with efforts to build the  future. At present, the Palestinian people are about to take  firm and decisive steps toward independence. The Palestinian  people under the PLO have made preparations for all  eventualities. They are ready to thwart all obstacles that  could stand in their way, preventing them from achieving their  sublime objectives. This requires, among other things, enhanced  national unity and further vigilance against any malicious  instigation promoting discord, a pestilence that has failed in  its attempts to plague the Palestinian national consciousness  and the Palestinian national unity since the inception of our  liberation march.    O masses of our lofty people, let self-confidence and the  giant national will be among the slogans of this phase while we  proceed firmly toward the extrication of our legitimate national  rights to achieve total independence. While looking forward to  the future, which we are bound to extricate, let us repeat with  our leader Abu-'Ammar the following verse: Those with sure  steps are unshakable. Yes, our people are walking the path  leading to the state of Palestinian right and truth, unified and  united. Their steps are unfaltering.</p>

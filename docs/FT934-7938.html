			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Investment and trade co-operation boosted OFFICIALS from 15 Pacific countries yesterday agreed on a new trade and investment framework which will mark a modest step towards closer co-operation without setting the stage for creation of an Asian trade bloc. A declaration expected to be approved by trade and foreign ministers of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation group, who began their annual meeting last night, will establish a permanent committee on trade and investment. Ms Charlene Barshefsky, deputy US trade representative, said the new framework 'will take Apec beyond its current role as a facilitation and co-operation forum to a policy-making role, to be expanded through consultation and consensus by its members'. The committee, she said, would be charged with finding 'ways to expand trade, create a more attractive investment climate and facilitate the flow of goods, capital and technology across the region'. Mr Kim Chulsu, South Korea's trade minister, said: 'This is a mandate for a more active approach to advancing regional co-operation.' However, according to participants, the discussions on the new framework revealed vigorous disagreement about Apec's future role, some members favouring creation of formal, bureaucratic structures in which to discuss trade liberalisation and others - apparently a majority - preferring to maintain a more liberal, informal approach. The resulting declaration will represent only a mild institutionalisation of Apec. Mr Tony Miller, Hong Kong's director-general of trade, said it 'binds nobody but sets out a collective view.' One of Apec's advantages over other bodies, he said, was its informal atmosphere. An Australian official said the new committee was 'a step of considerable significance' although he conceded that 'to an outsider it might not seem to amount to much'. He said the idea had been too sensitive to raise when Apec was founded only four years ago. The committee's work would include harmonisation of customs procedures, a database of regional tariffs, and a study of investment regulations. Differences of view over Apec's future role were also evident in the officials' discussions on a report by an eminent persons group headed by Mr Fred Bergsten, a US economist. The report, to be submitted to the ministerial meeting, sets out a series of steps towards creation of a Pacific economic community.</p>

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Vosper improves to Pounds 19m - Order book exceeds Pounds 700m of which 95% will go overseas A STRONG export perform-ance helped Vosper Thornycroft Holdings, the shipbuilding and engineering group, sail through the gloom which has gripped other defence contractors. The Southampton-based company yesterday reported a 19 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 19m in the year to March 31. Sales rose by 25 per cent to Pounds 196m. Mr Peter Usher, chairman, said the group's order book remained in excess of Pounds 700m, of which 95 per cent will go overseas - mainly to the Middle and Far East. Vosper Thornycroft is currently making no plastic-hulled minehunters, but hopes soon to receive funding for another three from Saudi Arabia, and a further batch from the Royal Navy. It has also tendered to build six minehunters for both Australia and Turkey. Mr Martin Jay, managing director, said work on new steel ship orders for Oman, Quatar and the UK's Customs and Excise was progressing well. The policy of broadening the group's business base into related field continued, with non-defence order input up from Pounds 14m in 1992 to Pounds 16m in 1993. Cash balances stood at Pounds 90m at the year-end, of which about Pounds 50m could be used for acquisitions. Mr Jay said he wanted to take a measured approach, making acquisitions in areas which were related to the core business. Earnings per share rose 19 per cent to 41.3p (34.8p). A final dividend of 11.1p (9p) gives a total for the year of 15.8p (13.1p), an increase of 21 per cent. The company said it had increased the dividend by this exceptional amount so as to compensate institutional shareholders for the reduction in the rate of Advance Corporation Tax. COMMENT These results caused Vosper Thornycroft's shares to close 22p higher at 595p yesterday - completing a striking rerating from their level of 240p of March last year. It has taken the market some time to realise that not all defence companies deserve to be in the dog house - and Vosper Thornycroft's strong overseas order book continues to impress. Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 20m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 13.8, a slight discount to the market. However, in spite of the dividend rise, the prospective yield of 3.5 per cent is substantially below the market average. The shares are likely to take a breather, at least until there are more firm orders from the Royal Navy or Saudi Arabia.</p>

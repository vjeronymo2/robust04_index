			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Apr 04, BNS -- The government's recent  actions that led to a major controversy over the fate of  Estonia's second largest daily newspaper may bring about a vote  of no confidence in Prime Minister Mart Laar, opposition MP Tiit  Made said.    "The State Assembly probably will again have to take for  discussion the personal issue of Mart Laar," Made said,  mentioning that he had stopped short of calling it an issue of  no-confidence.    He said it was the government's attempt to submit the RAHVA  HAAL newspaper directly to the government's control that may  cause raising the issue in the parliament.    Made and another opposition MP, the Centriat Party's Andra  Veidemann, visited RAHVA HAAL's editorial premises in the Press  House, Tallinn, today. The premises were taken under guard in  the early morning today by a security company hired by RAS Rahva  Haal, the state company that still owns the newspaper's  trademark, but has lost most of the former staff in a conflict  that led to the emergence of EESTI SONUMID, a new title  published by RAHVA HAAL's former staff.    The security guards, apparently acting under instructions to  prevent possible takeover of the premises by ex-staffers who  enjoy massive support by the newspaper's subscribers, today let  the former employees in only in groups of two to take their  personal belongings from their once places of work.    Made also said he had been surprised to see that RAHVA  HAAL's  editorial premises were guarded by a security company owned by  Agu Kivimae, one of the owners of the company Maag Ltd. that  took part in bidding for RAHVA HAAL in the newspaper's  privatization last year. The privatization authorities adopted  a decision in favor of Maag, but the issue finally ended up in  court after protests from Maag's competitors.    Veidemann referred to the possibility of a legal offense,  saying the blocking of RAHVA HAAL's premises had taken place  without a court order.    She said a court must now decide whether the steps taken by  the state company's leadership were legitimate.    The two MPs said they had seen no evidence in support of  some  recent allegations that the ex-staffers had stolen some of the  property belonging to the state-owned newspaper.    Security guards hired by the ex-staffers today called off  their agreement and left the premises of the editorial office.</p>

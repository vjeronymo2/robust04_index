			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANAGUA ACCUSES 13 IN ARMED FORCES OF MURDER  </P> <P> The Nicaraguan government, stung by international criticism of its  counterinsurgency methods, has brought murder charges against 13 Sandinista  soldiers, security agents and paramilitary gunmen in the deaths of seven  unarmed civilians suspected of aiding the Contras.  </P> <P> In a quiet admission of revolutionary power gone awry, nine of the gunmen have  been sentenced in recent weeks to prison terms ranging from six to 30 years,  two are on trial and two others are being sought, according to an unpublished  Sandinista report to the New York-based human rights group Americas Watch.  </P> <P> The official account is challenged, however, by witnesses who say they have  seen two of the convicted officers still on duty. The government insists they  are both behind bars.  </P> <P> Over the past year, Americas Watch has repeatedly denounced a "pattern of  summary executions by government forces" in Nicaragua and listed evidence of 51  killings and the disappearance of 13 persons in Sandinista custody.  </P> <P> The government's reply early this month, its most substantial effort to clarify  these cases, coincides with well-publicized Sandinista moves to end the war by  freeing Contra prisoners and offering amnesty and farm land to rebel soldiers  under an Aug. 7 Central American peace accord.  </P> <P> "It proves that impunity is not the norm here," Wilma Nunez Escorcia, president  of the government's Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Human  Rights, said this week in an interview. "A government that punishes violators  of human rights cannot itself be called a violator."  </P> <P> Leaders of the U.S.-backed Contra movement, which faces the loss of its  sanctuaries in Honduras by Dec. 5 under the peace accord, are telling their  11,000 followers that security agents might harass or even kill them, as a  result of Sandinista policy or indiscipline, if they return to Nicaragua  unarmed.  </P> <P> While the still-unfinished murder investigations appear to offer a test of both  sides' assertions, the results so far are inconclusive.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Little Zonal Impact  </P> <P> Because the convictions were not announced publicly, they have made little  impact in the northern rural war zones where the killings occurred. And the  reported sightings of convicted men on the loose have cast doubt on the  intention of the trials.  </P> <P> The highest-ranking officer tried, Lt. Francisco Gonzalez Siles, was sentenced  July 17 to the maximum 30-year prison term for the separate killings last fall  of farmers Adrian Zeledon and Miguel Angel Ramirez Davila in a hamlet near  Pantasma, where Gonzalez Siles worked for the Interior Ministry's state  security office.  </P> <P> Relatives of both victims said this week they were not aware that the officer,  known and feared in the region as "Chico Tiro," had been found guilty.  </P> <P> And when President Daniel Ortega went to war-divided Pantasma on Aug. 15 for a  conciliatory speech to the nation, promising the release of about 1,200 jailed  Contra collaborators in the coming weeks, five farmers said they saw Gonzalez  Siles supervising a presidential security contingent north of the town.  </P> <P> "I don't really believe that justice will be done," said Rosalina Flores de  Zeledon, widow of one of the victims. "How could it be? The Sandinistas really  were pleased with Chico Tiro's work."  </P> <P> The top Sandinista official in Pantasma, Reynaldo Guadamuz, insisted that  Gonzalez Siles has been imprisoned since his arrest last month. Nunez said  Thursday: "I have rechecked with the military prosecutor. All those convicted  have to be in jail."  </P> <P> The prosecutor began investigating the killings near Pantasma and elsewhere,  Americas Watch was told, within days after The Times reported them last April.  </P> <P> The news accounts, based on testimony gathered by reporters and by Americas  Watch, tied most of the killings to a campaign to break up the Contras'  civilian support networks in northern Nicaragua after most of the rebel troops  had retreated to Honduras.  </P> <P> Both Pantasma victims were seized near their farmhouses, marched to remote  jungle clearings and executed. Juan Ramon Mairena Chavarria, identified as an  army agent, was sentenced to 15 years for the fatal stabbing of Zeledon under  Gonzalez Siles' orders.  </P> <P> A local state security chief, Aran Molina Perez, and a subordinate, Felix Pedro  Jarquin, were sentenced to 16 years each for strangling an alleged Contra  messenger, Sergio Molina Monje, near Rio Blanco. Two other agents and two of  the paramilitary gunmen received eight-year terms as accomplices.  </P> <P> Nunez said that all three murders were clear examples of abuse of authority in  counterinsurgency operations. She said the others were less so.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 6-Year Sentence  </P> <P> In one, Sandinista soldier Luis Concepcion Arauz Flores was sentenced to six  years for killing a man with whom he had "a very personal enmity" before five  witnesses near the town of Quilali, she said. Americas Watch reported that  witnesses had seen Arauz on duty after he was sentenced.  </P> <P> In two other cases, in Apantillo and Wiwili, investigators identified the  killers as civilians, even though they wore military uniforms and had often  been seen on military patrols. They are on trial in civilian courts.  </P> <P> Witnesses to the Apantillo execution, of Roman Catholic lay preacher Felicito  Peralta, told Americas Watch that a state security official widely suspected in  that village as the man who ordered it had been absolved after two weeks in  jail.  </P> <P> Two former soldiers are being sought in one of five other killings in Apantillo  in the past two years.  </P> <P> Eleven cases listed by Americas Watch were closed without any criminal charges,  Nunez said, because the victims were shot in cross-fire or while trying to  escape, or because evidence against the defendants was weak. Three people  listed as missing turned up alive. Investigations are under way in 41 remaining  cases and 10 are "nearly complete," she added.  </P> <P> Juan Mendez, executive director of Americas Watch, said the official account  proved the pattern of abuses his organization had denounced, even though the  Sandinistas rejected overall responsibility for them.  </P> <P> "We feel we have succeeded in making the government realize the importance of  this problem," he said. "This is an encouraging first step. We are getting  preliminary reports that the killings themselves have stopped. That is even  more encouraging."  </P> <P> Mendez expressed concern that some of those punished might still be on duty and  said he expects investigations of pending cases to continue. But he emphasized  that Americas Watch is getting better cooperation from the Sandinistas than  from "some other countries in the region," which he did not identify.  </P> <P> Interior Minister Tomas Borge has agreed to open Nicaragua's jails for  inspection by human rights groups next week to settle a dispute over how many  prisoners are held on security charges. He put the number at 1,440; opposition  groups estimate 6,000.  </P> <P> The government's decision to free most Contra fighters and collaborators while  jailing Sandinistas for wartime abuses has caused resentment within the ruling  party. It is apparently to minimize such strains that the recent trials have  not been publicized.  </P> <P> "Chico Tiro is a comrade who has risked his life during years of war, and now  he is paying for the errors he is accused of," Guadamuz said of his convicted  subordinate in Pantasma. "On the other side, there are Contra chiefs who have  killed, and they are about to go free. This is inconceivable. We are putting  our own people in jail and letting the enemy out."  </P></p>

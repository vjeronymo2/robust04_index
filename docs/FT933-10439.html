			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Heavy truck decision angers pressure groups and industry THE FREIGHT transport industry and environmentalists yesterday attacked from separate flanks a government decision allowing the use of 44-tonne lorries on journeys to and from UK rail freight terminals. Regulations to be introduced in the autumn will allow the heavier lorries on such routes, provided that they are six-axle vehicles which spread loads evenly. The present limits are 38 tonnes for articulated lorries and 35 tonnes for lorries pulling trailers. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said the heavier vehicles would be no bigger and cause no more wear to roads than existing vehicles. He predicted that the measure, combined with other incentives to move goods by rail, would reverse the long-term decline in rail freight. However, the decision was immediately attacked as a missed opportunity to raise the weight limits for all lorries on Britain's roads. The Confederation of British Industry said that allowing 44-tonne trucks more generally would have enhanced the competitiveness of British business. The Freight Transport Association said that lifting the limit for all lorries to 44 tonnes would reduce the number of lorries on the road and save industry Pounds 300m in transport costs. The shipping industry complained that the restrictions would remain on lorries using ferries. Sir Nicholas Hunt, director-general of the Chamber of Shipping, described shipping as 'the transport mode most friendly to the environment'. Environmental pressure groups said the decision was unlikely to reverse the decline of rail freight. Mr Tony Burton of the Council for the Protection of Rural England said that, without close enforcement of the routes, it would increase the number of lorries in villages and on country roads. The change in rules is intended to encourage industry to send more container freight by rail, according to Mr MacGregor. Existing lorry weight limits do not allow containers to be loaded to their maximum capacity. Mr Garry Turvey, director-general of the Freight Transport Association, said that the government had chosen an option with the least benefits to industry, the environment and the economy.</p>

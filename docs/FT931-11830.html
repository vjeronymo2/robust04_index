			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Leading Article: After the punt devaluation YET ANOTHER punch-drunk European currency, the Irish punt, has thrown in the towel. Before the Dutch guilder, the Belgian franc, the Danish krone and the French franc are forced from the ring, European Community policy-makers should ask themselves whether what they gain is still worth the pain. The difficulty facing the ERM is not currency misalignments and it is not the condemned 'speculators' who are merely the bearers of the bad news. Their message is that real short-term rates of interest in continental Europe, now around 7 per cent, are far too high in a deepening Europe-wide recession. The speculators are not irrational. They are merely giving governments - or, if not governments, their electorates - credit for common sense. Every country in Europe, except Germany (though many would disagree there too), needs far lower interest rates. The question is whether they will get them in time. Even Paris, the most resolute upholder of the 'hard ERM', must recognise that persistence with rigeur may lead not to the sunlit uplands, but to a breakdown with damaging political, as well as economic, consequences. Tactical flexibility may now be a more satisfactory route to the strategic goal of Emu than persistence along the EC's present course. Rate cut The only escape would be a large reduction in German interest rates. Various German financial figures are suggesting early cuts. But how far are these likely to go? If Germany is to avoid a deep recession in 1993 and perhaps 1994 and France a recession of almost equal intensity, German short-term rates of interest might have to fall to 6 per cent within a few months. The chances remain small. If the Bundesbank is not to provide relief, what are the alternatives? Greater co-operation over exchange rate intervention is of modest help when the form of co-operation most needed - looser German monetary policy and tighter German fiscal policy - is unavailable. Realignments, though inescapable under severe pressure, are of limited benefit too, unless large. The problem of persistently high interest rates remains, since realignment can help here only if subsequent upward realignments against the D-Mark become credible. It would have been best to have agreed a temporary suspension of the D-Mark upon German unification. It remains the best option. Let the Bundesbank fight its battle for stability unhampered by the monetary consequences of foreign exchange intervention and relink exchange rates when German inflation is once more where the Bundesbank wants it. Yet an agreed suspension of other currencies need not do them much harm. Given the strong fundamentals of the French economy, in particular, the franc might lose little value, even with lower interest rates. Wider bands An alternative would be temporarily wider bands. But these would have to be wide enough to allow currencies a reasonable chance of appreciation within the ERM and so lower short-term interest rates than Germany's. Under the Maastricht treaty, a country does not have to maintain its parity within the ERM for more than two years prior to joining in the third stage. This means that suspension of modification of the ERM need not preclude Emu at its earliest possible date, provided the full ERM were restored by the beginning of 1995. Such a restoration could be announced alongside a current suspension or move to wider bands. The alternative to greater flexibility is either fighting on or immediate moves to a mini-Emu. But the latter path would be divisive within the EC and no less within the putative participants. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, has already shown his opposition. Worse, a mini-Emu would not even help much, unless the Germans were to accept that German inflation would have a substantially smaller weight than now. C'est magnifique, mais ce n'est pas la guerre; and it is not sensible monetary policy either. European leaders should ask themselves whether their strategic goal of European union might not be better served by a temporary retreat than by galloping on to glorious defeats or Pyrrhic victories.</p>

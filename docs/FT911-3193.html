			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / International Company News: Bull close to completing share exchange with NEC BULL, the French state-owned computer maker, expects to complete within weeks its long-expected share exchange with NEC, the Japanese electronics group. A Bull official confirmed last night that the group is negotiating a straight share swap with NEC, under which the Japanese company would take a 5 per cent stake in the loss-making French group. This would be in exchange for NEC's 15 per cent stake in Bull HN, a subsidiary of the French group embracing most of its US and Pacific operations. This is the first time Bull has revealed the precise size of the stake on offer to NEC, which is also likely to take a seat on the board. The share swap will accompany a wholesale re-organisation of the cumbersomely structured group, in which Mr Francis Lorentz, the chairman, has said he aims to merge Bull's four operating units into a single organisation by the early summer, in an attempt to curb costs and increase efficiency. Bull officials say the deal could be completed in the next 30 days. The deal is likely to be greeted with relief by the French government, which for all its reservations on Japanese competition is keen to find a private partner for Bull.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A Taiwanese Government source, quoting intelligence  reports, claimed yesterday that 24 Taiwanese tourists who died  in a mysterious boat fire on the mainland last month were in  fact murdered by a group of renegade Chinese soldiers. The  source said People's Liberation Army troops, armed with  flame-throwers, robbed and burned to death the tourists and  eight Chinese crew while the boat was touring Qiandao Lake in  Zhejiang province on March 31.    Mainland authorities discovered the murders the next day but  covered them up and ordered the loot to be returned because "the  impact of the incident could be far-reaching", the source  claimed, quoting intelligence he described as "authoritative".    The deaths have seriously strained uneasy relations between  Taiwan and China, bitter rivals since the Chinese civil war  ended in 1949. Relatives of the victims have accused Beijing of  covering up what they alleged to be mass murder. They raised  several questionable points, including why the victims did not  jump ship when the fire began and were instead huddled in the  small cabin below. Relatives visiting the death scene last week  to recover victims' remains said the authorities restricted  their movements. They said officials had also insisted the  remains be cremated in China instead of being taken to Taiwan.    China acknowledged the blaze might have been caused by  "saboteurs". It pledged that the culprits would be severely  punished after Taiwanese leaders called Chinese authorities  "bandits ... trampling on human lives".    In Beijing, officials from the State Council and the  ministries of foreign affairs and defence could not be reached  for comment on the new allegations.    Taiwan will suspend all group tours to China from May I and  has declared 11 scenic spots, including Qiandao Lake and Lhasa  in Tibet, high-risk areas for travel. About 10,000 Taiwanese  have already backed out of tours to China, with about 450 group  tours already canceled at a cost of US$11.4 million (HK$88  million) to Taiwanese travel agents. Chinese officials estimate  that more than one million Taiwanese travellers last year pumped  at least $589 million into China's economy.    The island has also suspended subsidised cultural and  educational exchanges with China, and the Economics Ministry has  recommended putting on hold applications for new or additional  investment in China and expansion of imports from the mainland.    China has urged authorities in Taiwan to "handle the matter  in a rational and cool-minded manner so as to avoid a setback in  relations". Meanwhile, Chinese President Jiang Zemin appealed  for increased ties with Taiwan and the restoration of direct air  post and maritime links, major Chinese newspapers said  yesterday. "The reunification of China is a historic mission,  the will of the people and irreversible," Mr Jiang was quoted by  the papers as saying at the end of a five-day meeting of the  State Council.    Beijing has given assurances the fire was purely accidental  and repeatedly said it was no reason for a deterioration of  relations between the two sides. During the meeting, Premier Li  Peng called for Taiwanese business to invest in China even as  many were announcing the cancellation of projects in protest of  the boat fire.    Despite an 18-year-old modernisation drive, the PLA, which  encompasses all three armed services, operates largely above the  law, analysts say. Hong Kong maritime officials say many  Chinese smuggling syndicates operate with the navy's tacit  consent. They say PLA coastal patrols often raid ships and  seize their cargos on the pretext of curbing smuggling.  Military officers have been seen driving righthand-drive cars,  which cannot be legally registered in China and are presumed to  have been stolen in Hong Kong.</p>

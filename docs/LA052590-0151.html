			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOXING AT THE IRVINE MARRIOTT;  </P> <P> HUNTINGTON BEACH'S FIGHTING LIFEGUARD SURVIVES HEAD BUTT TO WIN  </P> <P> When John Armijo's fight with Robert Jackson was stopped after four rounds  Thursday because of a cut above Armijo's eye that was caused by an  unintentional head butt, Armijo looked worried.  </P> <P> But as the ring announcer slowly explained that the fighter suffering from the  butt could not lose the fight, Armijo managed a slight grin.  </P> <P> When it was then announced the fight would be decided by the judges, a smile  came across the Huntington Beach resident's face. Armijo (9-0-1) was ahead,  40-36, on all three cards over Jackson (6-11) of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "I wasn't sure of the rules," said Armijo, who is a Huntington Beach lifeguard.  "I just come here to fight. That's what I worry about."  </P> <P> Armijo, a middleweight who has become very popular at Irvine in the past year,  made his main-event debut Thursday before a sellout crowd of 1,450. It was the  largest audience of the year at the Marriott.  </P> <P> Armijo's usual band of supporters, mostly co-workers, were in the back of the  room chanting his name three fights before he came into the ring.  </P> <P> Armijo was calmer than usual before the fight, and continued his slow actions  in the first round.  </P> <P> "I was trying to pace myself," he said. "Sure, I was a little nervous, but this  was a learning experience and I can build on it."  </P> <P> Armijo picked it up in the next three rounds, though. He was clearly the more  aggressive fighter, landing several solid rights on the chin of Jackson in the  second and third rounds.  </P> <P> The two boxed in close for most of the third. Then, about halfway through the  fourth, the head butt caused a deep gash above Armijo's left eye.  </P> <P> After the cut, Armijo stood up and dared Jackson to punch him as blood gushed  from the wound. There was one more solid exchange before time ran out and the  ring-side doctor halted the bout.  </P> <P> "I was getting him ready," Armijo said. "I was confident the knockout was going  to come. I just needed a little more time."  </P></p>

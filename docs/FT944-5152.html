			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / World Bond Markets: New York The US Treasury market is likely to remain on the same path it pursued last week, a path that led to a further flattening in the yield curve as investors prefaced trouble for the economy and further interest rate increases ahead. Last Friday's remarkable gains at the long end of the maturity range narrowed the spread between two-year and 30-year yields to less than 50 basis points, half what it was less than a month ago. The curve has been rapidly flattening as investors have bought long-term Treasuries in the belief that the economy will start to slow down next year and thus restrain any inflationary pressures in the system. The next interest rate increase, in fact, could come a few days before Christmas. Last week's exceptionally strong third-quarter gross domestic product and November employment data indicated that the economy is growing at a faster rate than the Fed wants. Several analysts now predict that the central bank will raise rates again after the December 20 meeting of the Fed's open market committee. Prices should not move sharply in any direction this week given the lack of key economic releases. Only today's motor vehicle sales figures for November and single-family home sales for October are likely to generate any reaction.</p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Russia and The G7: Moscow given notice on Bosnia THE Group of Seven yesterday backed the Russian leadership of President Boris Yeltsin and his reforms but also put Russia on notice that its full support is expected in handling the conflict in Bosnia. G7 foreign ministers attending the two-day meeting in Tokyo were agreed that much tougher sanctions should be imposed on Serbia through the United Nations unless there is a settlement in coming days. The ministers made clear to Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, that Moscow, a traditional ally of the Serbs, must use its influence to end violence and should vote in favour of tougher sanctions if a vote is held at the UN. A UN vote has been delayed until after Russia's April 25 plebiscite as Mr Yeltsin is under pressure from conservatives and could be embarrassed by a vote in favour of action against the Serbs. In recent weeks, Russian officials have said tougher sanctions would be 'unhelpful'. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said the vote was delayed out of deference to Russia and its apparent attempts to quell the violence, but Moscow's full co-operation would be expected in the UN after April 25. He said Russian officials had indicated a settlement may be possible and insisted they must make genuine efforts to see it was reached. If there was no settlement, he said, the US would vote for sanctions and Russia should too.</p>

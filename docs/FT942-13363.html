			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Czechs fall prey to financial predators: East Europe has become a target for sharp operators A scheme to raise Dollars 1.2bn through the sale of fraudulent securities in a Czech bank is deeply embarrasing the Prague government. It has also highlighted once again how weak domestic controls and lack of experience in the international capital markets can make eastern Europe's economies a target for unscrupulous predators . The scheme was discovered by the US Securities and Exchange Commission in March - early enough to prevent the bulk of apparently worthless securities issued by Banka Bohemia, a middle-sized bank, being sold in Europe and the US. 'Promisory notes' worth more than Dollars 800m have been traced by the Czech National Bank and withdrawn from the market since then, but another Dollars 380m are still missing. It is not known how long the notes have been on the market, and how many were actually sold, but investors who bought them may never get their money back. The fraud comes on top of a series of scandals that have hit the Czech Republic since the 1989 'velvet revolution' that overthrew communism. Senior officials, politicians, and businessmen, have been linked to activities ranging from tax evasion to insider trading and extortion. Even foreign companies have found themselves unwittingly embroiled in local scandals resulting from privatisations. According to police, of all types of crime, economic crime grew fastest last year. Analysts say the Bank Bohemia scam was waiting to happen. 'What's surprising is not that it happened, but that it didn't happen before,' says Mr Daniel Jackson, director of Nomura International in Prague. 'There are hundreds of these schemes (in the region). The opening up of these countries has created enormous opportunities for these groups of operators. It's extremely dangerous, but if experienced western people can get taken in, it's hardly surprising that people in eastern Europe without the experience will fall for them.' 'It's extraordinary how many of these people are moving around (eastern Europe) with these fraudulent schemes. They try their luck without concern about retribution because there's no enforcement mechanism for a guy that flies in from Switzerland to Prague, and offers what looks like a great deal.' That view is shared at the central bank. 'There is a growing use of fraudulent (financial) instruments aimed at companies and countries wanting to raise funds. The bank has seen several such proposals of investments from abroad with very good conditions and low interest rates for large amounts,' says Mr Martin Svehla, the bank's spokesman. In Banka Bohemia's case the central bank was alerted by the SEC after the purchase by a US church institution of notes worth Dollars 13.2m for Dollars 8m through a London investment house . The central bank intervened quickly and placed its own administrator in the bank whose accounts have since been frozen to stop a run on deposits by anxious creditors. The scheme involved Banka Bohemia notes described as 'bank guarantee' and 'prime bank guarantee' that were apparently sold by foreign partners of the Prague-based bank in Britain, Germany, Switzerland and the US. Mr Svehla says the guarantees were signed by authorised officials at Banka Bohemia, though they were not recorded in the bank's books. They did not meet Czech foreign exchange regulations, and Banka Bohemia did not have a licence to issue them. The two deputy chairmen who signed some of the guarantees have been sacked, and inquiries continue within the bank to establish responsibility and the bank's liability. Banka Bohemia says it is not liable for investors' losses because the notes were sent to partners abroad to help raise loans but not to be traded, and it did not receive any money from the sales. Local custom and practice will not help sort out the mess. Brought up under a communist regime that lied to its own citizens as a matter of routine, many people do not consider financial impropriety as wrong, but as just another way of exchanging favours. 'The problem is that there is no concept of ethical behaviour,' says Mr Richard Fletcher of Arthur Andersen's Prague office. Several instances of insider trading have come to light recently, though evidence has been mostly circumstantial. Misdemeanors include dealing in shares prior to a company's listing on the stock exchange, passing information about competitors' tenders, and buying shares through front companies to hide an original buyer's identity. Analysts say controls are insufficient, and activities overlap. Chinese walls are not properly established, and 'there is probably seepage', says one analyst. 'Nothing stops a big bank from putting in a lot of orders to push the price of a share up and selling (the stock) instead.' A western lawyer says these problems should not be exaggerated, that the rise in economic crime is an inevitable by-product of the radical transformation of the economy. 'The Czech Republic has been relatively scandal free when you consider the very short time during which huge numbers of people have become economic actors, and their lack of experience.' This appears to have encouraged the government to take a somewhat relaxed 'leave it to the market' approach to these problems, but western companies worry the market will suffer unless it is made more tranparent and stronger action is taken to punish abuse. Mr Fletcher says: 'It's a problem, but they (the authorities) are addressing it. With pension funds coming in they have to think about these issues. It's very important for non-resident investors to have faith in the system.'</p>

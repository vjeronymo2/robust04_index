			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Prince warns on population increase PRINCE CHARLES warned in London yesterday that environmental improvement and alleviation of Third World poverty would be jeopardised by the predicted doubling of the world's population to 10bn by the year 2050. He said that some delegations to the forthcoming Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro were blocking discussion on the need to reduce the growth in world population. The prince did not name the delegations which he said were determined to prevent discussion of the issue. But they are understood to include the Vatican, the Philippines and Latin American countries. The UK strongly favours having the population issue on the agenda of the summit, to be held in June. 'I don't in all logic see how any society can hope to improve its lot when population growth regularly exceeds economic growth,' he said. 'We will not protect the environment until we address the issue of population growth and poverty in the same breath. I wish that these simple and incontestable truths could find greater prominence on the Rio agenda.' The prince was addressing a session of the World Commission on Environment and Development which will issue a statement tomorrow giving its views on the Earth Summit. The commission was formed in 1984 by the United Nations to draw up a global environmental agenda. The prince said that unless a far-sighted agenda for action was worked out 'we will be sacrificing the survival or our grandchildren and great-grandchildren for short-term gain'. Negotiations for the summit have been marked by differences between industrialised and developing countries. But the prince asked why resources could not be pooled to 'tackle the unfolding crisis together'. Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Norwegian prime minister - who heads the commission - warned that the summit could fail unless the 'watering down' of proposals during preparatory talks was reversed by pressure of public opinion. 'We must enter a period of firm action,' she said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovsky]    [Text] Parliament speaker Mechyslaw Hryb has told INTERFAX  that before 15 April everything will be prepared for nominating  candidates for presidential elections in Belarus.    He said for that day it is planned to approve the schedule  of  the procedures associated with the presidential campaign, to  prepare the lists for collecting signatures of people's deputies  and citizens in support of different candidates for presidency.    On 15 March it is expected to approve a list of expenditures  for the elections. Referring to so far unconfirmed information,  Hryb said that the presidential campaign would cost  approximately 160 Bn Belarusian rubles.    He said that everything associated with the elections will  pass smoothly and openly, without any deviations. Hryb said  about the intention to invite CIS and foreign observers to  monitor the campaign.    When the president is elected, the state power in the  Republic will be stronger and the crisis of power will end, said  Hryb. He believes a clear structure of subordination laid in  the system of the presidential rule will allow to rule the state  efficiently through the presidential representatives in  provinces.    IF Note: According to the parliament decision adopted on 30  March, the elections of the first ever Belarusian president will  take place on 23 June.    The head of the temporary parliamentary commission for  combating corruption Aleksandr Lukashenko officially said about  his intention to stand for presidency.    The spokesman for the Republic's prime minister Vladimir  Zametalin has said that Vyacheslav Kebich is expected to make an  official statement about his intention to run for presidency.    The organization of Belarusian Social Democrats and the  United Democratic party decided to nominate for presidency the  ex-speaker of the Belrusian parliament Stanislav Shushkevich.    The opposition Belarusian People's Front nominates its  leader  Zenon Poznyak. The Party of the People's Accord will nominate  its chairman Gennadiy Karpenko, while the party Belarusian  Scientific Industrial Congress -- Federal Director of the the  Gorizont association producing TV-sets -- Aleksandr  Sanchukovskiy.    Still undecided are the parliament speaker Mechyslaw Hryb  and  the CIS executive secretary Ivan Korotchenya.    Minsk observers name among the main candidates for  presidency  Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, who consistently pursues the  policy oriented for the economic integration with Russia.  Staking on the popular idea of a closer union with Russia,  Kebich, observers believe, has a big advantage over the bloc of  "national patriots" led by Zenon Poznyak who orients on opposite  ideas.    Aleksandr Lukashenko, who recently accused of dealing with  mafiosi two vice-premiers, three ministers and some other  government officials, and also Kebich of patronizing the  corrupted officials, is also popular among the people for his  struggle with corruption.    With the aim to discredit before the elections his main  opponent Vyacheslav Kebich, Lukashenko expects to win a victory  despite the fact that he does not have the structural  organizations in provinces which could help him during the  election campaign.    Observers believe that if the court where the accused want  to  file a suit against Lukashenko, manages to pass a verdict  against him and prove the innocence of the vice-premiers and  ministers before the elections, his chances will be slim.    An aspect of the presidential campaign, namely: whether a  person who is prosecuted by court, may be candidate for  presidency, is the popular talk in the political quarters of  Minsk. Lukashenko admits that he has no so far economic  program. In an interview with INTERFAX he said that he could be  helped by his supporters to draw a program overnight.    Stanislav Shushkevich, ex-speaker of the Belarusian  Parliament, is also among the contenders. The stake on the two  parties which have their structures in provinces, as well as the  organization of servicemen, banned in the Republic, will allow  Shushkevich to collect the necessary 100,000 signatures to stand  for presidency, forecast the observers.</p>

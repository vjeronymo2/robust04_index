			<p>BFN     [Text] The police in the Western Cape have objected to an  undertaking by the ANC's regional police spokesman, Mr. Vincent  Diba, that the National Defense Force will be deployed in the  gang-riddled Manenberg area of the Cape Flats next week.    A police spokesman, Colonel Raymond (Dawoud), said  gang-related crime was a police responsibility and not that of  the National Defense Force, which was not trained to handle the  situation. Speaking on behalf of the Western Cape MEC [Members  of Executive Committee] for police, Mr. Patrick Mckenzie, Col.  (Dawoud) appealed to people not to allow the issue to develop  political overtones. He added that crime in the area had  decreased significantly since the start of Operation Gang-Bust  last week.</p>

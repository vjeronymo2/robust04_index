			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Romanian unions call 2m on strike More than 2m Romanians, a fifth of the workforce, are due to take part in a general strike today in what is expected to be the biggest show of union strength since the end of Communist rule in 1989. Alfa Cartel and CNSLR-Fratia, the two main union blocs, decided to go ahead with the strike after President Ion Iliescu failed to resolve the conflict and after inconclusive talks with the government. The two union blocs are demanding the government implement a collective labour contract for this year, improve the social security system, and speed market-led reform. The weak left-wing minority government has tried to head off the strikes but the unions last week said its offer to negotiate would not be credible until it had finished drafting its 1994 budget. They have also criticised the government for not moving quickly enough to implement a reform package agreed in December with the International Monetary Fund. The delay is holding up IMF approval for a new stand-by arrangement which would unlock Dollars 700m (Pounds 480m) in loans. The unions say that, for the first time since 1989, 'the whole country will feel the strike'. They plan to block roads and fuel deliveries, cut bread production, interrupt telecommunications and shut down most of industry. The mounting labour unrest has increased pressure on the governing Party of Social Democracy in Romania to create a new pro-reform coalition. The PSDR has given itself until tomorrow to complete negotiations on a new coalition with hardline nationalist and former Communist parties, its allies in parliament. But the unions are refusing to support any such coalition and their tough stance, as well as pressure from abroad, has also pushed the PSDR into holding talks with pro-reform opposition parties.</p>

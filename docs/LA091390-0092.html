			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MECHAM LOSES IN ARIZONA, BACKS PRIMARY WINNER  </P> <P> Republican J. Fife Symington III heads into a gubernatorial showdown against  Democrat Terry Goddard with a less-than-ringing endorsement from former Gov.  Evan Mecham.  </P> <P> "I'll support Fife," said Mecham, who lost his comeback attempt in Tuesday's  primary.  </P> <P> "As I've said many times, Goddard will be a 100% disaster. Fife will only be an  80% disaster."  </P> <P> With 99% of the state's precincts reporting, Symington had 161,347 votes, or  44%, to Mecham's 89,496 votes, or 24%, in the five-way GOP race. Goddard had  209,454 votes, or 84%, to beat perennial candidate David Moss, with 39,970, or  16%.  </P> <P> "Now, the great battle begins," said Symington, a millionaire developer, of his  general election contest with Goddard, the former Phoenix mayor who also is  known as Samuel P. Goddard III.  </P> <P> Mecham was seeking a political comeback 2 1/2 years after his impeachment  conviction and removal from office. Analysts said his chances were doomed by a  higher-than-anticipated turnout. Also, the five-way race split the vote.  </P> <P> Democrat Rose Mofford, who became governor upon Mecham's ouster, had decided to  retire.  </P> <P> Symington, 45, portrayed as the liberal in the GOP primary, used his victory  speech to get in his first jabs at Goddard, 43, the son of former Gov. Sam  Goddard.  </P> <P> Goddard "is a professional politician, a tax-and-spend Dukakis liberal  Democrat, and I'm a Goldwater conservative, and I'm proud of it," Symington  said.  </P> <P> Symington ran a major campaign in the mid-1980s to promote a retail office  complex that he was developing over then-Mayor Goddard's objections. His  great-grandfather, Henry Clay Frick, founded U.S. Steel.  </P></p>

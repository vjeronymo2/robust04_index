			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Observer: Same again It's hard to quibble about the calibre of the Bank of England's latest clutch of non-executive directors. Sir Jeremy Morse, recently retired chairman of Lloyds Bank, is one of Britain's best bankers. Hambros' Sir Chips Keswick is regarded as very sound. How refreshing, too, to find a woman at last on the Court of the Bank of England, although Frances Heaton's appointment suggests that life at the Takeover Panel can't be all that busy at the moment. Even so, the appointments do look a trifle incestuous. Morse and Keswick both learnt their trade at the same place - Glyn Mills &amp; Co. Sir David Walker, one of the outgoing Bank directors, has joined the board of Morse's old firm Lloyds, and is expected to take his old job after a decent interval. Moreover, Walker is an old Treasury hand and so is Frances Heaton. Perhaps the government could have cast the net a bit wider. The Bank would benefit from a greater variety of opinions. The problem with the latest bunch is that there's probably nothing whatsoever they disagree about.</p>

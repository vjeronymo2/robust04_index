			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Brother to import typewriters from US BROTHER Industries, the electronics group, plans to transfer production of portable typewriters from its home base in Japan to the US and to export typewriters back to Japan from its US factory. The company said it would begin importing models from the US from next week. Brother said it would become more internationally competitive by concentrating typewriter production in the US which is the largest typewriter market. The move is one of the most radical taken by a Japanese manufacturer since the recent appreciation of the yen to shift to overseas production to improve competitiveness. The recent rise in the value of the yen against the dollar has made exports from Japan less competitive, while exports into the Japanese market from the US should make Brother more competitive. Brother makes 20,000 English language typewriters each month mainly for export to the US and Europe. About 15,000 are portable models. It expects to export from US to Japan about 2,000 typewriters a month.</p>

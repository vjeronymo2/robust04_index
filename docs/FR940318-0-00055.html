This action is based on findings made by the Acting Administrator of the DEA, after review and evaluation of the relevant data by both DEA and the Assistant Secretary for Health, Department of Health and Human Services, that aminorex meets the statutory criteria for inclusion in Schedule I of the CSA. Since this substance has been temporarily scheduled in Schedule I, the regulatory control mechanisms and criminal sanctions of Schedule I continue to be applicable to the manufacture, distribution, importation and exportation of aminorex. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> March 18, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0065 forcenewline --> 0 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Howard McClain, Jr., Chief, Drug and Chemical Evaluation Section, Drug Enforcement Administration, Washington, DC 20537, Telephone: (202) 307&hyph;7183. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> On September 21, 1992, the Administrator of the DEA published a final rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  (57 FR 43399) amending &sect;1308.11(g) of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations to temporarily place aminorex into Schedule I of the CSA pursuant to the temporary scheduling provisions of 21 U.S.C. 811(h). This final rule, which became effective on the date of publication, was based on a finding by the Administrator that the temporary scheduling of aminorex was necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety. Section 201(h)(2) of the CSA (21 U.S.C. 811(h)(2)) requires that the temporary scheduling of a substance expires at the end of one year from the effective date of the order. However, if proceedings to schedule a substance pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 811(a)(1) have been initiated and are pending, the temporary scheduling of a substance may be extended for up to six months. Under this provision, the temporary scheduling of aminorex which would have expired on September 21, 1993, was extended to March 21, 1994 by the DEA Administrator (58 FR 44611).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On August 20, 1993 in a notice of proposed rulemaking published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 44311) and after a review of relevant data, the DEA Administrator proposed to place aminorex into Schedule I of the CSA pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 811(a). Prior to that time the DEA Administrator submitted data which DEA gathered regarding aminorex to the Assistant Secretary for Health, delegate of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. In accordance with 21 U.S.C. 811(b), the DEA Administrator also requested a scientific and medical evaluation and a scheduling recommendation for aminorex from the Assistance Secretary for Health.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letter dated March 4, 1994, the Acting Administrator for the DEA received the scientific and medical evaluation and scheduling recommendation from the Assistant Secretary for Health. The Assistant Secretary recommended that aminorex be placed into Schedule I of the CSA based on a scientific and medical evaluation of the available data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The notice of proposed rulemaking for aminorex provided the opportunity for interested parties to submit comments, objections or requests for a hearing regarding the scheduling of aminorex. No comments, objections or requests for hearings were received regarding the scheduling of aminorez. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aminorex, also called aminoxaphen, 2-amino-5-phenyl-2-oxaoline, or 4,5-dihydro-5-phenyl-2-oxazolamine, is a phenethylamine in which the side chain has been cyclized into a substituted oxazoline. In the mid 1960's, it has marketed as an anorectic agent in Austria, West Germany, and Switzerland but was withdrawn from the European market when it became apparent that aminorex administration was associated with a high risk of fatal pulmonary hypertension. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has notified the DEA that there are no exemptions or appovals in effect under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for aminorex. A search of the scientific and medical literature revealed no indications of current medical use of aminorex in the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aminorex is chemically and pharmacologically similar to amphetamine, methamphetamine, and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> cis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -4-methylaminorex, all of which are controlled substances with high abuse potential. Like most central nervous system (CNS) stimulants, aminorex produces acute locomotor stimulation in rodents. In drug discrimination studies, aminorex fully substitutes for amphetamine in rats and monkeys and for cocaine in rats. The reinforcing effects of aminorex were evaluated in rhesus monkeys and baboons. Aminoex is self-administered in both experimental paradigms. Collectively, these data indicate that aminorex has an abuse liability and dependence profile similar to other potent Schedule I and II controlled CNS stimulants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The earliest confirmed trafficking of aminorex was in Florida in 1989. Since that time, forensic laboratories have identified aminorex in more than 70 exhibits submitted by law enforcement personnel in Florida, New Jersey, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina. Clandestine laboratories engaged in the synthesis of aminorex have been discovered in Florida, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Lloyds Chemists in Pounds 10.5m expansion Lloyds Chemists, the UK's second largest pharmaceuticals retailer, yesterday announced it was to buy Daniels, a pharmaceutical wholesaling and manufacturing business, for Pounds 10.5m. Mr Peter Lloyd, chief executive, said the acquisition would increase the company's national wholesaling business and expand its customer base. He said the deal was also an opportunity to build pharmaceutical manufacturing interests. Daniels, made up of Daniels Pharmaceutical, Shapebase and H Wilkinson, operates a wholesaling business in the north-west of England, the east Midlands, East Anglia and the northern home counties. It also owns a manufacturing business in Derby and a surgical wholesale business in Nottingham. Operating profits were Pounds 1.55m in the year to June 30 1993 with net assets at the date of Pounds 913,000. Lloyds has expanded its geographical spread during the last 12 months, acquiring 25 pharmacies throughout the UK bringing the number of its retail outlets to 1,510. In March Lloyds reported a 16 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 26.2m (Pounds 22.6m) for the six months to December on sales up 17 per cent to Pounds 460m.</p>

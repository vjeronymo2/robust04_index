			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [7th Corps Information Service report] </F>   [Text] After the days-long futile attempts of Karadzic's  army to capture our defense lines on the Vlasic plateau, a part  of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 7th Corps elite units, in a strong  counteroffensive, this morning managed to break through the  Chetnik lines and capture the wider area of Mt. Neokrnje located  in the triangle between the Travnik, Teslic, and Skender Vakuf  communes.    Our defenders' action has significantly expanded the free  territory on the Vlasic plateau. Dozens of Chetniks have been  killed and we have captured a nice collection of material and  technical equipment [words indistinct] -- a 105-mm howitzer, a  Praga antiaircraft weapon, a SAM-110 vehicle, 120-mm mortar, a  antiaircraft machine gun mounted on a tractor, (?several pieces)  of small caliber weaponry, and a substantial quantity of  ammunition and military equipment. As we file this report, the  members of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 7th Corps have captured  the mountain resort on Mt. Neokrnje which the Chetniks used as  quarters for manpower and hardware during battles.</p>

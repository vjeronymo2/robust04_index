			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A RAP FLAP AMID ANTI-SEMITISM CHARGES  </P> <P> Public Enemy encourages black youths like me (I'm 17) to learn about their  history. They teach black kids about their leaders, Minister Farrakhan, Jesse  Jackson and Malcolm X -- something the public school system does not do.  </P> <P> As a senior project, I wrote a history of rap music. I interviewed Chuck D of  Public Enemy. He is a great person, and black youths need him.  </P> <P> All races need to listen to Public Enemy. They are showing other races how  blacks feel.  </P> <P> DEDAN GILLS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

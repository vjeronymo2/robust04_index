			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mirza Sadikovic from Bihac] </F>   [Text] After yesterday's wild and bestial artillery  attacks by chetniks on the Bihac region, during which members of  the UN Protection Force were directly endangered, the joint  aggressors continued attacks overnight and this morning.  Provocations with small arms on most lines of the front in the  zone operations of the 5th Corps and the General Command of the  Croatian Defense Council of this region, and sporadic  treacherous and indiscriminate shelling mark the last 24 hours.  The chetniks shelled the outskirts of Cazin last night. In  this way they directly supported members of the Abdic's traitor  paramilitary army, who have been launching attacks with  anti-aircraft and anti-armor weapons on all lines of separation  throughout this period. In the broad area around Pecigrad they  tried to penetrate our lines with infantry and infiltrate  subversive-terrorist groups.</p>

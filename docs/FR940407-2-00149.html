Definition of Terms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of this Program Announcement the following definitions apply: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Budget Period: The interval of time into which a multi-year period of assistance (project period) is divided for budgetary and funding purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Community-Level Data: Key information to be collected by each grantee that will allow for a national-level analysis of common features of JOLI projects. This includes data on the population of the target area, the percentage on public assistance, the percentage whose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incomes fall below the poverty line, the unemployment rate, the number of new business starts and business closings, and a description of the major employers and average wage rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Community Development Corporation: A private, locally initiated, nonprofit entity, governed by a board consisting of residents of the community and business and civic leaders, which has a record of implementing economic development projects or whose Articles of Incorporation and/or By-Laws indicate that it has a focus in the area of economic development.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Hypothesis: An assumption made in order to test its validity. It should assert a cause-and-effect relationship between a program intervention and its expected result. Both the intervention and result must be measured in order to confirm the hypothesis. For example: Eighty hours of classroom training in small business planning will be sufficient for participants to prepare a successful loan application. In this example, data would be obtained on the number of hours of training actually received by participants (the intervention), and the quality of loan applications (the result).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Intervention: Any planned activity within a project that is intended to produce changes in the target population and/or the environment and can be formally evaluated. For example, assistance in the preparation of a business plan and loan package are planned interventions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Job Creation: To bring about, by activities and services funded under this program, new jobs. Jobs that were not in existence before the start of the project. These activities can include self-employment/entrepreneurial training, the development of new businesses or the expansion of existing businesses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Non-profit Organizations: Any organization (including a community development corporation) exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by reason of paragraph (3) or (4) of section 501(c) of such Code.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Private employers: Third-party private non-profit organizations or third-party for-profit businesses operating in the same community as the applicant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Process Evaluation: The ongoing examination of the implementation of a program. It focuses on the effectiveness and efficiency of the program's activities and interventions (for example, methods of recruiting participants, quality of training activities, or usefulness of follow-up procedures). It should answer questions such as: Who is receiving what services?, are the services being delivered as planned?, and are client competencies improving? It is also known as formative evaluation because it gathers information that can be used to improve the way a program operates while the program is in progress.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Program Participant/Beneficiary: Any individual eligible to receive Aid to Families with Dependent Children under Part A of Title IV of the Social Security Act and any other individual whose income level does not exceed 100 percent of the official poverty line as found in the most recent Annual Revision of Poverty Income Guidelines published by the Department of Health and Human Services.

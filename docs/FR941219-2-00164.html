The purpose of the meeting is to finalize preparations for the Thirty-eighth session of the Subcommittee on Ship Design and Equipment (DE 38) and associated bodies of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) which is scheduled for January 23&hyph;27, 1995, at the IMO Headquarters in London. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the papers received and the draft U.S. positions for DE 38. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Among other things, the items of particular interest are: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Safety of passenger submersible craft; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Development of safety standards for combined pusher tug-barges; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Guidelines for safe ocean towing; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Guidelines for the design and operation of passenger ships to the needs of elderly and disabled persons; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. Use of compressed air systems for buoyancy; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f. Ventilation of vehicle decks during loading and unloading; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g. Matters related to the prevention of oil pollution; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> h. Matters relating to ship structures, including hull stress monitoring devices, corrosion protection for ballast tanks, and access to tank and ballast space structures; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i.

Guidelines on standard calculation methods for anchor positioning systems for Mobile Offshore Drilling Units (MODUs). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The IMO Subcommittees work to develop international agreements, guidelines, and standards for the marine industry. In most cases, these international agreements, guidelines, and standards form the basis for national standards/regulations and class society rules. The U.S. Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Working Group supports the U.S. Representative to the IMO Subcommittee in developing the U.S. position on those issues raised at the IMO Subcommittee meetings. Because of the impact on domestic regulations through development of these international guidelines, standards, and regulations, the U.S. SOLAS Working Group serves as an excellent forum for the U.S. maritime industry to express their ideas. All shipping companies, shipyards, design firms, naval architects, marine engineers, and consultants are encouraged to send representatives to participate in the development of U.S. positions on those issues affecting your maritime industry and remain abreast of all activities ongoing within the IMO. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Members of the public may attend this meeting up to the seating capacity of the room.

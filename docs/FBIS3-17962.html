The statement  of the Armenian side came two days after the statement of the  Iranian Foreign Ministry, which said that the Iranian plane had  been brought down on March 17 by a missile, fired by the  Armenian troops deployed in Nagorno-Karabakh.    According to the Armenian Foreign Ministry, circulated on  the next day after the accident, the Iranian military-transport  plane, which was flying from Moscow to Tehran, deviated from his  course by about 100 km, instead of entering Armenia's air space.

According  to the preliminary information of the Armenian side, something  went wrong with the mechanisms of the plane, which was denied,  however, by experts from the Foreign Ministry, civil aviation  and the air force of Iran, who visited Stepanakert. All the 32  Iranian citizens, who were on board the plane, including women  and children, died. After official honours in Yerevan, their  remains were sent to Tehran.</p>

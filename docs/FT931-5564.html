			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / People: North West Water flows into Europe When Swedish-born Eva Wisemark walked into the office of North West Water's chief executive Bob Thian to be greeted in Danish, she was immediately impressed. 'I have great respect for anyone with English as their mother tongue who bothers to learn a Scandinavian language.' Presumably Thian was also impressed because he has now hired Wisemark, whose own linguistic skills are considerable and who has globe-trotted vigorously in a varied career, as the water company's European project director, a new position reporting to Alan Dean, group business development director. With a mechanical engineering degree under her belt, her first job was selling gas turbines and steam generators for GEC in Sweden. She has worked with the Austrian State Power Board in Vienna, MIAG in Braunschweig, Germany, and John Brown Engineering in Portsmouth. For the past 13 years she was based in the US, latterly as director of external business development in the engineered materials sector of Allied-Signal. There she did a good deal of work in former eastern European countries, which in turn is part of her new beat. North West Water has a highly ambitious Pounds 5bn investment programme this decade, with 8,000 projects under way at any one time. The new opening also offers her the chance to quit commuting across the Atlantic to see her husband who moved back to Cheshire two years ago. While it has pursued contracts in locations from Thailand to Australia to Indonesia as opportunities presented themselves, North West has hitherto had almost no presence in Europe - save a German operation belonging to Wallace &amp; Tiernan of the US which has been part of the group since 1991. Wisemark has a team of a dozen east European engineers who are working for her to produce a range of feasibility studies on possible North West Water projects in their respective countries. She is also looking within the EC to decide how and where the UK utility can best compete.</p>

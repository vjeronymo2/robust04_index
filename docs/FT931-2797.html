			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Sheffield companies forecast better profits THE FIRST quarterly economic survey by a north of England chamber of commerce this year shows a marked increase in business confidence, further expansion of companies into export markets and a small increase in capital investment. Sheffield chamber's survey of 315 companies also suggests there is a reduction in labour-shedding. A quarter of companies cut their workforce in the first quarter, but only 12 per cent say they would do so between April and June. There was also a rise in companies recruiting - 31 per cent compared with 28 per cent in the last quarter of 1992. The chamber itself reported a 15 per cent rise in the volume of export documentation processed for member companies last year, most of it for the dollar-based markets of the US, Middle East and Pacific Rim. The clearest sign of revival in confidence was that 50 per cent of companies expected better profits this year, while 60 per cent forecast improved turnover. Only 17 per cent of companies expected profits to decline and only 11 per cent predicted a fall in turnover. A trend of falling domestic orders in recent quarters seems to have halted, while one third reported improved sales in the first quarter. There was also more confidence about making capital investments this year. But companies are worried about financing recovery. 'Many have concern that some organisations will have problems in obtaining credit to finance new output,' the chamber says. 'Slow payment is also adding pressure to cashflows, creating more reliance on banks for funds.' the chamber said.</p>

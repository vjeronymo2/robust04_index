			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Brazil to raise Dollars 15bn in new taxes to combat inflation THE Brazilian government yesterday unveiled a long-awaited fiscal reform package to raise Dollars 15bn through new taxes as a key part of its battle against inflation, now running at more than 1,000 per cent a year. The project, which involves constitutional amendments and requires congressional approval, is aimed at covering a Cr110,000bn (Dollars 12bn) hole in next year's public finances and at combatting mounting tax evasion which has seen tax revenues fall 25 per cent in real terms over the last two years. The new economics team plans to show this to the International Monetary Fund at the reopening of negotiations next month in an attempt to rescue a Dollars 2.1bn standby agreement which has lapsed because of failure to meet targets. The principal new taxes to be introduced are: a 0.25 to 0.3 per cent tax on all financial movements including cheques a selective tax on fuel, electricity, cars, tobacco, beverages and telephone calls a 7 per cent aggregated value tax on the final price of products and services. These replace a tax on financial operations and a tax on industrial products as well as various social security contributions and profit taxes which companies have been challenging in court. Half of all revenue raised through the new taxation scheme will go towards financing domestic debt, and states and municipalities will be banned from issuing new debt titles up to the year 2000. The government also pledged to pay a 147 per cent increase to pensioners. The project must be passed this year if the new taxes are to come into effect in 1993. Officials admit their chances are slim because of limited time before the Christmas recess.</p>

However,  in a few years the EEA is in danger of being undermined when  four of the five countries mentioned are to become full members  of the EU.    The EEA dethrones the North American Free Trade Agreement  (NAFTA), which made the United States, Canada, and Mexico into a  large market, as the biggest market in the world. NAFTA may be  bigger in terms of surface area, but the EEA has a larger  population, larger production, and a larger share in world trade.    The EEA has 372 million inhabitants compared with NAFTA's  360  million. The EEA has a joint GNP of $7,500 billion (270,000  billion Belgian francs [BFr]) compared with NAFTA's $6,770  billion (BFr244,000 billion). The EEA exports $3,878  (BFr140,000) per inhabitant, compared with $1,683 (BFr60,500) in  NAFTA.    Originally the aim was that all seven countries in the  European Free Trade Association (EFTA) should join the EEA. But  the Swiss voters decided otherwise in a referendum at the end of  1992. The treaty had to be quickly adapted to accommodate  Switzerland's dropping out and be ratified again. In addition,  Liechtenstein, which has a customs treaty with Switzerland, was  also unable to join for the time being.    Somewhat ambitiously, the EEA is sometimes called the  biggest  single market in the world. However, the current negotiations  on Norway, Sweden, Finland and Austria joining the EU make it  clear that EEA membership is still some distance from EU  membership.    First, the EFTA countries involved have no representatives  in  the European institutions, they do not take part in  decisionmaking procedures within the Union and are adopting  nothing of the Union's political ambitions. But, on the  strictly economic level, integration does not go so far as  within the Union.    Agriculture and fishing are outside the EEA agreement; the  free movement of goods between the Union and the EFTA countries  can be limited for reasons of public safety or public health and  there is no joint trade policy. Restrictions continue to apply  to the purchase of real estate and direct investment in the EFTA  countries.    But the EFTA countries are adopting the EU's rules on free  competition. They are setting up their own "Supervisory  Council," which is to ensure that rules of competition are  respected. From now on the five countries will also be involved  in the preparation of new EU laws.    For these reasons many observers see EEA membership as  merely  an interim step to full EU membership.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, April 5 (AFP) -- Romanian Foreign  Minister Teodor Melescanu said Tuesday that he hoped Serbia  would make an effort in peace negotiations on Bosnia and in turn  be rewarded with lighter sanctions. President Slobodan  Milosevic and Foreign Affairs Minister Vladislav Jovanovic of  Serbia were on an official visit to Romania Tuesday.    In an interview with AFP, Melescanu said: "The Serbs can not  and must not stay outside of the peace process." He referred to  the recent accord forming a Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia  which the Serbs refused to join.    He said that if the Serbs agreed to form some kind of  relationship with the new federation, sanctions imposed on rump  Yugoslavia should be eased. "The goal of the embargo is not to  create useless suffering but to encourage a peaceful solution to  the conflict," he said. "One must use the carrot as well as the  stick."    He said Bucharest has a direct interest in a peaceful end to  the conflict. Romania has lost nearly seven billion dollars in  trade since the sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro began  two years ago.</p>

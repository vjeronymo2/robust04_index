Saying "we cannot understand at all the prime  minister's explanations because they sound unnatural and  unreasonable," both Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the Japan  Communist Party [JCP] plan to intensively question, during the  Diet session, the prime minister to reveal details of how he  borrowed the 100 million yen and repayed the money afterwards.  On the other hand, the prime minister submitted relevant  documents and a letter of explanation to a council of the lower  house Budget Committee on 15 December. Because of this, he plans  to refuse demands from the LDP and JCP, saying that "groundless  suspicion will be dispelled completely." Since the prime  minister gave different answers to parliamentary  interpellations, many members of the ruling parties are worried  that the issue may develop into a scandal. It is possible that  the issue of 100 billion yen may have fatal impact on  deliberation of political reform bills should the prime minister  fail to handle it correctly. It may also develop into an issue  of whether he must resign or continue to remain in his post.  Therefore, the prime minister's close associates are feeling a  growing sense of crisis.    Regarding the issue of 100 million yen, both the LDP and JCP  are deepening their suspicion. A senior LDP member said: "It  is a lie that he borrowed the money. The truth is that the  money was an illegal contribution from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin. In  short, he was given the money."    The prime minister said, in the documents and during his  responses to questions at the lower house Budget Committee, that  he had borrowed the 100 million yen to buy an apartment in Tokyo  and to repair plaster walls and a temple gate of his house,  which is designated as a cultural asset, in Kumamoto. He also  explained that he signed a loan contract in October 1982.  However, he purchased the apartment house in Tokyo at the price  of 75 million yen in July before signing the loan contract, and  repair work started from six months to nearly one year after  signing the contract. Both the LDP and the JCP are saying that  "we cannot possibly believe the prime minister's explanations."    Moreover, what invited fierce objections from both parties  were six documents (all of which are copies and the originals  were confiscated by the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors  Office) and a letter, which explains the contents of the  documents. The prime minister submitted the documents to the  Budget Committee, saying: "They were supplied by Sagawa Kyubin."    Some of the documents are: 1) A copy of the loan contract  signed between the prime minister and Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin on 6  October 1982. A column for the lender's name on the contract is  left out blank; 2) A copy of a mortgage contract, signed in  1982, with blank columns for lender's name and date of signing.  The contract holds a mortgage on the prime minister's villa in  Yugawara-cho in Kanagawa Prefecture; 3) A copy of an unsealed  receipt, which was issued when the prime minister returned 10  million yen to Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin on 31 January 1990; and 4)  Copies of Sagawa Kyubin's written notices, dated 15 December  1982 and 28 March 1983, for interest payment schedules. They  were addressed to the prime minister but an accountant's seal on  the written notices was blacked out.    The LDP suspects that they are forged documents, saying that  "we cannot possibly believe that the receipts without seals, the  written papers with blacked-out seals, and other papers are real  accounting documents," (according to a senior member of the LDP  Diet Policy Committee). On the basis of Clause 104 of the Diet  Act, the party plans to call for a submission of the original  documents to the lower house Budget Committee. At the same  time, the LDP will press for summoning the prime minister's  former Secretary Masatoshi Fukayama to the Diet to testify as a  witness.    Due to the prime minister's explanations, which change every  day, people are deepening their suspicion. At the Budget  Committee meeting, he repeatedly corrected his explanations  regarding details of the loan repayment schedule and on repair  of the plaster walls and the gate. The prime minister, when it  came to a critical part, refused to answer questions, saying:  "I do not remember the details because I entrust my office with  the task of taking care of everything." Such responses at Diet  interpellations give us the impression that the issue of the 100  million yen loan is a suspicious case.</p>

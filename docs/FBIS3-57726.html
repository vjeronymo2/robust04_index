An Absolutely Normal Career"]    [Text] Sergey Dubinin has been appointed acting finance  minister for the time being. There is hardly any doubt,  however, that Sergey Dubinin will survive the trial period and  become a full- blown minister.    Admittedly, Sergey Konstantinovich Dubinin has worked in the  government fairly long and not just by dashing in and out --  although formerly he always played second fiddle. Before  becoming first deputy finance minister, he was Vladimir Mashits'  deputy at the State Committee for Economic Cooperation. He came  there from a scientific environment (they say that Gaydar  attended his seminars). Dubinin's work at the Economic  Cooperation Committee was fairly effective; he was involved in  negotiating interstate treaties on deliveries between the CIS  countries and the Baltic states. Dubinin's competence in CIS  matters does not raise any doubts as to his orientation toward  Russian national interests.    Aside from overall economic competence, Dubinin is known for  a healthy blend of theory and practice -- at any rate, he is not  dogmatic. Another noteworthy feature is his ability to work  fruitfully as part of a "team," which is typical for most chiefs  who have held first deputy posts. Of course, any postponement  of inflation a la the political campaign-94 is out of the  question. This does not mean, however, that the tap of credit  resources will be fully open. On the contrary, one may expect  an improvement in actual results of the ministry's operation,  because at Council of Ministers meetings Dubinin will raise  conceptual matters instead of newspaper pages, which will be a  compensation to a certain degree for the office holder's loss of  a deputy prime minister's title: the status of deputy prime  minister and the post of the Credit Commission chairman, plus  presidential confidence, enabled Fedorov to work (refuse to give  money) virtually without discussing his steps. Dubinin appears  to be able to bring relations between a finance minister and a  Central Bank chairman back to a normal working relationship.    On the whole, Sergey Dubinin, keeping a low political  profile, is the best choice for Chernomyrdin's government of  pragmatists.</p>

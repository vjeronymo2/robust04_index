			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> When "Oh! Calcutta!" cast members put on their clothes and went home after  Sunday night's performance in New York, it marked the close of what has been  billed as "the world's longest-running erotic stage musical." The show, born of  the 1960s era of "free love," ended with its 5,959th performance. The revue  opened Off-Broadway on June 17, 1969 and has moved to several New York theaters  since then. There were 10 in the cast then. The final performance had eight in  the opening number, "Taking Off the Robe," and 11 in the finale as a few alumni  returned for a final scamper in white robes and birthday suits. With the  5,832th Broadway performance of "A Chorus Line" this weekend -- it opened a few  months earlier but has had a less-intensive schedule -- "Oh! Calcutta!'s" mark  is expected to fall this fall. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Arts: A place where history is not forgotten - Northern Ireland's museum trail TO describe Northern Ireland as off the normal beat for arts writers is perhaps an understatement. However, an unusual promotion, a brochure entitled Museums of Ulster, The European Connection, sponsored by the European Arts Festival, hopes to change that. Nine museums in Ulster have collaborated in the making of the brochure which is funded by an EEC grant of Pounds 10,000. Their aim is to put their permanent collections on the tourist map. From any other region of the UK, such a modest initiative would appear worthy but dull, but because this is Northern Ireland, matters looked more promising. For a start, given the perception of the province in the wider world, an invitation to 'take a voyage through the history of Ireland and Europe' appears more in the nature of a challenge. And then there are the interesting questions such a voyage raises. How is history to be packaged for presentation amid a population bitterly divided by memories, grievances, prejudices, and bloodshed? The brochure picks up the European theme of the Festival by highlighting exhibits which illustrate Ireland's cultural links to continental Europe. A visit to Derry brought education in treacherous place-names. The 'London-' on the roadsigns along the road to the city has been painted out, and the brochure referred to the new Tower Museum at Derry in County Londonderry. So in at least one official circle, it looks as though the use of Londonderry for the city has been dropped, in deference to the nationalist view that it is an indefensible, unhistorical Anglicisation. The Tower Museum, opening at the end of this month, surveys the history of Derry, one of the oldest cities in Ulster. It dates back to the 6th Century in the eyes of those who see its founder as St Columba. Derry's more recent history that has blackened its reputation. In the Troubles in the 1970s, one-third of Derry's city-centre was destroyed. However, since the mid-1980s there has been much rebuilding and a determined attempt, using funds from the EEC, to promote the city's heritage to attract tourism. The plan deserves to work. Except for its bad days, mercifully rare in the past four years, Derry appears as a charming and congenial place. The old city, up high overlooking the valley of the River Foyle, has streets of well-restored Georgian town-houses, the only intact city-walls in Ireland, and an exuberant arts scene which leaves Belfast looking decidedly stodgy. Brian Lacey, director of Derry's museums, sees his task as made easier for having one world-famous event to promote: the Siege of Derry of 1689. At the siege, King James II and his Catholic army (including troops sent by Louis XIV) were frustrated by the dogged endurance of the Protestant defenders of Derry, who for 105 days held the city for William III. It needs tact and a certain courage to make a museum display out of an event which rates with the Battle of the Boyne as sacred moments in the annals of Protestant Ulster. Lacey himself is from the Republic, something not at all uncommon in the museum world, where cross-border links are getting closer. The majority of the inhabitants in Derry is Catholic and nationalist, so Lacey had no idea what to expect when he mounted an exhibition in 1989 devoted to the Siege. On the day of the opening, the Provisional IRA blew up a pub by the museum car park. It was a warning: this could have been your museum. Since then, Lacey's feeling is that the atmosphere in Derry has improved considerably. The Tower Museum itself is a curious structure, built in the 1980s as a symbol of Derry's renewal. The finale remains to be settled. It may come up as far as the late 1970s, and include rubber bullets, posters and letters written on lavatory-paper by Bobby Sands, the republican hunger-striker who died in 1981, and smuggled out of prison. But a video made about the Troubles has already fallen foul of the politicians. Some of them urge that the subject be dropped altogether, a solution Lacey reprehends as 'dishonest and lopsided'. Even without it, local sensitivities could always be inflamed, very probably by the effigy of Lundy. A 'lundy' in Northern Ireland parlance is a traitor. According to the Protestant version, Robert Lundy was the governor who during the siege treacherously betrayed King William's trust by shinning down a pear-tree which grew beside the city wall and disappearing. Until recently, Lundy was a - literally - explosive symbol of Protestant supremacy, because every December the Apprentice Boys used to stuff his effigy with fireworks and hang it from the Walker Pillar. Down in the mean, terraced streets of the Bogside, the Catholic population returned the fire - metaphorically on this occasion - by setting their chimneys alight. Nine years ago, the Provos blew up the Walker Pillar, so Lundy now meets his annual fate on the steps of the court-house. At the charming Ulster Folk and Transport Museum at Holywell, County Down, pains are being taken to get the denominational mix correct in reconstructing historic churches in the expanding 'village' which is the centrepoint of the museum. Museum staff talking as if simply to get Catholics and Protestants under the same roof to enjoy the same experiences, marks a victory - whether it be jewellery from the famous Armada wrecks at the Ulster Museum in Belfast or wildlife videos at the recently refurbished Fermanagh County Museum at Enniskillen. On this simplest of criteria, museums hardly need to tackle difficult subjects. Their justificiation for seeking larger grants from local authorities, central government, and the EEC is their contribution to 'Education for Mutual Understanding', or Emu. At Down County Museum in Downpatrick, staff regularly teach children from Protestant and Catholic schools, folk-traditions, such as the rituals for St Brigid's Day. On March 17, St Patrick's Day, a strange medley of events, from pipe bands to tractor clubs, brings over 3,000 visitors to the museum, a stone's thrown from the legendary burial place of the saint. Director Brian Turner demurred at my suggestion that he was bringing the two communities together. For him there is just the one community, and no reason whatsoever why it should not take pride in the mysterious, but mercifully ecumenical, figure of St Patrick, 'one of the few things in Northern Ireland which is a world attraction.' In all these museums, one senses a particularly strong emphasis on reaching out to children. In 1991, a survey conducted in Northern Ireland on public attitudes towards museums showed that four in 10 adults said they never went and 'most of the remainder' visited only once every two or three years. Protestants went more than Catholics. However, the survey also showed that Protestants and Catholics alike see museums as a vital resource for preserving the province's history and cultural traditions, and that they consider museums give an unbiased presentation of history. In terms of Emu, then, school outings seem to be the crux of the relationship between museums and their public. On the other hand, time alone will tell whether taking children to museums has any lasting impact on the social stereotypes, incomprehension, and hatred. Meanwhile, at the Ulster Museum in Belfast, an astoundingly profitable exhibition bought in from the US has pulled in more than 150,000 visitors this summer, mostly children, to gawp at lunging, roaring dinosaurs. Director John Nolan's gamble has paid off and this expensive show have wiped out seven years of accumulated debt. He answers critics by pointing out this blockbuster also plays its part in contributing to Emu by attracting so many people, often first-time callers, to the museum. The problem is the pressure on space which means masterpieces of the museum's fine art collection, such as Turner's The Origin of Christianity, are put in store. There is pressure for a separate art gallery to be built in Belfast. This month, the Museum offers compensation with a large exhibition of its own drawings and watercolours, previously seen in the US, and Sir James Lavery's bequest of his paintings goes on show in November. But for the genuinely curious visitor from abroad, even dinosaurs make their point about life in Northern Ireland. On a damp August morning, there was not a soldier to be seen as queues waited for the museum to open. Inside, the dinosaurs' lair was a pandemonium of children screaming with delight. Every day people had been asking me, 'So how do you find the place?'. Right then - but not for the only time - my answer would have been 'just like anywhere else'.

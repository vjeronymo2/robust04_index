			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Belikov report: "Saving `Moscow-City' Project; the </F> Capital's Government Has Taken Over Control of It"]    [Text] There has been a change of leader in the "City"  joint-stock company, which is engaged in the construction of the  Moscow International Business Center [MIBC] in Presnya -- the  capital's largest construction project. V. Silin, deputy leader  of Moscow's construction department, has become the company's  president in place of A. Khazhakyan (who came to the post in  1992 after being managing director of the Russian Commodities  and Raw Materials Exchange). The former has taken charge of  "City's" board of directors. These personnel changes are  subject to confirmation at the annual shareholders' meeting 30  April.    The tempting idea of having something akin to New York's  Manhattan in the Russian capital was conceived two years ago.  Since then an architectural design for the center has come into  being, a plan of its transport links has been prepared, and many  negotiations have been conducted with possible major foreign  investors, of which one has, it seems, agreed to finance phase 1  of the construction operations. And that is all as regards  specific results of the activities of the joint-stock company,  which has among its shareholders 99 organizations, companies,  and other legal entities, as well as more than 17,000 individual  share holders.    Evidently, such a slow pace in implementing this project  which affects the global prestige of Moscow, its government, and  Mayor Yu. Luzhkov personally, provoked the justified concern of  the city authorities.    Deputy Minister I. Ordzhonikidze brought the government's  concern to the notice of the joint-stock company's board of  directors, after which practical conclusions were made -- A.  Khazhakyan was dismissed.    The creation of MIBC ("Moscow-City") continues to be one of  the city's priority programs.    Apart from the construction of a metro line, the clearance  of  site of the future center, the laying of underground roads,  utilities, and main sewers, this work also involves the  construction of three buildings. They include an office and  hotel complex costing $150 million built by the "Reforma" fund  together with foreign partners, a 300-400-room four-star hotel,  and an administrative and business block. The city government's  patronage will soon be officially recorded in documentary form  as a special decree signed by the premier, in which the  government's present task is formulated as "participating in the  preparation of infrastructure to attract foreign investment."    In other words the city authorities are establishing strict  control over the execution of "Moscow-City" project, with a view  to there being something to show on Krasnopresnenskaya  Embankment by as early as fall 1997 -- the 850th anniversary of  the Russian capital.</p>

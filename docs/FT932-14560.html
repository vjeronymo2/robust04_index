			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Books: Crazy, man - crazy FADS, FASHIONS AND CULTS by Tony Thorne Bloomsbury Pounds 20, 310 pages ONE MUST be so careful these days. Ask directions of a New Age traveller and you might find yourself addressing, instead, a Smellie, a Soap Dodger or a self-styled Cider Punk. Thanks to Tony Thorne's kaleidoscopic new guide to the pseuds' corners and sub-cultures of modern Britain, New Men, New Romantics and New Georgians can sit down and discover how new they really are. For Fads, Fashions and Cults is no ordinary dictionary. Its world is a post-modernist one in which nothing has meaning but everything, from Cocteau to cocktail sticks, can have significance. Cross-referencing frantically, Thorne lays bare the song-lines of 20th century living. Like generational lists from the Old Testament, he says a disco craze like Talking begat Toasting which begat Dub which begat Rap. Hip Hop begat Body Pop which, in turn, begat Rave. Not everything is as crystal-clear as that, of course. Did Punks or the Crusties ('Crusties practise a militant self-degradation involving drink and drug abuse, personal filthiness and public obnoxiousness') beget Grunge? Then again, which dissident hair-style came first: the Duck's Arse or the Argentine Ducktail? Replies on a postcard to the author, who says he wants his readers to answer back. Some lines of enquiry lead nowhere. Trepanning, or drilling a hole in the skull to release higher levels of consciousness, seems to have begat only publicity for Dr Bart Hughers, a Dutch mystic who tried it in 1962. Forest Therapy begat Tree Sniffing but little else. True, contemplating a tree at close quarters while inhaling the resinous fumes given off by its bark and leaves might, as our author speculates doggedly, have something to do with the 'outdoor Shamanistic rituals of the Men's Movement.' But by the time he has thrown in the Combat Games cult to boot, the reader has got his song-lines well and truly knotted. Like the four rivers leading away from Paradise, if there are four grand-daddy cult fads and fashions which spawned the rest, then Hip Hop, the Beats, Existentialism and the hula hoop appear to have a lot to answer for. Indeed, we learn that the hula hoop looks forward to aerobics and back to the Maori war dance. 'Only connect,' EM Forster once suggested as a means of comprehending modern society. Reading this self-styled 'definitive' guide to modern culture, he might rather have wished he hadn't.</p>

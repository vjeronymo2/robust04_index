			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DUE EXPOSURE  </P> <P> I am delighted to finally read something about "Northern Exposure" in your TV  Times.  </P> <P> I was beginning to think we were the only ones watching it. It is the best  program to come along in years and we are hoping it will not just disappear.  The plots are so imaginative and original, very humorous and the characters are  wonderful. Beautiful scenery -- no car crashes, murders, hokey families, etc.  </P> <P> Please, please help keep it on the air all year.  </P> <P> George H. Boyer, San Marcos  </P></p>

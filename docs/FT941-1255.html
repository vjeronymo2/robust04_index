			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Sterling and dollar suffer Sterling and the dollar yesterday fell to four month lows on the foreign exchanges against a resurgent D-Mark, writes Philip Gawith. Both currencies fell below key support levels. Yesterday evening the dollar was trading below DM1.67 and sterling was just above DM2.49 having earlier breached the key DM2.50 level. Their decline, which came amid a general climate of interest rate pessimism in Europe, was sparked off by an annualised 17.6 per cent growth in German M3 in February. Although this poor figure - way above the Bundesbank's 4-6 per cent target range - was widely discounted, it introduced a cautionary note into the market's view about how quickly German interest rates might fall. This feeling was accentuated by the perception that Europe will find it difficult to decouple its interest rates from the US which has started a process of credit tightening. These views were reflected in the D-Mark which finished the day higher across the board. It closed in London more than a pfennig stronger against the dollar, finishing at DM1.6726 from DM1.685 on Wednesday. In Europe it closed higher against the French franc, closing at FFr3.424 from FFr3.418. Against sterling it was nearly two pfennigs higher at DM2.4971 from DM2.5165. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at the Bank of America, said sterling's weakness could be explained by the fact that it seemed to suffer disproportionately at a time of general D-Mark strength. He said this reflected the market view that the UK remained vulnerable to a politically inspired rate cut. Personally unpopular, and facing potentially large losses in local elections in May, and European elections in June, some observers believe prime minister John Major is under pressure to cut rates. This view was not shared by either the gilts or short sterling futures market where prices fell. Futures contracts were lower across the board. The June contract settled at 94.73, ten basis points down on the day. The December contract fell 14 basis points to 94.25, while the June 95 contract was 29 points lower at 93.44. Contrary to those who are looking for a further cut in UK rates, the market is signalling that three month interest rates will be 5.75 per cent at the end of the year - 50 basis points above the current level of 5.25 per cent. In the discount market the Bank of England provided late assistance of Pounds 535m. Earlier it had put Pounds 341m liquidity into the system after forecasting a Pounds 850m shortage. Overnight rates moved between 5 per cent and 6 per cent. Analysts yesterday expressed some surprise at the D-Mark strength given the backdrop of falling interest rates in Germany. It appeared to provide yet further confirmation of the unravelling of 'consensus trades' in foreign exchange markets. At the beginning of the year the market built in long dollar and short D-Mark positions. Now there is evidence these positions are being reversed. Although the February M3 figure lent support to the D-Mark, the money supply figures are so anomalous at the moment that the Bundesbank seems unlikely to use them as an excuse for not lowering rates. The fact that the Bundesbank allowed the repo rate to fall by eight basis points the day before the M3 figure was released lends support to this view. This sentiment was reflected in the cash markets where, helped by adequate liquidity, German call money rates eased to 5.70/80 per cent from 5.75/85 per cent on Wednesday. The futures markets sent a different message, with Euromark contracts softening slightly. The June contract was unchanged at 94.50, but the longer contracts lost ground. Elsewhere in Europe the Bank of France said it would cut its intervention rate to 6.00 per cent from 6.10 per cent at a securities repurchase tender held to allocate funds for injection into the money market. The intervention rate at which the central bank allocates repo funds was last cut, from 6.20 per cent, on February 24. The tardy pace of interest rate cuts has not helped the franc which has weakened steadily over the past two weeks. Indeed, some commentators cite the franc as evidence of a return to the ERM log-jam of old, where markets believe interest rates need to fall faster than the pace set by the Bundesbank, to forestall domestic political pressures. The Italian lira continued its recent weakness ahead of Sunday's election. It closed in London at L993.2 from L988.9. Investors are expected to stay on the sideline until the result becomes known on Tuesday. The dominant view among analysts is that a centre-left government will be lira positive. It would be able to introduce the sorts of fiscal and institutional reforms which markets would welcome. Under this scenario, Mr Steven Yorke, chief European analyst at Chase Manhattan, believes the lira could reach L950 by the year end.</p>

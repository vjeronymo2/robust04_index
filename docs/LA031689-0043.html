It was the first time in 41 years that Communist  officials had made a public legal holiday of the March 15 anniversary of  Hungary's unsuccessful revolt against Austria in 1848. A 12-point declaration  calling for more freedom and independence was read at a large rally in front of  the Hungarian state television offices. The declaration also demanded the  withdrawal of Soviet troops, a multi-party political system and freedom of  speech and the press.  </P></p>

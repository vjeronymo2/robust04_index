			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["S. Korea; Chongukyonhap Calls for Peaceful Solution of </F> Nuclear Issue" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 18 (KCNA) -- The South Korean  National Alliance for Democracy and Reunification  (Chongukyonhap) in a statement June 16 contended that the  North's "nuclear issue" should be solved in a peaceful way  through a package deal between the North and the United States,  a Seoul-based radio report said.    The statement said a package solution whereby to renounce  the  hostile policy toward the North and normalize relations with it  is the only way of securing the nuclear transparency of the  North as the United States wants to see and, at the same time,  of ensuring the safety of the entire nation of the Korean  peninsula and defending world peace.    It urged the puppet authorities to oppose "sanctions" on the  North and strive for a peaceful solution of the problem and to  stop acts of creating "a situation for a new security-oriented  rule" on the pretext of the North's "nuclear issue" in a bid to  suppress the national democratic movement and force "an  endorsement of the Uruguay Round final agreement".</p>

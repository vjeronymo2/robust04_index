			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Criticism mounts of BT's selling by numbers / A look at the fresh pressures facing the company as the last tranche of the government's shares is offered for sale IF British Telecommunications thought the forthcoming sale of the government's last tranche of shares in the company would give it a break from regulatory pressure, the last week will have been a rude shock. The prospectus for the Pounds 5bn sale, published last week, revealed that BT may face a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into its directory advertising services, notably its lucrative Yellow Pages business. This week came notice from Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, that it is to investigate directory enquiry services, where BT has a virtual monopoly. Should the two investigations happen they will be separate - but there will be considerable overlap. This is because the loudest complaint of competitors to Yellow Pages is that BT's control of its numbering database gives it an un-warranted advantage in the market for printed directories. Thomson Directories, the main rival to Yellow Pages, has been airing its grievances against BT for nearly a decade. It is no longer alone. Mercury and the newly established cable TV companies are adding their voices - and it was all these representations which precipitated the investigations. Announcing the second investigation, Mr Don Cruickshank, director-general of Oftel, stressed the need for telecommunications subscribers to have access to a 'complete' directory service, 'especially at the local level' in which the cable companies are starting to compete fiercely with BT. With the BT3 share sale imminent, BT refuses to discuss its directories business. But analysts estimate that revenue from Yellow Pages last year was in excess of Pounds 350m, with a profit margin approaching 40 per cent. Rivals complain of BT's charges. Mercury has to pay BT Pounds 3.80 a year for each of its numbers listed in BT's directories. The cable TV companies, in addition to paying for entries, buy directories from BT for distribution to their customers, many of whom have severed their BT connections. The cable companies resent having to pay BT the full retail price for the directories - Pounds 6.50 for 'white' pages and Pounds 5 for Yellow Pages - when BT customers get them 'free' - the price being buried in the line rental and not separately accounted for in BT's accounts. Thomson is similarly concerned about BT's prices and its refusal to break them down. In 1989 it secured a licence giving it access to the business-numbers side of BT's numbering database, for a price similar to that 'paid' by Yellow Pages to BT's numbering information services division. However, Thomson believes that the price is too high in relation to the costs, and that BT is able to get away with it only because of Yellow Pages' dominant position. It points to new BT directory services, such as Electronic Yellow Pages and Talking Pages, and questions whether they recover their full costs. It also questions whether other BT divisions pay the Yellow Pages rate for access to the database. The implication is that BT should have to account separately not just for its main 'retail' and 'network' businesses, as suggested recently by Oftel, but also for smaller 'retail' and 'network' units within them. After all, for Thomson - with a turnover estimated at barely a sixth that of Yellow Pages - small differences in prices charged by one part of BT to another make a critical difference to its capacity to compete. Thomson is thinking, for instance, about offering a rival directory enquiry service to BT's, but says it needs to be able to unbundle BT's prices to be able to assess the potential. A drastic option would be to take the numbering database away from BT. That would be the ultimate in unbundling, and prevent BT from gaining benefits which are hard to quantify in its accounts - such as early access to numbering changes and the ability to use its residential database to target Yellow Pages and other services to phone subscribers, an economy which Thomson claims places it at a competitive disadvantage. Mr Gordon Mitchell, Thomson finance director, says: 'All we want is to compete on a level playing field with BT businesses in the area of telephone information services.' That is the plaintive cry of all would-be competitors to entrenched operators. For Thomson, however, there is a bitter irony. From 1965 until 1980 it had a contract to provide Yellow Pages for the Post Office, as it then was. When it lost the contract for part of the country in a competitive tender in 1980 it decided to go it alone - and started to scrap with its former paymaster.</p>

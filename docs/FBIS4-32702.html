			<p>BFN     [Text] At the present time, all of the prerequisites exist  in the Czech Army for the reduction of the Armed Forces to the  planned 65,000 in 1995, Defense Minister Antonin Baudys said  today. He said that, over the past 18 months, the number of  troops was reduced from just below 106,000 to 88,000 men under  arms. Key posts on strategic and operational levels were filled  with uncompromised and professionally trained generals and  officers, Baudys said.</p>

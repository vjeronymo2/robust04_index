			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Piecemeal progress has been reported at the Lusaka  talks. Yesterday, the National Union for the Total Independence  of Angola [UNITA] and the government met and made additional  progress. We have learned that consensus has been reached on  UNITA's role in central and provincial governments and in the  news media, and on changes to the existing constitution. More  than 70 percent of the 16-point document on national  reconciliation submitted by the mediator has been dealt with.  All that is left now is to approve the modalities on the  implementation of specific principles, as well as the status to  be accorded to His Excellency Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi,  president of UNITA, and the return of UNITA property.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["fy." report: "Resistance to Ruehe's Plans in CDU/CSU </F> Bundestag Group"]    [Excerpts] Bonn, 20 Apr -- The decision of Defense  Minister Ruehe to reduce the Bundeswehr strength from 370,000 to  320,000 men and the basic military service from 12 to 10 months  was unanimously rejected in the defense working group of the  Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU]  Bundestag Group on Wednesday [20 April]. In a three-hour  session, in which, apart from the members of the working group,  only the minister and his state secretaries, Wilz and Mrs.  Geiger, participated, almost all working group members took the  floor. Its chairman, Breuer, made critical comments, just like  former Parliamentary State Secretary Wuerzbach and the following  deputies: Hauser, Uehlhoff, Adam, Mrs. Marienfeld, Strobe,  Augustinowitz, Janovsky, Stockhausen, Ganz, and Kossendey. They  did not show any understanding for Ruehe's decisions. The  assessment of the security policy situation in Europe, which  Ruehe takes as a basis in the recently published white book and  the "conceptual guidelines" deduced from it, is too positive.  The situation is far less stable and calculable than it is  presented. His decision to reduce the basic military service  from 12 to 10 months is a serious danger for the preservation of  compulsory military service, it was stated. Some deputies  expressed the fear that the reduction will pave the way for a  professional army.    At the same time, with the criticism of the material effects  of Ruehe's planned cuts, members of the Bundestag Group  expressed the fear that the financial endowment for the  remaining units will not be improved by the reduction. Rather,  one has to prepare for the possibility that the finance minister  will justify further budget cuts by the Bundeswehr's reduction  and "collect" the savings. Ruehe has not promised that this  will not happen, it was stated. This fear was not refuted in  the debate.    Ruehe resolutely rejected the criticism of his decisions. He  referred to the fact that he had made his decision in  coordination and full agreement with the chancellor. The  government had adopted the assessment of the security policy  situation in the white book. The deputies have to accept that,  he said. The further course of action was also controversial.  First Ruehe reported that he is no longer prepared to  participate in the closed meeting that the working group had  fixed in Siegen for the weekend. After a discussion of half an  hour, Ruehe took his decision back. However, after the  three-hour debate, an agreement in Siegen seemed to be unlikely  to members of the working group. Ruehe also did not make the  impression that he is once again prepared to strive for an  improvement of the Bundeswehr's financial means and thus to  create the prerequisites for the preservation of the Bundeswehr  strength of 370,000 men. [passage omitted]    Before the beginning of the meeting, Ruehe had pointed out  that nobody gets around "some hard facts." This includes that a  Bundeswehr strength of 370,000 men cannot be maintained with the  means that are provided by the government.    A few days ago, in a speech, State Secretary Schoenbohm made  it clear how great the cuts in the Bundeswehr budget after  reunification are. With the inflation rate being taken into  account, it was reduced by 18 percent from 1989 to 1993, next  year the cuts will amount to 25 percent, that is, one-fourth of  the amount available in 1989. In this way, the means available  for materiel and investments decreased by 43 percent until 1993,  he said.</p>

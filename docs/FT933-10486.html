			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Probing the business of failure: A study intended to boost the official receivers THE GOVERNMENT yesterday said that Stoy Hayward Consulting, the accountants, had been appointed to investigate the scope for involving the private sector in the work of the official receivers. Last month's decision to examine ways of contracting out the work of the insolvency service, an executive arm of the Department of Trade and Industry, raised concerns in some quarters that the interests of creditors might be adversely affected. The service has been under mounting pressure from a threefold rise in the number of bankruptcies and compulsory liquidations since 1989. In the 1992-93 financial year company failures and individual bankruptcies totalled 42,700. Yet the number of insolvency service staff has risen only from 1,400 in 1990 to 1,750 this year, straining its ability to perform its investigatory role of preparing the ground for the prosecution of fraud and other offences, and disqualifying directors. Disqualifications rose from 499 in 1990-91 to 700 in 1991-92, while reports prepared for prosecutions rose from 979 in 1990-91 to 1,155 in 1991-92. But over the past 18 months the rate of activity has slackened. Indications are that the number of prosecution reports and disqualifications fell by between 20 per cent and 30 per cent in the past financial year. The Stoy Hayward review is designed to examine ways to reverse this trend by offloading routine administrative and 'paper processing' tasks to the private sector, where they might be carried out more efficiently. This would follow last year's decision to 'market test' the service's central accounting unit, which holds the assets of all insolvent companies and individuals. Some insolvency practitioners welcome the initiative. 'They've been swamped with a load of duff companies,' says Mr Colin Raefide, head of the technical department at Grant Thornton. 'If they get rid of some of the administrative tasks, that will free them up to do what is important. For every case they investigate there are 20 more that need following up.' Others warn that if change is too radical it may damage creditors' interests. Mr Tim Hayward, a KPMG Peat Marwick partner, says many practitioners are 'cynical' about the government's motives and worried about a rundown of funding. A decline in resources available to the official receivers could affect the image of insolvency practitioners. Mr Steve Hill, a partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand and the head of the Institute of Solvency Practitioners' technical committee, says small private insolvency practitioners may be unable to act quickly enough to safeguard assets after the declaration of an insolvency, the point at which there is the greatest risk of 'assets going walkabout'. He is sceptical about the capacity of private practitioners to compete with the official receivers. 'They have 1,700 people they can mobilise,' he says. 'My instinctive view is that it doesn't lend itself to greater private-sector involvement. The Civil Service is doing this at cost. We are doing it for profit. I don't see how we can square the circle. I'd be concerned on behalf of creditors if the quality of work was diluted because it was being done by the lowest bidder.'</p>

Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said this  today. However, the government would be very careful before  taking such action as the government did not want to be seen as  persecuting opposition politicians. The prime minister was  commenting on an Australian news report that the Australian  Secret Intelligence Service, ASIS, paid bribes to Malaysian  opposition politicians in an alleged unauthorized [word  indistinct] meddling in the internal political affairs of a  foreign nation. The report which quoted former ASIS field  agents said the opposition politicians had over many years been  receiving tens of thousands of dollars in bribes from the  Australian spy agency. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said the  government would carry out its own investigation into the matter  as well as keep a close watch on developments in Australia.</p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / International Company News: Cheung Kong pays more as earnings surge CHEUNG KONG, the property development vehicle of Hong Kong's richest man, Mr Li Ka-shing, yesterday posted a 50 per cent jump in 1991 net earnings to HKDollars 4.88bn (USDollars 630.5m) from HKDollars 3.25bn in 1990, writes Simon Holberton. Mr Li announced a final dividend of 51 cents which, with the interim of 17 cents, makes 68 cents for the year - a rise of 42 per cent over 1990. Cheung Kong's results, though not unexpected, underline the strength of Hong Kong's residential property market and the profits of companies exposed to it. Mr Li said in his chairman's statement that in 1992 the area of buildings completed was the largest ever and that, in a rising market, the group's profits rose very sharply. He warned that Cheung Kong was likely to produce in 1992 a lower growth in earnings than that achieved last year. The great proportion of the buildings expected to be completed this year have already been pre-sold. Mr Li said that the confluence of low interest rates and relatively high inflation had prompted the public to invest in property to safeguard the value of their savings. 'This new trend in property buying and the fact that the supply of residential land and buildings is not sufficient have caused the steep rise in the prices of residential buildings in the second half of 1991,' he said. 'Demand for such buildings is expected to remain strong and the market will continue to be active in the foreseeable future.' Mr Li added that the group would continue to identify various investment opportunities and would continue to enlarge its land bank - both in order to lay a good foundation for future growth.</p>

			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> PILLSBURY TO SELL BUMBLE BEE UNIT TO AFFILIATE OF THAILAND COMPANY  </P> <P> The Pillsbury Co. said today it plans to sell its Bumble Bee Seafoods Inc.  subsidiary to an affiliate of Unicord Co. Ltd. of Thailand for $269 million in  cash.  </P> <P> The sale of Bumble Bee and its Santa Fe Springs manufacturing facility to the  newly formed Uni Group Inc., a U.S.-based affiliate of Unicord, is expected to  be completed in September, the companies said.  </P> <P> It follows Pillsbury's announcement last week that it will sell its Van de  Kamp's frozen seafoods division to the Chicago-based Whitman Corp. for about  $140 million in cash.  </P> <P> "Bumble Bee, like Van de Kamp's, is an exceptionally strong company. However,  it does not fit with Pillsbury's long-range strategy for its core businesses,"  said Ian A. Martin, chairman and chief executive officer of Pillsbury.  </P></p>

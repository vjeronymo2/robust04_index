			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Dilemma of sterling recovery: The resurgence of the pound brings its own problems WHAT A difference a year can make in the life of the pound sterling. Nearly 12 months ago the government and the Bank of England were battling to stop the pound falling below its floor against the D-Mark in the European exchange rate mechanism. Now the authorities face the opposite dilemma. Sentiment towards sterling has improved sharply in recent weeks, amid signs that the UK is one of the few countries in Europe to be enjoying economic growth this year. Earlier this week the pound hit a high for this year of DM2.57  - about 9 pfennigs above its level exactly a month ago and 11 per cent above its level in February. The currency lost some ground to a stronger D-Mark towards the end of the week. But some economists still predict that the pound could reach DM2.60 or DM2.65 in the short term, particularly if there is renewed turmoil in the ERM this autumn. That might cause problems for the government. There are signs that sterling's rise may be hampering the UK's trading position by making exports more expensive. Last week the Confederation of British Industry reported a 'slight setback' in exports to Europe in the first two weeks of June. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief currency strategist at Citibank, believes that the UK authorities will become extremely concerned if the currency rises to DM2.60 or DM2.65. In his view, that would roughly correspond with sterling's purchasing-power parity level  - the level at which the exchange rate matches the value of the goods that it trades  - and a move higher would actively undermine the UK's export competitiveness. 'If the government allows the currency to move to those levels, then it will be ensuring that this is the shortest economic recovery in history,' Mr MacKinnon said. But what action can the UK authorities take to cap the rise of the pound? One thing must be almost certain  - there will be little appetite in government for returning to the days of a sterling target, tacit or otherwise. Mr Nigel Lawson, the former chancellor, ran into severe problems trying to shadow the D-Mark in the late 1980s, and his successor, Mr Norman Lamont, was unable to maintain sterling's ERM parity. Cutting base rates would be more popular, especially with worried Tory backbenchers. A lower short-term return for international investors would cause some to sell sterling, and have the additional benefit of stimulating consumer spending and the housing market. But it could backfire and boost the pound further, because foreign exchange dealers sometimes put a higher premium on economic growth than short-term gain. 'If interest rates are cut in a country where growth already exists, the tendency is for the currency to rise further,' said Mr Jeremy Hawkins, economic adviser at Bank of America in London. However, the government could decide to do nothing. Although sterling is enjoying a rise at the moment, the size of the public sector borrowing requirement, at Pounds 50bn this financial year, has raised serious concerns about the state of the public finances, which could undermine investors' sentiment towards the end of the year. The government might even take some perverse pleasure from its political difficulties, knowing that such troubles have regularly stopped the pound in its tracks. One reason for sterling's small setback this week was that the government set the date for the Christchurch by-election  - July 29  - and it could face a humiliating defeat there. However, recent official figures show that although the volume of UK exports rose in the first quarter of this year, there was an even sharper rise in the value of these exports, which suggests that Britain's business community is more concerned with margins than with volumes. Mr Ian Harnett, UK economist at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, said: 'Since the early 1980s sterling's value has halved from about DM5.00 to around DM2.50. But we still have a huge trade and current account deficit. 'There is nothing to be gained by worrying about the exchange rate,' he said. 'The only thing that has any impact on exports is the level of domestic growth  - and that is the only issue that the government should consider when setting base rates.' The question that cannot be answered is whether Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, agrees. But a strong view in City dealing rooms is that Mr Clarke will cut interest rates by the end of the year  - perhaps by 1 percentage point - because of the likelihood that the domestic economic recovery will falter. Then sterling could go where it may.</p>

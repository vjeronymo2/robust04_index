			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Observer: Brussels gossip Meanwhile a more immediate question for Britain is who will replace Geoffrey Fitchew as head of DG 15, which looks after financial institutions and company law and is the most important part of Vanni d'Archirafi's new empire. Brussels bureaucrats are supposed to be impartial, of course, but given the dangers adverse EC legislation could pose for the City of London's position as a world financial centre, the UK has always felt it important to have a Brit in the post. Hence the concern about the replacement for 53-year-old Fitchew. An old Treasury hand, he has been recalled to London to head the European secretariat of the Cabinet Office. It's said the front-runner is the deputy DG of the internal market directorate, John Mogg. He'd be a sensible choice, given that his department has been gobbled up by d'Archirafi.</p>

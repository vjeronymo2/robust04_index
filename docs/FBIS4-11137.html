			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Emanuel Neri] </F>   [Text] In addition to facing internal opposition to the  alliance with the Liberal Front Party [PFL] for Fernando  Henrique Cardoso's presidential candidacy, the Brazilian Social  Democracy Party [PSDB] is having problems forming coalitions to  back candidates at the state government level.    In many states local PSDB members support the agreement with  the PFL at the national level, but they reject regional  coalitions with the same party.    Ceara, the state run by the only PSDB governor, is the best  example of this conflict.    PSDB members in Ceara State do not want to hear about any  alliance with local PFL members, whom they regard as their  longtime adversaries.    In Ceara State, PSDB members would rather form an alliance  with the PT [Workers Party] and the PDT [Democratic Labor  Party]. The PT could nominate the running mate for Tasso  Jereissati, the PSDB candidate for governor of Ceara State.    Deputy Jackson Pereira (PSDB-Ceara State) said: "There is a  no-win situation here." If Cardoso comes to Fortaleza to attend  a rally, the local PSDB leaders will not allow their PFL  counterparts to share the same stage with them. "Either the  presidential candidate decides not to come here, or we will have  to hold separate rallies," Pereira added. In Pernambuco, the  PSDB has two federal deputies who may have to go separate ways.    Deputy Wilson Campos (PSDB-Pernambuco State) supports the  gubernatorial candidacy of Miguel Arraes, who is running for the  PSB [Brazilian Socialist Party]-PT coalition. The other PSDB  deputy for Pernambuco is Maurilio Ferreira Lima, who favors an  alliance with the PFL and the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic  Movement Party].    Campos has suggested that the PSDB give freedom of action to  its members to vote for the candidate of their choice in the  Pernambuco gubernatorial election. He said that, otherwise, he  would still vote for Arraes and admitted the possibility of  voting for [PT candidate Luis Inacio] Lula [da Silva] for  president.    In his efforts to widen his support base, Cardoso has  compounded these conflicts. In Mato Grosso do Sul State, the  local PSDB branch reached an agreement with the PMDB to support  PMDB gubernatorial candidate Wilson Martins. The incumbent  governor, Pedro Pedrossian (Brazilian Labor Party), has  torpedoed the agreement.    Pedrossian persuaded Cardoso that in order for the  presidential candidate to obtain his support the local PSDB must  endorse the gubernatorial candidate nominated by Pedrossian.  This provoked a division among PSDB members in the state.    There is a similar problem in Parana State. The local PSDB  branch already has agreed to form a coalition with Jaime Lerner,  the Democratic Labor Party candidate for Parana governor, but  Cardoso has promised Popular Party leader Alvaro Dias that the  PSDB would support him.    Deputy Deni Schwartz (PSDB-Parana State) said: "They are  going to destroy the party if they insist on that agreement."  He said Lerner has always been "loyal" to the PSDB and does not  deserve to be abandoned.    In Rio de Janeiro, Cardoso will face the predicament of  having to support one of these two candidates for governor:  Marcello Alencar (PSDB) and General Newton Cruz (Democratic  Social Party), who could obtain the PFL endorsement.</p>

			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Arts: A young quartet and London Brass - Music in London For the past 20 years or so, first-class string quartets have been springing up as never before. There is no simple answer to 'Why?' - but there are some obvious factors, all interconnected. Modern recordings have made the quartet repertoire available to all sorts of people who might never have discovered it earlier; many more quartet teams can now make professional careers than there used to be room for; for distinguished senior quartets, it has become a moral duty to coach new ensembles. This is a happy state of affairs. In the Wigmore Hall on Wednesday the young Vogler Quartet - which has been coached by the LaSalle Quartet and the great Sandor Vegh - gave the last of three well-planned concerts, each featuring very late works of two classical composers and one strong contemporary exhibit. As a team, the Vogler Quartet is a year younger than the excellent Carmina Quartet (also winner of the crucial Evian competition). Its praises have been sung on this page often, but Wednesday's concert convinced me that it ranks among the best, most individual and enthralling teams to be heard. The quartet played Haydn's and Schumann's last quartets, and Gyorgy Kurtag's First (written in 1959 when he was a thoroughly practised 33-year-old, but denoted 'op. 1' because it was his breakthrough into modern composing). In each work the players were hugely impressive - above all because of their sound: super-rich, communicatively forward and muscular, and yet laden with the players' separate characters, without which the glories of western chamber music would remain mere shadows of themselves. The collective 'sound' of a string quartet is no simple thing. It involves the subtle balancing of parts and a collectively focused attack, as well as sheer timbre. The splendid Vogler sound bespeaks a rare musical unanimity, one which leaves plenty of room for distinct personalities. Thus the players could deliver the great Andante of Haydn's op. 77 no. 2 with compelling purpose, but vitally lit up by individual thrusts: marvellous to hear. Again, in Schumann's Quartet in A, op. 41 no. 3, the Risoluto section of the variation-movement acquired a towering, rambunctious impetus we rarely hear. Yet elsewhere in Schumann, the Voglers could indulge expansive rubati to maximal affect, without dropping a stitch. Some of the curves they threw might have bordered upon winsomeness, had their intentions been less definite and palpable. In the six wildly inventive movements of Kurtag's quartet, the team outdid itself. Through wickedly syncopated passages and unmeasured dramatic suspensions, they were knife-edged and spot-on. As for the outre range of string colours that the young Kurtag demanded, the quartet brought it all to palpable life (at the cost of a snapped viola-string in midstream, and a long pause while it was replaced). Every bizarre effect made a sharp expressive point, inseparable from the literal notes, and they all struck directly home. While it lasted, the music seemed to have the distilled density of a late Kurtag score. It doesn't, but the Voglers triumphantly persuaded us that it did. ***** London Brass launched its 10-day Contemporary Music Network tour at the Queen Elizabeth Hall with a programme reflecting the ensemble's enterprise. The virtuoso 10-piece group - four trumpets, four trombones, horn and tuba - which grew out of the Philip Jones Brass Ensemble in 1986, does much to challenge perceptions of brass music. Thursday's programme featured five contemporary works by British composers, all London Brass commissions, with a set of Venetian canzonas in the middle. The music of Gabrieli and his contemporaries is, of course, central to the brass repertory, and here the pieces were dispatched with flair. The QEH is not an ideal venue for these works - they need a church, preferably St Mark's in Venice - but they came across. The programme's opening works, Dominic Muldowney's Un Carnaval Cubiste and Nigel Osborne's Canzona: Procession of boats with distant smoke, Venice, both art-inspired, picked up the Italian theme. Muldowney's seemed the more successful. It is based on a steady pulse provided by a centre-stage metronome, round which rhythmic counterpoints build into flashes of exuberance. Little tonal fanfares act like 'found objects' in a painting, hence the title. The Osborne relies heavily on hazy, shifting sonorities, but the sounds are more interesting than the ideas. Indeed, much of the evening's music revealed a poverty of invention, suggesting that composers were seduced by the sounds of the medium - brass instruments can be wonderfully liquid and irresistibly crunchy - and forgot about developing them. Michael Nyman's For John Cage, given its first London performance here, is a very un-Cageian pastiche of recycled big-band gestures. Bayo's Way by Jeremy Arden, for electronic tuba and ensemble, is like a miniature concerto. The form is clear, but the use of electronics unimaginative, limited mostly to highlighting the tuba's vulgarity in long stretches of violent burping. One had to admire Oren Marshall's virtuosity. Mark-Anthony Turnage's Set To rounded off the evening and provided a corrective. Each of the two movements is richly textured, and both the languid Blues and joyous Bacchanale engage mind and ear. On tour: Liverpool, March 21 (051 709 3789); Hexham, March 24 (0434 607272); Dartington, March 26 (0803 863073); Bracknell, March 27 (0344 484123).</p>

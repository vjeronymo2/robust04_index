			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - The World's Economies  -Europe (43): Recovery gains momentum - Scandinavia / Christopher Brown-Humes examines the four economies Some of Europe's best rates of growth will be found in the Nordic area this year as a steady recovery from the region's deepest recession since the 1930s gains momentum. For the first time since 1990, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway will all see their economies expand. In the case of Denmark and Norway, gross domestic product will probably rise by more than 4 per cent, putting them at the top of the European growth league. Despite this, the deterioration in the international bond market this year has had a particularly severe impact on the Nordic region and led to a renewed focus on some of the area's underlying problems. The markets are alarmed at the prospect of a new surge in inflation. They are worried about the state of government finances in Sweden and Finland. And they are fretting about the round of EU referendums due later in the autumn. The nervous mood has forced up bond yields, worsening government finances and slowing the pace of the recovery. But at least there is a recovery - which is a marked contrast with the past three years when the Nordics were battered by high interest rates, slumping demand, rising unemployment and financial sector crisis. Worst hit were Sweden and Finland which both recorded three consecutive years of negative economic growth. In Finland, where the general difficulties were exacerbated by the collapse of trade with the former Soviet Union, GDP shrank by 13 per cent between 1991 and 1993. In Sweden GDP fell 5 per cent over the same period. Common factors behind the revival have been a sharp drop in short-term interest rates and a strengthening world economy. Otherwise the pattern shows a marked difference between Finland and Sweden, which have relied on exports to assist their recovery after the sharp weakening of their currencies in the past two years, and Denmark and Norway where the momentum has been assisted by fiscal expansion. The difference is that budget deficits have constrained Finland and Sweden to keep a tight grip on spending while Norway and Denmark, with low budget deficits, have been able to promote a recovery in domestic demand through fiscal expansion. Nowhere has the recent pressure been felt more keenly than in Sweden and Finland, where politicians' attempts to talk up the economy have been sabotaged by the controversy surrounding large budget deficits and rising state debt. Bonds in both countries have taken a mauling. In Sweden, for example, 10-year bonds have traded at more than 400 basis points above their German equivalent (contrast Denmark where the gap has been nearer to 200 basis points). Many of Sweden's leading financial institutions have been hit by the turmoil, prompting Skandia, one of the country's two leading insurers, to announce a boycott of Swedish bonds in early July. Although bond markets worldwide have been turbulent since US interest rates began climbing earlier this year, sentiment towards Sweden has deteriorated for two reasons. One is the wretched state of the country's finances and doubts about the readiness of politicians to tackle the problem with sufficient vigour. Second, investors have been demanding a risk premium because of fears that inflation will be rekindled. Sweden has a poor record on inflation as well as a reputation for resorting to devaluation to sort out its problems. Although price rises have been remarkably subdued following the country's last devaluation in 1992, inflationary pressures have started to build because of capacity constraints. As a result, the central bank, the Riksbank, increased short-term interest rates in August. The depressed domestic economy and the rise in interest rates means forecasters are shaving their earlier growth predictions. At the gloomy end of the range is Nordbanken which now expects Sweden's GDP to grow by just 1 per cent this year, and 2 per cent in 1995. This is much the lowest rate in the region and has helped raise the spectre of a new economic trough characterised by low growth and high interest rates. The winners of the recent election, the Social Democrats, have promised big tax rises which will almost certainly restrain any increase in demand next year. Finland shares many of Sweden's problems, although the economy there is bouncing back more vigorously. The country's finance ministry forecasts GDP growth this year of 3.5 per cent rising to 4.5 per cent in 1995. Independent commentators have suggested growth could exceed 6 per cent. The Danish government is expecting growth of 4.4 per cent this year and 3 per cent in 1995. Private consumer spending is surging on the back of tax cuts and mortgage reductions. But the boom is sucking in imports and cutting the current account surplus. The Norwegian economy is benefiting from generally stronger oil prices and record-high oil production from the North Sea. But even the non-oil economy is doing well, with predictions suggesting that mainland GDP will rise by 3 per cent this year.</p>

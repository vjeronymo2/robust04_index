			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] The set of amendments that President Boris Yeltsin  made to the law on deputies' status has now been made available  to Interfax news agency.    In a paper of May 10, Yeltsin says that parts of the law he  endorsed on May 8 were in breach of the country's Constitution.    The president contests the deputy's right to unimpeded  access  to all government bodies--both federal and local--, and to visit  plants, offices and agencies, army units and public groups--on  the grounds that this has no relation to the parliament's law  making activity. Nor is he for the deputy being entitled to  free access to any government official and the latter being  bound to give a prompt reply to his questioning.    Yeltsin thinks that the law as it is now will vest the  parliament with legislative, executive and controlling functions.    He is also opposed to a broader interpretation of the  deputy's right to a prompt reply to his questions on the grounds  that this will not be an expression of the legislature's  controlling function.    Yeltsin thinks it necessary to bring the provision on  further  guarantees of parliamentary immunity in line with the  appropriate clause of the Constitution.    He also wants to amend parts of the law concerning the  conflict between parliamentary and civil service duties.  Yeltsin insists that the period that members of the armed  forces, police or prosecuting officers spend carrying out  parliamentary duties must be put on their usual work record and  they must be allowed to resume their former jobs when their term  in office expires.    Yeltsin says the law on the deputies' status was adopted in  breach of the constitutional procedures. Any bill providing for  federal spending is subject to government approval, something  that the authors of the law have failed to obtain, he said.    Yeltsin pointed to the abundance of mistakes of a legal  nature, terminology and style in the law saying he authorized  his envoy Aleksandr Yakovlev to brief the State Duma about them  in the order of the day.</p>

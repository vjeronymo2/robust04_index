			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / German car groups 'must shed labour' JOB cuts at German car makersare inevitable because of high labour and manufacturing costs and the need to slim down in line with the rest of the European industry, the industry association (VDA) warned yesterday. It also said the possibility of a steel industry shutdown - a strike ballot to be completed tomorrow is expected to show a big majority for a stoppage - would hit car manufacturers in two days. Steel stocks are low because the industry has operated at full stretch to meet domestic demand. Mrs Erika Emmerich, the VDA's president, said Germany's advanced technological standards were no longer enough in a climate of fierce competition. 'Whichever way you look at it, we produce too expensively, she said.' Jobs in the motor industry had fallen by 10,000 in the last few months of 1991; this followed a rise of the same amount to 787,000 (including components makers) in the first seven months, mostly spurred by post-unification demand. Mrs Emmerich's comments are in line with recent complaints in much of German industry that high labour costs, tough environmental laws, and lengthy approval processes for new plants are eroding competitiveness. This year will pose challenges for the German motor industry as the recent surge in domestic demand is likely to be followed by an expected 12-15 per cent decline while foreign markets remain depressed. Mr Achim Diekmann, the VDA's general manager, said production levels could only be maintained if manufacturers raised their share of foreign markets. Last year, west German car output was unchanged at 4.7m units, with truck production 12.5 per cent higher at 356,000. Car exports fell by 16 per cent to 2.2m. He declined to estimate what effect this might have on unemployment but said: 'We can't overlook the fact that the German industry has some catching up to do in the reduction of personnel.' The German union DAG said it wanted a 10 per cent pay rise for 3.3m west German shop workers, Reuter reports from Hamburg. Orders for west German plant and machinery rose last month for the first time in a year, the VDMA manufacturers' association said yesterday. Export demand was 3 per cent higher and German orders were 4 per cent up in real terms on December 1990, writes Christopher Parkes in Bonn. The aggregate 4 per cent rise was the one bright spot in a year in which the value of orders fell 8 per cent.</p>

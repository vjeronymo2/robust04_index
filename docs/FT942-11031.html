			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Resources must not be wasted Sir, The results of the Institute of Management's survey showing a reduction in the number of women in management are not entirely surprising ('Women turn away from careers in management', May 3). The message from female managers is clear: unless companies shape up and change typical, male-dominated working practices and environments, women will vote with their feet and opt for more flexible, family-friendly working environments. Two hundred and forty organisations, representing more than a quarter of the British workforce, are currently members of Opportunity 2000, the business-led campaign to help companies maximise women's skills and avoid wasting resource and ability. While they realise there is still a great deal to be done, these organisations are recognising the true business value of their female employees. They are implementing a number of measures to increase the quality and quantity of their participation in the workforce, including job-sharing schemes, part-time work and providing assistance with childcare, either through voucher schemes or on-site facilities. Unless more companies follow this example, British business will continue to lose money, time, efficiency and the skills and resources of half its workforce. Elspeth Howe, chairman, Opportunity 2000 Target Team, Business in the Community, 8 Stratton Street, London W1</p>

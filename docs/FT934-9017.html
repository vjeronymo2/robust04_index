			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Paying for performance Sir, I look forward to your further articles on Performance Related Pay and would offer the following reasons for the beneficial spread of the concept even if, to date, many schemes have not achieved all their objectives. 1) We have returned some power from shop stewards to first line foremen and clerical unit managers. To strengthen their position companies have passed more discretionary award recommendations to this crucial group. 2) As part of this exercise annual performance appraisals are much more widespread than in 1980 and appraisals without some potential personal benefit are like dough without yeast, soggy and often undertaken by both sides as a perfunctory exercise. 3) The empowerment of remuneration committees has resulted in a spread of PRP culture. I am willing to bet that 99 per cent of boards with such a committee use some form of PRP as simply salary vetting reviews, and changes to pension rules are not a sufficiently 'high fibre diet' for active non-executive directors. 4) Avoiding the current and future pension costs of higher fixed salaries is a major issue as companies fight to control their cost base. PRP, which is often not pensionable and moves with cash flow, gives employees an indirect stake in decision taking. Its increased use could save some jobs and companies from being sacrificed through over-pricing. You have only to look at the inroads PRP-based contractors have made in contracting out services from rigid salary organisations like councils and the uniformed services to see that those organisations could have maintained their own staffing if they had been more willing to establish a flexible structure.

			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Weill starts another journey at Travelers: The Dollars 722m move into insurance by Primerica and its chairman When he was asked how negotiations for last week's Dollars 722.5m (Pounds 423m) deal between US insurance group Travelers and financial services conglomerate Primerica had gone, Travelers chairman Mr Edward Budd said, only half joking: 'Very efficiently.' The remark drew a hearty laugh from Primerica's chairman, Mr Sanford Weill, who was pacing around his midtown Manhattan office last Friday morning, eager for the day's work to begin. Only a few days earlier, the renowned financier had clinched the deal that left Primerica holding a 27 per cent stake in the struggling insurer, which in return got a huge injection of capital and, just as crucially, access to Mr Weill's expertise in rescuing troubled companies. A native of New York who still talks with a trace of a Brooklyn accent, Mr Weill made his name in the 1960s and 1970s when he built up a small broking operation into Shearson Loeb Rhoades. He sold the firm in 1981 to American Express for Dollars 930m, at the time the most ever paid for a securities firm. After a brief spell with American Express, Mr Weill made an ambitious, but ultimately unsuccessful offer to take a stake in 1986 in BankAmerica. Soon after, he bought Commercial Credit, which he quickly merged with Primerica to create a complex, unfocused financial services giant. Mr Weill spent the next six years turning each of the group's businesses around. He also found the time to attempt a merger between Smith Barney and Shearson, and, reportedly, a takeover of Wall Street investment bank Kidder Peabody. Although his attempts to build a big-league broking house failed, Mr Weill kept his eye on the ball where it mattered - at Primerica. 'Our company over the last five years has seen its earnings grow at a compound rate of 25 to 30 per cent,' he says. 'Our dividends have been raised every year, our book value has grown substantially every year, and our return on equity has increased to something like 17 per cent, which we think is relatively good in the businesses we're in. So we like what we're doing . . . we've been running our business right, and funding our business right.' Today, Mr Weill has a target for Primerica - he would like each of the three operations to be producing twice as much profit in five years as it does now. That could be difficult without acquisitions, and few doubt Mr Weill is on the look-out. He admits as much: 'Of the core businesses of Primerica, the areas where one could grow externally as well as internally would be: buying a book of business in the consumer finance business, or buying another company in that business; adding another company in the brokerage business; or buying a mutual fund company. Yet all of those are very very hard to do right now . . . because the businesses are good, the cycles are good and people are doing well.' Mr Weill's reported attempt to buy Kidder was a case in point. He is said to have pulled out of the talks because the price was too high. Although Mr Weill does not mention any names, industry observers suggest a natural fit for Smith Barney would be Prudential Securities, the broking arm of the insurance giant, or possibly one of several smaller, regional brokerages. While acquisitions must obviously excite the dealmaker in Mr Weill, for now his energy is likely to remain focused on the task at hand - the restructuring of Primerica Financial Services, and sorting out Travelers. It took little more than two months for Mr Weill to agree to come to Travelers' aid. So 'efficient' were the negotiations that they weathered the disruption of Hurricane Andrew, which this year will take a big bite out of US insurers' coffers, including up to Dollars 225m from Travelers. Mr Weill was not blown off course. He saw in Travelers the opportunity to buy cheaply into a company that he calls 'one of the great, well-known financial brands in the US'. The holding cost Primerica Dollars 19 a share, compared with Travelers' book value of Dollars 40 a share, and by the end of last week Mr Weill was already sitting on a handy paper profit, with Travelers shares trading at Dollars 23. Hurricane Andrew may even have made the Travelers stake more attractive. Mr Weill believes the spate of recent natural disasters could herald the end of the 'soft' property and casualty insurance underwriting cycle and push rates up across the industry. Travelers certainly needed the help, and there is little sign of complacency about the task facing Mr Weill and Mr Budd. Although it has already raised almost Dollars 700m during the year through debt and equity sales, the insurer is struggling under the burden of billions of dollars in bad commercial property loans made during the 1980s. By the end of the second quarter Dollars 5.2bn in loans, or almost half of Travelers property book and more than 10 per cent of the group entire investment portfolio, was underperforming. Travelers now has Dollars 1.4bn to help it through the property slump and pay for a big restructuring. The Primerica deal has already done some good. The Moody's ratings agency has said it will review Travelers' Baa1 rating for a possible upgrade. Mr Weill does not see the stake in Travelers as merely a sound investment. Primerica has three core businesses - Commercial Credit, a consumer finance company; Primerica Financial Services, which sells insurance and mutual funds to middle-class families; and Smith Barney Harris Upham, a Wall Street broking house - and benefits may stem from combining elements of them with the Travelers name and its customer and product base. Mr Budd says: 'The synergies in asset-gathering are very real. We're going fifty-fifty with Gulf Insurance, the specialty property-casualty unit of Primerica that fills a niche we don't provide for our agents. (Under last week's deal, Travelers got 50 per cent of Gulf.) We will also work together on asset-management and investing . . . there is a lot of opportunity to cross-pollinate there.' If such potential is realised, the Travelers deal will help maintain Primerica's strong growth and enhance Mr Weill's formidable reputation.</p>

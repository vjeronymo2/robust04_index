			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Tales of disaster and salvation FOR those who like life to be simple, there are too many possible explanations for the unexpected surge in the dollar at the end of last week. Only the least likely of them could be construed as offering any kind of consolation for the British government for the fact that the dollar's rise left sterling more than ever stranded - the idea that the markets were giving Mr Major's friend President Bush a vote of confidence after his latest tax-cutting speech. The more plausible explanations are sadder. In the US, the most significant change was marked not by Mr Bush's speech, but by remarks from Governors Angell and Parry of the Federal Reserve. Both indicated that the lastest US interest rate cut should be the last for some time, which suggests that the Fed is now becoming more worried about the dollar than about the continued weakness of the economy. This postpones any remaining hope of European salvation from rising American demand. This news might have weakened the dollar still further, on what is now the normal market rule - that it is strong economies which have strong currencies. However, the sad fact is that while optimism about the US simply remains anaemic, hope is rapidly disappearing everywhere else. It was surely the news of crisis in Scandinavia and Italy, riots in Germany, slump in Britain and falling industrial confidence in Japan which drove the dollar up. The US may look waterlogged, but if you know a better hole. . . The stalest of all bull markets is that in European integration. Though it is easy to forget, it is not very long since the US business press was full of learned discussions of the European disease. Then the US economy went sour, the Japanese market looked overdone, and 1992 loomed. For a couple of years, Europe was seen as a nascent superpower; but now we have crisis, and what was seen as a source of strength looks like a fatal weakness. Indeed, for a rapidly growing minority of market analysts, European disintegration looks not so much a disaster as a prospective relief. The markets should have foreseen the pains of convergence. All systems become brittle if they are too rigid; and in any case, we have been this way before. The Bretton Woods system, now remembered as a paradise of low inflation and steady growth, was denounced in its time as a deflationary plot. When the IMF finally achieved convergence, the world went into a simultaneous boom and blew the lid off the system. Regional convergence should not be so accident-prone, because floating exchange rates outside the system allow for some automatic adjustment; they are now supporting US growth as Europe slows down. All the same, convergence is painful to achieve, and requires careful management even when it is achieved. Watching the mess we are making of the first stage (partly because the Germans no longer seem to want it much) it is hard to hold much hope for stage two; and the markets have clearly lost all faith in the whole business. All this looks like a catastrophe for Britain, and especially for Mr John Major; but I am not so sure. Pessimists might try to find a copy of Richard Hughes's prophetic inter-war novel In Hazard. This concerns a ship (very obviously the ship of state) in a storm. Every effort by the skipper to meet the crisis makes things worse; but every apparent disaster proves a salvation. At the climax, the bridge and funnel are carried away in a huge wave; so the ship does not capsize. Mr Major behaves ominously like Mr Hughes's skipper; and he will certainly look silly if the ERM superstructure is battered to bits. Yet Britain might have a very promising long-term future in a more flexibly constructed Europe. The present slump would still damage the economy and the currency, but it would kill inflation for a long time. Thereafter Britain's long-term competitive advantage could promise a prolonged growth boom. It is just a matter of not drowning first.</p>

			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Whitehall fails to keep its numbers in check THE PROGRESS Mrs Margaret (now Baroness) Thatcher made in cutting the number of civil servants is being reversed under Mr John Major. The total is rising again, despite the search for public expenditure cuts. There were more than 565,000 civil servants in April 1992, according to recently released Treasury statistics, a net increase of almost 11,500 on the previous year. While the number of white-collar civil servants rose by more than 14,000 the overall increase in the Civil Service was slightly less because of continuing cuts among blue-collar civil servants, whose numbers have been halved since 1984. The overall white-collar figure has returned to the 1984 level of 500,000. Mrs Ann Robinson, head of the policy unit at the Institute of Directors, said the figures reflected the government's failure to get to grips with the size of the public services payroll. 'If the chancellor is going to reduce public spending to curb the budget deficit, he has no alternative but to look at the number of people employed in the public services,' she said. While some departments such as Trade and Industry have cut white-collar payrolls, others such as the Home Office and Social Security Department have grown. A variety of reasons is given for the growth: The Lord Chancellor's Department, with a 17 per cent increase in its white-collar payroll since the start of 1980, blames a heavier civil and criminal justice workload. The Home Office, which has increased white-collar staff from under 30,000 to more than 46,000 in the same period, cites prison service expansion and increasing immigration work. The rapid increase in unemployment in the past two years has fuelled a 27 per cent jump in the number of civil servants in the Employment Service. The executive agencies which are supposed to impose business disciplines on government services are responsible for much of the increase in the number of civil servants. Of the 28 oldest agencies, 21 have increased staff totals since inception. Pumping up numbers, Page 6</p>

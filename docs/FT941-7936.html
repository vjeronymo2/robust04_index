			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Buskers' timid tune Mr John Prescott is one of Labour's few assets. Unfettered by the conventions of the English language, the party's spokesman on employment (and would-be deputy leader) manages to convey more with his unique syntax than does, say, Mr Gordon Brown, whose anxious blending of cliche with buzz-word, sound-bite with jargon, dark warning with sweeping intimation, can make it tedious to unearth his meaning. This observation applies only to recent ponderous examples of the shadow chancellor's written prose. He can be very funny in the House of Commons. Face-to-face, he is crystal clear. On TV, however, he is less than a barrel of laughs. Mr Prescott scores higher on most counts, although some of his spoken sentences are difficult to parse. Even Mr Robin Cook, with his wizard's beard, rapid-fire brain and rapid-fire mouth, is not quite so engaging as the garrulous shadow employment secretary. Why, it may be asked, do we need to bother with any of these three gentlemen? Is Labour not intellectually dormant? One answer is that in 1996, which is only two tax increases away, they may be senior members of a Labour cabinet. Another is that their names appear on Financing Infrastructure Investment, a consultative paper published yesterday. A warning is necessary here. The apparently tripartite authorship is a consequence of brotherly turf-sharing in the shadow cabinet. The names Brown, Cook, Prescott appear in order of seniority. The closely-argued paper, which is mainly about the technicalities of public-private finance, was three-quarters prepared in Mr Prescott's office. He has been propounding the central thrust of it for some five years. The quality of the finished product invites us to suspend our disbelief in the possibility that anything worth arguing about can be produced by Britain's principal political parties. Do not be misled by the use of that word 'quality'. Everything is relative. In the empty auditorium of British political debate we must be grateful for whatever busking turns up to offer us enlightenment. These three are busking more interestingly this week than for some time past. That's all. Although there is much talk about promoting a partnership between business and the state, the Prescott et al thesis does not constitute a new economic theory, a substitute for socialism, a repackaged form of capitalism, or even a storyline that might give waverers a positive incentive to vote Labour. It simply ignores old-style nationalisation and looks instead at the practicalities of bringing private capital into public initiatives. It does so with a sharper eye than the Treasury will currently permit. At its best, it outflanks the Tories on the right, which is what an opposition party should do. The cynical might dismiss the exercise as another episode in Labour's perpetual search for off-balance sheet financing, a piece of hocus-pocus to dodge the tax consequences of the party's high-spending intent, an opportunistic bid for votes for a less tatty Britain. It is not quite so obvious as that. For example, it proposes the sale of regulatory restrictions. This implies that, say, Oftel's grip on BT might be eased in exchange for an undertaking to develop a fibre-optic network. Of course there is some chicanery in this. There is no intimation that the price might be paid in higher call charges. We are, remember, talking about a political document. More down-to-earth sections seek to remove what the paper calls 'obstacles to partnerships between public and private sectors'. Take the Treasury rule that where the taxpayer assumes all the risk, the private partner cannot expect all the rewards. Labour, you will be relieved to hear, agrees. The rule has, however, prevented the conception, let alone the birth, of many a public-private joint venture. The answer is to redefine risk. The state might insure investors against events over which it has control, such as changes in the law, the sudden imposition of safety codes or ministerial bumbling. The private partner could absorb the risk associated with design, efficiency, cost and late completion. Such a compromise might have facilitated an earlier start to the channel tunnel rail link, more cheaply than will now be the case. Another disincentive to bringing in private money is the low rate of return likely under existing rules. A leading article in Monday's Financial Times pointed out that the Treasury insistence that Railtrack should budget for a 5.6 per cent return on its assets, rising to 8 per cent in four years, constitutes an excessively tight target. The consequent charges for using the rail network reduces the attractiveness of investment in rail operations. The Prescott-plus paper says that 8 per cent was set for all projects by Mr John Major in 1989, when he was chief secretary to the Treasury. It is now higher than the average real rate of return on private non-oil assets. Nervously Labour's paper suggests 're-opening this issue'. The authors are just as timid, and with more reason, when they propose a redefinition of the public sector borrowing requirement. The convention in continental Europe, says the paper, is to treat publicly-owned activities that earn a market return differently from those that do not. This suggestion for writing-down the PSBR is no more infamous than the dozens of writings-down of the level of unemployment by the Conservatives. It is supported by the convergence criteria set in the Maastricht treaty. 'We are consulting on this,' say our bold, radical authors. The principal source of these tentative suggestions is, remember, associated with the left of the party. Mr Prescott's antecedents come through, sotto voce, in the paper's affirmation that projects should be initiated and led by the government, which should set priorities. Regional investment banks are still in the mix. There is no acknowledgement of the Concorde factor, namely that colossal waste can result from decisions by officials. On the contrary the private sector is regarded as equally prone to error. There is material enough for the Conservatives to tear to shreds. The problem is that their own 'private finance initiative' is initiating very little. Perhaps that is why Sir Alastair Morton, brought in to revitalise it, will address Labour's symposium on Thursday. The co-chairman of Eurotunnel can tell them about financing the link.</p>

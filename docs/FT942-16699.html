			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / International Company News: Tata may buy control of Dollars 240m Florida plant Tata, India's largest industrial grouping, is considering buying control of a Dollars 240m fertiliser chemical plant in Florida in what would be the biggest overseas acquisition by an Indian company. Tata Chemicals, a Tata company producing soda ash, caustic soda and other chemicals, is examining plans to pay Dollars 122.4m for a 51 per cent stake in the plant owned by Occidental Chemical Corporation, an arm of Occidental, the energy group. Occidental would retain the remaining 49 per cent. The Florida plant produces phosphoric acid, the main ingredient for phosphatic fertilisers, which it makes from phosphate rock. India, which is short of phosphates, imports phosphoric acid. Its needs are expected to grow rapidly, so Tata believes it makes sense to invest overseas to secure a captive supply of phosphoric acid. The planned acquisition was strongly promoted by Mr Darbari Seth, the 74-year-old former chairman of Tata Chemical, who left suddenly last month, saying he was retiring. The scheme will require government approval because capital account transactions are tightly controlled by foreign exchange laws.</p>

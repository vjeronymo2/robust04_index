			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Flood dilemma for Bangladesh: Action to avert disasters may do more harm than good ONE THIRD of Bangladesh will slip under water in the next three months as monsoon rains swell the rivers of the Ganges delta. If rainfall is exceptional, many will lose their lives or their livelihood. Communications will be cut, schools closed and infrastructure destroyed before the rivers recede. There are few years when Bangladesh is not affected by floods. But the extent to which rivers and floods should be controlled is disputed. Mr William Smith of the World Bank, which is co-ordinating the efforts of donor countries to improve flood protection in Bangladesh, said solutions had to be tailored to regions and types of floods. 'It is not a choice between non-structural or structural solutions: or between the embankment approach or the no-embankment approach. It just isn't that simple,' he told a recent meeting in Dhaka between donor countries and the Bangladesh government. Environmentalists are worried that structures such as embankments will alter the ecology of the delta, disrupt fisheries, drain wetlands and possibly cause more harm than good. The counter argument is that disastrous floods are an environmental hazard for 110m people: and the persistent risk of floods is hampering the country's development. After the 1988 floods, which killed 2,000 and flooded almost 100,000 square kilometres of farmland, donor countries clubbed together under the World Bank to institute a Flood Action Plan to determine what scale of protection was possible. The dilemma is how to curtail the adverse effects of flood without undue disruption to the floodplain ecology upon which many people depend. This central problem emerges from detailed studies, costing Dollars 150m, which have just started. The Dhaka meeting was the first opportunity for open dialogue between the government, the international teams working on studies, and the critics. The country consists of the delta of three major river systems, the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna. Bangladesh has no control over the vast majority of the river water which pours into its territory because only 8 per cent of the catchment area falls within its borders. In some parts of the country, embankments are needed to protect the dry-season rice crop from early floods: in other areas, for example the Sylhet Depression in the north-east, deep floods occur every year and the situation cannot be changed. In the centre of the country one of the greatest flood risks comes from the Brahmaputra river which is up to 15km wide and has a peak flow of 100,000 cubic metres per second, exceeded only by the Amazon. Breaches in its banks are already causing water to flow from the Brahmaputra into a smaller river, the Bangali, which is two kilometres away. Engineers say one exceptional flood could cause the Brahmaputra to change course completely and pour into the Bangali. If this were to happen, 5m people would be cut off. The river's course is being studied as an urgent priority by German and French, British and Chinese teams. Complex issues of population growth and the economies of the national drive for grain production underlie the technical problems of dealing with the flood plains. Food grain policy requires land to be protected from floods to make it suitable for use of high yielding varieties of rice which have to be fed with nitrogen fertiliser and protected with pesticides. According to Dr Haroun er Rashid, who chaired the environment session of the meeting this month, much of the damage to the environment comes from this pursuit of rice self-sufficiency. He questioned whether if was the right policy for Bangladesh in the long-term. Last year, for the first time in 20 years, rice production (20m tonnes) met the needs of the population. However, with population predicted to rise from around 107m to 130m by the end of the decade it will be difficult to maintain this. Flood control increases land for high yield rice: but it reduces opportunities for catching fish in lakes and flooded depressions. If the grain self-sufficiency policy continues, it could weigh the rice/fish balance in favour of rice. Methods of economic analysis used at present do not show the importance of fish caught and consumed by poor families and not sold on the open market. A fisheries study, funded by Britain's Overseas Development Administration, is just starting under the FAP and should eventually provide the data needed to balance the rice/fish equation more accurately. All donor-country representatives at the meeting emphasised that the new democratic government in Bangladesh should try to establish wider public participation in decision making. They also stressed that every stage of the plan must be assessed for its environmental impact. Dr Shamsul Huda, at the ministry of water and flood control, said social and environmental effects of flood control schemes had been largely ignored in the past and that lack of consultation at the planning stage had caused many problems. 'We should not evaluate projects carried out 20 years ago by the standards of today,' he said. 'The challenge now it to keep detrimental side-effects of flood control projects to the minimum.'</p>

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As State and local governments plan for solid waste management, the EPA has encouraged them to employ the Integrated Solid Waste Management (ISWM) approach. Through ISWM, communities achieve flexibility by looking beyond a single solution. In tailoring systems to meet their unique needs, communities consider all four elements of ISWM: Reduction, recycling, combustion, and landfilling, as described in EPA's document entitled ``An Agenda for Action''. In this integrated approach, systems are designed so that some or all of the four waste management options are used as a complement to one another to safely and efficiently manage municipal solid waste. The system is ``custom designed'' to meet local environmental, economic, and institutional needs. A key element of integrated waste management is the hierarchy, which favors source reduction (including reuse) to decrease the volume and toxicity and increase the useful life of products in order to reduce the volume and toxicity of waste. Recycling (including composting) is the preferred waste management option to further reduce potential risks to human health and the environment, divert waste from landfills and combustors, conserve energy, and slow the depletion of nonrenewable natural resources. In implementing source reduction and recycling, shifting risks from one medium to another (e.g., groundwater to air) or from one population to another must be avoided. Landfills and combustors will be necessary for the foreseeable future to handle a significant portion of wastes, but are lower on the hierarchy because of the potential risks to human health and the environment and long-term management costs. This risk potential can be largely minimized through proper design and management. Integrated waste management can and should be implemented at a local level to the extent practical, and is a useful conceptual tool for making management decisions; however, it must be considered in the context of each community's unique waste and demographic characteristics. Diversion of solid waste by reducing the quantity generated and by recycling materials from the waste stream can effectively reduce the burden on MWC's and landfills.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Waste diversion has become increasingly popular at the local level, as well as nationally and internationally, as the tool to reduce waste going to MWC's or landfills. In 1989, the EPA challenged the nation to reduce and recycle 25 percent of MSW by 1992. The EPA called on all sectors of our society to voluntarily assume responsibility for helping to attain this goal. Today, many states have source reduction programs, including, for example, yard waste composting, fee-for-service programs, and industrial/commercial waste minimization programs. In fact, all but eight States have established waste diversion goals. These goals vary, but generally call for diversion of 20 to 60 percent of the solid waste stream and are to be attained over the next 5 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With EPA encouragement, communities are increasingly using the ``variable rate fee'' approach to charge for waste management services. This approach fosters waste reduction and recycling because the waste generators are charged only for the amount of waste they produce that must be combusted or landfilled. Waste generators can reduce the amount they pay for services by reducing the amount of waste they produce or by recycling more materials, thereby diverting materials from MWC's and landfills.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Across the nation, residents, businesses, and communities are using a variety of approaches to collect, separate, and otherwise prepare recovery materials for recycling. These materials may be sorted into different categories at the point of generation (e.g., residences or businesses) for separate collection, or they may be collected together and taken to a regional or community facility for sorting and processing for recycling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The collection of recovered materials has grown dramatically and continues to increase. According to EPA studies, the national recycling rate was only 9 percent in 1980 and grew to 17 percent by 1992. The EPA estimates the current national recycling rate at about 22 percent. Certain States and communities report even higher rates. Across the nation, materials that formerly were relegated to combustion or landfilling are being recovered for recycling. Waste reduction and recycling are increasingly becoming key factors in the sizing, design, and siting of MWC's and landfills.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

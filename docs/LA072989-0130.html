			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ADVICE FOR PARENTS OF CHILDREN FLYING SOLO  </P> <P> Here are tips from various airlines for children who will be flying alone.  Parents should consult with individual airlines for specific rules or  recommendations:  </P> <P> First and foremost, tell the child not to leave the plane under any  circumstances unless escorted by a flight attendant.  </P> <P> Try to schedule flying time in the middle of the day to avoid the disruption of  getting up at dawn to make an early flight or flying at night.  </P> <P> Arrive at the airport at least an hour before scheduled departure time. Most  airlines require forms to be filled out, and the extra time allows for relaxed  goodbys, which put children at ease.  </P> <P> Explain that flight attendants are there to make the trip easier, and your  child should not hesitate to ask them for help.  </P> <P> Brief the child about meal service. If a special meal (hamburger, peanut butter  and jelly, or spaghetti circles) better suits a child, many airlines will allow  you to order one 24 hours ahead of the flight.  </P> <P> Send along a favorite toy (a quiet one), game or book; a few of each for longer  flights.  </P> <P> Gift wrap a toy to open en route -- a bit of intrigue to occupy short attention  spans.  </P> <P> Provide the child with enough money to make phone calls should the need arise.  </P> <P> In addition to filling out the airline's paper work, include on the child's  person a home telephone number, the city of his destination and the phone  number of the person who is supposed to meet him.  </P> <P> Send along gum or hard candy for the child to chew during the plane's descent.  Some children experience uncomfortable eardrum pressure and chewing relieves  it.  </P> <P> If a child is arriving on a flight unaccompanied, make sure to be at the gate  on time. "It breaks their little hearts if no one is there to meet them," said  Patti Humberger, flight attendant for American Airlines. ROBERT OSTMANN JR.  </P></p>

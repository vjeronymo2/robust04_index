			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Arts: Obituary - John Piper The death on Sunday of John Piper, at the age of 89, removes from the British art world its last familiar figure of the pre-war avant-garde. But Piper was the least radical of his peers, and it is the great irony of his long and distinguished career that he should have become the one modern artist with whom the educated, literary middle classes were at all comfortable. After early experimentation with abstraction, he found his true metier as a romantic painter and illustrator of architecture and the architectural landscape, and his long mutually complementary collaboration with John Betjeman will long stand as a major popular achievement in mid-century arts and letters. At his best, which was at his most natural and uninhibited, he was capable of producing images of a true romantic sweep and grandeur, in the great English landscape tradition. During the war, he was commissioned to make a number of water-colour studies of Windsor Castle, wonderfully dramatic beneath lowering stormy skies. 'You don't seem to have had very good weather', said the King.</p>

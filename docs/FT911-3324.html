			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / International Company News: AGF sees increase of 5% ASSURANCES Generales de France (AGF), the country's second largest state-owned insurer, shrugged off losses on its international activities last year to produce a 5 per cent overall net profits increase, writes William Dawkins. AGF's net earnings rose in line with forecasts to FFr2.7bn (Dollars 461m) from FFr2.57bn in 1989, on turnover up by 20 per cent over the same period, to FFr46.03bn from FFr38.22bn, the group said yesterday. Half of the turnover growth came from acquisitions. Group investment income rose to FFr9.18bn from FFr7.67bn, while profits on asset sales climbed to FFr3.37bn from FFr2.45bn. Life insurance produced an 8.8 per cent rise in sales to FFr15.9bn, with growth mainly coming from savings and retirement contracts. Profits on AGF's life activities rose by 4.6 per cent to FFr1.5bn net. AGF's international division saw its turnover rise by 54 per cent to FFr11.2bn from FFr7.2bn, within which 38 per cent came from new acquisitions including NEM in Britain, ICI in Ireland and l'Escaut, a Belgian insurer. AGF's reinsurance business produced a 17 per cent rise in turnover to FFr2.3bn.</p>

The federal cabinet decided to end the 19-year-old ban and  has instructed public and private institutions that obstacles no  longer existed for dealing with South Africa, they sa?d.    Diplomats said the cabinet decision to end the boyco?t would  pave the way for establishment of diplomatic ties between the  UAE and South Africa.    The Dubai-based daily AL-BAYAN said the cabinet decision  cancelled a 1975 federal law banning any form of dealing with  South Africa because of its former system of apartheid.    The decision coincides with Pretoria's attempts to enter the  Gulf market, which is dominated by Japan, western countries and  other industrial powers.    South Africa's drive has already produced results. Its trade  with the UAE surged to around 150 million dirhams (40.8 million  dollars) in 1993 from less than 20 million dirhams (5.4 million  dollars) in 1992.    Officials from both sides expect trade to grow steadily in  coming years given their large business potential.    "South Africa enjoys great economic and trade potentials,"  the director of the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry,  'Abd-al- Rahman al-Mutaywi, said after returning Saturday from a  business trip to Johannesburg.    He said South Africa planned another major trade exhibition  in Dubai in May following the success of its first Middle East  fair in 1992.    Officials said South Africa was still planning to open a  commercial office in the United Arab Emirate of Dubayy to boost  exports to Iran and the GCC states of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain,  Oman, Qatar, Kuwait and the UAE.    South Africa is also aiming at the region's growing arms  market and has participated in two international defence shows  in the UAE.</p>

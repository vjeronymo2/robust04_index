			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Swedish party plays EC card SWEDEN'S opposition Social Democrats want the right-centre government to agree a broad-based bargaining position with them before it starts its negotiating next year with Brussels on the country's future membership of the European Community, reports Robert Taylor from Stockholm. The opposition's move comes in the face of substantial public hostility towards the EC. Mr Carl Bildt, the country's Conservative prime minister, hopes to complete the negotiations in early 1994 in time for a binding national referendum. The Social Democratic leadership continues to back Sweden's EC application but questions whether Mr Bildt will defend the country's national interest in negotiations with Brussels. Many feel he has been too ready to argue that Sweden has no alternative but to joinand that this could weaken his negotiating stance. Leading Social Democrats fear unless a bipartisan stance is worked out there will be a 'no' vote in the referendum. The initial euphoria at the Swedish application on July 1 last year by the then Social Democratic government has evaporated. A poll at the weekend showed 41 per cent of Swedes saying they would vote against the EC if the referendum was held now. Only 32 per cent were in favour, with 27 per cent undecided. A mere 18 per cent of Social Democratic supporters favour membership.</p>

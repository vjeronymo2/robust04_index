			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Fishing: Other fish to fry I HAVE often found myself envying other fishermen for their skills, none more so than a Frenchman I met on the Suir in Ireland. He was a dentist from Paris, small, neat and astonishingly accomplished. He extracted the devilishly educated trout from that devilishly difficult river with an ease which put my ham-fisted efforts to shame. I have been similarly humbled watching Italians, Belgians, and Spaniards, not to mention Poles, Slovaks and Romanians. This is fly fishing, which is, and has long been, an international sport. But the majority of the army of anglers across Europe seek their pleasure in species other than trout and salmon. Their joy is in pike, carp, perch and the like. And here there is a gulf between the British and their continental counterparts which it will take more than treaties, summits and avalanches of regulations to bridge. Quite simply, it is a matter of why we fish, and the division can be illustrated linguistically. In French, there is a word friture, for fry-up of little fish. In Italian it is frittura, There used to be a word in English, tansy, but it has fallen into disuse because we no longer fry little fish. The typical French fisherman is not my Parisian acquaintance. He is a figure in a beret, hunched by the Seine, a caporal stuck to his lower lip. With an immensely long pole, he flicks out an infinitesimal bait, whisks out a minute fish, and drops it into a bucket, where he cares not if it lives or dies. At the end of the day, he scoops up the harvest and sets off home, already hearing the sizzle of olive oil. This is not the British way. Here, we gaily kill and eat our trout and salmon. But, in general, the lesser fishes - be they fat, toothsome carp, or lean, firm-fleshed pike - go back alive. I doubt if one in 1,000 British coarse anglers has eaten a capture. The old books are full of quaint recipes for freshwater fish. But we have lost the habit. Within the UK coarse fishing fraternity, a puritanical aversion to killing fish has developed. A man found knocking a carp or tench on the head risks violence and expulsion from his club. With this invincible prejudice comes the assumption of moral superiority. The average British fisherman knows little of how they do things abroad. But he knows that the continental angler beats everything he catches to death, and then cooks it with strange and unnatural ingredients. He thus regards him as a barbarous fishmonger, sunk in primitive beastliness, indifferent to the suffering of his prey and to the welfare of the environment. The view from abroad is equally unflattering. To the continental, the link between quarry and table is central to the sport. He is a hunter, a provider of food. The idea of sitting for hours, enduring every kind of discomfort, only to return the catch to the element from which it has been removed at such cost is laughable. It is another species of English madness. I like to think I can see the strengths and weaknesses in both philosophies. It seems to me wasteful and wanton to kill every fish you catch, whether anyone wants to eat it or not, and it is a depredation which waters cannot stand for long. But I hate the English intolerance and ignorance. I will be doing my bit for culinary and piscatorial bridge-building this year. But the lead must come from the top. One day, perhaps, the prime minister will tuck into carpe a l'ancienne at the Elysee; and offer the French president at the return banquet stewed eel or barbel stuffed with sweetbreads, crayfish and artichokes. Then we will know the barriers are coming down.</p>

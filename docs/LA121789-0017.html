			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK: PUTTING BICE POMODORO RUMORS TO REST  </P> <P> According to rumors in local restaurant circles, Bice Pomodoro on La Cienega --  the casual, trattoria-like precursor of the elegant Bice which just opened in  Beverly Hills -- was either about to close, or was under new ownership, or, at  the very least, was shutting down part of its dining room. According to Bice  director of operations Paul Guzzardo, none of these rumors is true. A new group  of investors has indeed bought into the Bice chain, and liquor licenses and  other legal documents are being changed to reflect a new corporate structure --  but the original owners of the restaurants are still in place. As for the  dining room shrinking, Guzzardo says that new blinds have been set up to divide  off a part of the restaurant that was always meant for private parties.  </P> <P> There are, however, changes afoot at Bice Pomodoro. "What we're going to do,"  Guzzardo says, "is develop into a more casual concept, with lower prices, just  to sort of spread the market out. We want something that can appeal to young  diners on their own as well as to families. We plan significant changes in the  menu, Americanizing it somewhat. For instance, we've found that there's a  tremendous demand in the restaurant for things like Caesar salad and fettuccine  Alfredo, so we're going to offer these -- though in our own style. We just feel  that in our geographic area these changes are necessary. And it's also a way of  further separating the two restaurants, Bice Pomodoro and Bice itself."  </P> <P> CHRISTMAS TWO WAYS: The Beverly Hills Hotel hosts its 43rd annual Christmas  Carol Luncheon on Sunday, Dec. 24, beginning at 11:30 a.m. The event, which  includes a four-course meal, carolers and a Christmas choir, an appearance by  Santa Claus and his elves (who will distribute gifts to children), and a  so-called "parade of chef," costs $42 per person for adults, $33 for children  12 years old or younger. For reservations, call the hotel's Christmas Carol  Hot-Line (213) 281-2967. . . . On Christmas Day itself, on the other hand,  Orleans in West L.A. will serve sit-down lunch and dinner to about 300 of  L.A.'s homeless -- most of them children -- sent to the restaurant by the  city's Parks and Recreation Department. There'll be carolers there too, along  with Santa Claus distributing gifts.  </P> <P> TAKE TWO: The five-course Chanukah dinner being served at Akbar Cuisine of  India in Encino on the 24th, 25th, and 26th of this month is $29.95 per couple,  not per person as reported last week in this space. And one glass of kosher  wine per person is included.  </P> <P> ON THE FRONT BURNER: The Bistro in Beverly Hills, which closed for lunch last  year due to a drop in business (according to proprietor Kurt Niklas at the  time) by the short-lived Beverly Hills restaurant smoking ban, has reopened at  midday, featuring "traditional, hearty, down-to-earth bistro food." . . . The  Beverly Hilton Hotel has just dedicated a new kitchen which will be used  exclusively for the preparation of kosher food. Hotel catering manager Linda  Kent notes that the Beverly Hilton is striving to become the place of choice  for all Jewish events in Los Angeles" -- which ought to keep them mighty busy.  . . . The Wilshire Garden has debuted in the mid-Wilshire area, under the  ownership of Christian Burci and Livio Uleia, who describe themselves as "two  native Romanians with a taste for Italian cuisine." . . . And The Alley Grill  is new in Sherman Oaks, opened by Ted and Larry Wasserman, proprietors of the  Greenhouse in the mid-Wilshire area.  </P></p>

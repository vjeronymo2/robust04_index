			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Observer: Worldly move Lewis Preston is wasting little time filling the large shoes of Ernie Stern, who announced last Friday that he was leaving the World Bank vice-presidency for JP Morgan. The hot tip in Washington is that his successor will be Richard Frank, another American and currently vice-president at the International Finance Corporation, generally known as the bank's private sector, hard money sister. The Preston logic, which has the full support of the US administration, is that the bank is going to have to be ever more inventive in raising capital, especially now that Senator Jesse Helms is threatening to take the axe to anything smelling of foreign assistance and 'world governments' unaccountable personally to him. Frank, described as low-keyed and modest, certainly has the credentials. An old World Bank hand who moved to the IFC in the 1980s when Sir William Ryrie ran it, his principal responsibility has been raising funds through innovative syndicated and co-financing schemes. Though not a novice in the capital markets, the bank, according to its critics, and the countries which it helps, could use more imaginative approaches in the capital markets as official money becomes in shorter supply. He will also be seen very much as Preston's man, which could never entirely be said of Stern - the organisation's institutional memory and the man not even World Bank presidents could circumvent with impunity. An announcement is expected within days when the bank board next meets.</p>

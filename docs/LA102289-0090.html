			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION DEBATE AT STATE LEVEL  </P> <P> I found Gary McDowell's column ("Abortion Debate Finds the Appropriate Stage,"  Op-Ed Page, Oct. 15) to be a starry-eyed view of the state legislatures' role  in the anticipated upcoming abortion battles. The fact of the matter is that  the majority of our legislators are upper middle-class white males who will  never be affected by the outcome of their "moral debate." The only effect the  outcome of this debate has on these gentleman is whether or not they keep their  jobs. Can McDowell really believe that men who have their financial and  political futures at stake will argue this issue on "moral" grounds?  </P> <P> To say that our state legislatures are an appropriate place to hammer out this  issue is to overlook the fact that women in this country should be as equally  assured of their basic human rights as men are. A poor woman in Pennsylvania  should have the same rights as a rich woman in New York, regardless of what the  men who should, but don't, represent her believe is morally correct.  </P> <P> I say let the women of this country decide, since it is they who must face the  consequences. Let's have a special female-only referendum on this issue.  </P> <P> KAREN DARDICK  </P> <P> Encino  </P></p>

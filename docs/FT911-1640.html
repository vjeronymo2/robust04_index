			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Buying spree in Polly Peck shares SHARES in Polly Peck International have been the subject of a concerted buying spree in recent days and weeks, pushing up the price ahead of reconstruction plans due to be announced shortly. Institutional and large private investors have been approached by individuals saying they are buying on their own account or for overseas trusts, whose beneficiaries are not disclosed. There has also been a wave of buying in Zurich, where Polly Peck is still quoted. The shares have been suspended in London since last September. Institutions said that they believed the buying could reflect the creation of a substantial interest by Turkish or northern Cypriot interests. Mr Asil Nadir, Polly Peck's Turkish Cypriot chairman, said in a statement through his lawyers yesterday that he did not know anything about the recent share buying. 'He is co-operating closely with the administrators and the indications from them prior to the creditors' meeting on 24 May are very encouraging,' the statement added. News of the buying surge is known to have caused concern to the authorities in London, especially since reconstruction plans for Polly Peck are due to be announced by the group's administrators within days. An optimistic report from the administrators would boost the prospects for Polly Peck shareholders. The shares, which reached a peak of 450p, fell to 108p before being suspended last autumn. About a month ago, institutions and private individuals were approached with offers of 10p a share. That has now risen to 12p per share in new approaches. Under UK rules, transactions in the shares of suspended companies are still allowed to take place, although members of the Stock Exchange are not allowed to take part in any dealing. In Zurich, meanwhile, several million shares are understood to have changed hands in recent weeks, pushing the share price from around 10p to 22p. Several private investors with large numbers of shares have been telephoned from London by a man calling himself Mr Richards. He offered to buy blocks of 50,000 shares or more at 12p a share. Mr Richards says he is buying for his own account rather than for another investor.</p>

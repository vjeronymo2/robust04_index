			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Europe to speed vetting of rights EUROPE'S Strasbourg-based human rights machinery is to be radically reformed, under a decision taken in Vienna at the weekend. The present two-tier system, under which complaints are exhaustively vetted by a commission before being heard by the European Court of Human Rights, will be scrapped in favour of a single court, in an effort to reduce the time it takes to reach a final judgment. The decision was taken by the Council of Europe, the body which set up the machinery in the early 1950s. It was meeting at summit level for the first time in its 44-year history. Nearly all the 32 member states were represented by their head of state or government - the main exceptions being Britain, whose prime minister, Mr John Major, was attending his party's annual conference, and Greece, in the throes of a general election. The summit also decided to call for a new 'framework convention' on the protection of national minorities, and 'a protocol complementing the European Convention on Human Rights in the cultural field by provisions guaranteeing individual rights, in particular for persons belonging to national minorities'. But whereas the protocol establishing the single court of human rights is to be ready for signature by next May, the documents on minority rights - a highly sensitive issue for many European governments - will take much longer to agree. And the framework convention, unlike the human rights convention, will not be enforceable by a court. It will only specify 'the principles which contracting states commit themselves to respect'. Mr Vaclav Havel, the Czech president, voiced reservations shared by Britain and France when he warned the summit not to 'let in the demon of national collectivism with a seemingly innocent emphasis on the rights of minorities and on their right to self-determination'. Such an emphasis, he said, 'inevitably leads to questioning of the integrity of the individual states and the inviolability of their present borders'. Under the draft protocol restructuring human rights machinery, judges of the single court (one for each member state) will sit in committees of three to weed out inadmissible cases, and in 'chambers' of seven to try the merits of those judged admissible. Difficult or important cases may be referred to a 'Grand Chamber' of 17 judges. Lord Mackay of Clashfern, Lord Chancellor, who represented Britain, says he hopes this procedure may halve the time to settle an average case (now 5-6 years).</p>

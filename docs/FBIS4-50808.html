			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [First of a series of reports entitled "Sights and Sounds of </F> Chinese Prisons" by staff correspondent Tao Guangxiong (3221  0342 7160): "Merciless Punishment, Merciful Reformation"]    [Text] Beijing, 20 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)-- Chinese  criminal reformation is chiefly aimed at turning criminals into  new, law-abiding, and self-supporting persons and making people  who gave gone astray repent and reform, said Zhang Xiufu, vice  minister of justice, in a recent interview with this reporter,  adding that its criminal reformation is unique and highly  effective compared with that in other countries.    This point is borne out by relevant statistics. In China,  the number of prison inmates receiving reduced sentences is  20-25 percent a year, 95 percent of ex-convicts are reformed,  less than 10 percent of convicts are "second timers," and only 6  to 8 percent of those offended again within three years of being  released from prison. China has one of the lowest rates of  recidivism in the world.    "Prisoners are humans too; most prisoners can be reformed."  This saying by Mao Zedong serves as the foundation of Chinese  criminal reformation. In recent visits to prisons in Shanghai,  Shandong, and other places, this reporter saw that another  saying by Mao Zedong had been hung in each prison: "Our prisons  are not the usual prisons of past eras. Ours are actually  schools, factories, or farms."    This is also the reality. Statistical work by the Ministry  of Justice shows that each year 150,000 people serving custodial  sentences are awarded grammar school course or study graduation  certificates by educational departments and 100,000 various  technical course certificates by labor departments.    Zhang Xiufu said: There are many methods for reforming  criminals in China, the most notable of which is labor. People  commit crimes for varied reasons, but mainly because of sloth,  aversion to work, and coveting wealth. Through labor, prisoners  can be corrected of their bad habits and made to realize that  you have to "work hard to earn everything you own or consume."  Collective labor can also heighten the sense of cooperation  among prisoners, strengthen their physique, and maintain their  physical and mental health. The acquisition of a skill or  knowledge of production also helps prisoners find jobs and make  a living and prevents them from returning to crime.    China also gives consideration to political education in  reforming criminals, which has been attacked by some Western  countries as "brain washing." Zhang Xiufu said: Discounting  those who say this with malicious intent, most have no idea  about the real situation. There was indeed something wrong with  China's political education in the past, but "leftist" elements  have been weeded out, and what remains now is education in  morality, ideals, and the legal system. "Ultimately people need  something spiritual." Political education in reformation work  benefits criminals a great deal.    Behind every criminal are their parents, spouses, or  children  who have sincere expectations of them. Wang Fei, a former  reform- through-labor bureau chief in Shanghai and vice chairman  of the Chinese Society of Reform-Through-Labor Law, said in an  interview with this reporter that Chinese criminal reformation  has two objectives: To work for the country's stability and  social development and the future of criminals and their  familial happiness. The former is the essence, but the latter  cannot be ignored.    "Punishment is merciless but reformation merciful," said  Wang  Mingdi, reform-through-labor bureau chief of the Ministry of  Justice. Chinese prisons are the most humane. They are like  hospitals and want prisoners to return to society as healthy and  normal individuals. All work is done with an eye on the  prisoners' futures upon being released from prison. The  humanist light of Chinese criminal reformation work can be seen  from the last emperor, Pu Yi. Many criminals have obtained a  new lease of life through it.</p>

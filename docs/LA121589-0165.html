			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BLACK STILL BASIC IN HOSIERY, BUT GLITZ IS IN  </P> <P> Gold is in, glitz is it, but black is the perennial bestseller in holiday leg  wear, say hosiery department sales staffs.  </P> <P> Shoppers looking for hosiery to wear with this season's opulent evening clothes  will find plenty of options -- iridescent, jewel tone, elegant or whimsical  patterns -- at prices ranging from $5 to $20.  </P> <P> What isn't an option is basic beige. Women accustomed to stopping by a  mini-market, grabbing a package of beige panty hose and wriggling into them in  the car on the way to a party will find themselves out of step with this year's  fashions.  </P> <P> Even the favorite sheer black stockings have gone beyond basic. They are  seamed, jeweled, clocked, flocked and bow-tied. They sparkle with jet beads,  gold foil, discreet -- or indiscreet -- rhinestone accents.  </P> <P> "Embellishment" is essential, according to Antoinette Corley, who is promotions  manager/fashion production for the Broadway department stores. Beaded gowns  with a 1920s flavor look best with seamed or clocked stocking styles, she  noted. Back seams and satin bows at the ankle suit the tuxedo look for women.  And colored hose complete the all-in-one effect with gowns of red, green or  royal blue.  </P> <P> With black-and-gold party dresses, a gold foil detail on one leg of sheer black  hose helps pull the look together. Black embroidery and jet beads on black  stockings provide the finishing touch for a black velvet and red satin gown.  </P> <P> Sequined or jewel-encrusted gowns also require something special -- an  iridescent gleam, at the very least -- in coordinated stockings. And with this  year's very big little black dress, "the detail often is in the hose, not the  gown," she said.  </P> <P> Stockings are no longer an afterthought, Corley said, but an important  accessory. They are considered in the purchase of a dress and in wardrobe  planning by women who patronize the Broadway store at South Coast Plaza.  </P> <P> "The customers know what they want. They buy basic black, for example, and  accessorize with stockings and earrings. They want to wear (a dress) for more  than one party, rhinestones at the ankle for evening and sheer black to  church," she said.  </P> <P> At Frederick's of Hollywood in Westminster Mall, customers bring in evening  clothes, even wedding dresses, to match hosiery, said store manager Susan  Whetstone-Laws.  </P> <P> "I have girls drag in 20-pound dresses to make sure they get the right  stockings," she said.  </P> <P> While they're not always sure of their taste -- "They bring in dresses and ask  us to select stockings," Whetstone-Laws said -- her customers are buying gold  in a big way this year.  </P> <P> The store's newest style is black stretch-knit panty hose embossed with a gold  ivy-and-rose pattern. "They look great with gold lame," she said.  </P> <P> For evening, party-goers like gold and silver foil stockings with an embossed  pattern of champagne glasses. "I wore these stockings in silver with a simple  black velvet dress with a silver brooch at the center of the sweetheart  neckline," Whetstone-Laws said.  </P> <P> Holiday stockings can be whimsical too.  </P> <P> Just for fun, women are buying white panty hose dotted with candy canes and  holly berries or accented with peppermint-stripe seams, red bows and jingle  bells at the ankles. There is also a pair of black stockings decorated on one  ankle with a red Santa sporting a tiny pearl at the tip of his hat.  </P> <P> Male customers, who make up 40% of Frederick's hosiery customers, buy red or  green fishnet stockings for the holidays. "For some reason, men like fishnet,"  Whetstone-Laws said.  </P> <P> Men also like "fancy things" in hosiery, she said, and often purchase stockings  to complete an outfit. "They'll buy a leather dress or skirt at another store  in the mall and want stockings to go with it," she said.  </P> <P> Nordstrom's hosiery department also gets men customers, said Brenda Danielson,  hosiery buyer for the South Coast Plaza store. But they often feel out of place  in this women's department.  </P> <P> "Men are more comfortable buying sox," she said.  </P> <P> "Hosiery is a hard thing to buy," Danielson said. Women make an effort to match  or coordinate their dresses and stockings for the one-color look that's  current, she pointed out. (It's also possible to achieve that all-in-one look  for your mink coat, with mink pompons at the heels of your stockings.)  </P> <P> Many women prefer rhinestone-accented or sparkle hose for evening, Danielson  said, but younger, "more funky" customers like Capri tights -- footless opaque  stockings with lace or rhinestones at the bottom edge. In black, white, ivory  or earth tones, they are paired with chiffon skirts for evening.  </P> <P> Orange County stocking sellers agreed, however, that the best-selling hosiery  for holiday wear and all year long is, hands down, black ultra-sheer.  </P></p>

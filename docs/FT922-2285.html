			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Survey of European Building &amp; Construction (3): Solid but inevitable moves - Building Materials CONSOLIDATION of Europe's building materials market is far more advanced than in the contracting sector. The incidence of cross-border acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic alliances is far greater among cement, glass, plasterboard, concrete and roof tile producers than it is among contractors which operate in much more fragmented domestic markets. The prime reason for this is that a purchaser of a building materials company is buying tangible assets whereas a contractor with no production facilities is worth only the sum of the abilities of the people it employs. So it is more risky to invest in a contractor whose key personnel can walk away at any time, particularly after a contested bid, than put money into a building materials producer whose key asset is clay or limestone reserves that can be measured and valued. The manufacture of high volume, low value building materials such as bricks, cement and concrete tends naturally to consolidate among a small number of large suppliers. These are able to make the best of a low margin business by taking advantage of economies of scale. That is particularly true in Britain where public companies can be bought up through the Stock Exchange, unlike continental Europe where shares are more tightly held and many companies privately owned. As a result, British material companies have been able to build up large domestic positions. Thus, in the cement industry there are only three large domestic suppliers: Blue Circle, Rugby Portland and the Scandinavian-owned Castle Cement. Until a few years ago, BPB Industries controlled more than 95 per cent of the UK plasterboard market. Only recently has it faced strong competition in its home market from Lafarge-Coppee of France and Knauf of Germany. The British brick and concrete industries similarly are dominated by a relatively small number of large and medium sized publicly quoted companies. The result has been that British companies have been able to use their stock market strength to build up a substantial asset base. They have then used this as a springboard to carve out positions in the more fragmented continental European markets. Thus, BPB Industries is Europe's biggest plasterboard manufacturer; Redland is the biggest roof tile producer; Pilkington is the largest glass supplier and RMC the biggest ready-mix concrete producer. Steetley, the British building materials group which has recently been acquired by Redland after a bitter takeover bid, is the largest aggregates company in France. Blue Circle has become one Europe's biggest manufacturers of domestic heating equipment after the takeover of Compagnie Internationale du Chauffage, a subsidiary of Nord Est of France and of Thermopanel, Sweden's largest radiator producer. Mr Charles Young, chief executive of Blue Circle's home products division, said the purchases would make the group Europe's second largest supplier of steel panel radiators behind Stelrad, part of MB-Caradon, the British building products and packaging group. The takeovers are the latest in a series of cross-border mergers involving European heating companies. Last month, Robert Bosch, the German conglomerate, succeeded in gaining control of Worcester Group, the British central heating boiler maker, for which it had bid Pounds 71.8m. Earlier this year Wolseley, the Midlands based engineering group, paid FFr931m (Pounds 95m) for Brossette, a large French heating and plumbing supplier. In 1990 Hepworth, the UK building materials and home products group, paid Pounds 155m for Saunier Duval, the French boiler manufacturer. These moves are typical of the consolidation that has been occurring in European building material markets, particularly where products are too bulky to be exported easily and competitive pricing can be vulnerable to transport costs. In such cases, it is important that manufacturing plants should be close to main markets. Companies with international aspirations have little choice but to make acquisitions. Most of the large European cement manufacturers have subsidiaries in other Community countries. At the end of April, Italcementi, Italy's biggest cement company, paid FFr6bn (Pounds 611m) for a controlling interest in Ciments Francais, the second largest cement manufacturer in France. A month earlier Calcestruzzi, the ready-mix concrete producing subsidiary of the Italian Ferruzzi group, in a joint venture with the National Bank of Greece took control of Heracles, one of the top two Greek cement manufacturers. The deals marked a new development in the battle for market share by European cement manufacturers. Italian companies until now have stood aside from making cross-border acquisitions, preferring to concentrate on developing sales in a domestic market which boasts one of the world's highest per capita consumption of cement. Nobody is quite sure what the entry by Italcementi into the broader European market will herald. The extent of takeovers and stakebuilding by large manufacturers in the sector might suggest a highly competitive European market in which cement prices might be expected to fall sharply as producers battle for market share during times of recession. In fact, cement prices in western Europe have proved surprisingly stable by comparison with other basic building materials such as bricks and plasterboard. Prices of plasterboard, for example, have been slashed in Britain, France and Germany years as BPB Industries, Lafarge-Coppee and Knauf have slugged it out in a bitter war for market share. The absence of similar price-cutting by cement manufacturers and the relatively low level of cement exports between European countries, even where works are situated close to borders, has prompted a European Community investigation into possible market sharing involving 76 companies including Blue Circle of the UK, Holderbank of Switzerland, the world's largest cement manufacturer and Lafarge-Coppee, the world's second largest manufacturer. Manufacturers say that they have not colluded and that it would be suicidal to indulge in a price war simply to satisfy European commissioners. Nonetheless, companies risk being fined up to 10 per cent of their annual turnover should the Commission prove that relationships between competitors have become too cosy.</p>

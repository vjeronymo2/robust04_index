			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Opening remarks to a "New Year News Conference" by </F> President Kim Yong-sam for foreign and domestic reporters at the  Chongwadae presidential offices, Seoul--live]    [Text] I am glad to meet you, especially you foreign and  domestic reporters.    Dear fellow countrymen: I hope that during the New Year of  1994 all your wishes are fulfilled and you enjoy happiness.  Last year, we inaugurated the new government and initiated  changes and reforms to create a new Korea. With the  inauguration of the civilian government and reform, our  country's international position has been amazingly enhanced.  The world is watching us. Indeed, our society has been changed  remarkably over the past year. I sincerely thank you, the  people, for joining in the changes and reform.    This is the second year of change and reform. It is the year  to pledge a new upsurge and consolidate last year's achievements.    The Uruguay Round [UR] negotiations, which have dragged on  for seven years, were settled late last year. Thus, the world  has entered an era of unlimited competition. The world and  international competition are no longer empty words, but rather  a reality. We must exchange our narrow vision for a wide vision  of the entire world. Only the nations that win the competition  will become the masters of global history. The nations left  behind in the competition will barely survive.    It is our task this year to determine how to cope with the  fierce flow of world history. I want the new year's goal of the  state administration to be to strengthen the nation's  competitiveness. While setting this goal, I would like to  discuss the direction of overall state affairs.    First, I will continuously push for change and reform in a  bid to enhance the country's competitiveness. Through reform,  we should advance in the world and through change, we must  prepare for the future.    The world has entered an era of competition through reform.  We must adjust laws and regulations so that there will be  innovations in efficiency and productivity in all domains of  state affairs. We must continue to eliminate authoritarianism,  corruption, and irregularities that block internationalization  and slow our advance to the future.    In order to adapt to the changed international order, we  must first change all the government's functions and roles. The  government itself should take the initiative in eliminating and  rectifying inefficient practices. The government should  strongly push ahead with ongoing reforms and change so that the  people can actually feel them in their routine lives. The  government should become a government that always contributes to  alleviating the people's inconvenience and that serves for the  welfare of alienated people.    Change should also be effected in politics. In today's  turning point of the state and society, those involved in  politics should display the leadership of pooling the strength  and wisdom of the people. Now is the time to do so. With the  form of politics we had in the past we could not succeed in the  era of unlimited competition. Without changing our policies we  cannot enhance the international competitiveness of our country.    The people ardently want to see the politicians adapt to the  changing world and sincerely discuss matters to cope with it.  Today we urgently need such policies with which to lead  communities and provide guidance in carrying out change and  reform. Policies in the interest of the people and for their  welfare are urgently required.    We need policies that alleviate the sufferings of the people  in all fields, including education, traffic, environment, and  public security. The creation of such a political climate in  which confrontation and competition are vigorously carried out  is desirable. Policies that foster collective egoism should be  eliminated. Political reform by the politicians themselves  should precede all other reforms. We should firmly establish  clean politics. I expect the bills on political reform to pass  soon.    I will strengthen our economy's international  competitiveness  through the steady promotion of the Five Year-Plan of the new  economy. The expansion of social overhead capital and  facilities, the balanced development of national land, the  alleviation of regulations imposed on economic activities, and  the development of science and technology are our priority task  to strengthen international competitiveness. Our economy faces  difficulties today.    The government will further accelerate the expansion of  social overhead facilities to strengthen our potential for  economic growth. For this, I will provide mechanisms so that  civilian capital is actively induced into social overhead  facilities. At the same time, I will epochally rectify  imbalances in regional development. This is my long-cherished  will and resolution. I will provide a breakthrough and  foundation for rectifying imbalances between regions during my  term of office without fail.    I have already directed the new economic team to provide  comprehensive measures and implementation plans so this work  will be initiated on a full scale beginning this year. The new  economic team will make public to the people the framework of  these projects in the near future. Only when free and fair  competition is carried out, can sound enterprises be fostered.    Since unnecessary restrictions may work as a cause for  corruption, I will abolish, as part of my reform drive,  regulations that restrict business activities. The government  has already formed a team, which has already begun activities,  for examining ways to relax restrictive regulations. We will  drastically restructure more than half of the  government-supported enterprises, which have been operated  loosely or for which the nation's management is considered no  longer necessary, so that they are integrated, dissolved, or  privatized.    We cannot enhance international competitiveness of our  economy without technological development. In the new year, we  will push ahead with bolder policies for the promotion of  science and technology.    We must develop ultramodern industrial technology, including  introducing precision new materials and developing the life  sciences. At the same time, we must effect innovations in each  existing technology in our industrial fields. We will increase  the investment in and intensify support of technological  development to foster the intelligence industry.    With a view to creating a climate for vigorous business  activities, we will make efforts to stabilize wages and to lower  monetary interest and land prices. For this, we will readjust  laws and regulations pertaining to land and will further expand  the opening of the door for inducement of foreign capital,  including commercial loans for social overhead capital and  facilities.    At the same time, we must thoroughly comprehend and cope  with  the changes of the time. For example, the environment issue is  not only our nation's problem. We must prepare ourselves now to  effectively cope with the forthcoming environmental discussions.    I will direct all efforts to work out measures to deal with  the problems of farmers and fishermen, who are in a difficult  situation due to the opening of agricultural markets, and on  agriculture and fisheries. Our agriculture, fisheries, farms,  and fishing villages are facing a great turning point as the  result of the settlement of the UR negotiations last year.    The shock and frustration of farmers and fishermen was  painful to all of us, but also to me. However, we should  surmount today's difficulties. We can surmount them. We should  make a new start with new methods for this. As was promised,  the government will complete the 42 trillion won-scale farm and  fishing village development project three years ahead of  schedule. I will see to it that this project is carried out  according to the local situation.    A special tax will be established by this year to strengthen  the competitiveness of agricultural and fishing products.  Through this special tax the government will set aside 1.5  trillion won every year to invest in farm and fishing villages  for the next 10 years.    I have established a secretarial position in the  presidential  offices for agriculture and fisheries in an effort to  effectively promote agricultural policies. Soon, I will also  form a farm and fishing village development committee which will  be a presidential advisory organ. I will establish within the  first half of this year practical and fundamental measures to  secure the international competitiveness of our agricultural  products and to effect innovations in the development of the  rural environment. I will directly preside over the meeting of  the farm and fishing village development committee which  agriculture-related ministries will attend. Thus, I will  directly oversee the smooth promotion of various agricultural  policies. I will see to it that all of our people pool their  wisdom and strength so as to protect and revive farm and fishing  villages.    Fourth, I will actively promote educational reform to  enhance  our international competitiveness. Our country's international  competitiveness is determined, in the end, by people. Along  with education of people, our education should foster talented  individuals who will be able to cope with globalization and  opening up. Educational reform will be the core of the reforms  and changes we seek.    The government will strengthen professional and  technological  education to deepen education in science and to supply able  human resources to the industrial and administrative sectors.  The education reform committee which will soon be formed under  direct presidential authority, will provide a comprehensive  education reform plan, and I will see to it that the education  reform plan is implemented consistently.    We should make our 5,000-year-long culture the foundation of  our national strength. The spirit of being devoted to people's  welfare is the foundation of our national culture. Believing  the characteristics of our national culture to be the  characteristics of world culture, we should foster and cultivate  our culture.    This year marks the 600th anniversary of the selection of  Seoul as the capital. This year also is Visit Korea Year, and  the year of Korean traditional music. I expect that vigorous  efforts will be made this year to make our art internationally  renowned.    Fifth, I will carry out bold policies to internationalize  and  globalize all of our society. We will pursue active opening,  not passive globalization. This is because we ourselves must  cultivate our own national destiny, which must not be determined  by other people.    The degree of the globalization of a country, as well as its  economic and military strengths and the level of its culture,  are important factors in determining its national strength.  Globalization means deregulation, opening up, and  rationalization [jayulhwa, kaebanghwa, hamnihwa]. To promote  cooperation and compete with the world fairly, we must globalize  the people's consciousness and their capabilities as well as our  systems. Globalization must be pursued both in the central  government and in the regional governments. I expect practical  reforms for globalization will be made in all fields of our  society.    Practical diplomacy [silli oegyo] is called for more  urgently  than ever in an era of globalization. Heads of state of various  countries are busy promoting their own national interests. I  will rush to any place in the world if it is beneficial to the  country and people. And, the government will prudently fulfill  its duties to promote peace in the world and prosperity in the  Asia-Pacific region.    We will strengthen diplomacy in economic affairs and trade  to  positively adjust ourselves to [chokkuk taeung] the  international trade environment, which has changed since the  conclusion of the Uruguay Round negotiations.    Sixth, this year, I will do my best to build a foundation  for  resolving the North Korean nuclear issue and improving  South-North relations.    The North Korean nuclear issue is an issue over which the  existence of 70 million fellow countrymen is at stake. It also  constitutes a threat to peace in the world.    North Korea must, though belatedly, come forward with the  correct attitude of trying to resolve the Korean peninsula  problems through South-North Korean dialogue. I hope North  Korea will realize that it is a correct way to get assistance  for what it needs within the nation through South-North  dialogue, instead of trying to get it from outside. If the  North Korean nuclear issue is resolved, substantial relations  between the South and North can be promoted at a very rapid  speed.    Fortunately, North Korea shows signs of change, and I expect  we will be able to find clues to resolving the issue in a few  days [kummyonggan].    Of course we should refrain from being too hastily  optimistic. However, North Korea's closed and isolation policy,  rather than helping it maintain its system, will only burden it.  I clearly believe that North Korea will gradually become aware  of this fact. This is because as the era of unlimited  competition emerges, North Korea will have to take part in  globalization to survive. The sooner North Korea takes part in  the trend of reform and openness, the more it will hasten our  whole nation's globalization.    As president, I will carry out my work so that not an inch  of  error in national security emerges. I will continuously promote  reform and modernization of our military to assume a posture of  security so as to prevent any kind of provocation.    While there can be no sanctuary in eradicating injustice and  corruption, the people's love and faith in the military must not  be shaken. I hope all the people will encourage the military's  rebirth. I would like to thank our officers and men who are  taking pains to defend the armistice line in this cold winter.    Dear fellow countrymen: I would like to ask exceptional  cooperation from you, the people, as I reveal my plan for  administrating state affairs this year.    First of all, I would like to address businessmen. The most  important force of competition in an era of globalization and  internationalization is the business sector. The government  will provide all the assistance necessary to make our country  the most appropriate country for business. When this is carried  out, businessmen must exert efforts for invest resolutely and  develop technology and markets.    Economic war is competition in quality. I hope that  businessmen make products under the goal of making the world's  highest quality products.    Lacking harmony between the labor and management, there can  be no competitiveness. As today's economic growth was achieved  though the sweat of workers, tomorrow's international  competitiveness will be impossible without the determination and  participation of workers. Labor and management must harmonize so  that the economy can be saved, and the economy must be alive for  there to be a share for you and me. I would like to propose  that labor and management make this year a year of no  labor-management disputes.    The government will also prepare to carry out, without  fail, an employment insurance system in 1995. Once again, I  sincerely appeal to you, farmers and fishermen, not to be  discouraged. We must concentrate all our wisdom on overcoming  the high wave of global competitiveness and openness from now on  and make efforts for its realization. We must make efforts to  adapt ourselves to the new circumstances. Also, organizations  of farmers and fishermen must start anew.    I address the 900,000 civil servants. Last year, many civil  servants disclosed details of their assets to the public for the  first time in history. This served as an important occasion for  regaining the people's trust in your reputation. You are the  master of change and reform, as well as the driving forces of  international competitiveness. The fate of the state depends  upon your awareness and efforts. I hope you discard an  easy-going attitude and stand at the forefront of change and  reform.    Also, I extend my appreciation and sympathy to you and your  family members who shared the pain of last year's pay freeze. I  will surely keep my word to raise the wages of the civil  servants to the level of employees at government-operated  corporates before 1997 by formulating a four-year plan for the  improvement of the civil servant wage system.    I address my fellow countrymen. As we are only several years  away from the 21st century, the coming years are the most  important period for our nation. What we need now is faith to  carry out changes and reform, and conviction for their certain  success. The people's moral awareness and sense of mission in  these times are the basic factors in overcoming  internationalization and openness.    We must advance while carrying out reform. Also, we must  carry out reform while advancing. It is our goal to achieve  national reunification and to lead the creation of a new  civilization in the Asia-Pacific era by entering the ranks of  developed countries. We will surely reach it. Let's cherish  the firm faith of opening a great era for the Korean nation.  Let's all advance together toward that glorious day.    Finally, the United Nations has named this year the year of  the family. Therefore, we should realize the importance of  family and fill all our families with love and happiness by  further developing our good family system. Thank you.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 23 KYODO -- Japan's major dailies on  Saturday editorially welcomed the coalition's end to a two-week  political paralysis by choosing Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata as  their candidate for prime minister, but also pointed out the  difficulties lying ahead.    "Hata was considered the most likely candidate from the  beginning," the ASAHI SHIMBUN said, citing the candidate's  cabinet experience in Liberal Democratic Party-led governments  and his "comparably high" popularity.    But "the Hata government sets sails while revealing big  contradictions," the ASAHI editorial continued, pointing to  major policy differences and animosity between Shinseito's  [Japan Renewal Party] key strategist Ichiro Ozawa and leaders of  the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest coalition party.    "Both (sides) were like oil and water from the very  beginning," it said, adding that policy clashes over North Korea  and tax increases seem inevitable.    "As before, Shinseito's No. 2 man Ozawa will play the major  role, as so far Hata has failed to put his foot down on the  intracoalition struggle," said the ASAHI editorial entitled,  "Isn't It Prime Minister Ozawa?"    The NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN observed that with Hata's  candidacy,  "the antagonism between coalition parties has not been settled  for the time being, and political instability characterized by  political realignment is likely to continue."    After New Party Sakigake [Harbinger] split from its ally  Japan New Party and pulled out of the coalition, "two poles"  centering on the Shinseito-Komeito [Clean Government Party] bloc  and the SDP have developed, the economic daily said.    It said Shinseito and the Buddhist-backed Komeito are  devoted  to a total overhaul of the tax system and tax hikes, which the  NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN believes are necessary to finance the  country's social security system.    The NIKKEI said it is doubtful whether the coalition will  endorse "unconditionally" any steps the United Nations could  take against North Korea in connection with its alleged nuclear  weapons program.    "This will unavoidably narrow Japan's diplomatic range," the  NIKKEI said.    "The rising tide for political realignment shows no signs of  ebbing. Fires of change are smoldering," the YOMIURI said about  the prospects of the coalition. It urged a "stable and strong  government with common policy ideals and policies."    The YOMIURI, the nation's largest daily, said it would be  better to make Hata's government a caretaker government to pass  the fiscal 1994 budget, and then dissolve the House of  Representatives for a general election.    The MAINICHI SHIMBUN regretted the missed opportunity for  political realignment and the formulation of new policies which  it anticipated from the formation of a new government.    "It will basically maintain the structure of the current  coalition government," it said.    While urging the upcoming government to continue Hosokawa's  reform drive, the MAINICHI doubts whether money politics will be  rooted out.    "The political reforms focusing on a revival of the  self-cleaning capacity of politics have come to an end before  penetrating even below the surface," the MAINICHI said.</p>

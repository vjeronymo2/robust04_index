			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: Amdahl in alliance to offer MPP computers Amdahl, the US mainframe computer company, plans to offer high-performance database systems based on massively-parallel processor (MPP) supercomputers. Its announcement pre-empts the expected introduction of similar products by IBM. Amdahl has formed an alliance with nCube, a US manufacturer of MPP computers; Oracle, the leading database software company; and Information Builders, a software company that specialises in linking different types of computers on networks. Amdahl, which has been struggling to keep pace with rapidly falling prices for its mainframe computers, sees the alliance as an opportunity to broaden its market. MPPs achieve very high processing speeds at low cost by linking thousands of microprocessor chips, similar to those used in personal computers, to work together in parallel. Most MPPs have been used in scientific and technical applications. However, IBM is expected next week to announce an MPP system aimed at the commercial market. Amdahl and its new partners said they too would enter this field within the next few months. Business intelligence systems that capture, analyse and distribute information from mainframes and other computer systems are now seen as critical to process re-engineering efforts taking place in many businesses, Amdahl noted. nCube will supply the hardware for the products. Oracle and Information Builders will provide software. Amdahl will market the products. Hearst Corp and Capital Cities/ABC are have agreed to buy Viacom's one-third interest in Lifetime Television for Dollars 317.6m in cash, AP-DJ reports from New York. Hearst and Capital Cities, which each own one-third interests in the cable network, will each own half interests on completion of the deal.</p>

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Books: Chitchat with Tennessee FIVE O'CLOCK ANGEL Letters of Tennessee Williams to Maria St Just, 1948-1982 Andre Deutsch Pounds 17.99, 407 pages AT A party given by John Gielgud in June 1948 Maria Britneva noticed a young man wearing one red and one blue sock. Since everyone was ignoring him and he looked vulnerable, she invited him round for a meal with her family. There he met members of the White Russian colony in London, including 'Larky Boy' and 'Klop the Bug' (father of Peter Ustinov). A few days afterwards he disappeared, and in July Maria started receiving letters from Paris addressed to 'Darling Maria' and signed 'Love - Tenn.' Yes, folks, you've guessed. The young man (he was actually 37 at the time) was none other than the famous playwright, Tennessee Williams, who, having taken Broadway by storm with A Streetcar Named Desire, had come to London for the British premiere of The Glass Menagerie - John Gielgud directing, Binkie Beaumont producing. The fact that Williams was staying in a suite at the Ritz does not dim the brightness of Maria's story. She might be a little naive, but she is a genuine 100 per cent brick. But who exactly is she, you may ask? A glance at Donald Spoto's biography of Williams reveals three brief entries. In the first, she is described as 'a young Russo-English aspiring actress . . . a woman of strong loyalty and vitality.' In the second, her name is inscribed on a plaque at Williams's summer-house Key West, along with six others. In the third, her antagonism to Tallulah Bankhead is noted, with Tennessee 'licking his lips' at the prospect of a fight. To read Williams's letters to Maria, knowing what was actually happening in his life, comes as something of a shock. Until, of course, one reminds oneself that this was not a love affair, nor was ever meant to be. Tennessee bathed in Maria's unstinted devotion and sent her letters full of the kind of detail that he knew she would enjoy. Among his myriad lovers and hangers-on, Maria stood like a rock - a rock that was all the more necessary because of his impossible behaviour and the bitchery of his friends. Where Harold Acton saw 'a petty, taciturn moustached little man without any obvious distinction,' Maria acknowledged only her soul-mate, whose blue eyes she had gazed into at John Gielgud's party. When asked what he would like most in life, Williams once replied, 'To be handsome.' Maria did not care whether he was handsome or ugly. She accepted him completely, seeing only good where others saw bad. She had been struck by lightning and is still in that state long after his death. To the consternation of those who thought of themselves as his nearest and dearest, he rewarded her by making her co-trustee of his will. And so we have the St Just letters. The change in Maria's name is accounted for by the fact that, although she was for a long time in love with James Laughlin, she finally married Peter, the ailing son of the banker, Edward Grenfell, who had taken the title of St Just and bought himself a Palladian mansion. By Peter, she had two daughters, and, since she was the offspring of Russian aristocrats, fell into her new role with gusto, playing with 'Froggy Footman' (the dog) in the country and dispensing champagne and badinage in Belgravia. Tennessee knew exactly how to pitch his letters to her. Discussion of stage craft, technique or plot motivation were not called for. He turned on the gossip like a tap. The justification for the publication of these letters is Maria's burning - and altogether honourable - desire to prove that Tennessee Williams is the greatest playwright of the century. Unfortunately, you do not achieve this purpose by printing chitchat - enjoyable though it is, coming from the great man himself - nor by reproducing letters to the Swedish Ambassador wondering why 'the most distinguished dramatist writing in English' has not been nominated for the Nobel Prize, signed 'The Lady St Just.' And who, pray - we return to our question - exactly is the Lady St Just? She is simply the best friend Tennessee Williams ever had, that's who she is. Or is she?</p>

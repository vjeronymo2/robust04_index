			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Private mines bid withdrawn RJB Mining yesterday with-drew a bid to resume mining at Bevercotes, Nottinghamshire, amid growing doubts that private-sector companies will rescue more than a handful of the 20 pits closed by British Coal in the past six months. RJB's decision ends any hopes of salvation for Bevercotes, as British Coal has received no other bid to mine it under licence. It means that just six of the 19 pits put out to tender so far are the subject of a bid which involves mining. Analysts believe it unlikely that all six will resume mining. Betws, in south Wales, is considered the most likely to re-open because of its valuable anthracite coal deposits. The other five pits - Rossington and Markham Main in Yorkshire, Clipstone in Nottinghamshire, Trentham near Stoke-on-Trent, and Coventry, near Keresley - will have to compete with surviving British Coal mines for markets. Bevercotes is the second pit at which RJB has withdrawn a bid, having initially tendered for five of the 19. The company would not comment yesterday because of the confidentiality requirements of bidding. However British Coal said RJB's decision was made after a 'further evaluation of the mining and commercial prospects of the pit'. British Coal also announced detailed talks with companies which have lodged tenders for Rossington and Markham Main. They are each the subject of two bids, from RJB and Edwards Energy, led by Mr Malcolm Edwards, former British Coal commercial director.</p>

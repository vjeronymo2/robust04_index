Shakeup in Government  May Affect Aleksandr Zaveryukha"]    [Text] Boris Fedorov, Russian Federation finance minister,  does not intend to reign for the time being. This was told to  your SEGODNYA correspondent by a high-ranking Russian Federation  Government official who wished to remain unnamed. The vice  premier repeatedly stated earlier, in confidential discussions,  his unwillingness to work in a coalition government. The  Constitution, however, permits the president to form the cabinet  personally. The participation of Mr. Fedorov in Viktor  Chernomyrdin's coalition government is quite possible on  condition that the course toward financial stabilization will be  preserved.    To all appearances, Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin, who  became member of the Russian cabinet back in summer 1991 and who  at one time played the leading role in forming the  post-Communist government of Yegor Gaydar, will keep his  position in the government, too. One of the reasons for his  keeping the role of supervisor of the foreign economic bloc,  experts think, is that there are no aspirants yet in sight for a  position in which one is supposed to handle the problem of  Russia's relations with the other CIS countries. Besides,  Aleksandr Shokhin is Russia's director of the IMF and the World  Bank, and in line with the charters of these international  finance organizations, the term of office in this position is  two years.    At the same time, Gennadiy Melikyan, nominated by Aleksandr  Shokhin and his comrades in arms in the Party of Russian Unity  and Accord [PRES], is apparently threatened with resignation.  According to some information, the State Committee for  Nationalities Policy led by the head of the PRES, Vice Premier  Sergey Shakhray, will also be scrapped. It is not to be hoped  that Mr. Shakhray will leave administrative bodies. According  to unofficial information, he intends to combine parliamentary  activity with work in the president's staff. Boris Saltykov,  who currently holds the position of deputy science minister,  also pins his hopes for a further political career on the State  Duma. The candidacy of former vice premier Mr. Saltykov will in  all probability be offered by the ruling cabinet for the  position of Duma deputy speaker.    Mr. Zaveryukha, vice premier for agriculture, who leads the  Agrarian Party, may lose his position. His vigorous lobbying in  the Council of Ministers may become even an even more  significant reason for that than the fact that his party's  faction in the Duma is in open opposition to the government and  president.</p>

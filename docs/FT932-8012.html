			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Money Markets: Euromarks fall back GERMAN interest rate futures fell sharply yesterday after Germany's latest money supply figures appeared to be a good deal worse than expected and the Bundesbank decided not to cut its short-term interest rates, writes James Blitz. It was announced first thing yesterday morning that, on an annualised basis, Germany's M3 money supply had grown by 7.3 per cent in April compared to 3.4 per cent in March. The headline figure was worse than dealers had expected, leapfrogging over the Bundesbank's target band of 4.5 to 6.5 per cent annualised monetary growth. Some analysts suggested that the underlying monetary growth may not have been as bad as the headline figure indicated. The higher growth did not reflect increased private sector or bank lending, but lower long term savings and increased lending to public authorities, both of which are said to be rather erratic variables. Miss Alison Cottrell, an analyst at Midland Global Markets in London, comm-ented: 'This figure would actually encourage an interest rate cut, not postpone one.' In interest rate markets, however, the clear view was that the M3 figure was the precursor to a more cautious attitude to easing monetary policy by the Bundesbank. In the early morning, the June and September Euromark contracts retreated by 10 and 11 basis points respectively, bottoming out at 92.77 and 93.54. The Bundesbank later decided to keep its Lombard and discount rates unchanged, in spite of expectations earlier in the week of a modest cut in the official interest rate floor. Both contracts remained at these low levels at the close. Sterling futures markets were a good deal more bullish about a rate reduction, following another good performance by the pound on the foreign exchanges and a poorer than expected retail sales figure, which implied that the UK authorities may still need to stimulate the economy. The June short sterling contract rose 2 basis points on the day, while the September contract finished 11 basis points higher at 94.05. In the cash market, three-month money softened to around 6 per cent from a previous 6 1/16 per cent. There was a large shortage of Pounds 1.65bn forecast at the start of the day but it was swiftly despatched.</p>

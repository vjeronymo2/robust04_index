He also stressed the need to  seize the opportunity to carry out the reform well, and  completely solve problems arising from development.    This central leader said that macroeconomic regulation and  control in 1993 only tackled the symptoms but not the root  cause. Some problems which have emerged in the forward progress  since the rapid development in 1992, were not solved last year,  and could not be solved last year; if efforts were made to solve  them last year, it would mean a "hard landing," big  fluctuations, and vibrations in the society. The method adopted  during macroeconomic regulation and control in 1993, was to  tackle the symptoms, so it could only achieve limited goals,  such as checking the inflationary trend, the growing trend of  excessively large scales of capital construction, and the trend  in which large amounts of money were being released by banks.  The number of construction projects underway at this moment is  three times that of 1991. We must continue the "soft landing"  in 1994, and capital construction cannot rise rapidly. This  central leader said that the duty of macroeconomic regulation  and control has not yet been fulfilled, and it has not "landed"  at this moment, therefore it must continue the "soft landing"  this year. If it always "does not land," or even flies upward,  a "hard landing" is needed when problems erupt, by then, the  consequences are hard to predict, and changes in the society  will be unimaginable.    This leader pointed out that the reform in 1994 indeed has  to  be put to a very important position. If the reform in 1994  cannot be carried out well, we will miss an historic  opportunity, which will hardly come again in the future. If we  can carry out the reform well, completely solve problems arising  from it, and really embark upon the road of sustained, rapid,  and healthy development, then, conditions will be good; we must  cherish this good pattern, situation, and opportunity, really  work solidly for eight or 10 years, then, China can really be  counted as a strong nation in the world. Of course this is not  judged in terms of per capita figure, but in terms of overall  quantity, which will show a relatively strong national strength.</p>

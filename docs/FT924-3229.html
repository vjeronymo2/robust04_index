			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: AEEU to raise party payments THE AEEU electrical and engineering union yesterday announced a 14 per cent increase in its contribution to the Labour party, Cathy Milton writes. The increase of more than Pounds 100,000 is matched by a corresponding increase in the notional number of members the union plans to affiliate to Labour to 510,000 at Pounds 1.70 each. It will only partly offset the decision last week by the TGWU general union to cut its contribution by Pounds 500,000 and reduce affiliated members by more than 250,000 by 1994. The move was agreed by the executive of the AEEU, formed by the recent merger of the AEU engineering union and the EETPU electricians' union. A review group is wrangling over the extent unions should influence party elections and the annual conference. The AEEU supports a move to one-member-one-vote for the party leadership and selection elections while the TGWU would like to see the present electoral college system survive broadly intact.</p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: SON HAS DISARMING RESEARCH METHOD  </P> <P> I receive a lot of interesting calls at my office. My favorite so far this year  was from a mother who lives in Bethesda, Md.  </P> <P> "I wonder if you'd mind answering some questions on the U.S.-Soviet missile  treaty?" she said.  </P> <P> "I would be happy to," I told her. "Why do you ask?"  </P> <P> "My son is home from college and he has to write a term paper on disarmament."  </P> <P> "I see. Why doesn't your son call me himself?"  </P> <P> "He's very busy. He needs to get his car tuned, and the only time he can see  his girlfriend is when he comes home."  </P> <P> "Don't you think there is something wrong with a son asking his mother to do  his term paper for him?"  </P> <P> "I don't mind," she replied. "There is so little he needs from me these days.  Was it Reagan's idea or Gorbachev's to reduce the missiles in Europe?"  </P> <P> "Look, ma'am, I don't mind answering your questions, but if you do the work,  your son isn't going to get anything out of it."  </P> <P> "Oh, yes, he will. If the paper is any good, they'll give him an A."  </P> <P> "That's not what I mean. Mothers shouldn't be writing term papers for their  children."  </P> <P> "Why not? We pay their tuition."  </P> <P> "The term paper itself isn't important -- gathering the research for it is what  helps make the scholar."  </P> <P> "Well, I'm sure my son would research the material if he could spare the time.  He was never lazy when he lived at home."  </P> <P> "Whose idea was it for you to do this paper?"  </P> <P> "Both of us. He kept complaining that his entire vacation was being ruined  because he had to look up facts about ICBMs. Since I didn't have any other  commitments, I volunteered to help him. After all, he is flesh and blood."  </P> <P> "But if you just give him all the information, he won't understand any more  about disarmament than he does now."  </P> <P> "If he gets stuck, he can always call me. I always like to hear his voice."  </P> <P> I didn't know what to tell her. "Somehow I feel party to a crime," I said.  </P> <P> "Mrs. Lipkin always helped her son Milton with his papers, and now he works for  the State Department. Will you please tell me everything that took place in  Geneva before they reached an agreement?"  </P> <P> "That'll take a long time."  </P> <P> "I'm not going anywhere. My son is using my car."  </P> <P> "Apparently there is no child abuse in your family."  </P> <P> "None whatsoever. We're very close."  </P> <P> "I'm sure you are. But I would still prefer to discuss disarmament with your  son."  </P> <P> "What's the matter? Are you afraid that a woman can't understand it?"  </P> <P> "It's not that. What concerns me is if something I tell you about the missile  treaty is wrong, your son would never forgive you."  </P> <P> "He has in the past," she told me. "Once I did a paper for him on Tolstoy. Are  you going to help me or not?"  </P> <P> "Why are you so impatient?"  </P> <P> "He has to get the paper in by Monday, and my husband needs at least a day to  type it for him on his computer."  </P></p>

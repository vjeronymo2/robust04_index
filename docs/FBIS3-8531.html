Mr. Papoulias presented to the international mediator the Greek  proposals on the flag and constitution of Skopje and explained  the reasons why the Greek Government decided to impose the trade  embargo on this statelet.    According to reports from Geneva, after his meeting with  Karolos Papoulias within the framework of efforts to settle the  Greece-Skopje dispute, Cyrus Vance will also meet with Skopjean  Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski. It has been learned from  Cyrus Vance's circles that no meeting between the Greek and  Skopjean foreign ministers has been scheduled.    Mr. Papoulias is expected in Belgrade this evening. He will  meet with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic at 1100 tomorrow,  and after their talks he will leave immediately for Moscow.    According to an ASSOCIATED PRESS dispatch received from  Geneva a short time ago, UN envoy Cyrus Vance proposed to  Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias some ideas to settle the  dispute with Skopje, but the obstacles remain. Mr. Papoulias  said that the trade embargo that Greece has imposed on the  neighboring country will continue until an overall solution is  found. The Greek foreign minister added that he will examine new  proposals together with Mr. Vance when they meet again. Mr.  Vance said that he hopes this new meeting will be held in two  weeks. Mr. Papoulias said that in the meantime the Greek  representatives will meet with Mr. Vance's aides as part of the  efforts to solve the problem. After his two-hour talks with Mr.  Papoulias, Mr. Vance told reporters that there is room for more  negotiations.</p>

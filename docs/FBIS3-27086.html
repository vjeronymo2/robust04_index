			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, 17 Feb (XINHUA) -- Guo Fengmin, chief  Chinese representative to the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group,  pointed out recently that the Chinese side had systematically  forwarded its views on the new airport's overall financial  arrangements as early as last August, whereas the British side  only now has presented its new financial arrangements, and thus  the responsibility for delaying the solution of the new airport  issue does not lie with the Chinese side.    In responding to reporters' questions after attending a  Spring Festival gathering hosted yesterday by the New Territory  District Board, Guo Fengmin said: The Chinese side has  preliminarily studied the fourth new airport financial plan  forwarded by the British side. Because the new airport issue  involves so many aspects, the Chinese side is now conducting  in-depth studies of certain questions, some of which require a  further exchange of views with its British counterpart. China  and Britain will first exchange views at the experts level to  pave the way for the Airport Committee meeting.    Guo Fengmin pointed out: Sometime back, people from the Hong  Kong British side said that the Chinese side virtually did not  forward any comprehensive views on the new airport issue, and  recently there were also people who said that the plan submitted  by the British side has fully met the demands of the Chinese  side. Is this not self-contradictory? Because the Chinese side  has not forwarded any comprehensive views, from where did the  so-called plan that has "fully met the demands of the Chinese  side" come? He said: During the Airport Committee meeting last  August, the Chinese side had systematically forwarded its  opinions, and the British side only presented its plan after a  lapse of nearly six months -- from August up to the present --  so it is rather obvious who is delaying.    Guo Fengmin expressed his hope that substantive progress  will  be made by the meeting of the Defense and Security Experts  Subgroup of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group next week. He  also criticized the British side for dragging things out too  long over this matter. He said: Some people are now  deliberately creating the impression that the Chinese side is  delaying matters, but in fact, that is not true. It is also the  British side which has delayed for several years the discussion  of the question of land used for defense and military purposes.</p>

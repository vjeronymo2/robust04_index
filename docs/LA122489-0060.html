			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BORSCHT TO A 'T'  </P> <P> Regarding "Taking a Camp Look at Search for Borscht" (Nov. 12): One of life's  puzzling mysteries for me has been trying to find out why people spell the name  of the well-known soup, borscht, with a "t" at the end. This soup, indigenous  to Slavic nations, has no "t" in its Cyrillic spelling. Only non-Slavic people  stick that letter at the end and it makes absolutely no sense to have it there.  If someone pronounces it with a "t", they are not pronouncing "borshch"  correctly.  </P> <P> "Borshch" was originally developed in the Ukraine and there is a basic,  classical version of this delicious soup. Like everything else to which the  people of Russia have helped themselves, including vodka, which originated in  Poland, they labeled "borshch" as Russian. But we know better, don't we?  </P> <P> JAIME ARAGON  </P> <P> Brea  </P></p>

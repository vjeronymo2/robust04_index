			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OCEANSIDE'S NEW SLOW-GROWTH COUNCIL COMES IN LIKE A LION  </P> <P> It was a maiden voyage awash in political blood Wednesday as the Oceanside City  Council's new slow-growth majority fired most of the city's Planning Commission  and stripped the mayor of an important post.  </P> <P> Just one hour into the majority's first council meeting, Councilman Sam  Williamson, who is now in the minority with Mayor Larry Bagley, said, "To see  what's happening here this morning really disgusts me."  </P> <P> First, the majority muscled through a motion to unseat four of the city's seven  appointed planning commissioners.  </P> <P> "We need some fresh ideas and some new people involved in this city,"  Councilwoman Melba Bishop said.  </P> <P> Bishop was the council's longtime rebellious outsider until voters last month  elected Nancy York and Don Rodee, creating a majority eager to smash what they  regard as the developers' hold on Oceanside.  </P> <P> One of the ousted commissioners, Nancy Jakovac, wasn't going without a parting  shot, and told the council, "I will not sit still and let somebody for  political gain tear this Planning Commission apart."  </P> <P> She blamed the council for passing exemptions to Proposition A, the city's  growth control law, that made it hard for commissioners to practice balanced  growth policies.  </P> <P> The council majority said Jakovac, Nancy Boyer, Jack Cassan and Brian Sullivan  may continue serving until new commissioners are appointed early next year.  </P> <P> Rodee said voters support slow growth, and the commission needs members "with  that philosophy." But the raid on the commission infuriated Bagley and  Williamson.  </P> <P> The mayor termed it "a blatant exercise of power" without regard to the fallen  commissioners' tenure, experience or voting records.  </P> <P> He flatly accused Bishop, York and Rodee of meeting privately to orchestrate  their political actions, calling it a "clear violation" of the Brown Act, the  state's open-meeting law.  </P> <P> Bishop countered: "You're going to see a lot of like votes from these three  people because our philosophies are similar." She called the mayor's accusation  "ridiculous."  </P> <P> But the rancor was just beginning.  </P> <P> Traditionally, the mayor assigns council members to committees, but newcomer  York announced her list of committee appointments. Bishop quickly apologized  for York, saying she actually meant to say "recommended" appointments.  </P> <P> In a 3-2 vote, the majority approved York's list, which placed the appointees  on the most critical committees and removed Bagley as a director of the San  Diego Assn. of Governments, a regional planning agency. He would have become  the board's president next year.  </P> <P> Bagley railed at the move, saying: "I would remind you I was elected mayor of  this city. There may be a coup pulled here, but I will not go quietly."  </P> <P> York replied curtly: "Your appointments to the major committees would continue  the policies of the past, which have led us almost into bankruptcy." The city  is considering cutbacks to erase a projected $5.8-million deficit.  </P> <P> However, the mayor protested that the city is basically financially sound,  commenting: "I think we've done a tremendous job. We are in a glitch right  now."  </P> <P> Finally, it became clear that Bagley would not be making the council's  appointments, nor could he save his own prestigious place on Sandag's board,  which is partly composed of other mayors.  </P> <P> "You can live with it, but you will live with it without my cooperation," said  Bagley, who was later joined by Williamson in threatening to boycott the new  committees.  </P> <P> "I was placed on the appointments list by Miss York. The mayor does not accept  an appointment by a council member," fumed Bagley, who later commented to  reporters that he was dumped from the Sandag board out of spite.  </P></p>

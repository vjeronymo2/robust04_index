			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Lloyds Chemists It is not the average company that can announce a one-for-two rights issue and see its share price rise. Lloyds Chemists' success is all the more remarkable because its story is really rather dull. There may be plenty of mileage left in the strategy of buying up independent chemists, sticking on a new shop-front and pushing own-label products from an efficient distribution system. There is even a clear pool of desirable acquisitions in what remains a fragmented sector. But it is hard to get too excited about the long-term potential of the business as it stands, even if EPOS is successfully installed. As Boots has discovered, diversification when it comes can be painful. The acquisition of the Kingswood chain from Booker is a typical Lloyds deal, though the addition of the troubled Holland &amp; Barrett chain of health food stores at a cost below net book value was unexpected. No doubt Booker insisted on the package. Certainly the commercial logic is elusive unless Lloyds wanted to begin its own diversification. Cost-cutting will probably start with directors' salaries, but H&amp;B will be marginal to the group's success. It might make Pounds 4m next year; the group could make Pounds 40m. Lloyds' shares have outperformed the market by nearly 70 per cent over three years. But at 278p, they remain on a cheap rating given the underlying profits growth and promised 50 per cent dividend increase. One is nevertheless left with the nagging question of why shareholders should stump up more than the cost of the acquisitions simply to clear the balance sheet of debt. Whatever happened to cash generation?</p>

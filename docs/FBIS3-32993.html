Talking to PRENSA LATINA at the conclusion of the first day  of his official visit to Colombia, which followed his stay in  Brazil and Venezuela, Lage said the general balance of his  visits is positive.    Relations are at a high point in these three countries, and  we have found great receptivity in those governments, great  interest in joint ventures, and many opportunities for  cooperation and economic development, Lage affirmed. Lage said  he felt that the most important aspect of his long afternoon  meeting with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria was the frankness  of the in-depth analysis of bilateral relations and problems  between Colombia and Cuba. He indicated that Cuba's ties with  Colombia have made important and significant advances since  Presidents Gaviria and Fidel Castro met last August in  Cartagena. Lage disclosed that he and his host discussed  prospects for strengthening relations, Cuba's opening to foreign  capital, and possibilities for having Colombian businessmen  participate in that process.    He also brought up the subject of furthering commercial  relations through an increase of Cuba's direct purchases of  Colombian oil and exports of Cuban medicines to Colombia.    The Cuban leader felt that as the exchange increases, his  country may find solutions to resolving its debts with Colombia,  which will in turn pave the way for increasing commercial  relations.    Lage indicated that he analyzed specific cooperation in each  sector with the ministers of foreign commerce and agriculture  and livestock and with the planning chief. He will continue  such discussions with the public health, mines and energy, and  economic development ministers and with the management of Banco  de la Republic and the Colombian Petroleum Enterprise.    The Cuban official begins today's schedule with a meeting  with the top leaders of Colombia's major business groups. He  will conclude his visit in the afternoon.</p>

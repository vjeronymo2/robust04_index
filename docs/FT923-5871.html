			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / International Company News: Swire rises 101% at half year SWIRE Pacific, the Hong Kong-based aviation, property and trading group, revealed a 101 per cent increase in net profit to HKDollars 2.18bn (USDollars 282m) for the six months to June. The figures were buoyed by the HKDollars 631m exceptional profit from the sale of the leasehold interest on an office site to Hong Kong Telecom. But recurrent earnings were also 43 per cent higher. 'Notwithstanding the weakness of Cathay, virtually all the other Swire businesses are exceeding profit forecasts', said Mr Sheldon Kasowitz, research manager at Jardine Fleming, who is expecting full year profit of HKDollars 4.3bn. Turnover for the period increased 27 per cent to HKDollars 18.95bn, while earnings per share soared to 137.4 cents for the A shares and 27.5 cents for B shares. The interim dividend is 29 cents for A shares and 5.8 cents for the B shares. Cathay Pacific, the international airline subsidiary, announced a 13 per cent rise in profits on Wednesday. The figures reflected recovery from the Gulf war, but disappointed analysts who had underestimated the impact of recession and price wars. The main engine of growth for Swire was its enlarged property portfolio, rental income increasing to HKDollars 798m from HKDollars 597m, as a result of initial contributions from Cityplaza III and IV, and higher rental rates in its Pacific Place development. The industrial and trading division recorded strong growth, contributions from the Coca-Cola bottling operations in the US and the Taiwanese vehicle sales division, both better than expected. The insurance division showed an improved performance, but earnings from offshore oil services were below budget. The outlook for the full year remains positive. The two new Cityplaza office towers are 99 per cent occupied and Swire will receive a full six-month contribution from the properties. The only question mark over the second-half performance will be Cathay Pacific, whose earnings will depend on factors such as oil price, dollar movements and the extent of the current price war.</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Job prospects up in first quarter JOB PROSPECTS improved in the first quarter of the year, the Alfred Marks recruitment agency said yesterday. It added that the number of temporary posts rose much faster than the total of permanent jobs. The employment department is expected to announce a further rise in unemployment today. Economists in the City of London are predicting a monthly increase of about 25,000, in line with the recent underlying trend of a slight improvement. Unemployment has risen steadily since March 1990. According to the Alfred Marks survey, temporary posts rose 13.2 per cent compared with 9.4 per cent in the same period last year. Permanent posts rose 1.2 per cent compared with a 6.6 per cent fall in the first quarter last year. Using temporary staff enables employers to respond more flexibly to fluctuations in demand. It is not clear, however, whether the increase in temporary work indicates a more flexible labour market or employers' continuing uncertainty about the strength of any economic recovery. The figures show more vacancies in the north and west of England than in the south and east. Vacancies rose 23.5 per cent in the west Midlands compared with a fall of 5.5 per cent a year before. In the north of England vacancies increased by 11.9 per cent compared with a fall of 4.4 per cent last year.</p>

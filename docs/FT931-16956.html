			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / People: Hongkong Bank's new era There was a time when being a Scot sometimes seemed to be almost a condition of promotion to the upper echelons of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. However, the appointment of Indian-born Aman Mehta (above) as the top man in the Americas for HSBC Holdings, the new London-based holding company for Midland Bank as well as Marine Midland in the US and Hongkong Bank, is a sign that those days are long gone. Mehta, 46, trained in the HongKong Bank's London office, but started his career in its Bombay office. After a stint in charge of the bank's corporate planning in Hong Kong he moved to Riyadh in 1988 as managing director of the group's Saudi British Bank affiliate. Last February he was made a group general manager and has been responsible for helping sort out the problems of the group's troubled Concord Leasing business. Mehta's new job is the most senior of a string of announcements of the management team which will run Britain's biggest banking group from the beginning of this month. David Beath, 54, has been made general manager and group audit controller, and Richard Hennessy, 39, group chief accountant. HSBC, which will be headquartered in Midland Montagu's old offices in Lower Thames Street, is keen to maintain its reputation for having a lean top management team. In addition to John Bond, 51, the new group chief executive who has just been appointed to the Midland board, HSBC will have three executive directors - Bernard Asher, 56, (investment banking), John Strickland, 53, (services), and Richard Delbridge, 50, (finance). Asher will report direct to Sir William Purves, HSBC's chairman, while Strickland and Delbridge will report to Bond. Mehta, who will be based in New York, is one of three group general managers of HSBC. Tim O'Brien, 45, in charge of private banking and trustee work, will be based in Geneva, and John French, responsible for credit and risk management for the whole group, will be based in London.</p>

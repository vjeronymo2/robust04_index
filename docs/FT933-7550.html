			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / International Company News: Mannesmann slides into deficit MANNESMANN, the diversified engineering group and a recent favourite with investors during the rally in the German stock market, yesterday reported a group net loss of DM467m (Dollars 278m) for the first six months of the year. The result is a huge swing from a profit of DM15m in the first six months of 1992. Mannesmann suffered losses in all divisions, hit by the combined effects of recession in German, the impact of a stronger D-Mark on group exports, and the costs of rationalisation measures in a number of its main industrial sectors. The result was worse than expected, and the shares dropped DM8.30 to close at DM333.20. The group said first-half losses were worst in its car components division and in its pipes and tubes activities, the group's traditional core business. In both cases, trading losses were compounded by restructuring costs. In addition, weak sales and prices hit the machinery and industrial plant division. Total group turnover rose fractionally, from DM12.82bn to DM12.87bn in the six months, while group orders dropped 6 per cent to DM14.1bn. The group forecast that turnover for the full year would reach the same level as last year, but that orders would not. Although there was little evidence of improvement in business conditions for the rest of the year, Mannesmann nonetheless sounded an optimistic note about the future. It said rationalisation - the positive effects of which were not felt in the interim figures - would lead to a permanent lowering of the group's break-even point without the necessity to reduce the number of products on offer. Over the past year, the number of employees in the group has fallen from 142,827 to 131,164 at the end of June. In a letter to shareholders, chief executive Mr Werner Dieter was confident about the D2 mobile telephone system, the first private network in Germany. Development has cost the company DM4.5bn to date. However, Mannesmann said the project was set to start making profits early next year, and that the system already had nearly 300,000 subscribers, ahead of expectations. Mannesmann shares have outperformed the rising German stock market by 13 per cent since the beginning of June, reflecting investors' desire to buy so-called 'cyclical stocks', where a recovery in profits is not expected until 1995. Mannesmann's added attraction is the gradual contribution to profits from Mannesmann Mobilfunk, the mobile phones subsidiary.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The easing of Thailand's political crisis has  helped restore overseas confidence in the Government's stability  and the country's investment climate, Deputy Foreign Minister  Surin Phitsuwan insisted yesterday.    "I was glad everything ended that way," Mr Surin said.    Political turmoil stemming from calls for a new constitution  prompted other countries to look at Thailand with suspicion  since an international agreement stipulated that any  international accords could be enforced only after they were  legally approved through constitutional procedures of respective  countries, he said.    Concern had grown that if the Government bowed to demand by  a  group of people, foreign investors would be reluctant to invest  in Thailand as they would fear changes in the constitution any  time.    "If we started by avoiding adherence to constitutional  principles, no one could have confidence." he said.    Thailand's political situation, which became tense after  political activist Chalat Worachat staged a hunger strike to  press for the Government to draw up a more democratic  constitution, eased after Mr Chalat called off his protest on  Thursday.    Mr Surin said neighbouring countries were worried that  Thailand's political crisis, if prolonged, could affect  negotiations on cooperation in the establishment of the Growth  Triangle and the Growth Quadrangle as well as the use of water  and other resources in the Mekong River.    He invited suggestions from academics and businessmen on how  Thailand should proceed politically and how it could best  protect its democratic system.    Mr Surin, however, conceded he was "a little bit worried"  about problems within the Phalang Tham Party [PTP] hut' said  disputes and rifts were common in politics and that the party  needed time to adjust to any changes.    "The party needs to reorganise its own system. The Democrat  Party went through that process before."    In the end, all party members had to accept the decision of  the majority, he said.    Mr Surin said that people should not be pessimistic about  the  future of Thai politics following reports that the PTP might  withdraw from the Government, since Prime Minister Chuan Likphai  was still confident all would go well.    He said Mr Chuan would not dissolve the House of  Representatives and would go on working with the five coalition  parties.    Mr Surin asked the public not to give importance to reports  that the Democrat Party had approached certain Opposition  parties to join the Government.    According to Mr Surin, the Government has three options to  solve its problems: dissolving the House, reshuffling the  Cabinet or seeking settlements among the five parties.    Mr Surin said the best exit was for all five parties to  discuss how to prevent disputes from recurring as well as iron  out their differences.    He said the Premier would not intervene in the internal  problems of the PTP.</p>

It is thought that the measles virus, both in the wild form  and in that used in the vaccine, may damage blood vessels which  feed the intestines, causing a long-term condition called  Crohn's disease which results in severe abdominal pain and  diarrhoea.    The researchers stressed that even if the link was proved,  measles vaccination should not be abandoned, because it offered  protection against a serious illness with consequences which  could include brain damage and pneumonia. But there would be a  case for finding different forms of the vaccine.    Andrew Wakefield, director of the inflammatory bowel disease  study group at the Royal Free hospital in London, said that  Crohn's disease affected at least 40,000 people in the United  Kingdom. It caused inflammation and ulceration of the  gastro-intestinal tract, often requiring major surgery.    Mr. Wakefield said studies in Scotland had found that over  the last 20 years cases in children had risen from four a  million to 29 a million.    There was evidence that the measles virus could cause a  blockage of the tiny vessels controlling the blood flow to the  intestines, he told a meeting in London of the British Digestive  Foundation. His group had identified the virus in a set of  patients, and other researchers in America and Sweden had  confirmed the finding.

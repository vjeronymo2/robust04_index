			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / General Motors - The Embattled Giant: Crucial test ahead for component units and biggest potential labour flashpoints - in GM's efforts to slash its US costs will come in the group's components manufacturing subsidiaries. GM is the most vertically integrated car assembler in the US, getting some 70 per cent of parts from its own subsidiaries. This has several drawbacks. First, GM's parts operations have a captive market which reduces the pressures to improve efficiency. Second, many employees at the in-house components companies belong to the United Auto Workers' union and thus can command higher wages than workers for outside contractors. Third, GM's dependence on in-house businesses makes it vulnerable to strikes. This was demonstrated in late August when a strike at a stamping plant in Lordstown, Ohio, quickly idled 10 assembly plants. GM officials have long argued the group should shift components purchasing more to outside suppliers, but this has been fiercely resisted by the UAW. GM's new cost-cutting regime could thus lead to a fierce tustle. The GM automotive components group is expected to have sales this year of Dollars 24bn, some 80 per cent of it with GM and the rest with outside customers. It employs 195,000 people worldwide and operates 195 manufacturing plants in 14 countries. GM's new global parts purchasing chief, Mr Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, has stirred fears of job losses in the components companies by threatening to buy only from the world's most efficient, low-cost, high-quality manufacturers. While seeking internal improvements, GM may be preparing to sell off some major components operations. It has made a start, putting its bearings business up for sale.</p>

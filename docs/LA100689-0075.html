			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAT ROBERTSON BID FOR MORE ELECTION FUNDS TURNED DOWN  </P> <P> Television evangelist Pat Robertson's 1988 campaign committee was turned down  Thursday in a bid for an additional $675,000 in federal matching funds to help  reimburse costs of his run for the Republican nomination for the presidency.  </P> <P> The Federal Election Commission rejected an appeal by Americans for Robertson,  which had resubmitted a request for matching funds that previously had been  denied.  </P> <P> The commission staff had denied the request after reviewing a sample of  contributions to be matched and determining they were not eligible for matching  funds.  </P> <P> In resubmitting its request, the Robertson committee asked the FEC to identify  the sample contributions that had been rejected.  </P> <P> The committee maintained that, by correcting the errors that had made these  contributions ineligible, it should be entitled to recover the value of its  original submission, about $689,000.  </P></p>

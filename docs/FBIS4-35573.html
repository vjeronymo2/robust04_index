			<p>BFN     [Text] An IDF [Israel Defense Forces] inquiry has  concluded that reserves soldier Shlomo Shitrit, who was killed  on the edge of the Gaza Strip earlier this week, was  accidentally shot by another soldier. Qol Yisra'el's military  reporter Karmela Menashe says that in contrast to initial  reports, soldiers did not come under terrorist fire and it  transpires there were irregularities in the way the troops acted.    Reserves soldiers serving on the border of the Gaza Strip  met  with the head of Army Southern Command, Major General Matan  Vilna'i, this week and complained of uncertainty about the new  situation and lack of equipment.</p>

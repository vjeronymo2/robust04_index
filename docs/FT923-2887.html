			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: EIS up 4% in hostile environment EIS GROUP, the specialist engineer, reported a 4 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the half year to June 30. Mr Peter Haslehurst, chief executive, said the rise in profits, from Pounds 7.06m to Pounds 7.34m, had taken place in the most hostile economic environment the group had faced in its 21 years of continuous profits growth. Turnover rose to Pounds 95.5m (Pounds 92.1m) with more than half generated from overseas activities. Increased profitability enabled the group to re-hire up to 25 per cent of the 200 employees it recently shed as part of a cost cutting exercise. The group continued to make use of the Pounds 18.3m raised in last year's rights issue, buying Fluidrive and Sime Industries, manufacturers of fluid couplings and industrial disc brakes, for Pounds 4.7m. Mr Haslehurst said: 'We will continue to make further acquisitions, although we are not in any rush to buy companies.' Capital expenditure is expected to remain at last year's high level of Pounds 6.9m. The interim dividend 3.225p (3.175p). Earnings per share fell from 14.211p to 13.062p.</p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: Credibility of unions revives THE Trades Union Congress has enjoyed a strong revival in its credibility, not least among its own member unions, during the pits crisis, according to senior TUC officials. Mr John Monks, the TUC's deputy general secretary, yesterday said recent events showed that 'if we did not exist we would have needed to be invented'. An immediate consequence is likely to be a clear recommendation for a 'yes' vote from the executive of the electricians' section of the AEEU craft union in next year's ballot on whether the merged union should be in the TUC. The electricians' union remains outside the TUC after disputes about poaching of members, but after its merger with the AEU engineering union, a TUC member, members of both unions are being balloted.</p>

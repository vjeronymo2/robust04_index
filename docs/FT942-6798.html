			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Japanese inflation subsides to 0.8% Japanese inflation sank again last month, falling to 0.8 per cent a year from 1.3 per cent in March. Meanwhile government forecasters admitted that they still could not see the bottom of the recession. The inflation figure is in line with market expectations, but adds fresh weight to fears that the economy is on the brink of deflation. The slowdown has continued into May, according to figures for Tokyo consumer prices, up 0.6 per cent this month, as against 0.8 per cent in April. A reduction in the rate of increase in home rents - a result of falling property values - was the main factor, said an agency official. This is the latest in a recent series of poor economic figures, which have caused official forecasters to soften earlier cautious suggestions that the worst was over. Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, yesterday maintained that 'the basis for movement for recovery is being prepared' but admitted he was still seeking proof that the bottom had been reached. Mr Yoshio Terasawa, director general of the government's economic planning agency, was even more cautious. 'As of now we can't see the bottom' and the economy remained in an 'extremely severe' state, he said. Gerard Baker adds: Japan was the world's largest creditor nation in 1993 for the third consecutive year, according to a report from the country's finance ministry. Net overseas assets grew for a 12th year, to reach Dollars 610.8bn at the end of 1993, up by 18.9 per cent on a year earlier.</p>

			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CONTRAS WILL DISBAND, SAYS ARCHBISHOP  </P> <P> Nicaragua's Contras agreed Friday to begin disbanding their troops in Honduras  by April 20, five days before a new civilian government is to take over in  Nicaragua.  </P> <P> Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, the archbishop of Managua, announced the  agreement after a seven-hour meeting with leaders of the Nicaraguan Resistance  and representatives of President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.  </P> <P> The communique said the U.S.-backed rebels agreed to demobilize the 10,000  fighters in bases in Yamales, Honduras, near the Nicaraguan border. It said the  3,000 guerrillas inside Nicaragua would move into security zones supervised by  Obando y Bravo and the United Nations.  </P> <P> Chamorro's conservative, pro-American coalition defeated the leftist  Sandinistas in the election, which was monitored by several thousand  international observers.  </P> <P> The communique said the rebels agreed to demobilize because the Feb. 25  elections had "established a process of democratization" in Nicaragua. It did  not mention when the disbanding would be completed.  </P> <P> The rebels called for an immediate cease-fire between the Sandinista armed  forces and the Contras inside Nicaragua to be supervised by the United Nations  and Obando y Bravo.  </P> <P> Chamorro's delegation to the talks agreed that the new administration would  provide pensions to Contra widows and orphans and to wounded rebel veterans in  "recognition of their patriotic labors." No details were immediately available.  </P> <P> The Chamorro administration also promised to "assure the rehabilitation and  social readaptation" of those affected by the war and to seek humanitarian and  medical aid for the duration of the demobilization.  </P> <P> Leaders of the rebels met with Obando y Bravo and Chamorro's representatives  had come to Honduras to persuade the rebels to disband before her April 25  inauguration.  </P> <P> "In Central America, the time has come for arms to be silenced to make way for  the search for a lasting regional peace," Obando y Bravo said before talks  began at Toncontin air base outside the capital.  </P> <P> "The size of the armies also should be reduced for the purpose of seeking  civilized solutions to the serious problems that afflict the great Central  American nation."  </P> <P> Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said he fully supports the agreement to  begin disbanding the Contras.  </P> <P> "As president of Nicaragua I fully support this accord. I believe it goes in  the direction of achieving peace and eliminating the war that has caused so  much suffering, so much harm to the Nicaraguan people," he told reporters at  the Managua airport, where he met representatives of the church and the new  government.  </P> <P> President Bush, who said the Contras must disband, has asked Congress to  approve a $300-million aid package for Nicaragua that includes $45 million to  demobilize and relocate the Contras and 42,000 relatives living in the base  camp in Yamales, Honduras.  </P> <P> The Chamorro delegation also agreed to set up a commission including  representatives of the new government and of the Contras to monitor  demobilization. The commission and humanitarian aid for the rebels and their  families were conditions the Contras set for demobilization at the outset of  Friday's talks.  </P> <P> The rebels went into the talks with a long list of demands, including several  -- such as the demobilization of the Sandinista army -- that would have  required the agreement of the Sandinistas. The Sandinistas were not represented  at the talks.  </P> <P> Other rebel demands that were not part of the agreement:  </P> <P> * The right to reclaim or receive compensation for property confiscated by the  Sandinista government.  </P> <P> * Rebel participation in the National Reconciliation Commission, a multi-sector  commission created under the Central American peace plan, and in a national  agency to manage funds for the demobilization.  </P> <P> * Tax exemptions for repatriated rebels for the first year of the new  government.  </P> <P> * A national referendum on modifying the structure of the armed forces  </P> <P> Israel Galeano, the rebels' top leader, led their five-member military  delegation. Three members of the rebels' political commission, led by Aristides  Sanchez, also participated.  </P> <P> Chamorro representatives included her chief negotiator, Antonio Lacayo, and  Emilio Alvarez, considered her closest adviser and a likely choice to be her  foreign minister.  </P></p>

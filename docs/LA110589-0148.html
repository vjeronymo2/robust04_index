			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LSU BEATS OLD MISS IN GAME THAT BENEFITS PARALYZED PLAYER  </P> <P> Tommy Hodson passed for three touchdowns and ran for another Saturday as  Louisiana State held off Mississippi, 35-30, in a Southeastern Conference game.  </P> <P> Hodson, LSU's all-time leading passer, passed for 381 yards as the Tigers  improved to 2-6. Ole Miss, playing before a record crowd of 42,354 at  Vaught-Hemingway Stadium, dropped to 6-3.  </P> <P> Tailback Eddie Fuller caught two of Hodson's touchdown passes, a 46-yard,  first-quarter bomb to open the scoring and a 13-yarder in the second quarter.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, fans at Saturday's game donated more than the expected $50,000 for a  health-care plan for Ole Miss player Roy Lee (Chuckie) Mullins, who was  paralyzed during a game last week. Final figures were not immediately  available.  </P> <P> "We will go well beyond our minimum goal," Ole Miss Chancellor Gerald Turner  said.  </P> <P> The reserve defensive back was injured on Oct. 28 when he tackled a Vanderbilt  receiver while breaking up a pass play. Mullins fractured the third, fourth,  fifth and sixth vertebrae in his neck when he took a blow on the top of his  head.  </P> <P> Ole Miss has set up a trust fund to help provide lifetime care for Mullins, and  one student collected at least $17,000 on her trip through the record 42,354  fans, and $19,000 was collected in a sky box.  </P> <P> "The best thing about this is the united effort of people from all  backgrounds," said Turner, who also predicted the fund-raiser would exceed the  $150,000 needed to set up a "significant endowment fund" for Mullins.  </P> <P> LSU officials donated money and other universities said they would send money  for what he called a long-term recovery effort for the injured athlete.  </P> <P> Mullins reportedly had been able to sit up and listen to part of the game on  radio.  </P></p>

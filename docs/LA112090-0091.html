			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'A PINCH OF PINTER' AT ROSE THEATRE  </P> <P> Harold Pinter is a playwright who fiddles with words but in "A Pinch of Pinter  with a Twist" at the Rose Theatre, the actors don't use his words. They are  members of a new group of deaf actors, using American Sign Language.  </P> <P> Pinter survives beautifully and, surprisingly, so do his famous pauses.  </P> <P> Directed by Leslie Byrne, the production is a good chance to see some of  Pinter's unfortunately obscure "cabaret pieces."  </P> <P> The winner of the pair is "Night," an oblique and often funny conversation in  which a couple tries to remember the foggy details of their first meeting. It  features compelling performances by Charles (C. J.) Jones as the Man, and Vae  as the Woman.  </P> <P> More interesting textually is the longer "Silence," but it's less effective  because Lilly Benedict as the girl straddling a romantic fence, and Donald  Lyons as her older, gentler lover, don't have a firm grasp on their  characterizations. Ken Elks is the only one to have evolved a full persona.  T.H. McCULLOH  </P></p>

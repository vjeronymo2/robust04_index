			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Business and the Environment: Everyone's losing their marbles - Haig Simonian describes the furore surrounding one of the world's most famous quarries In the marble quarries high above Carrara in Tuscany, where Michelangelo chose the slabs for his future masterpieces, an almighty row has broken out. Like hundreds of other squabbles between industry and environmentalists, it has driven a wedge between those concerned about pollution and the landscape and others more preoccupied with profits and peoples' livelihoods. But the battle between the marble quarriers of Carrara, on whom the town's economy largely depends, and the local council, supported by the Tuscan regional administration, cuts much deeper than the gashes in the mountains from which marble has been extracted over the centuries and which are now at the heart of the rumpus. Under plans to develop the local Apuan park, the name for the area which covers the mountains above Carrara and embraces most of the quarries, industrialists fear their businesses are at risk. Three high-altitude quarries have already closed owing to the enforcement of rules banning excavation above 1,200 metres. More could follow, they warn. For many locals, not just in the marble business, the quarries, sawmills and associated processing facilities which dominate the landscape are more intrinisic to Carrara, its history and surroundings, than any attempts to set up an industry-free zone in the hills. But for others, the park represents the first serious attempt by the authorities to check the unbridled expansion of the quarries since their origins. The business of quarrying the lightly grained white stone, for which Carrara is famous, has certainly left its mark. From a distance, especially in winter, visitors regularly mistake the huge white gashes along the local stretch of the Appenines, for snow. Only when they approach on roads like the narrow, twisty lane which leads up to the village of Colonnata above Carrara, do they realise that what they are seeing are vast white slices gorged out of the face of the rock. Elsewhere, the quarrying is less immediately striking, as at the disused workings which litter the area. Often, they are all that is left of centuries of labour cutting hundreds of feet into the mountain, only to be abandoned when a vein has run out, or the stone has become too difficult to extract commercially. All around are piles of debris, testifying to the fact that often less than 10 per cent of the stone extracted is suitable for sale. For Simonetta Cattani Lazzareschi, head of the Carrara Industrialists' Association, the quarries are a thing of beauty. 'Look,' she says, pointing to the workings above the churchyard at Colonnata, 'have you ever seen anything so splendid?' Lazzareschi, the only woman to head an Industrialists' Association in Italy, is not a lady to be crossed in a hurry. Her strong features betray the traits of the Greek and Arab craftsmen who, she says, were first brought into the region by the Romans to work the stone. Perceptions of beauty are somewhat different at Carrara town hall, where Alberto Pincione is mayor. The marble-cladding of the modern, two-storey building highlights the trade's importance for the town, especially now that so much of the heavy public-sector industry brought into the area by Mussolini in the late 1920s has closed down, leaving 6,000 unemployed. 'No one wants to close the quarries,' he says. 'But they have to observe the rules on protecting the landscape and maintaining safety standards'. Both are touchy subjects within the left-leaning council, dominated until recently by the Communist Party. 'There have been 44 deaths in the quarries since 1977, and almost as many serious injuries,' says Vittorio Prayer, a local journalist. His fingers quickly find the page in a specialised medical magazine on industrial injuries showing a gruesome colour photograph of a huge marble block, one side spattered with blood. The quarrel now raging over the implications of the park is as complex as might be expected in a one-industry town, where the trade is dominated by a handful of aggressively independent entrepreneurial families which have, until recently, been left largely to themselves. The quarriers claim the park, first mooted in 1975, poses a more serious threat to their livelihoods than even the depression of the late 1920s, which prompted Mussolini to develop many of the now defunct alternative sources of employment in the region. Since then, the number of people working in the quarries has fallen as new technology has replaced manual labour and the highly fragmented quarries have been rationalised into the hands of relatively few families and big companies. Only about 1,900 people now work in quarrying, compared with around 14,000 at the beginning of the century. However, Lazzareschi reckons about 1,000 jobs hang on every one occupied in the mountains. The valleys and plain below the city echo to the repetitive grinding of hundreds of sawmills operating around the clock to cut huge blocks of marble into thin slices for cladding skyscrapers, making table tops and even gravestones. Around a quarter of the world's stone cutting facilites are in Carrara, according to the Industrialists' Association. The quarry owners fear that if the park one day receives national, rather than regional, status, all quarrying will have to stop. 'The rules governing national parks in Italy prohibit excavation,' says Lazzareschi. 'Given the poor financial state of the Tuscany region, the authorities are bound to try to shift the burden for the park to the state. That means we would close.' The demise of quarrying would also threaten the substantial tourist business which has developed in its wake. The quarries and exposed peaks may not be aesthetically appealing to all, but they are often breathtaking and stand as historical monuments in their own right. 'Closure is crazy. It would put us all out of business,' says Vannucci Venanzio, the owner of a small restaurant in Colonnata that lives off the marble and tourist trades. But according to Pincione: 'No one is talking about closing anything. But do you really call what has been done to the hillsides beautiful? It wouldn't be allowed elsewhere in Europe.' Under present rules, the quarry-owners have almost free rein over their sites, for which they pay a token rent, under concessions dating back to 1751. The council, which will this year make around L4.2bn (Pounds 2m) from a special tax on the amount of stone quarried, sees its role in enforcing the environmental and safety rules which have been introduced since the 1980s but not always observed. 'Theoretically, the quarries should follow precise rules on how they cut into a hillside, not to change its shape without permission. And there should be regulations on cleaning up afterwards,' says Prayer. The briefest visit to the region demonstrates otherwise. The park, which advanced one step further last month with the appointment of a new management board, has now become the focal point for the wider dispute over future regulation. Although not yet a threat, its creation and the likely rise in bureaucracy it will entail could obstruct the quarries' expansion, particularly as new stone-cutting technology has accelerated the rate of excavation. Meawnhile, the underlying issue of exerting control over an industry which is of immense economic and cultural importance to the region but which may have grown accustomed to being left to itself in the past, remains unresolved. 'Environmental legislation has increased steadily,' says one resident, who has followed the growing conflict closely. 'And rules now cover every part of the business, including the sawmills, which pollute local rivers with marble powder and other chemicals for treating and polishing stone.' Behind the fighting talk on both sides, there is undoubtedly room for compromise. It is almost inconceivable that anyone on Carrara's council would dream of closing the quarries, on which the town so heavily relies. Nor are the quarry owners quite the shameless exploiters some of their critics claim. But so far, their positions have not met.</p>

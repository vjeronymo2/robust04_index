			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> LUCK SIDES AGAIN WITH MARYLAND, 23-20;  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL: FIELD GOAL IN THE FINAL MINUTE LIFTS TERRAPINS TO 23-20  VICTORY OVER DUKE.  </P> <P> It is still too early to say what fate ultimately will be in store for the  Maryland Terrapins this season, but 1990 already might be regarded as a turning  point for the football program.  </P> <P> There was evidence of that Saturday at Wallace Wade Stadium, when a 20-yard Dan  DeArmas field goal with 50 seconds remaining provided the winning points in  Maryland's 23-20 triumph over Duke. The 38-yard, seven-play drive that led to  the kick was set up by a magnificent defensive stand -- plus a little bit of  the luck that had gone against the Terrapins in recent seasons.  </P> <P> "We've worked too hard and come too far -- for the seniors it's been some hard  times," said senior linebacker Scott Whittier. "We've tried to put those things  behind us but we remember. We've come too far to lose a game like this one.  This win came from all we've been through."  </P> <P> Maryland (5-3, 3-2 in the Atlantic Coast Conference) made a number of big  plays, including a 29-yard touchdown pass from Scott Zolak to Barry Johnson and  a 19-yard end around scoring run by flanker Gene Thomas.  </P> <P> Defensively the Terrapins got six sacks -- three by linebacker Jack Bradford,  who had six other tackles and recovered a fumble. Whittier contributed 14  stops.  </P> <P> Even so, when the Blue Devils (3-4, 0-3) -- who had scored touchdowns on two of  the their previous three possessions to tie the game at 20 -- took over with  7:06 remaining, Maryland appeared to be in trouble.  </P> <P> Duke quarterback Billy Ray riddled the Maryland secondary throughout the second  half. And when Maryland made the adjustment at the start of the crucial series,  the Blue Devils ran four straight times to gain 25 yards to the Duke 36-yard  line.  </P> <P> On first down, Ray was pressured by defensive tackle Larry Webster and  scrambled for a one-yard gain. On the next play, the snap from center Stewart  Albright somehow trickled through Ray's legs and rolled 10 yards backward  before the quarterback fell on it.  </P> <P> "I don't have an answer for that one," said Maryland Coach Joe Krivak. "There  are a lot of things you can look at, a fumble, a turnover ... in a close game  there are eight to 10 different situations that can go for or against you."  </P> <P> But by now the game had taken on an eerie tone, reminiscent of Maryland's 13-12  victory over North Carolina State. That win came on a 25-yard DeArmas field  goal with 11 seconds remaining -- after a fumble by Wolfpack running back  Aubrey Shaw.  </P> <P> Albright and Ray got their act together on third down but Bradford made his  third sack, dropping Ray for an 11-yard loss. Maryland got another break when  Randy Gardner's punt traveled only 26 yards, with Mike Hopson downing the ball  at the Duke 42.  </P> <P> Maryland took over with 3:23 remaining. A run by Troy Jackson gained four  yards; on second down, Zolak rolled out to the left and threw to Jackson,  standing alone in the right flat. The 17-yard gain moved the ball down to the  Duke 21. On first down, Andre Vaughn gained two yards, but the Blue Devils were  penalized for having 12 men on the field.  </P> <P> The walkoff put the ball on the 9. Vaughn carried for one yard and Jackson for  four. A third-down run failed, setting the stage for DeArmas, who after a Duke  timeout booted his second game-winner. It was Maryland's fourth victory that  was decided in the final three minutes of play.  </P> <P> Although players and coaches on both sides called it ugly, the game was a  strategist's delight.  </P> <P> Duke's Randy Jones and Leroy Gallman each had returned kickoffs for touchdowns  this season and Maryland had yielded an uncomfortable 28 yards per return, so  Krivak decided to have Fred Ensign squib every kickoff.  </P> <P> However, following DeArmas's field goal, Ensign kicked to Gallman -- "the  lesser of two evils," said Krivak -- and the coverage team stopped him at the  18.  </P> <P> From there, Maryland put the pressure on Ray, with Webster getting a first-down  sack. That pressure had come in part because defensive line coach Dennis Murphy  had freed the junior from his normal duties.  </P> <P> "He told me not to worry about responsibilities, just get pressure on the  quarterback," Webster said. "I had to double check; I asked him if I could go  anywhere I wanted to and he said yeah, just get the quarterback."  </P></p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cargill's Indian salt plan arouses bitterness - Local producers do not relish multinational competition ON MAY 17, thousands of activists, politicians, trade unionists and salt farmers will brave the scorching sun and march to a piece of flat marshy land in Kandla port, on the west coast of India's Gujarat state, to protest against the government's decision to allow Cargill, the giant US multinational, to set up a salt manufacturing unit there. Encouraged by India's new economic liberalisation programme, Cargill Southeast Asia obtained an approval from the government's Foreign Investment Promotion Board last August to set up a 100 per cent export-oriented unit to produce 1m tonnes of high-quality sun-dried or solar industrial salt a year. Cargill, the US-based multinational company, produces 5m tonnes of salt a year at its plants in Western Australia and San Francisco. But with Australia and Mexico expected to be unable to satisfy future world demand the company is seeking extra production capacity. Cargill has also been given permission to build a Dollars 25m loading jetty, capable of loading 10,000 tonnes of salt a day, compared with loading capacity of 1,000 to 2,000 tonnes a day at other Gujarat docks. The multinational's first obstacle was the strident objection to the project by the Kandla Port Trust authorities, after experts had expressed concern that salt farming and the operation of a private jetty would compound the heavy silting problem that the port faced, posing a serious threat to the functioning of the port. Despite the Gujarat state government's objections, the surface transport ministry in Delhi insisted on allotting the land to Cargill; the government even considered amending the Major Port Trusts Act of 1963, which forbids the construction of private jetties in port areas, to clear the way for the Cargill project. The island of Satsaida Bet, created by a system of interconnected creeks, is perfect for the setting up of salt pans, but the silting could cause major technical and ecological problems. Earlier proposals from local salt manufacturers to convert the area into salt pans have been rejected on the ground that the port's master plan recommends that no commercial activity be allowed on the island to conserve the hydrographic features needed for a proposed Rs100m (Dollars 3.2m) tidal power project. The Kutch Small Scale Manufacturers' Association, which is worried that the advent of international competition will adversely affect its members (the Gujarat-Kutch belt accounts for 80 per cent of the country's salt production), has filed a case against Cargill Southeast Asia in the Kutch civil court. They are supported by Mr George Fernandes, MP, who as minister for industry, evicted US multinationals Coca Cola and IBM from India in 1977. Mr Fernandes, a staunch socialist, accuses Cargill of being 'all set to take over Kandla Port as its own private enterprise.' He points out that India produces enough salt (14m tonnes) to meet its own domestic needs and has a large export surplus that Cargill is free to market if it wishes. He argues that Cargill's claim that it will provide employment to 2,000 local people is spurious, considering the company, by its own admission, uses only 50 people to harvest double the amount of salt at its Australian plant. 'Allowing Cargill's proposal in Kandla implies exposing Kandla port to foreign surveillance and jeopardising national security, reducing the income of the port, preventing expansion of the port, and creating mass unemployment in the region,' says Mr Fernandes. The MP, who is supported by state government officials in Gujarat, and even MPs from the ruling Congress (I) party, whose decision it was to grant permission to Cargill, compares the May 17 agitation to Mahatma Gandhi's historic salt march agitation in the same region more than 50 years ago, which led to India's independence from British rule. Cargill, in its court affidavit, has blamed vested interests for the problems and charged that the salt manufacturers have dragged the case to court 'with an ulterior motive to establish their monopoly in the salt-manufacturing business'. The company, with world-wide sales of Dollars 50bn, has refuted allegations that its project is a threat to India's security, and has submitted that the Indian government has already examined the economic and environmental impact of the project before approving it. The 127-year-old company, which, with its various subsidiaries, employs 66,000 people in more than 800 companies in 54 countries, says that it is committed to developing countries, and has planned the entire Kutch project 'to generate the maximum possible employment to this backward area for its development'. And there would be more investments in future - Cargill is looking to the Indian markets for further investment up to Dollars 50m, and has already submitted a proposal to the Indian government for a Dollars 25m citric acid plant. But Cargill's Indian plans will have to wait until the courts decide what is best for India.</p>

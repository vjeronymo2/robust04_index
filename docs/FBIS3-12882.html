And Lieutenant  General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential  Council, spoke for the second time about his willingness to step  down if this is going to serve Yemen, its unity, and its  democracy.    Sources in Sanaa have said that Vice President 'Ali Salim  al-Bid, secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party,  vehemently attacked President 'Ali Salih before the Yemeni  Political Forces Dialogue Committee, with which he met the day  before yesterday in Aden. The sources said that al-Bid accused  'Ali Salih of "planning the military incidents witnessed  recently in Abyan Governorate in the south of the country and in  the Harf Sufyan area." He also said that "'Ali 'Abdallah Salih  was happy with the offensive launched against some refugees in  the Harf Sufyan area and with the treacherous ambush set up in  Abyan by the al-'Amaliqah Brigade against a small battalion from  al-Wahdah Brigade."    Addressing members of the Dialogue Committee, al-Bid said:  "I  fear that we might lose control. I stopped an integrated  military force which was on its way to hit and discipline  al-'Amaliqah Brigade. And the central security camp in Aden is  under siege, but we are not going to kill them in retaliation  for what 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih did in Abyan and Harf Sufyan."    In his meeting with the Dialogue Committee, al-Bid proposed  that Deputy Prime Minister Brigadier Mujahid Abu-Shawarib assume  all military powers as regards the Armed Forces, in order to  ease the severity of the military tension and return matters to  their previous status. al-Bid asked Brig. Abu-Shawarib to  contact President 'Ali Salih during the meeting to obtain  permission to do so.    The sources emphasized that Brig. Abu-Shawarib did indeed  contact the president and later told the meeting that 'Ali Salih  had refused to give him the authorization. He told him: "How  can we breach the authorization document given to the  Yemeni-Jordanian-Omani military committee, when its ink has not  dried yet? Such talk represents a contradiction in positions,  and I do not believe that you would accept that, nor do I  believe that it is honorable for us as leadership to do it." So  al-Bid said: "Did I not tell you that his intentions are not  sincere," pointing out that he knows well the GPC's military  strength. And that he knows how many troops that force includes  from the GPC, the Reform Grouping, and the Nasirites. He added:  "So we believe that our position is the strongest. But our  characteristic is that we examine the situation before making a  decision."    Concluding, al-Bid said that the al-'Amaliqah forces in  Abyan  "attacked the party's offices and militias -- actions which  explode the situation." He renewed his warning about losing  control of the military situation if such actions continue.    In Aden, sources close to the Political Forces Dialogue  Committee, which convened in the southern governorate of Abyan  in the evening of the day before yesterday, said that "the  committee's members failed to stop the deterioration in the  situation in Abyan -- the deterioration which began on 21  March."

			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MIRA COSTA SOUNDLY DEFEATS CHATSWORTH  </P> <P> The Mira Costa High girls' volleyball team gave each member of the Chatsworth  team a yellow carnation before Tuesday night's Division I first-round state  playoff game.  </P> <P> Then Mira Costa (25-0) gave Chatsworth a sound beating, as the Chancellors  fell, 15-5, 15-1, 15-10, at Mira Costa.  </P> <P> Chatsworth, the City Section 4-A runner-up to Palisades, ended its season 14-4.  Mira Costa, the nation's No. 1 ranked team and the Southern Section 5-A  champion, advanced to the second round, where it will meet Torrey Pines on  Saturday night.  </P> <P> "We obviously are not at that level," Chatsworth Coach Steve Berk said. "But we  had some nice plays and we got 10 points off them in the third game; it was a  good way to get ready for next year."  </P> <P> In the last game, Chatsworth took a 7-2 lead. Junior hitter Heather Gorman, who  had five kills, teamed with Kelly Scott to block a Kristal Attwood spike,  giving Chatsworth its fifth consecutive point and the five-point lead.  </P> <P> But then Mira Costa scored eight unanswered points, including three service  aces by Cindy De Garceau, to take control.  </P> <P> Chatsworth scored two more points in the game on Mira Costa errors, but it was  not enough.  </P> <P> The first two games took only 25 minutes to play. In the first game, Chatsworth  only managed six sideouts.  </P> <P> All-American setter Piper Hahn led Mira Costa with 24 assists. Attwood had  eight kills.  </P></p>

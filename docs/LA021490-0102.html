			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MATTEL'S 1989 PROFIT ALMOST DOUBLES; 4TH QUARTER SLIPS  </P> <P> Barbie, He-Man and Hot Wheels racing cars led giant toy maker Mattel Inc. to  income of almost $70 million in 1989, although a one-time charge of $11 million  cut into the fourth quarter, Mattel's chairman said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The Hawthorne-based company reported 1989 earnings of $68.7 million, almost  double the $35.9 million reported in 1988.  </P> <P> However, the $9.7 million in earnings during the fourth quarter dropped from  $10.5 million reported in 1988.  </P> <P> In December, Mattel called for redemption of a subordinated debt, which  resulted in a one-time charge of $11 million to 1989 earnings. The redemption  will result in annual interest savings in 1990 of $8.8 million, said Johm W.  Amerman, Mattel's chairman.  </P> <P> Amerman said the company's long-established products, its presence in the  international market and its manufacturing networks contributed to increased  sales for 1989.  </P> <P> Amerman said its 30-year-old legend, Barbie doll, and He-Man, Hot Wheels racing  cars, Disney toys and Li'l Miss Dolls "are our core business products that  endure over the years."  </P></p>

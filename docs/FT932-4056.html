			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Italy promises to change rules for foreign brokers THE Italian government has promised to change stock exchange rules which force foreign stockbrokers to set up special offices in Italy, following pressure from the European Commission. The Commission has decided to give Rome until October 31 to submit proof that the changes are under way, or face action in the European Court of Justice. If the rules have not been changed by January 15, 1994, court action will be triggered automatically - three years after the first formal letter of complaint from the Commission. The UK government formally complained to Brussels about the new SIMs law - named after the Societa di Intermediazione Mobiliare, the new type of securities house it created - in September 1991, arguing that it was an unacceptable barrier to freedom of establishment and free provision of services in the Community. An Italian diplomat in Brussels said yesterday the government would probably issue a formal decree, which could change the rules this autumn. The British Merchant Banking and Securities Houses Association welcomed the news and said changes in the Italian legislation had been widely expected following the adoption of EC directives liberalising securities trading earlier this year. 'People have got more relaxed recently and their worst fears about prosecution (in Italy) or unenforceable bargains had gone away,' said a spokeswoman. The rules cover equity trading on the domestic market and the sale of securities of any type to Italian investors other than SIMs or banks. Most large EC-based investment banks have centralised European trading operations in financial centres outside Italy, and were worried about the cost of setting up elsewhere. Bankers feared that the Commission's tough line against the Italian law would be relaxed when Sir Leon Brittan was replaced as EC financial services commissioner by an Italian, Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, in January. In fact, Mr Vanni d'Archirafi - a former Italian ambassador to Madrid and Bonn - has managed to find an appropriately diplomatic solution to the problem, aimed at producing a result before the formal implementation of EC directives which will allow EC-based stockbrokers to do business anywhere in the Community. The Commission has argued throughout the negotiations that securities houses have the right to set up in Italy using the legal form of their choice, and even to provide broking services from other member states.</p>

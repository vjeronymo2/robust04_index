			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Prime Minister brother 'Abd-al-Wahhab  al-Anisi has reaffirmed that the war, which was triggered by the  gang of apostasy and secession in the Yemeni Socialist Party  leadership, is between the Yemeni people and a mutinous group  violating the constitutional legitimacy.    Referring to the concern of the brothers and friends, as  well  as their calls for halting the fighting, he wondered: On what  basis do they call for a cease-fire, and what are the guarantees  that the rebels would resort to the constitutional legitimacy  and its institutions, which were established as a result of the  general elections that were held on 27 April 1993 and that were  (?defined) by everybody.    The deputy prime minister reiterated our country's rejection  of any interference in its domestic affairs by the Security  Council or any other side, stressing that what is taking place  in the Republic of Yemen is an internal affair. He also voiced  his surprise at some brothers' insistence on the need for the  Security Council to issue a resolution on a cease-fire, although  they know that the issue belongs to the Yemeni people alone.  Such a resolution, he added, will lead to more fighting, which  is sought by those who want such a resolution.    This came during a news conference he gave at the Prime  Ministry today. Several representatives of local, Arab, and  international television networks, radio stations, and press in  Sanaa attended. It was also attended by 'Abd-al-Rahman Zaydan,  director of the prime minister's office, and [name indistinct],  under secretary of the Ministry of Information.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Kryuchkov and Gennadiy Dernovoy, </F> leading specialists at the Institute of High Energy Physics,  under ``Sensation!'' rubric: ``Explosive Idea, But There Will  Be No Disaster'']    [Text] Protvino, Moscow Oblast -- The Chernobyl disaster  bluntly raised the question: Should we have nuclear power or  not? These worries are understandable. An accident whose  probability is assessed as ``one incident in 10,000 years''  occurred at the initial phase of the mass operation of powerful  nuclear reactors. Should we be surprised at the demonstrations  by ``greens'' at AES [nuclear electric power station] units in  operation, and the bans and all kinds of restrictions which have  swept across the whole world? However, it is easier to impose a  ban than to build a safe AES. Scientists from many countries  have continued to struggle over the problem. These include  employees of our High Energy Physics Institute. And today we  can say: A safe method of producing nuclear power has been  found.    For those who have forgotten their school physics course, we  will remind you: A conventional nuclear reactor works on the  principle of a self-propagating chain reaction. The operating  regime has been selected to ensure that the number of neutrons  is constant all the time and is strictly monitored. The balance  is utterly precise, otherwise an explosion would ensue.  However, even the most complex multiple backup systems for  monitoring and automatic protection control only reduce the risk  of an accident.    But we have elaborated a fundamentally different method of  producing nuclear energy which rules out the very possibility of  a disaster. The essence of it is that the subcritical reactor  -- that is, one that is not operating of its own accord -- is  illuminated by a beam of particles dispersed in an accelerator.  Splitting the nuclei they meet in their path, they generate a  powerful, rapidly expanding cascade of secondary particles.  These in their turn split a large number of target nuclei.  There takes place a complex multistage process of the birth and  capture of the gradually decelerating particles, at the end of  which the division of the nuclei occurs, as in a conventional  reactor, accompanied by the release of an enormous quantity of  energy. In other words, the process only operates when the  accelerator is working.    The idea of the new energy producing system is attractive  not  just because it means that repetitions of disasters on the scale  of Chernobyl are impossible. The likelihood of smaller  accidents at AES's, caused by a leakage of the cooling agent in  the active zone, is also decreased. Special requirements for  the construction materials in the subcritical reactors also  enhances its [as published] safety. Furthermore, nonenriched  uranium can be used in them, which decreases both the cost of  the energy obtained and the risk of the uncontrolled use of  enriched uranium. We should add that the subcritical reactor  produces not only energy but also the additional nuclear fuel by  which it operates.    We have spoken several times about our discovery in  scientific publications. Announcements have been made in the  open press too. And suddenly there are ``sensational reports''  that in Switzerland the physicist Carlo Rubia has developed a  new ``direction in nuclear power engineering.'' As it turned  out, the essence of this direction coincides with what we have  described. Truly, there is no prophet in his own land.  However, we are prepared to argue about who should bear the  palm. But for us, something else is far more important at the  moment: Why has a safe reactor not yet been built? The answer  is simple: There is no money. All the research on this topic  in our institute has been done by a group of specialists on the  basis of enthusiasm alone. The money allocated is not even  enough to operate the unique accelerator. It is standing idle,  while the construction of an accelerator-accumulator complex has  essentially been frozen. The following question begs to be  asked: What is more advantageous -- to find money to build safe  AES's today, or to seek out money tomorrow to eliminate new  Chernobyls?</p>

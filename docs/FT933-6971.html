			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Crime claims anger Czechs A CZECH police chief yesterday denied his country had become 'a breeding ground for organised crime' and said it faced the same problems as other European countries in fighting drugs trafficking, the illegal arms trade, and other crime. Mr Josef Doucha, deputy director of the Czech central criminal police, angrily rejected press reports suggesting Prague had become a centre for international criminal groups after the collapse of communism. There had been no 'sudden eruption of crime', though the Czech capital's geographical position put it in the middle of new east-west crime routes, he told CTK, the Czech news agency. Drug smuggling had grown because the Balkan drug route from Afghanistan and Pakistan through Turkey and the Balkans and into western Europe had been disrupted by war in the former Yugoslavia. As a result the Czech Republic had become a transit route for drugs. The illegal arms trade was also worrying. The Czech Republic produced good weapons and there were large quantities of old Semtex explosive - manufactured before last year's requirement that it be made easily detectable - in circulation. But Czech police lacked resources and experience in fighting organised crime.</p>

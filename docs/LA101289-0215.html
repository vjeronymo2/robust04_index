			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> CHASTITY, NOT CONDOMS, ADVISED  </P> <P> The U.S. Roman Catholic Church should drop its qualified support for teaching  about condoms in public schools as a way of preventing AIDS, and should urge  that youngsters be taught chastity instead, a committee of bishops said today.  </P> <P> "There is no such thing as safe, or safer, sex. That's an illusion," said  Archbishop Roger Mahony of Los Angeles, chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee on the  HIV Statement. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS.  </P> <P> The committee's draft statement revises an earlier document released by the  church's 50-member Administrative Board in December, 1987, which said the  church could tolerate public schools' providing information about condoms as  long as sexual abstinence outside of marriage was presented as the "only  morally correct and medically sure way" to prevent AIDS.  </P></p>

			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Valuing the environment PUTTING VALUES on the environment tends to be controversial. Many non-economists find it offensive, feeling that clean air and water, rainforests and whales are priceless. This position is absurd. The exercise of working out what we are prepared to pay or forego to preserve the environment is necessary. It is necessary if public debate is to be informed. It is necessary if governments are to weigh up the cost of cleaning up the environment against the benefits. It is also necessary if economically efficient policies are to be adopted. What is more, attributing values often helps rather than hinders the environmental cause. Discharging pollution into the atmosphere or the oceans often appears free, for example, because there is no market in these 'goods'. They are 'externalities', consequences not taken into account by decision makers. As a result, environmental resources tend to be overused, which is why environmentalists should welcome serious attempts at costing the earth. Misleading terminology has been responsible for much opposition to environmental valuation. The exercise is one of putting values on people's preferences for preserving the environment, not searching for values intrinsic to the natural world itself. People's desire The value of protecting the environment can be derived partly from the use people actually make of resources and the damage that, say, global warming would do to crop yields. The valuation is also likely to include an 'existence' portion, which represents people's desire for the trees or the whales to be there, even if they do not make direct use of them. Preservation of the Grand Canyon ranks high in US studies of such preferences, for example, even though many citizens never visit it. An 'option' value for the potential use of some resources may also be included: people hope that tropical jungles may eventually yield new medicines. The derivation of such values is inevitably rough and ready. It is far better, however, to be roughly right, by making these calculations, than precisely wrong, by ignoring the need to do so. The OECD reported last year that governments of its member countries were increasingly using such techniques in policymaking. But with the exception of the US's Environmental Protection Agency, adoption of such analysis has been patchy and tentative. OECD reports detect a 'credibility problem' and attribute it to two unsolved controversies. The first is how future costs and benefits should be discounted because they do not occur for many years. Future generations Many environmentalists oppose the notion of discounting, on the grounds that it under-represents the interests of future generations who must, for example, pay for decommissioning nuclear power stations. But that argument ignores the opportunity cost of the investment, which could be spent on research, education or infrastructure - a clean environment is only one of many benefits handed on to future generations. Present modes of analysis also do not take adequate account of uncertainty. Scientists disagree, for example, about the likelihood and the extent of global warming. Nor do these methods reflect people's tolerance for higher risks where they have some control, such as driving a car, than where they have none, such as from a nuclear power station. Those points need clearer treatment. So do even more ambitious plans for environmental valuation, such as bringing 'green' values into the national accounts to reflect gains or losses to a country's 'environmental capital'. Despite those unsettled questions, economic analysis can help clarify which policies should be followed. Economic instruments, such as taxes and permits for pollution, can then bring the costs of cleaning up the environment into the open, whereas regulation tends to leave them hidden. But neither solves the political problem of enforcing the best policies if they prove unpopular  -as the energy taxes proposed by the US, UK and European Community are proving. If the analysis is carried out systematically, however, governments cannot claim ignorance of what they are sacrificing. This is the third of a series of leaders on environmental issues</p>

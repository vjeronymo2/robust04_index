			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Poland sets date for Dollars 12bn debt talks POLAND said yesterday it would start talks on restructuring its Dollars 12.1bn (Pounds 8bn) commercial debt with western bank creditors in Vienna on February 11, writes Christopher Bobinski from Warsaw. The Polish team will be led by Mr Krzysztof Krowacki, the new chief debt negotiator who last week stunned western banks with an announcement that servicing of a Dollars 1.1bn trade facility extended in 1983 would be cut to 20 per cent of the interest due this year. The Vienna meeting will cover this loan as well as commercial debts worth Dollars 8.3bn which have not been serviced since autumn 1989 and the Dollars 2.7bn-worth of interest on the loans which has gone unpaid since then.</p>

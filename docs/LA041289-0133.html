			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> 3 DEAD SEA LIONS ON SUNSET BEACH  </P> <P> Three dead sea lions washed ashore at Sunset Beach this morning, and a federal  official said they probably had been trapped in fishing nets at sea.  </P> <P> The sea lion carcasses were discovered between 10th and 11th streets at Pacific  Coast Highway.  </P> <P> "The sea lions probably died after being trapped in gill nets" of commercial  fishermen, said Joe Cardaro, a wildlife biologist with the National Marine  Fisheries Service in Los Angeles. "About 99% of the sea lion deaths in January  and February were because of fishing nets." In those months, the National  Marine Fisheries Service counted about 50 dead sea lions in the area of Seal  Beach, Sunset Beach and Huntington Beach.  </P></p>

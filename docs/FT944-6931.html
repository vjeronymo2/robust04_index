			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Books: Pre-war village fantasy THE MORTMERE STORIES by Christopher Isherwood and Edward Upward Enitharmon Pounds 7.99, 206 pages AN UNMENTIONABLE MAN by Edward Upward Enitharmon Pounds 5.99, 102 pages JOURNEY TO THE BORDER by Edward Upward Enitharmon Pounds 5.99, 135 pages Edward Upward, alert and active at the age of 91, was in London recently. He and his wife attended a reception at the British Library given to honour the publication of these three books. The library has an Upward archive from which a selection of manuscripts was on show. These included the Mortmere stories begun by Upward and his friend Christopher Isherwood when they were Cambridge undergraduates in the 1920s. In his autobiographical Lions and Shadows, Isherwood described how they invented the sleepy English village of Mortmere, peopled with eccentric local characters whose activities were chronicled in a style that was a cross between Conan Doyle and surrealist fantasy. Mortmere summed up the charming, well-bred complacency and eccentricity of pre-war England. Up to now the tales were considered too private to be published, but at last curiosity has been satisfied and we have the texts of the surviving manuscripts, edited by Katherine Bucknall. The bulk of them are by Isherwood. The humour is often lavatorial, but the writing is brilliantly readable in the hilarious manner of the young pre-Buddhist, pre-Californian I-Am-a-Camera Christopher. After Cambridge, Upward became a schoolmaster and a member of the British Communist Party, from which he resigned in 1948. He was housemaster and head of English at Alleyn's School, Dulwich, from 1931 to 1961. After retirement he went to live on the Isle of Wight where he resumed his earlier career of novelist. His first book, Journey to the Border, was published by the Woolfs in 1938. It now appears in a revised edition. A tutor goes with his pupil and employer to a race meeting at a Mortmere-ish country town. While entering a crowded marquee he has a vision of the future. More than half a century has done nothing to diminish the work's sense of foreboding. Gentlemanly tweed-suited English racegoers become a gathering of militant fascists. A long speech by an apologist for obeying natural instinct parodies Auden's early guru, Homer Lane. Much of it seems as relevant now as then. Upward's major work, The Spiral Ascent, a trilogy written over two decades and published in one-volume in 1977, describes the fortunes of a poet and schoolmaster who is a committed Marxist. It is a view of intellectual life from Upward's left-wing stance that is both calmly detached and highly personal; so too is the sequence of stories now published for the first time in An Unmentionable Man. The man is an elderly English writer whose name is never mentioned because he believes we are witnessing the death-throes of capitalist society. He has been mugged, and while his wife awaits his return to consciousness he has nightmares described with marvellous clarity in which his credo comes under attack. As a writer of English prose Upward belongs to the school of Swift and Orwell. Now that I have read again these remarkable books I feel that Upward's work is going to be mentioned more and more frequently by discerning judges of 20th century literature in the years to come.</p>

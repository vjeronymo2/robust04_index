			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Contracting-out may be clarified Officials at the Department of Employment said some of the legal uncertainty surrounding contracting-out of public services could be removed early next year when the European Commission reviews its Acquired Rights Directive. The directive, which aims to protect the conditions of employment of employees when their jobs are transferred from one employer to another, has served as a deterrent to potential bidders for services being put out to tender in local and central government. Many private contractors say that Whitehall policies on how to implement this directive, known as Tupe in its British form, are making sustainable bids impossible. The European Union's weekend summit agreed to include Tupe in the list of policy areas that would be subject to a subsidiarity test, with a view to simplifying the complicated regulations. However the government is unlikely to succeed in excluding contracting-out from the regulations. A new draft of the regulations will be presented early next year and will go before ministers in June. Mr John Hall, director-general of the Business Services Association, which lobbies on behalf of contractors, has written to Mr Jonathan Aitken, minister of state for defence procurement, complaining that the MoD procurement executive requires contractors to guarantee not to sack employees or change their conditions of employment for 15 months. He said recent industrial tribunal cases to decide whether Tupe applies usually concluded that the regulations do not apply. Mr Hall is optimistic that the Commission review will redefine the concept of 'undertaking' to ensure that Tupe only applies when whole organisations, rather than functions, are transferred. Other lobbyists pressing for reform of Tupe are more circumspect about reform. Opponents of reform such as Mr Stephen Bubb of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities say the Commission is more likely to tighten the regulations than relax them. Contractors have suffered a blow from the government actuary's department, which has confirmed that bids for National Health Service work will have to provide a pension package 'broadly equivalent' to the one currently enjoyed by employees. While the government had already indicated that pensions are covered by the Tupe regulations, a recent industrial tribunal case cast doubt on this.</p>

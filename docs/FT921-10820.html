			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Management: Budget lament to Lamont - Taxation / What the lobby groups are demanding Small businesses, one of the Conservative party's natural constituencies, have had little to thank the government for in the past two years. Many of the small firms that started up so hopefully in the late 1980s have been swept away by the recession and the survivors have had to struggle hard to weather the storm. Next month's Budget, which may be only a matter of weeks before a general election, will be an ideal opportunity for the chancellor of the exchequer to make up for some of the damage which his government's policies have done. Not all the business organisations lobbying for tax changes make this point explicitly, but it is an assumption that underlies their budget submissions. Norman Lamont showed himself to have a fine ear for the concerns of Britain's small firms in his first budget last year. He met a number of their complaints in a manner that was not too demanding on Treasury revenues. Business lobby groups are hopeful that the imminence of a general election will make for even better treatment this time around. Despite the fact that the different business pressure groups do not co-ordinate their campaigns, there is a remarkable degree of unanimity about the aspects of the tax system which they believe are due for a shake-up: Inheritance tax is a popular target for lobbyists keen to establish a climate more favourable to family-owned businesses. The Association of British Chambers of Commerce calls for the abolition of inheritance tax while several other organisations urge relief to be given on business assets. The Forum of Private Business wants taxpayers to be able to defer the tax on business assets, including shares in private companies. The Institute of Directors (IOD) describes inheritance tax as 'a capricious tax on misfortune' and 'a principal reason for the decline of family business in Britain'. It calls for speedy government action, including an increase in the tax threshold and a reduction in the rate to no more than 20 per cent. Capital gains tax is a particular target of the British Venture Capital Association, which believes it is preventing managers in large companies from setting up in business on their own. Pension funds, investment trusts and private investors who use the Business Expansion Scheme, all escape capital gains, the association notes. 'The only ones who will certainly have to pay CGT are the ones who make it happen - the entrepreneur and his management team,' it says. The association, which won some concessions from the chancellor last year, wants more generous relief for entrepreneurs who sell their business, either by abolishing the present age limit of 55 and raising the starting threshold for the tax or by tapering the relief so that after seven years, gains would be exempt. Business Expansion Scheme investors may be better off in tax terms than the managers they back, but all is not well with the BES. The IOD wants the maximum amount that can be raised by trading companies (not involved in property investments) to be doubled to Pounds 1.5m. The present limit of Pounds 750,000 has practically killed off the BES for non-property businesses because of the relatively high cost of raising smaller amounts of capital. An increase in depreciation allowances has been a regular feature of budget submissions ever since 100 per cent first- year depreciation was abolished in 1984. Even the chambers of commerce, which believe that full, first-year relief distorts investment decisions, have been persuaded by the fierceness of the recession to call for an investment allowance to provide 'a one-off kick-start to the economy'. Corporation tax attracts a wealth of proposals. The Union of Independent Companies (UIC) wants small companies to be given a Pounds 10,000 tax free allowance, with the self-employed receiving similar relief from income tax. The Forum makes a more modest plea for Pounds 5,000 of corporation tax relief, but asks for companies to be allowed to defer payment. The IOD wants the extension of loss relief announced last year - permitting companies to carry back trading losses for three years instead of one year - to be made available to unincorporated businesses. It also calls for the removal of an anomaly in the tax system which means that businesses pay 35 per cent corporation tax on profits of between Pounds 250,000 and Pounds 1.25m, instead of the 33 per cent general corporation tax rate. The introduction of the Uniform Business Rate has hit many small firms, particularly retailers in the south-east. The IOD wants an immediate freeze on the level of the rate. Both the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and the Forum call for businesses which should be paying lower rates - many of them manufacturing companies in the north of England - to get the immediate benefit of any reduction. Because the rate is self-funding and the government has insisted on increases being phased in to ease the burden, reductions are similarly being brought in gradually. Finally, the burden of coping with taxes and excise duty. Administering VAT involves small businesses in a considerable amount of unpaid work on behalf of the government, recent research has shown. The Federation of Small Businesses wants the government to pay small businesses for the work they do. The Forum wants an increase in the threshold at which businesses start paying from Pounds 35,000 to Pounds 250,000. Efforts to improve the climate for small businesses are hampered by the fact that the ministers and officials responsible usually have no control over matters such as tax and social security levies. The annual budget therefore is the small business lobby's best opportunity to influence policy where it really matters. To judge by their detailed submissions, they could not be faulted for not trying.</p>

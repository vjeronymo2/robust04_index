It Includes a Physician Who Will  Spend a Record Time in the Station: 427 Days"]    [Text] The principal hero of the experiment is  cosmonaut-researcher Valeriy Polyakov, deputy director of the  Biomedical Problems Institute, candidate of medical sciences. He  already has been in the orbital station. He worked there for 241  days with Aleksandr Volkov and Sergey Krikalev.    "Yes, we need this flight primarily as a record," states  Polyakov. "It is impossible for us to let go of our first-place  standings with ease. In addition, it will afford us the  opportunity for the first time to rehearse the medical support  for what in essence is an expedition to Mars."    "But a record time is not an objective in itself. The flight  will be saturated to the limit with an interesting scientific  program. It will enable us to rise to a new level in  understanding all that which transpires in the human body in  space. The project has been supported by all those countries of  Western Europe whose astronauts have flown in the Mir and which  are actively participating in realization of the new flight."    "Valeriy and I will set to work," says Colonel Viktor  Afanasyev, the crew commander, joining into the conversation. We  calculated: the crew literally each day will participate in  medical research. The active work of a physician will determine  the character not only of our expedition, but two others as well  which it will meet and live with in orbit. But we also have  planned other experiments: in the fields of material science,  bioengineering and astronomy.    Viktor Afanasyev also is no novice in space. When he went  before the interdepartmental state commission for admission to  special training he was scheduled for flight under the Buran  program. Then he was transferred to the group of pilots for  spaceships of the Soyuz-TM series. He made his first flight in  the Mir station together with Musa Manarov in 1990-1991.    The ship's engineer, Yuriy Usachev, is the youngest in the  crew and perhaps the youngest among those who are today  preparing for flights under different programs. To my question  as to how he feels psychologically prior to the launch, whether  he is ready, he became thoughtful:    "I do not know what to say. It is probably necessary to sit  first in the ship, enter orbit and work for at least a half-year  in the station, and so it is possible to philosophize for a long  time. I will go with quite experienced cosmonauts and I would  not want to feel myself such a schoolboy. During the time of the  expedition I will strive to `get educated,' to better study all  the systems and equipment on the station. It is necessary to fly  more than once."    At any rate, we wish good success to the cosmonauts.</p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / International Company News: Maple Leaf Foods rises 29% to CDollars 20m MAPLE LEAF FOODS, Canada's biggest food processor which is controlled by Hillsdown of the UK, said second-quarter profits from continuing operations were up 29 per cent to CDollars 20m (USDollars 17m) or 25 cents a share. This compares with CDollars 15.6m,or 24 cents a share, last year. Sales fell to CDollars 678m, against CDollars 808m last time, due mainly to the sale of its edible oils business. First-half earnings from continuing operations were CDollars 32m, or 40 cents a share, up from CDollars 24.7m, or 38 cents a share, a year earlier on fewer shares outstanding. Sales were CDollars 1.3bn, against CDollars 1.55bn. Maple Leaf, with operations across Canada and in the US and Europe, said results for the second half would probably be affected by the weak economic recovery and poor weather. HJ Heinz, the US food group, and Hillsdown of the UK have formed a joint venture to acquire a Hungarian state-owned canning company, Kecskemeti Konzervgyar of Kecskemet, Reuter reports from Pittsburg. The venture will be known as Magyar Foods.</p>

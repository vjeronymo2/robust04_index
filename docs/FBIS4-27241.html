			<p>BFN     [Text] The government has recently issued regulations on  the setting up of representative offices overseas for Vietnamese  businesses. According to the regulations, all Vietnamese  business establishments which are legally registered and are  capable of operating representative offices will be licensed.    Overseas representative offices should be put under the  administrative authority of the state representative organ in  the country concerned. The minister of trade has the authority  to renew, withdraw, and cancel licenses for overseas  representative offices. The minister of trade is also charged  with the management and inspection of the overseas business  representative offices.    The regulations on the overseas business representative  offices also stipulate the necessary period of time for the  Ministry of Trade to consider whether to approve or reject  applications to set up representative offices. In cases where  business establishments had representative offices open before  these regulations, their owners should prepare new applications  under the provisions of the new regulations.</p>

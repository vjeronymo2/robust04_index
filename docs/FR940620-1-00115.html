			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  An alteration that affects or could affect the usability of or access to an area of a facility that contains a primary function shall be made so as to ensure that, to the maximum extent feasible, the path of travel to the altered area and the restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the altered area, are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, unless the cost and scope of such alterations is disproportionate to the cost of the overall alteration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Primary function. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A ``primary function'' is a major activity for which the facility is intended. Areas that contain a primary function include, but are not limited to, the meeting rooms in a conference center, as well as offices and other work areas in which the activities of the public entity using the facility are carried out.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Mechanical rooms, boiler rooms, supply storage rooms, employee lounges or locker rooms, janitorial closets, entrances, and corridors are not areas containing a primary function. Restrooms are not areas containing a primary function, unless the provision of restrooms is the principal purpose of the area,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , in highway rest stops.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For the purposes of this section, alterations to windows, hardware, controls, electrical outlets, and signage shall not be deemed to be alterations that affect the usability of or access to an area containing a primary function.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Path of travel. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) A ``path of travel'' includes a continuous, unobstructed way of pedestrian passage by means of which the altered area may be approached, entered, and exited, and which connects the altered area with an exterior approach (including sidewalks, streets, and parking areas), an entrance to the facility, and other parts of the facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) An accessible path of travel may consist of walks and sidewalks, curb ramps and other interior or exterior pedestrian ramps; clear floor paths through lobbies, corridors, rooms, and other improved areas; parking access aisles; elevators and lifts; or a combination of these elements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) For the purposes of this part, the term ``path of travel'' also includes the restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the altered area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Disproportionality. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) Alterations made to provide an accessible path of travel to the altered area will be deemed disproportionate to the overall alteration when the cost exceeds 20% of the cost of the alteration to the primary function area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Costs that may be counted as expenditures required to provide an accessible path of travel may include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Costs associated with providing an accessible entrance and an accessible route to the altered area, for example, the cost of widening doorways or installing ramps;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Costs associated with making restrooms accessible, such as installing grab bars, enlarging toilet stalls, insulating pipes, or installing accessible faucet controls;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Costs associated with providing accessible telephones, such as relocating the telephone to an accessible height, installing amplification devices, or installing a telecommunications device for deaf persons (TDD);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Costs associated with relocating an inaccessible drinking fountain.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Duty to provide accessible features in the event of disproportionality. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) When the cost of alterations necessary to make the path of travel to the altered area fully accessible is disproportionate to the cost of the overall alteration, the path of travel shall be made accessible to the extent that it can be made accessible without incurring disproportionate costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) In choosing which accessible elements to provide, priority should be given to those elements that will provide the greatest access, in the following order:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) An accessible entrance;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) An accessible route to the altered area;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) At least one accessible restroom for each sex or a single unisex restroom;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Accessible telephones;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Accessible drinking fountains; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) When possible, additional accessible elements such as parking, storage, and alarms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Series of smaller alterations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) The obligation to provide an accessible path of travel may not be evaded by performing a series of small alterations to the area served by a single path of travel if those alterations could have been performed as a single undertaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) (i) If an area containing a primary function has been altered without providing an accessible path of travel to that area, and subsequent alterations of that area, or a different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area on the same path of travel, are undertaken within three years of the original alteration, the total cost of alterations to the primary function areas on that path of travel during the preceding three-year period shall be considered in determining whether the cost of making that path of travel accessible is disproportionate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Only alterations undertaken after the effective date of this amendment shall be considered in determining if the cost of providing an accessible path of travel is disproportionate to the overall cost of the alterations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;35.154  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Alterations: Historic preservation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Alterations to buildings or facilities that are ``historic properties'' as defined in &sect;35.104 shall comply, to the maximum extent feasible, with section 4.1.7 of appendix A to part 37 of this chapter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) If it is determined under the procedures set out in section 4.1.7 of appendix A to part 37 of this chapter that it is not feasible to provide physical access to an historic property in a manner that will not threaten or destroy the historic significance of the building or facility, alternative methods of access shall be provided pursuant to the requirements of &sect;35.150.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

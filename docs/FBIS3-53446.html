			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Iraq has affirmed that the comprehensive embargo  imposed on it has lost its legitimacy and, therefore, must be  lifted. In a press release issued by the Iraqi UN mission  yesterday, Iraq hoped that the next review of the embargo will  reflect the progress that has taken place thanks to the  cooperation between Iraq and the Special Committee and the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], rather than the  political purposes of some UN Security Council member states.    The Iraqi press release noted that everyone has come to  realize that some UN Security Council member states,  particularly the United States and Britain, are trying to impose  their political views on the UN Security Council's decision  during the next review of the embargo.    The press release hopes again that the review scheduled for  early next week will reflect the international community's real  desire for lifting the blockade in light of the progress that  has been made during recent months.    The statement says that if the blockade is lifted, this will  prove that the positive steps and success that have taken place  have had a positive effect on the UN Security Council's  decision, especially after the Special Commission and the IAEA  have considered Iraq's acceptance of Resolution 715 on 26  November 1993 a major step which has resulted in removing the  remaining obstacle before Iraq's compliance with its obligations  in accordance with Part C of Resolution 687.    The Iraqi mission's press release explained that the  continued embargo will not serve the credibility of the United  Nations, as the only result of continuing the embargo will be  continued suffering by the Iraqi people. Recent statistics have  shown that 400,000 Iraqi citizens, including 140,000 children  under five, have died since the embargo was imposed, and which  resulted in the scarcity of food and health supplies.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "`Islamic Jihad' Hints at Possible </F> Halt to its Operations in Gaza Strip"]    [Text] Damascus, AL-HAYAH -- Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi,  secretary general of the Islamic Jihad Movement, has told  AL-HAYAH that the signing of the Gaza-Jericho agreement between  Israel and the PLO today "prompts us to reconsider the nature of  military action" in the Gaza Strip after the self-rule  authority's entry. He pointed out that he will work toward  increasing the movement's "political effectiveness" while  continuing military action in the same manner in the other  occupied territories.    Al-Shaqaqi said in Damascus yesterday that "in the event of  the Palestinian authority's entry into Gaza, we will reconsider  the nature of military action there. But we will continue  [military action] in the same manner in the West Bank,  Jerusalem, and the 1948 territory." He added that military  action will continue, "and we will not suspend it during the  reconsideration period. The confrontation methods will be  linked to the nature of the Israeli presence in the Strip."    He pointed out that the Jihad Movement does not object to  "political moves in the Strip away from the self-rule authority  and its institutions. We will push toward the broadest  political movement possible, whose motive power is the jihad."    On the nature of the future relationship with Fatah and the  administrative self-rule authority, al-Shaqaqi said that the  "Jihad's" history is closely linked to Fatah.    He added: "There are personal ties between Fatah and Jihad  sons. This personal relationship could become a channel through  which to solve some of the problems" that may emerge between the  two sides.    He pointed out that he has no "desire to fight over power.  Nevertheless, the possibility of a confrontation exists. If  they judge us because of our jihad against Israel,  confrontations would occur between us."    On his opinion of the agreement to be signed today, the  Jihad  secretary general said that he considers "this day a danger in  our history, and (Palestinian President Yasir) 'Arafat has sold  his soul for the sake of his body and is trying to sell the  Palestinian people's soul in return for their remaining alive  politically."</p>

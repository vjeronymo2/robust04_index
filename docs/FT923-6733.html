			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Pakistan reaffirms rebel support Pakistan yesterday reiterated its commitment to support the secessionist movement on the Indian side of Jammu and Kashmir, despite India's warning that talks on the Kashmir issue could only take place once Pakistan stopped such support, writes Shiraz Sidhva in New Delhi. 'We will continue to give moral, political, and diplomatic assistance to the Kashmiri people,' Mr Shaharyar Khan, Pakistan's foreign secretary, told the Financial Times only days after India and Pakistan agreed to hold talks on Kashmir, breaking a 26-year old deadlock on the subject.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] News from the Pailin battlefield on 14, 15, and 16  March:    1. On 14, 15, and 16 March the communist Vietnamese  puppets continued their assault on the Pailin region from the  south and the north using tanks, artillery, and infantry troops.    2. We destroyed four of the raiding forces' T-54 tanks on  14 March; one at Treng, two at Sdau, and another at Kamping Puoy.    3. We killed 60 infantry troops of the communist  Vietnamese puppets on 15 March and wounded several others, who  were dragged away by their comrades. We seized 85 firearms,  including AK's, B- 40's, RPK's, SKS's, and AR-15's.    4. At 1030 on 15 March, we hit a communist Vietnamese  puppet plane over Chineang along Route 10. The plane was forced  to turn back hastily and land at Battambang to avoid becoming  another of the many carcasses on the Pailin battlefield. The  people have a great predilection for the wreckage of the  communist Vietnamese puppet planes; they make good knives, pots,  and pans.    5. We hit them hard on 16 March, killing 49 raiding  troops, wounding 60 others, and destroying another T-54 tank.    In sum, over these three days of fighting we destroyed five  T-54 tanks, killed 109 raiding troops, and wounded 60 others.</p>

Specifications and features of  existing systems of automatic chemical monitoring systems are  examined. Key problems to be resolved in the design of such  systems are minimization and optimization of the area occupied  by instruments and software development. A table presents  specifications of automatic chemical monitoring devices produced  in Russia. Sample handling techniques and possible resultant  errors are described. A schematic of a chemical-technological  monitoring system is presented. Operations carried out by the  system are listed. The prospects for the use of ion  chromatography are outlined.

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Japan, US end SII talks with cartels pledge THE US and Japan ended talks on structural impediments to trade yesterday with an argument over how much the average Japanese home should cost, and a promise by Tokyo to study the business habits of Japan's biggest trading houses. After the two-day meeting, US negotiators, under orders from Washington, were determined to portray the Structural Impediments Initiative (SII) agreement as successful in treating the underlying causes of Japan's consistently large trade surplus, likely to top Dollars 100bn (Pounds 52.3bn) this year. Praising the SII agreement, signed in 1990, was partly an attempt by US negotiators to defend the Bush administration's Japan policy, under attack in Congress for having been too soft if only because Japan's trade surplus has risen over the past two years. But Tokyo made several new pledges, including introduction of training for anti-monopoly officers in the detection of bid-rigging, common in the building industry. Tokyo will study the 'trade associations' routinely established by Japanese industry, sometimes used as a front for cartels. Japan will 'encourage transparency' in private procurement, 'consider' improved rights for shareholders, and reduce import processing times. But Tokyo did not promise, as the US asked, to include a target price for the average Japanese home, raised by the US as part of its campaign for changes in land use. The most awkward discussions concerned differing corporate cultures. Washington sees Japanese corporate families, keiretsu, as exclusionary; Tokyo argues these groups' cross-shareholdings are conducive to long-term stability and profitability. Mr Olin Wethington, assistant US treasury secretary, said keiretsu were 'among the most complicated subject areas in this exercise', and Japan must act to improve disclosure of cross-shareholdings, allow proxy voting and outside directors, and improve access to corporate records. Japanese negotiators were disappointed the US had not done more to cut its budget deficit and there has been a general lack of new SII-related policies. US negotiators insisted President Bush was committed to cutting the deficit and said the US Congress had been the biggest problem. Apart from the deficit, the US pledged in principle to promote private saving, improve US worker training, and encourage US companies to cultivate a longer-term business perspective. In assessing results of the review, Mr Tadao Chino, vice-minister of international affairs at Japan's Finance Ministry, compared SII to a lemon: 'When you squeeze it first, the juice comes out quickly. It's harder the second or third try.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Impacts attributable to listing also include those resulting from the responsibility of Federal agencies under section 7 to ensure that their actions are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of endangered or threatened species. An action could be likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species through the destruction or modification of its habitat regardless of whether that habitat has been formally designated as critical. The Act provides significant protection to species, including protection to their habitats, as a result of listing. Therefore, the direct economic and other impacts resulting from additional habitat protection through critical habitat designation may be incrementally small. In general, the designation of critical habitat supplements the substantive protection resulting from listing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has prepared a draft Regulatory Impact Analysis on its proposed water quality standards. EPA's draft Regulatory Impact Analysis includes an economic analysis of the effects of the designation of critical habitat for the delta smelt. This economic analysis concludes that economic costs attributable to the designation of critical habitat for the delta smelt are relatively small and due primarily to the effects designation of critical habitat would have upon the five types of actions listed above under the section entitled ``Effects of Critical Habitat Designation.'' An underlying assumption of the draft economic analysis is that the costs associated with implementing EPA's proposed water quality standards for the Bay/Delta are due primarily to listing the delta smelt as threatened. As the Service refines its economic analysis, it may determine that this assumption is to some degree inappropriate and that some of the costs associated with implementing the water quality standards may be attributable to the designation of critical habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The costs associated with sand and gravel operations (approximately two aggregate operators are located in the Delta), diking or dredging for agricultural activities, and marina or bridge construction are expected to be similar. Project proponents or operators would incur costs associated with wetlands restoration, using a replacement ratio of 3 acres restored for 1 acre destroyed. The cost to restore 1 acre of wetlands ranges between $10,000 and $50,000. However, for some tracts of land, the costs associated with restoring wetlands may exceed the value derived from the agricultural activity, in which case the cost attributable to critical habitat would be the loss in agricultural income. The costs attributable to a designation of critical habitat are not expected to substantially affect levee maintenance operations because Federal regulatory agencies currently have restrictions that generally avoid adverse effects to the delta smelt. However, the designation of critical habitat may result in leaving the Montezuma Slough Control Structure's gates open from December to August rather than November to March.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service will prepare a final economic analysis prior to making its final determination on critical habitat. If that analysis substantially differs from the draft summarized here, the Service will make a revised economic analysis available to the public for comment prior to a final determination on critical habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Available Conservation Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities. Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. Such actions are initiated by the Service following listing. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against taking and harm are discussed, in part, below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(4) of the Act requires Federal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. If a species is subsequently listed and its critical habitat is designated, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into consultation with the Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Survival and recovery, mentioned in both the definition of adverse modification and jeopardy (see ``Effects of Critical Habitat Designation'' section), are directly related. Survival may be viewed as a linear continuum between recovery and extinction of the species. The closer a species is to recovery, the greater the certainty of the species' continued survival. Thus, the terms survival and recovery are related by the degree of certainty that the species will persist over a given period of time. Survival relates to viability. Factors that influence a species' viability include population numbers, distribution throughout the range, stochasticity, expected duration, and reproductive success. A species may be considered recovered when there is a high degree of certainty for the species' continued viability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act's definition of critical habitat indicates that the purpose of critical habitat is to contribute to a species' conservation, which, by definition, means recovery. Section 7 prohibitions against the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat apply to actions that would impair survival and recovery of the listed species, thus providing a regulatory means of ensuring that Federal actions within critical habitat are considered in relation to the goals and recommendations of a recovery plan. As a result of the link between critical habitat and recovery, the prohibition against destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat should protect the critical habitat's ability to contribute fully to a species' recovery. Thus, the adverse modification standard may be reached closer to the recovery end of the survival continuum, whereas the jeopardy standard traditionally has been applied nearer to the extinction end of the continuum.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Traficant Jr. (D-Ohio) said he was given an investigator's report  written for Pan American World Airways' insurance underwriter claiming CIA  operatives in West Germany may have known a bomb was aboard Pan Am Flight 103,  but ignored the information. At a news conference, Traficant read parts of the  report but declined to be specific about how he obtained it. Pan Am 103, en  route from Frankfurt to New York with an intervening stop in London, blew up  Dec. 21, 1988, over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270.  </P></p>

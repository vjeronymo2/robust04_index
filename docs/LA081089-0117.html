			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Saying sexual orientation is important for maintaining discipline and the  integrity of command, a federal appeals court has barred an Army Reserve  sergeant from re-enlisting because she is a lesbian. The U.S. 7th Circuit Court  of Appeals reversed a lower court decision allowing Miriam Ben-Shalom of  Milwaukee to rejoin the Army Reserve. The Army had refused to allow her to  re-enlist because of her professed homosexuality. Ben-Shalom's attorney said  she will appeal. A district judge had earlier called the case a free-speech  matter, but the appeals court panel wrote "it is the identity that makes her  ineligible for military service, not the speaking of it aloud."  </P></p>

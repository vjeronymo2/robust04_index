			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Paul Vaute: "Dehaene's Team Fears Implosion"] </F>   [Excerpt] If the upcoming European elections confirm the  results of the latest opinion polls, the current government  majority will represent just 36 to 37 percent of the electorate  in Flanders, while in French-speaking Belgium it will just hold  on at the 50 percent mark. Even these figures could be overly  optimistic, however.    While the DIMARSO DE MORGEN poll, published a few days ago,  still gave the French-speaking Socialist Party (PS) 31.2 percent  (with 19.3 percent for the Social Christian Party (PSC), this  could not have taken into account the effect of the recent  Hainault scandals, which were all the more traumatic since they  hit the federation assumed to be the most solid and disciplined  in the party. In the north, the previously dominant Flemish  Christian People's Party (CVP) was still on around 21.9 percent  while the Flemish Socialist Party (SP) stood at 15.2 percent.  Another global survey on Belgium by THE EUROPEAN gave the PS 24  percent and the PSC 23 percent. This would give the coalition  47 percent, and therefore less than the critical threshold.    Of course, in principle these elections are about renewing  the European Parliament in Strasbourg, and are not a  pronouncement on the national level. However, the political  leaderships are under no illusions: The effect of a debacle  would be considerable. How could the government "hold on" for  almost a year and a half, to the end of this legislature,  knowing that the coalition could not be reestablished? How  could the coalition parties resist, during this long period at  the end of their reign, the temptation to lay the ground for the  future with a top secret wooing of blues or greens?    Just as revealing of the underlying fragility is the extent  of the speculation surrounding the chances of [Prime Minister]  Dehaene's team surviving if its great helmsman were to succeed  [European Commission President] Delors.

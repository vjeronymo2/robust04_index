The controversy comes five months ahead of a planned visit  by  Pope John Paul II.    Shaykh Ja'far al-Sayigh, a Shiite Muslim cleric in Qana,  said  over the weekend that a mosque should be built above a cave  there which many Lebanese revere as the site where Christ  changed water into wine during a wedding.    His call has also revived a centuries' old debate on whether  the biblical Qana was located in Lebanon, east of the southern  port of Tyre, or in the Galilee region of what is now northern  Israel.    House Speaker Nabih Birri said that he took proof of the  Lebanese claim when he was received by the pope in November at  the Vatican.    Birri condemned the shaykh's call saying it was "very far  from our traditions, our habits, our Islam and our Christianity."    "Qana is a symbol for us and we refuse to let it become a  meeting place for extremism and fanaticism," he said.    Muslim clerics and Christian dignitaries have rallied to  Birri's side.    "We must preserve the historical sites in the region of Qana  al-Jalil, which represents a meeting place for the Christian and  Muslim religions," said Shaykh Ali al-Amin, president of the  Imam al-Sadr Institute for Islamic Studies.    He called on the inhabitants of Qana "to close ranks"  against  the mosque proposal.    "Land where Christ walked becomes sacred and we must  preserve  it," the cleric said.    The head of the Catholic Church in Tyre, Monsignor Yuhanna  Haddad, praised Birri's position.    And the parish priest in Qana, Mikha'il 'Abbud, said troops  were deployed around the cave over the weekend to protect the  site.    The pope announced on December 21 plans to visit Lebanon in  the first half of 1994. Vatican sources said the visit might  take place in May or June. The pontiff is expected to visit  south Lebanon during his visit.    [Beirut Radio Lebanon at 1630 GMT on 4 January adds the  following: "Sidon's Ja'farite mufti Sayyid Muhammad Hasan  al-Amin called on Shaykh Ja'far al-Sayigh and his aides to  reconsider their decision to build a mosque in front of the  historical cave of Qana to safeguard national coexistence,  especially as the south has always embraced both Christian and  Muslim values."    [In a related item in the same cast, the radio adds:  "Chamber of Deputies member Muhammad Qabbani has denounced  recent incidents that occurred in the south and the north under  the guise of religion, stressing that they were provoked by  ignoramuses, not people of faith."    [Elsewhere, Beirut Voice of Lebanon in Arabic at 1715 GMT on  4 January reports: "Minister of State Jean 'Ubayd today praised  Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri's opposition to  extremism and to what Birri described as waves of insanity.    ["'Ubayd said Speaker Birri's stand against overzealousness  and extremism expresses his patriotic and pan-Arab policy.  Minister 'Ubayd called for reviving wisdom, strength, unity,  and dignity in this country and nation. He called for silencing  such voices and all those involved in schemes to partition the  country and provoke infighting. 'Ubayd said he believes the  state must prepare to confront such schemes by forging greater  solidarity among its institutions and acting firmly and sternly  against anyone who threatens the state's security, the  homeland's unity, and the country's sanctities, liberties, and  taboos."]</p>

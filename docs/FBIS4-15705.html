			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tigran Liloyan] </F>   [Text] Yerevan April 9 TASS -- A statement of the Armenian  Government was made here today in connection with last night's  explosion of the Tbilisi-Yerevan passenger train which claimed  the lives of three people and wounded 15.    The explosion occurred when the train was passing the  Georgian Marneuli region mainly populated by the Azeris. The  statement says trains and engineering railroad facilities have  been blasted 20 times and the gas pipeline - 12 times in the  area since last year.    Acts of sabotage staged against Armenia on territory of that  region and terrorist acts against civilians, this time against  train passengers, leave no doubts as regards the aims and forces  organizing the actions, stresses the document.    Violating all international legal norms, the Azeri side  chose  the Georgian region populated by Azeris for fulfilment of its  goals in order to involve Armenia and Georgia in the conflict,  says the statement. In the opinion of the Armenian side,  international terrorism, which has grown into barbarity, must be  stopped. At the same time, the Armenian Government will take  all measures to ensure safety of its citizens and protect  national interests. In that case all the responsibility for  further aggravation of the situation will rest on the Azeri  side, says the statement.    The Armenian Government hopes the Georgian authorities will  take measures to ensure safety of communications to Armenia via  Georgian territory.</p>

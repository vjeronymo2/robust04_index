			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Pacific Ocean" program] </F>   [Text] Presently our fishermen are trying to break the  vicious circle of mounting problems. Please listen to the tape  sent to us by our Sakhalin journalist Lyudmila Fillipova.    [Begin recording] The critical situation in the oblast  fishing industry is the center of attention of the industry  council of trade unions. The council notes that the  ill-conceived social and economic reform policies, the  extortionate taxes, and the disparity between prices for primary  products and energy resources has led to the ruination of the  fishing industry, the sharp decline in the volume of production,  the halt of a number of enterprises, and a huge wage debt. To  avert the final collapse of the industry, the council of trade  unions has sent State Duma deputies a number of proposals, for  example: review the tax policy in respect to the Russian fishing  industry; equate it to the advantages given to the agricultural  industry as food producers; free the fishing industry from  customs duties on import, export, and barter operations which  would ensure a significant additional flow of supplies of fish  products onto the domestic market; and a number of other  proposals.    Hoping to find understanding in the State Duma, the industry  council of trade unions has appealed to fishermen, fish  processors, and leaders of economic and trade union  organizations of the Far East fishing industry to show  solidarity and support the above named demands. In connection  with this appeal, the industry council of trade unions sent a  letter to the Russian president, the prime minister, the  government of Russia, and the chairman of the State Duma, which  supports the demands stated in the decree of the 5th central  committee plenum of the Russian fishing industry workers' trade  union. Incidentally, the letter emphasizes that if the demands  are not met, the trade union will be forced to take collective  action.    I want to add that the Yuzhno-Kurilsk fishermen have already  begun their strike. [end recording]</p>

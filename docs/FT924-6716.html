			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Unctad to boost aid for debt managing THE UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) is to boost its programme for helping developing countries manage their debt, with potential foreign exchange savings running to millions of dollars. Unctad's computerised debt information system, used by about 20 countries, enables governments to monitor their obligations (which many countries cannot easily do) and use the information in economic decision-making. It is a way to avoid unnecessary costs such as overpayments to creditors or penalty interest rates due to poor book-keeping. Unctad officials say developing countries must process huge amounts of information on debt, a task only handled effectively by computer. Many debtor countries carry 1,000 loans on their books. Lack of information has meant many countries must rely on data provided by their creditors, with no independent means of checking accuracy. Use of Unctad's debt management system enabled one central American country to reclaim Dollars 1.2m in overpayments. An Asian debtor recouped Dollars 800,000 paid in excess interest. Expansion of the programme, in collaboration with the World Bank, is being financed by a Dollars 5.3m grant from the UN Development Programme (UNDP) over the next four years. Unctad will be carrying out debt audits for individual countries, advising them on data collection and analysis, providing debt management software packages and training local officials. Unctad hopes donor countries will come up with funds to let it meet the growing requests for debt management help. Computerising the debts of a middle-sized developing country can cost up to Dollars 500,000. Thus, it would cost Dollars 200m-300m to bring external debt management in all developing nations up to an acceptable standard in five years.</p>

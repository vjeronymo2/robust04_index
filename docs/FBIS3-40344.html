Designing a satellite means integrating the know-how from  many disciplines: Computer-aided design [CAD]; mechanical,  thermal, acoustic, and electrical engineering; electronics;  impact propagation; propulsion; space and flight environments;  payload.... All specialists from these disciplines must work as  one if the satellite is to be successfully developed and  launched. Until recently, however, such specialists have tended  to act sequentially rather than concurrently: "The design  department and the engineering department have always worked  quite independently from each other," explains project manager  J.C. Amieux. Potential configurations are developed by the  design department, while the engineering services study their  compatibility, first with the launcher, then with the space  environment.    Development of the satellite then proceeds with the project  being shuttled back and forth between the design department,  which designs systems, and the engineering department, which  throws light on a number of design weaknesses; the design  department makes corrections, the engineering department runs  its computational codes once more, and so it goes until the  configuration meets the mission's requirements. Thus the  problem is both simple and complex: While such an iterative  process is obviously very time-consuming, unifying the two  worlds of CAD and engineering is a real challenge with respect  to technical, information-technology, and human aspects.  <H5>  Technological Challenge </H5>   First of all, for the various participants to act  concurrently, they must speak the same language. However, the  design department and the scientific disciplines in charge of  the various calculations do not share the same representation of  reality: CAD specialists work on complete models very similar  to the real thing, while engineers use idealized structures.    J.C. Amieux: "In fact, this is a problem of  multirepresentation. There are two ways around it. We can  either start with the CAD model and simplify and abstract it in  order to build an x-number of models corresponding to an  x-number of scientific disciplines. Or we can begin with simple  structures used in engineering, and then flesh out the model:  Why construct a complex CAD model when the various groups have  not come up with a final configuration yet?"    While the second solution may appear preferable, it creates  another problem: All projects soon need to be expressed through  an artist's view, a realistic rendering whose purpose is the  management of interfaces between satellite and launcher, between  boxes and support plates, between antennas and payload  plates.... Not to mention interfaces with the outside world:  between Matra Marconi Space [MMS] and its customers, between  MMS and its subcontractors.... It must also be possible to  consult with the latter at any time during the project.  However, the multirepresentation problem is not as critical as  in other fields: No-one would dream of developing a consumer  product without knowing very early on what it will look like.  So there is no single solution: "No matter which way is  chosen, each discipline is going to stick to its own model...and  our task will be to manage those models, and to make sure they  can actually communicate," J.C. Amieux explains.  <H5>  Information Technology Challenge </H5>   MMS's first goal was to consolidate the computer environment  so that all models could communicate. "Rewriting all programs,  thousands of lines of code, would be neither realistic nor  useful," says J.C. Amieux. "We had to come up with other  solutions: direct connection with data structures or the use of  communication standards." The first approach is only  conceivable if there is access to the data structure, which is  easier said than done.... Furthermore, this does not necessarily  solve problems arising as part of relations with the various  partners: One can hardly compel them to use a given software  package....    The alternate route is that of data exchange standards.  While  it may appear an easier one, it has its own set of problems.  Some highly specialized fields have almost no standards. As for  those standards that do exist, they are not always "standard":  Some designers use their own substandards...which make  transferring data from one software package to another highly  perilous! Unless, again, one is in touch with the designers of  the software. The ideal solution would be an opening and a  standardization of packages as wide as possible: "Exchange  standards are sheer hell...but since we are not locked in one  place, anything goes," says Matra Datavision Marketing and  Communications Director Jean-Yves Guinemer, who also supplies  MMS with packages such as Euclid.    For the time being, since there is no simple solution, MMS  has chosen one that is a compromise. Close links with Matra  Datavision have led to an interconnection of the tools used by  the design department and the engineering department, the tools  having been made compatible with the ESABASE European satellite  modeling language. The result is Systema, a computerized system  which consists in a number of integrated and interconnected  tools and makes it possible for specialists belonging to  different disciplines to talk to one another. "However, this is  not a centralized system which a single operator could use to  `design' a satellite: All we did was to interconnect the  various departments in order to let them work together on the  same project," explains J.C. Amieux. This tool drastically  reduces a satellite's design time: Over a 10-year period, MMS  has cut this time by half, with spacecraft becoming increasingly  complex. "What remains to be done now is to interconnect the  three integrated sets we have created: the tools the satellite  will use to respond to its environment, structure-oriented  computational tools, and CAD tools," says J.C. Amieux.    This is one of the subsequent phases on the road to  concurrent engineering: integration, from the design stage, of  all elements of a satellite's lifecycle.  <H5>  Human Challenge </H5>   So concurrent engineering is based on methodology and tools.  But there is more: "In this concurrent engineering project, we  started with the tools -- if there are no tools, people do not  begin to change their methodology. But because they have the  tools does not guarantee they will change methodologies!" Thus,  as always, convincing people to change their ways takes a lot of  work. MMS has a powerful argument, however: "A critical review  of the way people work never fails to show that they  increasingly refuse repetitive and costly work. Transcribing a  model from one standard into another is hardly productive...,"  explains J.C. Amieux. However, one basic principle must be kept  in mind: "All this work must not be visible to the end-user,  who must only think: I could not do this before, and now it is  both possible and more efficient...." Let us take a project  group as an example: Experts of the various disciplines used to  meet in the flesh, with all their paraphernalia of pens and  papers. Now, they can work together via the large screen of a  workstation: They will have access to the project's history and  to all calculations already performed; they will be able to make  changes and see very quickly their impact on the various  disciplines....    In other words, it is possible to work concurrently and in  parallel on several disciplines. Moreover, much better use of  the results of other projects can be expected:  Cross-fertilization, which currently takes place only within  the various departments, should now be possible at the upper  level also. "A wholly new concept of engineering is emerging.  This was made possible by, among other things, networking and  ever-cheaper and more powerful workstations. This new approach  is essential if productivity, quality, and prices are to be  improved. Especially in an industry which is characterized by  fierce international competition," Jean- Claude Amieux concludes.  <H5>  Engineering Workshop </H5>   The concept of "framework" -- single development environment  or engineering workshop -- is a difficult one. "This is an  information technology notion, an essential one for the  development of concurrent engineering. However, there is  currently no consensus as to what a single development  environment really is," says J.C. Amieux. Conventional CAD/CAM  software packages generally offer a single work environment,  albeit...a proprietary one: Developing a special module entails  calling on the package's developers. The problem? Engineers  want to make such tools their own.... "We developed our concept  around Matra Datavision's Euclid software, among others. But we  now realize that this was not the best approach to total  integration. So we talked with Matra Datavision and this led to  a completely reversed proposition: the Cascade software package.    This product is an answer to single development environment  concerns: It is a software system, a tool kit through which  engineers will be able to access all the tools required in a  concurrent engineering environment," J.C. Amieux says. In fact,  the conditions have been entirely reversed: It is no longer a  software package that is being supplied, but the tools necessary  to put together the appropriate system. "Cascade also  represents a substantial technological leap. It cannot be  implemented all at once; therefore, we are going to integrate  Cascade into the existing tool, little by little," J.C. Amieux  explains.  <H5>  MMS in Toulouse </H5>   Matra Marconi Space (MMS) was born of the 1990 merger  between  Matra's Space Division and British conglomerate GEC Marconi. As  a result of the merger, MMS became Europe's first space-oriented  integrated company. MMS' Toulouse center specializes in  satellite engineering and integration: In addition to the  actual platforms, its engineers design everything upstream and  downstream, including instruments, on-board systems, control  centers, and ground facilities. This expertise is put to use in  several space-related domains. First, Earth observation  satellites: Meteosat 1 through 6, SPOT-1 through -4,  Helios...up to and including the future polar platform Columbus.  These are instrument-carrying satellites. The basic module is  reusable; only the on-board instruments are changed: from two  cameras for SPOT-1, to six or even 20 on the future Columbus  platform.    Here, the central idea is to design and build elements that  can be used in various configurations. Concurrent engineering  should make this much simpler.    Second, telecommunications satellites. While Earth  observation satellites follow a quasi-polar heliosynchronous  orbit at an altitude of 800 kilometers, telecommunications  satellites are on a geostationary orbit at 36,000 kilometers.  Hence, very different environments and therefore specific  technologies and system constraints.    The third field of activity, scientific satellites, is a  highly specialized business; however, costs remain moderate:  "These are one-of-a-kind platforms," says Jean-Claude Amieux.  For instance, Hyparcos, the "star surveyor," beams back results  with an accuracy of 2 milliseconds of arc.    Then there are strategic satellites, a field where  circumspection is of the essence. However, as with scientific  satellites, this is a field where second-best is not an  acceptable proposition.    The last domain relates to manned spacecraft, with one  specialty: on-board data processing. While MMS has been a  participant in such projects from the very beginning, the  current sundry vacillations on the subject do nothing to comfort  the company's belief in the future of these activities.</p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: UK electricity Students of conspiracy theory and watchers of smoke-filled rooms will be busy deconstructing Professor Stephen Littlechild's threats to the electricity generators this weekend. The testy tone of the regulator's comments suggests he is losing patience with the generators which, despite four investigations, have continued to push prices up in the 'spot' electricity pool. If Offer's investigation concludes that the generators' margins are too high, an investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission would naturally follow. But it may be that the generators would like to provoke Offer into a decision on a possible MMC referral while the government still holds 40 per cent stakes in both companies. The shares were due to be sold next spring to help fund the PSBR. Any MMC referral would delay that and might damage the value of the holdings. Pressure from the Treasury to avoid a referral would thus be intense, as the generators are doubtless aware. Whatever the politics, the two most likely grounds for referral to the MMC are charges of profiteering or market power. Evidence for excess profits will have to wait for the results of Offer's investigation, though the upward drift in prices is disturbing. On market power there is a clear case for referral. While the generators' overall market share is falling, they are losing out to nuclear power and shortly to new gas-fired plant, both of which operate as 'base-load' electricity. The marginal segment of the market, which determines the price, remains firmly in the hands of the companies. Whether that will be enough to call the government's hand in such a high-rolling game of political poker remains to be seen.</p>

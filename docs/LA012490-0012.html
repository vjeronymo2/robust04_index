			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORATORIUM SOUGHT ON DEMOLITIONS;  </P> <P> HOUSING: YAROSLAVSKY EXPRESSES OUTRAGE OVER DESTRUCTION OF REPAIRABLE HOMES IN  ANTI-DRUG PROGRAM. BRADLEY PROPOSES SOME REFORMS.  </P> <P> City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky on Tuesday called for a 60-day moratorium on  city-ordered demolitions of abandoned homes, and Mayor Tom Bradley proposed  other restrictions, based upon a published report that an aggressive new  anti-drug tear-down program had destroyed salvageable houses.  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky said Operation Knockdown was billed a year ago as a "last resort"  to rid neighborhoods of crack cocaine houses, but "this program has gone far  beyond that," resulting in the demolition of homes in poor areas with acute  housing shortages, regardless of whether drugs were involved.  </P> <P> The Times disclosed Tuesday that the program, intended to destroy about 70  derelict homes used as crack dens and gang hide-outs, had quietly expanded as  city Building and Safety inspectors received mounting complaints from police  and neighbors concerning dilapidated or crime-ridden houses.  </P> <P> As a result, 215 homes and other buildings -- including an unknown number of  repairable houses -- were bulldozed at a cost to the owners of $2,500 to $4,500  each. Some houses had been used by homeless squatters who were then put on the  streets.  </P> <P> Moreover, city officials were unable to provide a figure -- and said they were  not keeping track -- of how many homes were actually known crack houses.  </P> <P> "I was outraged," Yaroslavsky said. "(Elected officials) have actually gone  down with press agents in hand to watch demolitions. Demolishing of homes is  nothing to celebrate in this city."  </P> <P> Bradley, in a letter to The Times, called Operation Knockdown a program that  "has worked," but he proposed two reforms. He asked for more certification  showing that homes are not repairable before they are destroyed, and proposed  that owners be told of loans that may be available to repair their homes.  </P> <P> "Only if a property is in serious disrepair -- with open windows and doors and  roofs that have been burned down by fire -- should Building and Safety activate  Operation Knockdown," Bradley wrote.  </P> <P> But Yaroslavsky, whose motion will be considered by the City Council next  Tuesday, said that even if a home is "really dilapidated," the city should  attempt to resolve the problem without demolition. "The big picture is that we  have the worst homelessness anywhere," Yaroslavsky said. "We are always quick  to criticize the Bush Administration or Reagan Administration for causing  homelessness but don't . . . blame ourselves."  </P> <P> Bill Chandler, an aide to Bradley, said the mayor ordered Building and Safety  officials last week to undertake the changes proposed in his letter. He said  the changes were ordered after a Times reporter asked the mayor for comment on  the newspaper's findings.  </P> <P> Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani said the majority of homes torn down could not have  been fixed, but he was unable to provide statistics. Building and Safety  officials earlier told The Times that they were not keeping a tally.  </P> <P> Fabiani said Bradley opposes Yaroslavsky's motion for a moratorium, believing  "that people who live near these crack homes don't deserve to live near them  even one more day, and certainly not 60 more days."  </P></p>

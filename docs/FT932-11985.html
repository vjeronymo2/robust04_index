			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Figures blunt Fowler's attack SIR NORMAN Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, accused Labour yesterday of admitting that in some parts of England it was not a serious electoral contender. Returning to the Tories' local election theme of pacts between Labour and the Liberal Democrats, he highlighted the cases of two Labour candidates in Berkshire standing down to give the Liberal Democrats a better prospect of defeating the Conservatives. He also referred to similar examples in Wiltshire and Oxfordshire. Standing down was 'an admission that Labour has no prospect whatsoever of victory in large parts of England', Sir Norman said. But Conservative Central Office later said the Tories themselves were not fighting about 500 of the 3,500 seats up for election on May 6. No party is fighting all 3,500. According to figures from Tory headquarters, in Durham the party is fielding only 25 candidates although there are 72 county council seats. In Northumberland it is not fighting 20 of the 66 seats and in Cornwall it is standing in fewer than 60 of the 79 seats. Taking England and Wales together, Labour is fielding slightly more candidates than the Tories, although more Conservatives are standing in England alone. Labour's headquarters list of candidates shows that in some counties, such as North Yorkshire and Shropshire, where there is no overall control but the Tories are the largest single party, it is not fielding candidates in a significant number of seats. The Liberal Democrats are fighting fewer than half the seats in Cumbria and are putting forward only five candidates for the 45-seat Powys county council. Altogether, they are fielding just over 2,500 candidates. Mr Andrew Stunell, of the Association of Liberal Democrat Councillors, said yesterday that the party was particularly hopeful of extending its influence in Leicestershire, Bedfordshire and Somerset.</p>

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Clinton warns of tighter sanctions as Bosnia peace hopes fade THE US and its allies are preparing to tighten sanctions against Serbia and looking for other ways to end the conflict in Bosnia, President Bill Clinton said yesterday. He spoke as hopes of a breakthrough in the Bosnian peace talks in New York dwindled. Mr Clinton said details of the new measures would be revealed soon. The announcement came as Russia said it would join the US in making air-drops of humanitarian aid in eastern Bosnia. Starting in a week, Ilyushin military transporters would drop 260 tons of aid over a two-week period. Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the UN and EC mediators, met Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic for three hours yesterday and scheduled a meeting with him today. The talks took place in his New York hotel after the Bosnian leader complained he was feeling unwell. He cancelled a previously announced plan to leave for home last night. It was unclear whether this was because of illness or the prospect of progress in the negotiations, which now are focused on the Vance-Owen plan to divide the country into 10 semi-autonomous provinces. Mr Mate Boban and Mr Mile Akmadzic, the Bosnian Croat leaders, took part in yesterday's meeting but there was again no face-to-face contact with Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader. However, a UN spokesman said Mr Vance and Lord Owen hoped to meet him today. He too had been expected to leave New York last night but apparently agreed to remain after reports circulated that he might be isolated as the only leader to hold out on the division plan, assuming Mr Izetbegovic eventually agreed. In New York, Bosnia's UN ambassador, Mr Muhamed Sacirbey, dampened expectations that the Moslems were on the point of signing the agreement on dividing Bosnia-Hercegovina, following their approval of ceasefire and military disengagement arrangements on Wednesday. Countering forecasts by the mediators that there would be a breakthrough on the plan, which has so far been signed only by the Bosnian Croats, Mr Sacirbey said his government still had strong concerns. In particular, further clarification was needed on how power would be shared between the proposed provinces and the central government, which would be responsible for foreign relations. The Bosnian Serbs, who have been assigned 43 per cent of Bosnia's territory, compared with the 70 per cent they now occupy, also have reservations about the proposed map. This is the most controversial element of the three-part peace plan, which also includes a constitutional framework and a military agreement. Meanwhile, the French commander of UN troops in Bosnia set out to cross Serb battle lines in an armoured convoy to assess the plight of the Moslem settlement of Cerska. The UN had been unable to persuade Bosnian Serb commanders to allow aid workers into Cerska, reportedly overrun by Serb forces. General Philippe Morillon was last night reported to be negotiating with Serb commanders. Unconfirmed reports from amateur radio operators, the only source of information from the besieged area and nearby Konjevic Polje, have said that hundreds of people have been killed and thousands were fleeing the region. Radio Sarajevo carried an appeal from Cerska's local leaders to Mr Clinton to rescue them. 'How long can this go on? The world watches and does nothing,' the appeal said. In Sarajevo a convoy carrying aid sent jointly by Serb Catholic and Moslem charities was hit by grenades, injuring four drivers. Bosnian Serbs blamed Moslem forces and ordered a halt to aid convoys while talks were held with the UN to guarantee their safety. Elsewhere heavy snowfalls stranded more than 50 UN aid trucks on narrow mountain roads in Bosnia. The commander of UN troops in former Yugoslavia for the past year acknowledged yesterday that there was widespread dissatisfaction with their current mandate, saying this would have to be changed. Lieutenant General Satish Nambiar, who is returning to Indian army service, agreed with the view that the peacekeepers might have to be authorised to use force to implement a peace settlement. Gen Nambiar emphasised that all the heavy weapons now in the possession of the warring groups would have to be brought under UN control to make a ceasefire effective. America's search, Page 9</p>

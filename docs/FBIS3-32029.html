We interrupt this program to  announce an item of general interest. This is Octavio Cogley,  live from the Christian Democratic Party [PDC] headquarters.  The PDC officially announced this evening its presidential  slate for the May elections. The slate is led by Engineer  Eduardo Vallarino as the presidential candidate; Raul Ossa,  first vice presidential candidate; and Rene Orillac, second vice  presidential candidate.    We repeat, the PDC revealed this evening the slate that will  represent it in the May elections. The slate is led by Eng.  Eduardo Vallarino, as the presidential candidate, with Raul Ossa  as the first vice presidential candidate, and Rene Orillac as  the second vice presidential candidate.    The PDC also revealed a medical certificate issued by Dr.  Fernando (Groce), a clinical neurologist, who states that Dr.  Ricardo Arias Calderon suffers from a chronic injury to a  vertebral disc and a recent fracture of the third lumbar  vertebrae. For this reason, Dr. Ricardo Arias Calderon declines  the presidential candidacy.    The party has decided to participate alone in the elections,  but it leaves open the possibility of being joined by other  parties before the 8 May elections.    It was also reported that a special congress will be held on  6 February to ratify the presidential slate chosen by the PDC to  participate in the next elections.</p>

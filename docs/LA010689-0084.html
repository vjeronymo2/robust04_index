			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAWMAKERS CONFIRM HAYES AS TREASURER  </P> <P> Heeding appeals to set partisanship aside, the Legislature voted overwhelmingly  Thursday to confirm Auditor General Thomas W. Hayes as state treasurer,  breaking a political stalemate that had kept the office vacant since August,  1987.  </P> <P> The vote was 34 to 0 in the Senate, where Rep. Daniel E. Lungren of Long Beach,  Republican Gov. George Deukmejian's first choice for the job, was rejected  early last year. In the Assembly, where some top Democrats had launched a  partisan attack on Hayes, Deukmejian's nominee was confirmed by a vote of 65 to  0.  </P> <P> Hayes, 42, will be sworn into office today, taking the place of Democrat Jesse  M. Unruh, who had occupied the seat for more than a dozen years until his death  almost 18 months ago.  </P> <P> After the vote, Hayes told reporters that he was "delighted" by the outcome,  adding: "I think the Legislature acted fairly. I was glad to see the bipartisan  support."  </P> <P> The confirmation was a victory for Deukmejian, who praised Hayes as "a man of  great integrity." The support Hayes received in both houses, Deukmejian said,  "represents a vote for fiscal integrity and responsibility."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Governor's Announcement  </P> <P> The victory was overshadowed, however, by the governor's own announcement  several hours later that he would not seek a third term. It also was muted by a  sense that Deukmejian, unable to win confirmation for Republican Lungren, had  no choice but to give in and accommodate the Legislature's Democratic majority  by nominating a non-partisan individual such as Hayes.  </P> <P> Not only has Hayes never run for office, he has never even belonged to a  political party. He promised Deukmejian, however, that, if confirmed, he would  register as a Republican and run for treasurer in 1990, forcing him to embark  on an effort for which he has little experience.  </P> <P> Hayes acknowledged that in an interview Thursday, but said he will move swiftly  to put together a credible campaign organization and begin raising money so he  can hold the seat for the GOP.  </P> <P> "I'm a financial manager, not a politician," Hayes said. "What voters are going  to have is a choice between a financial manager with no political experience or  a politician with no financial management experience. I feel confident they  will pick a financial manager. After all, it's their money."  </P> <P> Kathleen Brown, a member of the Los Angeles Board of Public Works and the  sister of former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., is among Democrats expected to run  for the seat. Brown, an attorney, who has scheduled three fund-raisers in the  next month, said she sees Hayes as "a technocrat" and herself as someone with a  "corporate finance and public finance background."  </P> <P> "It's going to be an interesting contest," she said.  </P> <P> Acting Treasurer Elizabeth Whitney, who had hoped to block Hayes' confirmation  so she could run for the office as an incumbent Democrat, issued a statement  after the vote pledging to cooperate in a "smooth transition," but did not say  whether she still intends to run for the office.  </P> <P> In voting to confirm Hayes, Democrats in the Legislature made it clear the real  political fight is yet to come.  </P> <P> "Be prepared for a very feisty campaign in 1990, Mr. Hayes," Sen. Art Torres  (D-Los Angeles) cautioned Hayes before the vote on the Senate floor.  </P> <P> Hayes, a soft-spoken professional who has carefully cultivated his non-partisan  image, has worked for the Legislature for the last 10 years, directing a staff  of auditors who investigate mismanagement and inefficiency in state departments  and agencies.  </P> <P> While his nomination at first was lauded by most lawmakers, more recently some  influential Democrats began to worry that their support for his confirmation  might imply an endorsement when he runs for the office in 1990.  </P> <P> In praising Hayes during Thursday's debate, Democrats such as Senate President  Pro Tem David A. Roberti of Los Angeles were careful to draw that distinction.  </P> <P> "We all have in one way or the other voted to confirm Mr. Hayes as our auditor  general," Roberti said. "He has performed admirably in that role. I think he  will perform very, very well in the position of treasurer. . . . We reserve  every right to support our candidate in November."  </P> <P> But Sen. John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove), who abstained from voting, said there  is no way to separate the partisan politics from the question of Hayes'  qualifications. "Have you ever tried to unscramble an egg?" Garamendi asked.  </P> <P> In the Assembly, where Hayes was expected to face vocal opposition from some  Democrats, Speaker Pro Tem Mike Roos of Los Angeles was the only legislator to  speak against his confirmation.  </P> <P> Roos praised Hayes as a "perfect technocrat," but then resurrected an old quote  from Republican leader Ross Johnson (R-La Habra) in which Johnson described  Deukmejian's choice as a "world-class bonehead decision." Many Republicans were  caught off guard and angered by the governor's decision to appoint non-partisan  Hayes rather than a Republican.  </P> <P> Roos accused Assembly Republicans of "laying down and rolling over for the  governor" by voting to confirm Hayes. Ultimately, Roos left the chamber before  the vote was taken, telling a reporter later that "I felt the breath of the  steam engine" pushing for Hayes' nomination.  </P> <P> Although some Republicans were still miffed by the governor's actions, they  called for unity and asked that Hayes be considered on his merits.  </P> <P> "Do you want him good-looking and charming . . . or do you want someone who has  the experience, the integrity and the ability to get the job done?" William P.  Baker (R-Danville) asked. "Yes, it's a bonehead decision because he doesn't  have the charm and wit of a (Sen.) Ken Maddy or the fund-raising ability of a  Bill Baker. But I didn't name Hayes, the governor did."  </P></p>

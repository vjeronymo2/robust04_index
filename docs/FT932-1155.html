			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / World Trade News: US backs down on computer displays THE US Commerce Department has revoked an earlier decision to impose stiff dumping duties on Japanese-made flat-panel displays used in portable computers, writes Louise Kehoe in San Francisco. The duties of 63 per cent were imposed in 1991 and applied to active matrix liquid crystal displays, which are the most widely used type of multi-colour displays for notebook computers. The market is dominated by Japanese manufacturers, who petitioned the International Trade Administration to lift the duties. Large US personal computer manufacturers including International Business Machines, Apple and Compaq were also opposed to the duties. The companies claimed there were no viable high volume suppliers for this type of display in the US. However, the final ITA decision came after a petition filed by Guardian Industries, which recently acquired Optical Imaging Systems, the only US manufacturer of active matrix displays. US companies opposing the duties are customers for Guardian's displays.</p>

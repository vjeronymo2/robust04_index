			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Also in recent years, there have been significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes in the activities of insured depository  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions, in terms of reported assets and liabilities as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well as off-balance-sheet operations (including derivative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products such as options, swaps, interest-rate and foreign- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exchange-rate contracts). Such changes, which to some extent have eroded the historical connection between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deposits and lending, give rise to the question of whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total domestic deposits continues to be a meaningful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition for the assessment base. Other relevant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developments include adjustments in federal failure- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolution policies and the adoption of ``depositor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preference'' requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This section discusses the applicability of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developments to the question of whether the assessment base  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be redefined. The areas addressed in this regard are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the role of the assessment base in the risk-related deposit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insurance system, the assessment-avoidance problem, failure-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolution policies, and depositor preference. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following discussions on these topics identify what the FDIC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes to be important issues that merit careful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration in deciding on an assessment-base definition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment is requested with regard to how the assessment base  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be defined in order to address these and other issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in an appropriate manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before turning to these topics, however, the FDIC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wishes to stress that, in reviewing the definition of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment base, it is not the FDIC's intent to change the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total dollar amount of assessments collected. Instead, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> goal is to select an assessment base that best suits the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of federal deposit insurance. To the extent any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decrease or increase in assessment income is warranted, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDIC anticipates that it would achieve that decrease or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase by changing the assessment rates, and not by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> redefining the assessment base. In short, the amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total assessment collections a particular assessment base  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition would yield (assuming no change in the assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates) is not a criterion the FDIC intends to apply in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deciding on an assessment-base definition, since assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collections can be fairly readily adjusted by changing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the FDIC does not intend any redefinition of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment base to have a significant impact on the total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of assessments industry-wide, there is a potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for significant change in the assessments paid on an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution-by-institution basis. Depending on the type of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities in which a particular institution is engaged, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the type of products and services it offers, a change in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment base could have a significant effect on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of the assessments it pays.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> A. Risk-Based Assessment System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Section 302 of FDICIA amended section 7 of the FDI Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to require that the FDIC establish a risk-based assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system. Under the system mandated by FDICIA, the amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution's assessment is to be based on the likelihood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that its deposit insurance fund will incur a loss with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to the institution, the likely amount of any such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loss, and the revenue needs of the insurance funds. Under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the risk-based system adopted by the FDIC pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 302, the rate component of the insurance system was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changed from a single, flat rate applicable to all banks and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a single, flat rate applicable to all thrift institutions to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a risk-based rate structure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Having already addressed the rate component of the new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk-based assessment system in previous rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proceedings, the FDIC is now turning its attention to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment-base component. This Notice does not revisit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> matter of the rate structure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At present, the assessment-base component of the risk- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based system remains unchanged from the form required by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statute for the former flat-rate insurance system. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue to be considered in connection with whether the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment base should now be changed is how and to what  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extent the assessment base should reflect the risk factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified in section 7(b) of the FDI Act, as amended by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 302 of FDICIA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Labour pledges electoral reform debate: Leadership prepares to endorse proportional voting for a future Scottish Assembly A LABOUR manifesto commit-ment to include the voting system for the House of Commons in a post-election national debate on electoral reform was foreshadowed yesterday as the party's leadership prepared to endorse proportional voting for a Scottish Assembly. The further shift towards changes in the voting system came as Labour responded to the third consecutive opinion poll showing a slight Conservative lead with a new campaign to counter attacks on its tax and spending policies. Mr Chris Patten, Tory party chairman, continued to harry the opposition over the details of its pledges, claiming renewed Labour muddle over the cost of its immediate commitments. He seized on apparently contradictory comments by members of the shadow cabinet on the strength of the party's pledge to a Pounds 1bn economic recovery programme. Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's campaign manager and a personal enthusiast for replacing the 'first-past-the-post' method of electing MPs, suggested wider debate after the election should involve a constitutional convention or a Speakers' Conference. Senior party officials acknowledged pressure on Mr Neil Kinnock to demonstrate in the manifesto that Labour is ready to consider seriously the option of radical changes to the electoral system. In an interview last week with the FT, Mr Kinnock said the constitutional debate his party had embarked upon was 'a process that will continue into government.' In spite of the strong opposition of some senior members, a majority in the shadow cabinet acknowledges the growing momentum behind a broad manifesto pledge to consider reform. That momentum will be strengthened when the party's National Executive Committee is expected broadly to endorse on Wednesday a report from the committee headed by Professor Raymond Plant of Southampton University which will recommend that the Scottish Assembly proposed by Labour be elected by the Additional Member voting system - the hybrid used in Germany to combine single-member constituencies and regional lists. Mr Cunningham, speaking on BBC television, dismissed any suggestion that a new voting system could be part of a post-election deal with the Liberal Democrats. Many colleagues, however, believe an open-minded approach could gain the support of a group of floating voters in the south-east. A MORI survey for the Sunday Times gave the Conservatives a 42 per cent share of the vote, against 39 per cent for Labour and 16 per cent for the Liberal Democrats. That followed polls on Saturday which had pointed to a 2-point and 1-point Tory lead respectively. Labour said it would respond with a campaign designed to highlight independent evidence that less than 9 per cent of households would lose, 46 per cent would gain, and 46 per cent would be unaffected by its tax and benefit proposals.

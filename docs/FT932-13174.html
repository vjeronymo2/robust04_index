			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / UK Company News: Reed Executive optimistic as losses are trimmed REED Executive, the employ-ment agency, slightly reduced pre-tax losses to Pounds 7.33m in the year to December 27, compared with Pounds 7.89m in the corresponding period. Reed, which changed its year end from March to December, said turnover dropped to Pounds 82.3m (Pounds 87.8m). The dividend was again passed and losses per share were reduced to 11.2p (12.9p). The company made an exceptional provision of Pounds 3.91m (Pounds 1.64m), to cover surplus property costs associated with those vacated or sold, and redundancies. Reed had Pounds 633,000 worth of cash at the year end and no borrowings. Mr Alex Reed, executive chairman, said: 'The really good news is that since the beginning of this calendar year, losses have been reduced dramatically.' Management accounts showed a loss of just Pounds 150,000 (Pounds 1.72m losses) for the first three months, with a small profit in March. He said he would be 'very disappointed' if the company failed to make a profit this year, although the first half would probably be near breakeven.</p>

The press service of the Russian Federation president has  reported that Boris Yeltsin mentioned "a certain normalization  of the situation around Sarajevo which is due, among other  things, to the deployment of a contingent of the Russian blue  helmets in the area."    The Russian president and the chancellor of the FRG said it  was important that the states interested in a settlement in  Bosnia should come out with political initiatives. They  expressed a hope that concrete suggestions on developing the  settlement process will be drawn up at the meeting of the heads  of diplomatic departments of Russia, the European Union, and the  United States on 22 February 1994 in Bonn.    According to Boris Yeltsin, Russia sees the following three  main tasks in Bosnia:    - to strengthen positive developments in Sarajevo and work  toward transferring the town to UN administration;    - to take measures aimed at strengthening other security  zones in Bosnia;    - to achieve the signing of an agreement on peaceful  settlement throughout Bosnia on the basis of the EC plan by  three Bosnian sides. The telephone conversation was initiated  by Helmut Kohl.</p>

			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: VIRUS FINDING SHAKES THEORY  </P> <P> Scientists reported last week that the concentration of viruses in a German  lake may be up to 10 million times greater than previously thought, a finding  that shakes existing views on dynamics of underwater life. Norwegian  researchers detected 1.25 billion viruses in about a teaspoonful of water from  a West German lake -- a level 1,000 to 10 million times greater than prior  estimates.  </P> <P> The microscopic viruses are a type that preys on bacteria and is not known to  infect animals or humans. They are the smallest living particles yet to be  found in river, lake or seawater. The University of Bergen's Gunnar Bratbak and  his colleagues said it had generally been assumed that relatively few viruses  inhabit natural, unpolluted water.  </P> <P> But in a study published in the British journal Nature, Bratbak's team said its  examination of water with an electron microscope found otherwise. At levels  found in Germany's Lake Plussee in May, 1988, researchers said viruses could  play a key role in keeping bacteria populations in check.  </P></p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Businesses in Notts set growth priorities MORE THAN 200 business leaders in north Nottinghamshire yesterday called for a unified approach among local authorities and private-sector promotional bodies to foster economic development in the area. The call, at a conference in Rufford, Nottinghamshire, reflects concern about the impact on the local economy of pit closures. The conference agreed a set of priorities to create a climate for economic development. The first was a dialogue between financial institutions and local business: there is concern about a shortage of venture capital. There were also demands for improvements to the area's infrastructure, especially east-west communications, and for more higher educational facilities, including a university.</p>

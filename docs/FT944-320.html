			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa in a solid rise Shares made steady gains helped by a solid bullion price and portfolio juggling ahead of the year-end. The overall index rose 29.9 at 5,839.7, as mining and industrial shares performed well. The industrial index made 30.8 to 6,963.0, and the gold index rose 22.2 to 1,976.1. Miners were the focus as gold tested the Dollars 382 resistence level. The feeling was that, if the metal broke through, it could push to Dollars 385 next week. In golds, Harties gained 50 cents to R18.75, and Vaal Reefs climbed R5 to R362.</p>

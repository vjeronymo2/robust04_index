			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Tory MPs to urge diluted Post Office sale Tory backbenchers opposed to Post Office privatisation plan to lobby the government in favour of selling only a minority stake to keep the corporation in the public sector. After a series of private meetings in the Commons the MPs have accepted the need to inject private capital into the Post Office. But instead of the government's preferred option of selling 51 per cent of the shares in the Royal Mail and Parcelforce, they are arguing for a flotation of 30 per cent. The MPs say the recent 30 per cent share sale in Koninklijke PTT Nederland, the state-owned Dutch postal and telecommunications company, provides a good example of how private capital can be injected without full privatisation. More than eight Tory MPs say they oppose the government's preferred option and have threatened to vote against it if put to a vote. This would wipe out the government's majority of 15. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is confident he will be able to win over the remaining Tory MPs opposed to his privatisation plans. However the MPs, by taking the unusual step of meeting together, have made it clear to Mr Heseltine in one-to-one meetings they are planning 'a big fight' to prevent the corporation moving into the private sector. Mr Nicholas Winterton, Conservative MP for Macclesfield, accused the DTI of making misleading comparisons between the Dutch sell-off and its privatisation plans for the Post Office. 'I am in favour of selling off a minority stake so long as the corporation remains in the public sector,' he said. Mr Hugh Dykes, MP for Harrow East, and Mr Patrick Cormack, MP for Staffordshire South, have also urged Mr Heseltine to draw back from privatising the Post Office. They favour a 30 per cent sale but Mr Cormack said he would be happy to see up to 49 per centsold. Sir Teddy Taylor, Tory MP for Southend East, said he also backed a 30 per cent sale of the Post Office. 'It would be a bad bargain for the taxpayer if we sold 51 per cent ahead of the massive benefits that the corporation says will flow from commercial freedom.' Mr Robert Hicks, Conservative MP for Cornwall South East, said he would like the Post Office to remain in the public sector with the removal of the Treasury constraints on it. 'I would be less worked up by a 30 per cent sale,' Mr Hicks said. 'But there is no way that I am going to commit myself to the 51 per cent sale.' Although Mr Heseltine has committed the government to a uniform affordable tariff, Mr Hicks pointed out that electricity privatisation led to regional price differentials after similar assurances. The issue of regional pricing also concerns Mr David Nicholson, Tory MP for Taunton, who said the government would have to make 'a very strong case for full privatisation' if it wanted to get a bill through the Commons. Party managers are still hopeful of bringing forward a bill in November to privatise the Royal Mail and Parcelforce after the consultation period ends in the autumn.</p>

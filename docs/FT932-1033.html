			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / People: CSEU confirms Robson Alan Robson, 51, was confirmed as the new general secretary of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions at its annual meeting in Llandudno on Wednesday. Robson, deputy general secretary of the AEEU engineering union since 1990, succeeds Alex Ferry, another former official of the AEEU, who was an important player in the campaign by the engineering unions for a 37-hour week. The campaign won shorter working weeks for hundreds of thousands of workers. Robson, who started his career as an apprentice at Swan Hunter shipyard, is keen to start campaigning for a 35-hour week when the economy picks up. But he believes many employers would be unwilling and unable to concede such hours at present. The CSEU is an umbrella organisation for engineering and shipbuilding unions and negotiates on their behalf locally. It used to be an important force in national pay talks with engineering employers but this role ended after disputes over the shorter working week.</p>

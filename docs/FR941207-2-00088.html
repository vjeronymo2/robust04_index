			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission also believes that the near match function does not involve a hidden auction market, but rather is simply a service provided to cross participants that fail to achieve execution in the match. This service is no different than a broker negotiating a trade in the crowd on an exchange floor or off an exchange. In the near match function, willing participants will have the option to have a near match broker call them to negotiate an order. There is no further participation at this point with CHX or the Chicago Match. <FOOTCITE>64</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 64 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Users who have entered orders which are not executed can also receive indications of interest from CHX floor brokers and may choose independently to contact a floor broker to negotiate a trade. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Third, the CHX has addressed issues relating to its order execution priority. The NYSE expressed concern that trades executed in the Chicago Match could trade through other markets' published quotations if liquidity fees or credits are deemed a part of the price. The Commission believes that the amended Chicago Match rules address this issue. As amended, the Chicago Match rules will limit the maximum size of liquidity fees or credits to one half of the best bid-offer spread at the time of execution. Therefore, even if the liquidity fees and credits are counted as a part of the execution price, no market's quotation will be traded through. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission also disagrees with the NYSE's assertions that by granting the CHX quote priority the Chicago Match will allow specialists to trade ahead of customer orders. The NYSE's concern arises in the case where the specialist enters a proprietary quote. In this instance, it is possible that a specialist could be trading ahead of a separately-entered customer order. The Commission believes that this possibility is not a significant concern in this context for two reasons. First, a specialist could not trade ahead of customer orders that he was holding, but only orders that brokers or other customers separately entered into the system. Second, a customer has the choice to enter an order by sending it to the CHX floor (in which case it will be displayed) so that his order will be a part of the specialist's quotation if the customer is concerned about the possibility of a specialist trading ahead of his order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fourth, the Commission believes that the Chicago Match, as finally amended, will not raise significant short-sale issues under Rule 10a&hyph;1 of the Act. <FOOTCITE>65</FOOTCITE>  The Division has granted the Chicago Match, as amended, an exemption from this rule <FOOTCITE>66</FOOTCITE>  because the orders that are eligible to be entered into the Chicago Match are not susceptible to the abusive practices that the rule was designed to prevent. The final Chicago Match rules do not allow short sellers to enter a liquidity fee, and thus any order to sell short is less likely to be used for manipulative purposes. Moreover, the current Chicago Match rules provide for order execution at midpoints between the spread, and therefore Chicago Match transactions will not change the inside market price. In addition, the Chicago Match pricing system is strictly derivative in nature and thus we believe it is unlikely to lend itself to short-sale abuses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 65 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (a) of Rule 10a&hyph;1 covers transactions in any security registered on a national securities exchange, if trades in such security are reported in the consolidated transaction reporting system. A short sale of a reported security listed on a national securities exchange may not be effected at a price either: (1) below the last reported price of a transaction reported in the consolidated transaction reporting system (``minus tick''), or (2) at the last reported price if that price is lower than the last reported difference price (``zero-minus tick''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 66 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A short sale is defined in Rule 3b&hyph;3 under the Act as any sale of a security that the seller does not own or any sale that is consummated by delivery of a security borrowed by, or for the account of, the seller. Rule 3b&hyph;3 further provides that a person shall be deemed to own a security only to the extent that the person has a net long position in that security. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Fifth, the Commission believes that the Chicago Match has adequate controls over non-member access. The Act contemplates that transactions on a national securities exchange would be conducted by ``members.'' Section 3(a)(3)(A) of the Act refers to transactions being conducted by various categories of exchange ``members.'' Section 6(c)(1) of the Act states that national securities exchanges shall deny membership to any person who is not a registered broker or dealer or any natural person who is not, or is not associated with, a registered broker or dealer. <FOOTCITE>67</FOOTCITE>  The Chicago Match, however, allows non-members to enter orders into the system if a CHX member is responsible for controlling and clearing these orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 67 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 3(a)(3)(A) of the Act also defines members as natural persons permitted to effect transactions on the floor of the exchange without the services of another person acting as a broker ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  an exchange member such as a registered trader). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that the Chicago Match does not violate the Act by allowing some limited non-member access to its system. First, a non-member entering orders may only do so after arranging with a CHX member to be legally responsible for the orders the non-member enters into the Chicago Match. The non-member must notify the CHX of this arrangement with the CHX member. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

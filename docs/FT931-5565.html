			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / People: Predator turned quarry Stuart Mitchell, managing director of the UK arm of New Zealand's Brierley Investments, has decided to give up the life of a corporate predator and become a full-time executive of one of his quarries. The 37-year-old New Zealand accountant has been appointed corporate development director of Alvis, the engineering group. Brierley, an investment group which specialises in taking strategic stakes in companies, had acquired a reputation for spotting under-valued stock market situations. Over the last few years it has held substantial stakes in companies such as Ultramar, Ocean Transport, Union Discount, William Low and Budgens. One of its more celebrated ventures was to try and persuade Vickers shareholders to support the demerger of its Rolls Royce car business before the onset of the recession. However, Brierley's UK stock market activities have been curtailed following its Pounds 644m takeover of Britain's Mount Charlotte hotel chain which left it heavily indebted. 'Over the last twelve months we have been very quiet' says Mitchell, who admits that his firm does not have a lot of cash for further investments. Brierley has a 29.9 per cent stake in Alvis and it is its second biggest UK investment. Mitchell has been a non-executive director of Alvis for two years and says that he knows the people and the problems at Alvis, which reported a small net loss last year and cut its dividend. Alvis says that Mitchell will be responsible for the acquisition and disposal of Alvis businesses as the group restructures.</p>

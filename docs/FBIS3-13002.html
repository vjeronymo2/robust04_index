			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tehran, March 5 (AFP)--Iranian President 'Ali Akbar  Hashemi-Rafsanjani and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen  pledged here Saturday to work together to ward off foreign  influence in Central Asia and the Middle East.    Hashemi-Rafsanjani, in a meeting with Qian, urged Iran and  China to play a "more active" international role in order to  ward off "interference" by Western powers.    "Such a goal requires planning, cooperation, and further  exchanges of views between the regional countries, particularly  Iran and China," Hashemi-Rafsanjani said, according to his  office.    The president urged Asian countries not to allow  "domineering  powers" to gain influence in Central Asian states and other  regional countries in the "guise of solving their problems."    The ex-Soviet republics of Central Asia are Tajikistan,  Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan.    Qian, who arrived here Friday at the head of a political and  economic delegation, said cooperation between Tehran and Beijing  had accelerated after the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran  "because of their common political views."    He agreed on the "need to resist" the influence of foreign  powers in the region, a reason for which China was "determined  to strengthen cooperation with countries like Iran," according  to Hashemi-Rafsanjani's office.    Qian stressed the "need to ensure peace and stability in  Central Asia to pave the way for economic progress" in the  former Soviet republics.    "China supports economic prosperity in these countries and  desires closer cooperation with Iran to solve regional crisis,"  he said.    Qian, who is here on the last leg of a tour of five Asian  and  Middle Eastern countries, is to leave for home Sunday.    An Iranian newspaper said Saturday that Tehran could serve  as  "Asia's Geneva" in solving the regional conflicts and urged  major Asian countries, such as China and India, to support the  idea.    "Tehran, a city synonymous with peace, possesses the  necessary qualities and the good will to realise the idea," the  English-language TEHRAN TIMES said.    Qian also held talks with his counterpart 'Ali Akbar  Velayati  and was to meet later with parliamentary speaker 'Ali Akbar  Nateq-Nuri.    The two countries were also expected to discuss expansion of  trade and economic cooperation and settling Iran's 100 million  dollars in overdue debt to China.    Bilateral trade stands at around 700 million dollars, with  China exporting 300 million dollars, mainly in machinery, and  importing 400 million dollars, mostly in oil and steel.    Tehran and Beijing could discuss Chinese participation in  several projects here, including the completion of the Tehran  subway and construction of several cement plants and dams  throughout Iran.    Newspapers said here in November that Tehran and Beijing had  agreed to undertake a 60-million dollar project for building a  copper foundry in southeastern Iran.    Iran and China are to launch a wide range of agricultural  cooperation projects including sending Chinese experts to help  in raising bees, fish and shrimp, according to Chinese sources.</p>

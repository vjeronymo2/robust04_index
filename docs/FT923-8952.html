			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / World Trade News: US offers 'open skies' to European airlines at a price THE US is offering to 'open its skies' to the airlines of European countries who give essentially free access to their markets to US carriers, Paul Betts and Reuter report. The move comes as US carriers press their government for new air pacts with EC countries. They want the administration to block the British Airways-USAIR equity partnership unless Britain is prepared to concede a more favourable aviation accord. The US move coincides with the advent of the single European air transport market next January and a transatlantic fares war. Mr Andrew Card, transportation secretary, said the 'open skies' efforts, including writing an 11-point definition, were focused on Europe because it was already moving toward free flow of passengers and goods. The administration hoped other regions would soon be ready to join similar talks. More liberal air pacts 'will move us closer to a truly open environment for international aviation,' he said. European carriers say they do not have the access they would like to the large US market. France and Germany are seeking to restrict US carriers which, they maintain, have an unfair advantage. The US department said 'open skies' would mean: unrestricted capacity and frequency on all routes, flexibility in setting fares; liberal charter and cargo arrangements; carriers could convert earnings into hard currency and return them home with no curbs; They could enter freely into commercial transactions related to their flight operations; open code-sharing arrangements, the right of a carrier to perform its own ground handling in the other country, and a pledge for non-discriminatory operation of and access to computer reservation systems.</p>

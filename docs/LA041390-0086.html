			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> LAGOMARSINO VISITS INSPIRATION FOR CHILD-CARE BILL  </P> <P> Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino paid homage Thursday to an innovative child-care  center in Ventura that has inspired a small part of the nation's developing  child-care policy.  </P> <P> But the Ventura Republican also took the occasion to say that he may eventually  vote against a child-care bill he helped write because of its overall cost.  </P> <P> At a press conference in Ventura, Lagomarsino thanked Anita Garaway, child-care  coordinator for Patagonia's employees, for helping him author a section of a  national child-care bill that passed the House of Representatives last month.  </P> <P> His section, co-authored by Rep. Nancy Johnson (R-Conn.), would provide $75  million a year to improve the quality of day care by paying model day-care  centers to help smaller, less-established centers.  </P> <P> "If you can magnify the effectiveness of a center like this," Lagomarsino said,  "then the child-care bucks would go a lot farther."  </P> <P> Patagonia, the manufacturer of outdoor and sports clothing, has won  considerable attention for offering discount child care since 1984 to its  employees through the Great Pacific Child Development Center.  </P> <P> Last year, Working Mother magazine listed Patagonia and its parent company,  Lost Arrow Corp., as one of the top 16 most desirable places to work.  </P> <P> The inspiration for Lagomarsino's bill came in 1988 when Lagomarsino  accompanied Johnson on a tour of the child-care center for 85 children, ranging  in age from 8 weeks to 12 years.  </P> <P> "She was impressed by what she saw," Garaway said. "We compared what we knew to  what she was seeing in Connecticut and one thing led to another. . . ." Garaway  ended up spending weeks on the phone with Lagomarsino's staff and ultimately  flying to Washington to help his staff draft separate legislation.  </P> <P> Later, Lagomarsino's bill was incorporated into the more comprehensive  legislation that passed the House on March 29.  </P> <P> Linking Garaway and Johnson in 1988 proved to be a political blessing for  Lagomarsino during his tough reelection campaign against a popular challenger,  state Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara).  </P> <P> Initially, Johnson had come to Ventura County on a short campaign swing to help  her Republican colleague. But the political marriage that spawned the  child-care legislation added an extra boost to Lagomarsino's reelection efforts  by robbing Hart of one of his issues. Hart has been a vocal leader on  child-care issues in the state Legislature.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Lagomarsino said that even though he authored part of the national  child-care legislation, he would be unable to vote for its final passage unless  Congress reduces its overall price tag.  </P> <P> The House bill, which directs most of its benefits to low-income working  parents, would cost $27.5 billion over five years. Among other things, it would  expand tax credits for parents with children in day care, enlarge grants for  child-care centers, set standards for child-care centers and create a new  school-based program before and after classes for "latch-key" children.  </P> <P> The Senate has approved a similar measure and a committee of lawmakers from  both chambers are expected to meet soon to iron out the differences in the two  versions.  </P> <P> But President Bush has threatened to veto any legislation unless Congress  dramatically reduces its cost. Lagomarsino indicated that he is not willing to  cross the president, the leader of his party, even though he has a personal  stake in the bill.  </P> <P> Lagomarsino's provision would establish 10 regional centers to spread their  knowledge and experience to neighboring child-care centers. Although the Great  Pacific Child Development Center inspired the idea, it would have to compete  with others for the limited grant money to become a regional center.  </P></p>

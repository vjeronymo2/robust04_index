			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: Downturn in Apple Computer earnings Apple Computer yesterday reported a 75 per cent drop in first-quarter net income as industry-wide price cutting in the personal computer market depressed its gross margins. Net income totalled Dollars 40m, or 34 cents a share, down from Dollars 161.3m, or Dollars 1.33 a share, in the same period of last year. Revenues, however, rose by 23 per cent to Dollars 2.47bn and unit shipments of Macintosh personal computers rose 40 per cent, passing the 1m mark for the first time in the company's history. The earnings figures, announced after the markets closed, were a little better than some analysts' forecasts. Gross margins for the company were 24 per cent of net sales, compared to 40.5 per cent in the same period of last year and about 26 per cent in the previous quarter. To compensate for lower margins, the company began a major restructuring last July. It said yesterday that this helped it cut operating expenses in the latest quarter to 21.4 per cent of net sales, from 28.5 per cent a year ago. Mr Michael Spindler, president, said: 'Our challenge is to continue to grow our unit shipments and revenues while we make further progress in reducing our operating expenses.' He said first-quarter revenue growth came in markets which were important to the future of the PC industry. In the US, shipments through consumer channels more than doubled compared with a year earlier. Internationally, shipments in Japan grew by more than 100 per cent. In the portable computer market, shipments of Apple PowerBooks were up strongly, with nearly 200,000 units sold worldwide during the quarter.</p>

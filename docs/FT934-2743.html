			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Fashion: Scarves: an alternative There is hardly a fashion editor who doesn't own a Georgina von Etzdorf scarf - but there are alternatives. Calver &amp; Wilson, for instance, go in for rich plain velvets, the most delectable in panne velvet. The scarves feature richly contrasting or toning borders. The range starts at Pounds 39.50, with children's versions at Pounds 12. The range is stocked at Browns of South Molton Street, London W1, Harrods of Knightsbridge, London SW1, Joseph, Liberty and other quality shops.</p>

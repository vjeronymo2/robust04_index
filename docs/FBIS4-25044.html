			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By N C Renoir] </F>   [Text] Guangdong authorities have banned visas for  foreign journalists until after tomorrow's fifth anniversary of  the Tiananmen massacre.    The propaganda section of the Guangdong party committee told  organisers of a Guangzhou trade show which had invited foreign  reporters to take part in its opening ceremony on June 4 that  reporters would not be allowed to come until June 6.    "They say this is too sensitive a time," Chen Guanghui of  the  Guangdong environmental protection bureau, the organiser of  Environment China '94, said.    Confirming the ban on foreign journalists, an official at  the  Hong Kong branch of the New China News Agency (Xinhua) said the  organisers should have checked with the Guangdong party  committee before issuing invitations for the ceremony.    "They should have been more aware of the situation," the  official said.    The Guangdong environmentalists appear to have been caught  unaware by the sensitive anniversary. The opening ceremony --  scheduled for the morning of June 4 -- has suffered from  withdrawals from at least two foreign government officials so  far, Chen confirmed.    The Environment Minister of the Canadian province of  Alberta,  Brian Evans, and the Australian consul-general in Guangzhou,  Maurine Chong, have both bailed out of the opening ceremony  after previously agreeing to attend.    Spokesmen for the two officials said they had other matters  to handle which came up unexpectedly.    Chen said that numerous senior officials from Beijing,  including the director of the National Environmental Protection  Bureau, Xie Zhenhua, have also cancelled plans to attend the  exhibition's opening ceremony.    Beijing is known to have placed a ban on travel by senior  officials during the period so they will be at their posts to  deal with any outbreaks of protests.    Travellers worldwide have reported difficulties recently in  getting individual travel visas, apparently part of China's  attempts to avoid an influx of journalists and overseas-based  dissidents into the country during the sensitive period.</p>

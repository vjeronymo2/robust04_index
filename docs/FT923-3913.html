			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Pound touches low with DM STERLING last night touched a new low against the D-Mark in the European exchange rate mechanism, amid continuing investor nervousness about a possible realignment of weak ERM currencies. In late European trading, the pound hit DM2.7808, a little more than a quarter of a pfennig above its DM2.7780 ERM floor, after a news agency report cited the German Bundesbank as saying the currency was a candidate for devaluation. Sterling gained ground later to DM2.7850, after the Bundesbank denied the content of the report. At the close of London trading, the pound had closed unchanged on the day at DM2.7875, a level it maintained in New York. Major stands firm, Page 8</p>

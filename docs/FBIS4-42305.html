			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd by </F> Julie Kirkbride in London; date not given]    [Text] Statesman, diplomat and even peacemaker are among  the more expected epithets applied to foreign secretaries, but  Douglas Hurd chooses to describe his role in international  affairs as "tradesman."    During his five-year stint at the Foreign Office, the  Diplomatic Service has been transformed from concerns about war  and peace to the more routine considerations of the trade  balance.    Sitting in the regal splendour of the Foreign Office, Hurd  explains: "Twenty years ago it would be some fellow down the  corridor who would deal with trade. But this is the life I now  lead. I've become a tradesman. It's extremely interesting and  I've learned a lot."    The change is largely the result of a joint initiative with  the Department of Trade and Industry, known as "Overseas Trade  Services," which began three years ago. The co-operative  venture has had an immense impact on the Diplomatic Service,  with the more senior ambassadors now devoting as much as a third  of their time to promoting British exports.    The export drive means that reporting back from a diplomatic  posting to the Foreign Secretary in London takes on a wholly  different dimension.    Mr Hurd explains: "Exports are a test of how well it's  going.  Every time I see an ambassador now, I have in my brief what the  exports are -- and the subject always comes round to that."    A fifth of British diplomats abroad are engaged fulltime in  commercial work, while nearly half of the locally-recruited  staff are businessmen and women employed as commercial officers,  actively seeking out opportunities for British exporters.    At present staff issue about 200 export-intelligence leads  every day which are faxed to a central clearing house, sorted  and sent directly to the relevant British businesses which have  subscribed to the service.    People abroad are matched by a staff of 100 specialist  export  promoters in London, seconded from blue-chip businesses, to seek  out overseas opportunities and follow up with assistance to the  exporting companies.    The services cost from 15 pounds up to 1,000 pounds  depending  on requirements. But they can be very effective. As a result,  Britain has sold vintage cars to Japan, electronics to Germany  and an authentic English pub to the Danes.    But Hurd also recognises a wider, more delicate, role for  the  diplomatic service. "The big foreign contracts become political  contracts," he says. As a result the ambassador is put "on the  front line between business and politics."    To win these contracts for Britain "it is important to know  who decides, who has his ear, what will influence the decision,  who is important to him and what our competitors are doing."    Such big prizes are often backed up by ministerial visits,  sometimes involving the pomp and ceremony of the Royal Family.    Last November, the Royal Yacht Britannia was moored in  Bombay  harbour in India while 1 billion pounds worth of contracts were  signed involving more than 300 British businessmen representing  100-plus firms. The Queen, Mr Major and the Indian premier  looked on.    In July, Michael Heseltine, the President of the Board of  Trade, will lead a similar delegation of businessmen to South  Africa.    Hurd believes British overseas exports could be about to  undergo a renaissance, capitalising on the country's early lead  in privatising public assets. His office points to Severn Trent  and North West Water who are supplying water to Mexico City,  while British Gas has signed a 300 million pound contract in  Chile to operate the Trans-Andean gas pipeline.    "I dare say we will make mistakes, but it's very exciting  witnessing a new generation of British investors and  entrepreneurs," he says.</p>

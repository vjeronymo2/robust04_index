			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW CALIFORNIA BATTLE: HEALTH CARE FOR ALL?  </P> <P> Even before the state Supreme Court decides the fate of last year's  auto-insurance initiative, economic forces are stockpiling political arms for  possible ballot-box warfare over a larger insurance issue -- health-care  coverage for every citizen of California.  </P> <P> In Sacramento, the immediate concern is insurance for 5.2 million Californians  who fall between the cracks, uncovered by their employers and ineligible for  government benefits. But a consumer coalition, fueled by recent successes with  the initiative process, is expanding the debate by propounding a ballot measure  that would guarantee all 28 million Californians state-provided health  insurance.  </P> <P> Since 1916, when progressive Gov. Hiram Johnson proposed a universal  health-insurance plan, Californians have periodically debated the issue, with  doctors, hospitals and other health-care providers fighting successfully  against what they call "socialized medicine."  </P> <P> There is general agreement on the principle that every Californian is entitled  to first-class health care without extreme economic hardship. From that point,  the debate centers on the proper role of government in converting principle to  reality.  </P> <P> Should government guarantee health care to everyone as a basic human right or  should its role be restricted to the aged, poor, blind and disabled? Should  government force employers to insure all employees and their dependents? Should  any public program include long-term care, prescriptions, eyeglasses and  dentistry?  </P> <P> Questions like these are now before the Legislature because the media have  dramatized the fiscal plight of the uninsured, medical costs are rising much  faster than inflation, and hard-pressed counties no longer wish to be the  health provider of last resort.  </P> <P> Most of all, the heat comes from a San Francisco-based coalition called Health  Access, which is developing a universal health-insurance initiative for the  1990 ballot. This 17-organization coalition is led by Lois Salisbury and  Maryann O'Sullivan, attorneys with Public Advocates, a law firm specializing in  pro-consumer class-action lawsuits.  </P> <P> Under a draft of the initiative, the state would provide health insurance to  every Californian "regardless of age, sex, health status or ability to pay."  Every citizen would choose between a variety of health plans that limit choice  of doctors and hospitals. A fee-for-service alternative would also be offered.  Canada uses a similar system, as does the state for 600,000 active and retired  employees and their families.  </P> <P> The literally $64-billion question: How would this system be financed? The  sponsors propose that the state go after funds now spent for the Medicare and  Medi-Cal programs and also levy a payroll tax of undetermined size.  </P> <P> For firms now providing coverage, the payroll tax presumably would be offset by  elimination of health-insurance costs. Employers without health plans would  feel the pinch.  </P> <P> The proposal is rife with problems that must be resolved: Will Uncle Sam be  willing to turn over all Medicare payments to the state? Will quality of care  be adversely affected by pressure to keep costs down? Will California become a  magnet for the nation's chronically ill? The coalition is using a bill by  Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles) as the vehicle for hearings designed  to answer these and many other questions about the proposal.  </P> <P> In theory, the proposal wouldn't eliminate the free-enterprise marketplace  because the state would only be paying insurance premiums, not hiring doctors  and running hospitals. But government and business would have an interest in  keeping costs down, and that could intensify the squeeze the state applied to  hospitals and physicians seven years ago in adopting health-care reforms.  </P> <P> The California Medical Assn., which represents most California doctors, is  attempting to defuse the Health Access plan by pushing a bill by Assembly  Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), which would take a big bite out of the  problem. Under the Brown bill, every business with five or more employees would  be required to provide health insurance for workers (but not their dependents).  </P> <P> That would place another 3 million Californians under the umbrella, leaving 2.2  million uncovered. These include dependents of the 3 million, those who work in  very small firms and self-employed persons.  </P> <P> Jay D. Michael, the association's chief lobbyist, says his organization and its  allies may place the plan on the ballot in 1990 if the Legislature rejects the  Brown bill. The main opposition is from small businesses, which would be forced  to pay billions of dollars to insure their employees. (Economists estimate  annual health costs at between $2,000 and $2,500 per Californian.)  </P> <P> That could produce a head-to-head conflict between rival health proposals  reminiscent of last year's free-for-all over auto insurance. The doctors are  betting that California voters won't buy a revolutionary plan if they can  choose a less disruptive alternative that will solve 60% of the problem.  </P> <P> If the ballot-box warfare materializes, Californians will find that feelings  will run far deeper than was the case with auto insurance, which dealt  primarily with dollars. The health-care controversy involves such basic values  as freedom of individuals from fear of economic disaster, freedom of employers  and employees to negotiate health benefits, and freedom of doctors and  hospitals to operate without government restrictions.  </P></p>

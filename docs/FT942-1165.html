			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Tepnel shares fall on higher losses Shares in Tepnel Diagnostics, the biotechnology company, fell 28p to 121p yesterday following the announcement of increased pre-tax losses for the six months to March 31. The shares have fallen from a high of 185p this year and are close to the price of 120p at which they were floated on the USM in September 1992, but below the 175p at which the company raised Pounds 2m in a placing in April this year. Pre-tax losses increased from Pounds 483,000 to Pounds 1.01m as a result of increased spending on research and development. Losses per share were more than doubled at 4.4p (2.1p). Since the period end, the company has launched one of its core products, Faras or food antibiotic residue analysis system. The company is intending to change its name to Tepnel Life Sciences 'to reflect the scope and potential of the company'.</p>

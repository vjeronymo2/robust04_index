			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "German General"] </F>   [Text] The Federal Government has nominated Major General  Manfred Eisele, 56, for a top position with the United Nations.  As an "assistant secretary general," he will control the  worldwide missions of blue-helmeted peace troops from UN  headquarters in New York. The nomination for the new leading  position prior to the ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court  on the admissibility of out-of-area missions of the Bundeswehr  led to controversies in Bonn between the Foreign Ministry, the  Defense Ministry, and the Chancellor's Office. In the  mid-1980's, Eisele, who was the commander of the Hamburg Armored  Infantry Brigade No. 17, discredited himself with his superiors.  TV reporters had asked recruits of his brigade what they would  do in the so-called defense case. The general had to defend  himself for the almost unanimous reply "clear off." When  Minister Volker Ruehe took office in 1992, Eisele was replaced  prematurely after no more than 12 months as the chief of the  Military Policy Department in the Defense Ministry, because he  was considered to be overtaxed. Since early April, he has been  chief of the Bonn Bundeswehr Office. In Defense Ministry  jargon, this authority has been derisively called the "soldiers'  cemetery," because it is where officers whom the Defense  Ministry wants to get rid of are transferred. Eisele went to New  York last week for an interview at the United Nations.  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali must yet confirm the  nomination for the influential post, which he wants to fill with  a German.</p>

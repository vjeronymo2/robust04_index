			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / BICC falls as Europe suffers downturn THE deepening recession on the European continent adversely affected BICC, the cables and construction group, which yesterday reported a 12 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the half-year to June 26. Sir Robin Biggam, chairman, said: 'In the last year, the continental European economies in which we operate have deteriorated rapidly. The rate of recovery in the UK and Australia has been disappointingly slow while the upturn in North America is only stuttering along.' Profits fell from Pounds 58m to Pounds 51m on higher sales of Pounds 1.95bn (from Pounds 1.77bn). The shares fell 14p to 403p. Around Pounds 4m of the fall in profits was due to the decision not to capitalise interest on property developments. The rest of the decline was mainly attributable to BICC Cables, the European business, where profits fell from Pounds 47m to Pounds 36m. It closed two factories at its loss-making operations in Spain and cut the workforce 22 per cent. This compares with a 20 per cent staff cut in the UK and 25 per cent in the US. Profits from the Italian and Portuguese operations also fell while the cable business in Germany broke even. North American cables reported a loss of Pounds 3m compared with a profit of Pounds 1m. A rationalisation programme in Canada is expected to yield annual savings of CDollars 10m (Pounds 5m). Australasia reported increased profits of Pounds 20m (from Pounds 13m) through increasing volumes and benefiting from a lower cost base. Balfour Beatty, the contractor, increased operating profits to Pounds 17m (from Pounds 15m). Sir Robin was encouraged by the increasing number of UK infrastructure projects involving the private sector but urged the government not to cut capital spending as way of bringing public spending under control. Sir Robin said offers, although inadequate, for part of the group's property portfolio, indicated the first 'chink of light' in the depressed property sector. Borrowings rose to Pounds 151m, partly because of acquisitions and disposals, giving gearing of 20 per cent. The interest charge was Pounds 16m (from Pounds 17m). Last year debt was wiped out from the proceeds of a rights issue. Earnings per share fell to 8.2p (from 11.2p). The interim dividend is held at 6p. Lex, Page 16 Analysis, Page 18</p>

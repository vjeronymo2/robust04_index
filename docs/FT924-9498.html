			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Russian bank chief returns Mr Viktor Gerashchenko was yesterday confirmed as chairman of the Russian central bank yesterday, returning to the role he held in the former Soviet Union, Leyla Boulton writes from Moscow. Mr Gerashchenko, who sees his role as including support for industry in the absence of capital markets, has spent a year out in the cold following the August coup and has survived a challenge from the newly-emergent Russian central bank while he was still chairman of the Soviet central bank.</p>

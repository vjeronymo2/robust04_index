			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhang Yuan] </F>   [Text] Unemployment on the mainland is rising as more  factory workers and government cadres are being laid off with  China's economy switching from its cradle-to-grave socialist  structure to a competitive market framework, a senior government  official says. Vice-Minister of Labour, Zhu Jiazhen, said  recently that the Government was facing increasing pressure to  find work for workers displaced because of the restructure of  the industrial sector.    Although China has claimed impressive economic growth this  year, many state enterprises faced a serious shortage of working  capital and some even had difficulty paying their workers after  the Government ordered the state-owned banks to restrict credit  as part of its anti-inflation policy.    In addition to finding employment for the displaced workers,  Mr Zhu said the Government was also under great stress to speed  up the establishment of a national insurance scheme to act as a  "safety net" for the unemployed. He said the top leadership  feared that the country could become unstable if unemployment  was not brought under control soon. While the Government would  try to create as many jobs as possible in a bid to make inroads  into unemployment, the authorities also hoped that more  displaced workers would be able to find work in the burgeoning  servicing industry.    He also admitted that China faced the problem of "hidden  unemployment" as Chinese enterprises abandoned their old  socialist management systems. Workers displaced by these  enterprises were often kept on the enterprises' payrolls but  they only received part of their usual salaries and were not  officially classified as "unemployed".</p>

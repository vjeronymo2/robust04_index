Churkin announced the meeting, to be held in the Russian  embassy here, after talks Wednesday with officials from Krajina.    The first task was to get them to sign a watertight  ceasefire  agreement to make sure there was no more fighting around  Serb-controlled zones under United Nations protection, he said.    Such an agreement already existed, but the two sides had for  "emotional and political reasons" refused to sign it so far,  Churkin said.    "People cannot make that final step towards peace, they are  so used to war that this final step is psychologically  difficult."    He told reporters that the announcement had been previously  worked out with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman "so it did not  come as a surprise to him."    He said his talks with both sides had proved difficult as  "mistrust is great on both sides."    "There are certainly some on both sides who believe that the  only way to go is by military means, which I happen to believe  very strongly is a catastrophe," he said. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Italian PM seeks emergency powers over economy: Amato may rule by decree during a crisis ITALY's embattled government is to seek emergency powers from parliament which would allow it to rule by decree in the event of economic emergency. The two-month-old coalition led by Professor Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, also announced a series of economic measures yesterday as it tries desperately to establish credibility in the face of a foreign exchange crisis. Prof Amato said the special powers would include the right to halt approved government spending or borrowing plans without parliamentary approval, to alter taxes and to speed investment in areas of the economy where it was considered necessary. After a long cabinet meeting, the government announced it would sell off shares in Credito Italiano, one of the country's top five commercial banks, and Nuovo Pignone, the heavy engineering company controlled by ENI, the state oil concern. The cabinet also approved a series of measures to tighten budgetary control and tax evasion, plus the abolition of tax exemption on Italian purchase of bonds issued by multilateral financial institutions such as the World Bank and European Investment Bank. For all future purchases, a 12.5 per cent tax will apply. With the Italian currency under persistent pressure for weeks on the foreign exchange markets, Prof Amato in a press conference last night stressed his government's commitment to defend the lira within the European Monetary System and reduce the country's huge budget deficit. Industrialists and bankers had pressed the government - following last week's 1.75 point rise in the discount rate to 15 per cent - to generate confidence by announcing a privatisation. The cabinet meeting was brought forward by two days in an attempt by the four-party coalition government to demonstrate to nervous financial markets evidence of a will to act. The government's intention to avail itself of special powers for quick action in the event of an economic crisis could have potentially far-reaching consequences. The proposal marks a recognition that Italy's existing parliamentary procedures are too slow for the necessary rapid decision-making at a time of financial turbulence. The law would permit the government to act by decree to, for instance, raise revenues once a 'neutral' party - defined as the governor of the Bank of Italy - accepted there was an economic crisis. Before the measures were announced, the lira slipped slightly against the D-Mark to close at L764.55 compared with L764.14. The Milan bourse rose nearly 2 per cent, while shares in Credito Italiano, buoyed by press leaks ahead of the announcement, jumped nearly 14 per cent, forcing trading in its stock to be suspended. 'The markets have been baying for blood, and maybe the government has given them a little of what they wanted,' said one banker. The decision on the privatisations was taken rapidly and the details of the sell-offs will take time to emerge. Credito Italiano is 67 per cent controlled by IRI, the state holding company which last month became a joint stock company. The bank, with total assets of L94,347bn at the end of 1991, has seen its shares rise 23 per cent in the last three days in what had been an otherwise depressed bourse. The bank earned net profits last year of L297bn. But investors were taken by surprise by the inclusion of Nuovo Pignone in the government's sell-off plans. The company last year turned in profits of L32bn on turnover of L1367bn.

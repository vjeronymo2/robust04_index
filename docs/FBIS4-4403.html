			<p>BFN     [Text] Pak Kil-yon, North Korean ambassador to the United  Nations, told reporters after the UN Security Council adopted  the president's statement on North Korea that, since North Korea  has fulfilled its duties under agreements with the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], it will not allow any kind of  inspection by the IAEA from this point of time [hyon sijomeso  oddon hyongtaeui IAEA sachalto hoyonghaji anul pangchimirago].    Ambassador Pak Kil-yon insisted that the adoption of the UN  Security Council president's statement will not help to resolve  the nuclear issue and he stressed the need to resume high-level  talks between North Korea and the United States, saying that  only North Korean-U.S. negotiations will help in resolving the  nuclear issue.    Meanwhile, a spokesman for the North Korean Ministry of  Foreign Affairs reacted negatively [pujongjogin panung] to the  Russian proposal for holding eight-party talks on the North  Korean nuclear issue, expressing concerns about the possibility  that it will complicate the issue.</p>

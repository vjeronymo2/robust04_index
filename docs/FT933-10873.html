			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Ex-ministers indicted in S Korea corruption drive TWO former South Korean defence ministers have been indicted for allegedly accepting bribes in connection with military contracts. The indictments followed a recent investigation by the government's Board of Audit and Inspection (BAI) into military procurement, which was conducted as part of the new civilian government's anti-corruption campaign. Mr Lee Jong-koo and Mr Lee Sang-hoon, both former military generals, served as defence ministers in the previous government of President Roh Tae-woo. General Han Chu-sok, a former air force chief of staff, was also indicted on bribery charges. Six executives were fined Won1m (Pounds 823) each for giving bribes to the officials. They include Mr Chung Mong-koo, the chairman of Hyundai Precision &amp; Industry and a son of the founder of the Hyundai group, Korea's largest conglomerate. Mr Chung is alleged to have bribed officials for contracts associated with the Korean K-1 tank, which is produced by his company. Other businessmen fined included the vice-chairman of Korean Air and an adviser to Samsung Aerospace Industries. The BAI probe was linked to efforts by President Kim Young-sam to curb the power of the military, which formerly ruled the country. Nineteen senior officers were recently purged for their role in the 1979 coup. Several former military chiefs also face charges of accepting bribes in return for granting promotions. It is widely believed, however, that military corruption was more widespread than that unearthed by the BAI. But its investigation was limited in scope because President Kim did not want to alienate the military further.</p>

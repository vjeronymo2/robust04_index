Currently construction has reached a zero  cycle, though the Russian Law on Environmental Protection  forbids "to locate, design, or construct nuclear power stations  near major bodies of water of republic importance." The station  is being built on a tectonic fault which has a high-level strata  of ground water, and the soil is geologically unstable,  resulting in washing away, sinkholes, and landslides. The KAES  pond is to be located on the bank of the Kostroma river, which  flows into the Volga. If radioactive waste seeps into the water,  the whole Volga area will be contaminated.    Not a single Russian reactor, including the KAES, passed  through state ecological experts; not a single one of them was  mass produced--each one was built as an experimental one because  neither technology was able to prove itself. No insurance  company in the world would take on the responsibility of  insuring Russian nuclear power stations.    In early 1993 the ecological movement "In the Name of Life"  attempted, for the first time, to conduct a referendum against  the construction of the KAES. Fifty thousand signatures were  collected in support of it from oblast residents. The idea of  the referendum was also supported by the Kostroma city council.    Similar referenda were conducted in Mordvinia and Nizhny  Novgorod Oblast. In Nizhny Novgorod it was decided to reorient  the construction to a different production line, in spite of the  fact that the reactor shop had already been completed. Mordvinia  decided not to build any stations at all.    The construction of the majority of new nuclear power  stations [AES's] in the Soviet Union was allowed by government  decrees of the 1970's. At that time no evaluation as to whether  it was economically feasible to construct such stations in their  intended locations was carried out. Chernobyl put a stop to all  construction. In 1991 the Russian Law on environmental  protection set forth a new decisionmaking procedure allowing  construction to begin and the criteria for choosing future  station locations.    Certain conditions are necessary for the construction and  operation of any nuclear station: adherence to the existing  legislation and sanitary norms in the design and construction as  well as a mandatory ecological analysis. The construction of  many Russian AES's was resumed after the 1992 decree of the  Russian Government. It describes the construction of the KAES  quite clearly: Accept the ministries' proposals "on completing  the work on engineering lines for the social infrastructure on  the KAES site in 1993." In October 1993 state ecological experts  rejected the draft "Comprehensive Program for the Development of  Russian Federation Nuclear Power Facilities Through 2010." The  construction of nuclear stations is continuing, however.    Some construction it is, too! The housing of the second  reactor of the Balakovskaya AES was dropped during its  installation, but only a superficial examination was done after  the incident. When laying the foundation, pads of local  limestone were used instead of marble ones, and ground water  started to react with them and erode them. The units are  settling unevenly and faster than expected by design, which  creates stresses in the structure.    Thirty years ago the idea was to replace crude oil and coal  with inexhaustible, cheap, and harmless nuclear energy. But the  idea proved to be unsound, from both the ecological and economic  points of view. Previously the cost of nuclear power failed to  include the cost of procuring and transporting raw materials,  and the expenses caused by accidents. The cost of burying a  used-up unit is approximately the same as that of its  construction. Nuclear energy is being nudged out of the  energy-producing market.  <H5>  The Future of the Dalnevostochnaya AES Will Be Decided by </H5> the People    The feasibility report on the Dalnevostochnaya [Far East]  nuclear power station which was prepared by the St. Petersburg  institute Atomenergoproyekt was handed over to the  administration of Khabarovsk Kray and Solnechnyy Rayon, the  intended location of the station. According to Yuriy Komov, head  of the Far East Center for Energy Problems, no decision has been  made yet on construction of the Dalnevostochnaya AES.    It is no secret that the eliminated kray soviet decided to  build or accommodate nuclear power facilities on its territory  only after the issue was presented to a kray referendum. Local  organizations of the Democratic Forces of Russia movement and  the "Greens" held several rallies demanding that the feasibility  report be submitted for public discussion. But currently, Yuriy  Komov thinks, it is unclear from the legal point of view who  ought to make the decision about building a nuclear power  station with four 440-megawatt units. At present time a public  commission is being set up under the kray administration that  will examine every aspect of the AES construction proposal.</p>

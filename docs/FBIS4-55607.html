			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jan Kurek, director of the Petrobaltic Oil </F> and Gas Prospecting and Extracting Company, by correspondent  Grzegorz Jasny; place and date not given]    [Text] [Jasny] Last month, after several years of  investigation, hard work, and negotiations, Petrobaltic was  granted a license to extract petroleum from under the Baltic Sea  floor. Initially, more than 100,000 tonnes of oil were extracted  from Sector B-3 in a so-called test production operation.  Full-scale industrial production is beginning now. How much  oil is there in the area designated Sector B-3?    [Kurek] The size of our oil deposits is an official secret.  One of the reasons for this is that these resources constitute a  part of our strategic reserve. All I can tell you is that,  during the first stage of operations, we will extract 500 tonnes  of crude oil per day from four wells. Once the field is fully  operational, we should be able to obtain 1,500-1,700 tonnes of  oil per day.    [Jasny] Petroleum extraction is one of the more profitable  economic undertakings, but it must be remembered that you have  had to bear very considerable costs associated with developing  the site for industrial extraction. Has this money been  recouped yet?    [Kurek] The money we made from the sale of the oil obtained  in the test production stage is not the only sum we have earned  so far. Our vessels also earned money by offering contract  services to North Sea oil-extraction enterprises, and the  profits from these operations were used to partly finance our  own current expenses. However, it is true that, recently, the  major proportion of our financial resources has come from the  sale of our own oil. We not only recouped the equivalent of the  outlays made to date but we were also able to ensure that the  company is largely independent financially, using little outside  assistance, and that we discharge all of our obligations in  respect of the state budget.    [Jasny] I understand from this that you ended the last  financial year with a profit. Is that correct?    [Kurek] It is.    [Jasny] As far as I know, extraction from the oil field you  are working at the moment is planned to continue for  approximately a dozen years. What will Petrobaltic do when that  is finished?    [Kurek] Our company's very name indicates two different  types of operations. The first is prospecting for crude oil and  other raw materials, identifying deposits, and estimating the  amount of raw materials found there. The second is extracting  these raw materials. Apart from developing the B-3 sector for  extraction, we have been carrying out parallel operations in  prospecting for and identifying further deposits of hydrocarbon  materials. We already know that there is a rather small oil  deposit north of Rozewie that could be economically viable for  extraction. To recap: Apart from our extraction operations, we  also carry out a program of identification and documentation of  further crude oil deposits, which we may develop for extraction  at some future point.    [Jasny] Your company intends not only to operate in the  Baltic area but also to extend its offer to the Asian seas.  Could you tell us a bit more about this project today?    [Kurek] A petroleum extraction company should not be run as  a provincial firm. It must be expansive and aim to actively  extend its field of operation. We are currently in the course  of negotiating cooperation in our particular business field with  the Baltic states. Everything indicates that we will be able to  work together with other oil companies in developing new  extraction sites belonging to these countries. Perhaps we will  also--together with other countries--search for and extract oil  deposits in the Asian seas. That would be an excellent start in  turning our company into an international business. Naturally,  I cannot release any details concerning the aforementioned  negotiations because these are always confidential.    [Jasny] Is your company sufficiently prepared to enter the  international scene?    [Kurek] We must meet three essential preconditions if we  want to be taken seriously in the international oil market. We  must employ credible professionals, we must have considerable  previous experience, and, finally, we must have sufficient  financial backing. Any bank will lend money to a healthy and  prosperous oil-extraction company. We do indeed meet all of  these conditions.    [Jasny] Nevertheless, your plans of expanding your business  operations to include other seas around the world are still at  the project stage, although I hope they will come true. But to  come back to the concerns of the present day, we should also  remember that all extraction operations carry with them an  ecological risk of damage to the environment. Have you made  sufficient precautions against--God forbid--some unwelcome  developments in that area?    [Kurek] From the very first stage of our operations--that  is, the gathering of information on potential deposits and the  designing of the proposed prospecting work--we pursue an  integrated environmental protection program. Our equipment  comprises machines and technical appliances that permit the  extraction of crude oil without damaging the natural  environment. We meet all of the requirements imposed on our  particular kind of operation by the Helsinki Convention. We  have at our disposal a range of state-of-the-art oil extraction  technologies. There are no better solutions anywhere in the  world. The system we use in Sector B-3 is fitted with multiple  safeguards, and there is practically no possibility that the  waters of the Baltic could become contaminated as a result of  our operations.    [Jasny] Thank you for talking with us.</p>

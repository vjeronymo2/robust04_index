			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Business and the Environment: Gaping holes in the safety net  -Last week's radiation leak in Russia could have occurred at dozens of sites in eastern Europe They represent one of the grimmest legacies of the old Soviet empire, but it took a radiation leak near St Petersburg last week to refocus public attention on the primitive safety standards in eastern Europe's nuclear power stations. The incident took place at Sosnovy Bor, one of the 16 Chernobyl-type nuclear plants which most international experts relegate to the category of those beyond hope. But there are many other reactors which western power plant builders feel could be upgraded, and the sooner the better. Because of their fundamental design flaws, there is broad agreement that safety standards at the Chernobyl-type (RBMK) reactors cannot be improved except at enormous cost. 'The only answer is to shut them down as soon as possible. What happened at Sosnovy Bor confirmed that,' says Adolf Huttl, head of the KWU power generation group of Siemens, the German company which is one of the world's biggest constructors of conventional and nuclear power plants. These 16 RBMK light water gas-cooled reactors have no containment structures of steel and concrete to stop or lessen the impact of radioactive leaks. Also, the numerous cooling channels in each reactor block are so arranged that the graphite used to moderate the reaction process can burn away dangerously in emergencies. Another disaster like that at Chernobyl six years ago - it rated the maximum of seven on the international nuclear accident scale against three for Sosnovy Bor - would be disastrous for the local population. For the nuclear industry, it would also be a further setback in terms of image - not just in Europe, but also in the US. There are 63 non-RBMK nuclear power stations to worry about; 42 are in operation and 21 under construction. It is these to which companies like Siemens, ABB, the Swiss-Swedish power engineering company, and Westinghouse of the US have directed their attention in the belief that safety could be improved in stages. This approach would spread the cost over several years and avoid the unthinkable alternative for the countries concerned of shutting down the plants and depriving millions of people of warmth and light. Czechoslovakia, for instance, obtains 28 per cent of its electricity from nuclear energy and Hungary as much as 50 per cent. The big problems are time and money. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is keen that nuclear safety in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and eastern Europe should be high on the agenda of the Group of Seven industrial countries' summit in Munich in July. Will this stimulate the west into rapid action? 'It will if the other six countries listen,' asserts Huttl. Any action, however, would have to go beyond the G7 nations, though they would bear the main load. Germany, most acutely aware of the problem since it borders on eastern Europe, does not want to finance the whole exercise alone. Huttl, who has been helping the Bonn government on this issue, envisages a three-stage plan which would cost roughly DM12bn (Pounds 4bn), involve a broad measure of international agreement on basic safety standards and their implementation, and could be under way in the mid-1990s if work is begun soon. Of the 42 non-RBMK nuclear plants, only the relatively recent VVER 230 pressurised water reactors are equipped with safety features comparable to those in the west. There are 18 of these 1,000 MW plants, of which 16 are in the CIS countries and two in Bulgaria. However, even these need proper controls to monitor changes in pressure and temperature and to trigger action in emergencies. Those in worst shape are the 10 type VVER 230s (440MW) built up to 20 years ago. There are four in Russia, four in Bulgaria and two in Czechoslovakia. These cannot be re-equipped for long-term operation over the next 10 to 20 years at reasonable cost. For one thing, they also have no proper containment. In west Germany, for instance, nuclear plants have a thick steel casing and an outer concrete dome to protect them from air crashes. In between come the VVER213s (also 440MW). These were mostly built at the end of the 1970s. There are 14 of them: four in the CIS countries, four in Hungary and six in Czechoslovakia. These have no proper containment structure, but do at least have a system for allowing pressure to escape. For all the VVER types, the stage-by-stage plan envisaged by Huttl is as follows: Stage one. With a quick start, the next 12 months could be devoted to installing relatively cheap monitoring equipment to detect water or steam leaks, cracks in metal and loose floating particles. These devices and sensors could be fitted for around DM5m per block, or a total cost of some DM200m for all 42 units. In emergencies, they would shut down the reactors. At the same time, international agreement must be reached on safety standard definitions for eastern Europe's nuclear power stations. This could best be done through the International Atomic Energy Authority in Vienna; the standards would form the basis of decisions by countries on what to do about their existing and future power stations. Stage two. Eastern European governments and utilities would work out what was needed for each plant. As well as modern controls and instrumentation, plants would need separate emergency core cooling systems, which would not necessitate rebuilding the whole plant. These would function during an accident. International experts would work with local engineers and officials to determine what should be done and the likely costs. Loan applications could then be made. At this stage, it is hard to say how the funds would be divided between government and private lenders. They would certainly need government guarantees. Huttl believes the obvious channel for the money would be the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Stage three. Around DM4bn of Huttl's estimated total would be for imports of equipment such as electronic controls and DM8bn for work done locally - the orders would be placed and the work begun. If all goes well, the main contracts could get under way in 1995 and be completed around 1997. In five years' time, therefore, the main problems with the Soviet-designed water pressure reactors could be solved, with monitoring devices put in early. The countries with the vulnerable nuclear plants do not have the money; the western nations do have the funds but their budgets are stretched. 'The sums of money are not unbearably high for the west and there is no time to waste,' believes Huttl.</p>

He called for a  halt to all terrorist operations when the month of Ramadan  begins, making this the starting point in the renunciation of  violence and aggression.    Defendant Hasan al-Hallawi -- a leading figure in the  Islamic  Group who is currently serving a prison term in connection with  the case of the Military Technical College and the murder of  Lieutenant Colonel 'Isam Shams during the events that took place  at the Adam Mosque in 'Ayn Shams in 1989 -- made these remarks  when commenting on his colleagues' statements of the past few  days, which promised more terrorist operations. In his message,  which he sent to us from behind bars, al-Hallawi says that  threatening to retaliate and murdering innocent and defenseless  people, both Egyptians and foreigners, are not approved of by  Islamic law, but are a distortion of jurisprudence and religion  and the result of an erroneous understanding of the shari'ah.  He urged terrorist elements to fear God and listen to the  counsel of the sincere ulema in this regard. He added: Any  party that fears talks has a weak argument, because dialogues  are the path taken by sane people so long as there is an  atmosphere of freedom, justice, and safety.    This open message to the terrorist groups is the first  response and show of sympathy by a prominent figure in these  groups. It shows the threat to them as a result of the  successful blows security forces have dealt their leaders in the  past week, in which they lost important cadres in their military  wing.    It should be recalled that defendant Hasan al-Hallawi had  escaped to and resided in an Arab country. He was among the  elements responsible for sending money to their cadres in Egypt  before he was arrested and deported to Egypt two months ago  along with a group of his associates.</p>

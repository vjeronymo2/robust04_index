			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jordan Kostadinov, chairman of the Ilinden </F> United Macedonian Organization, by Valeriya Veleva; place and  date not given: "Whoever Tries To Prove Macedonians Are  Bulgarians Is Waging Propaganda for War in the Balkans"; first  paragraph gives biographical details that appear in a box  together with 1.5 x 1.5-inch photograph of Kostadinov]    [Text] Yordan Kostadinov was born in the village of  Ilindentsi, in Sandanski district. He used to work as a teacher  of mechanical engineering. At the constituent meeting of the  Ilinden OMO [United Macedonian Organization], held on 14 March  1990 in the town of Sandanski, he was elected deputy chairman of  the organization. Later, after the Ilinden OMO split, he was  elected chairman of the extreme right wing.    [Veleva] Mr. Kostadinov, what are the aims of the Ilinden  OMO?    [Kostadinov] During the four years since its formation, the  Ilinden OMO has campaigned for the granting of national rights  to the Macedonians. We are entitled to seek our rights, and not  to be oppressed by those who want to ensure that the voice of a  Macedonian declaring that he is a Macedonian is not heard. What  we have been subjected to was a genocide and an assimilation.  So far, over 150 of our people have been beaten by the  authorities. Where is Bulgarian democracy going? Their  propaganda describes us as riffraff, as crazy people, and yet we  have winegrowers, tractor drivers, engineers, and teachers among  our members. You media people incite the violence that the  government and the authorities are practicing against us. What  you are doing is covered by Bulgaria's Penal Code. The Ilinden  OMO is a defender of national minorities, and whoever tries to  prove that Macedonians are Bulgarians is waging propaganda for  war in the Balkans!    [Veleva] However, according to the Constitution, Bulgaria is  a one-nation state, so on what basis do you claim that a  Macedonian national minority exists?    [Kostadinov] Look here, it is distinguished by its own  culture, its own mentality, its own peculiarities, spirituality,  and needs, in that it does not want to live oppressed by these  Bulgarian policies and propaganda. This is what I mean.    [Veleva] How do Bulgarian policies oppress you?    [Kostadinov] Our population lives in a state of stress and  neurotic fear. Old women still cover their heads with black  scarves. What are we to say about this? How can I allow myself  in my life to bear candles and flowers, and then you come along  and beat me about the head. This is madness!    [Veleva] Is your home village within the borders of  Macedonia or Bulgaria?    [Kostadinov] Within the borders of Macedonia.    [Veleva] In which language are you speaking at the moment,  Mr. Kostadinov?    [Kostadinov] Language?... Look here now, we will not come  to blows about the language. What language do the people of  Radomir speak? I listened to some Ukrainians talking, and I  understood them better than people from Radomir. We did not  borrow the Macedonian language from our neighbors the Serbs or  the Bulgarians, because we in fact gave our neighbors their  written language. Macedonia was never occupied by the First or  Second Bulgarian Kingdoms. Our language is the oldest in this  region.    [Veleva] Who created the Macedonian language?    [Kostadinov] My God! You... I am sorry that I cannot speak  to you as melodically as my grandmother and grandfather did. I  at least have heard comments from old people who have been in  Bulgaria and said that the people there did not understand their  language. Are you trying to provoke me now? As long as this  nation has existed, it has spoken its own language. Did you  send textbooks to Preslav? Did you send us the alphabet? Did  you open schools in the sixth, seventh, and eighth centuries?  Why do you pick on these matters?    [Veleva] Who is your favorite author?    [Kostadinov] Krustyo Misirkov, who speaks in the Macedonian  language. Read his book; if you do not have it, we will send  you a copy so that you can find out what he writes. His book  was published in Sofia and then forgotten. You see now, bans  and harassment have existed for more than 70 years. Our  politics have remained the same.    [Veleva] How many members does your organization have?    [Kostadinov] In Pirin Macedonia [part of Bulgaria] there are  400,000-500,000. As regards how many members we have, we cannot  tell you, because we do not want to. However, 70-80 percent of  the population of Pirin Macedonia support us, but will not say  so under the risk of fear. We simply want to avoid bloodshed.    [Veleva] In your view, does a Macedonian nation exist, and  who created it?    [Kostadinov] So far four uprisings have shed rivers of blood  for the Macedonian nation and the Macedonian state. You should  ask our ancestors whether they were a nation of puppets of  various foreign propaganda. The Macedonian nation was born at  the same time as the Bulgarian one -- at some time in the 12th  or 13th centuries, or so I have read. You did not give us our  letters, nor teachers, nor books and culture, and you borrowed  your language from us. We now want to save this region from  becoming a second Bosnia.    [Veleva] What were the nationalities of Cyril and Methodius,  Kliment Okhridski, Gotse Delchev, and Yane Sandanski?    [Kostadinov] They were all Macedonians, no question of it.  It is ridiculous to say that Gotse Delchev was a Bulgarian.  Our grandfathers remember him. You must have read Peyo  Yavorov's memoirs. You suggest Yane Sandanski was a Bulgarian?  That is preposterous! What can we say about this?    [Veleva] From where does your organization derive its funds?    [Kostadinov] Let the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] and  Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] say where they get their  millions and their fine technical equipment from, let the  Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization [VMRO] say how it  is financed, and then ask me this question again. We get our  finance from companies. We are now entitled to ask the  Bulgarian Government for money.    [Veleva] Why does your program include the words "withdrawal  of the Bulgarian occupation forces from Macedonia"?    [Kostadinov] What do you mean, why? We know that in 1912  Macedonia was divided between three states. If Macedonia had  been Bulgarian, then Bulgarian politicians would not have dealt  with it the way they did; if it had been Greek, the Greeks would  now be offering us a helping hand. The same goes for the Serbs.  Macedonia represents spoils of war for Bulgaria, and the more  territory we annex, the more of our country we will lose, and  the sooner we will start a war to grab more territory.    [Veleva] Why do you constantly talk about possible  bloodshed?    [Kostadinov] The propaganda is leading toward this.  Relations are deteriorating. You should give up this  propaganda and grant us our rights.    [TRUD editorial note] (The interview is reproduced without  editorial intervention.)</p>

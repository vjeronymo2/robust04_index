			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROUND BEEF FAT AND LEAN CONTENT SAME IN ALL STORES  </P> <P> Although ground beef is consumed by more Americans than any other meat, about  the only thing a consumer can be sure of is the fat and lean content of regular  ground beef.  </P> <P> Buy lean, extra-lean or super-lean ground beef and the percentage of lean meat  (and, therefore, fat content) will vary from store to store.  </P> <P> Sometimes, percentages won't even be marked, leaving the customer to guess how  much fat or lean meat is contained in packages labeled simply, "ground round"  or "ground chuck."  </P> <P> Leroy Corbin, director of the Bureau of Foods and Chemistry for Pennsylvania's  Department of Agriculture, explained, "Ground beef may not contain more than  30% fat.  </P> <P> "There are no standards for lean and extra-lean ground beef. However, under  normal labeling interpretation and that of the law, it is fair to interpret  that lean would have to have less fat than the store's regular ground beef and  that extra-lean must contain less fat than the lean."  </P> <P> The ground beef problem has raised the ire of at least one Washington-based  consumer lobbying group. Bonnie Liebman, of the Center for Science in the  Public Interest, said, "Never mind that no other food contributes more fat to  the average diet. Never mind that the Surgeon General and other health  officials have been nagging consumers to 'choose lean meat.' The fact is that  the states don't require 'lean ground beef' to be truly lean."  </P> <P> She explained, "The U.S. Department of Agriculture says 'lean' meat can have no  more than 10% fat (by weight) and 'extra-lean' no more than 5%. But these  policies don't apply to ground beef.  </P> <P> "In fact, the average fat content of 'lean' ground beef sold in supermarkets  nationwide is not 10%, it's 21. The average 'extra-lean' is not 5% fat, it's  17."  </P> <P> Liebman urged consumers to do some lobbying. She advised, "If your meat market  doesn't display the fat content, tell the store that you and your friends want  to know how much fat is in the ground beef you're buying. If other stores in  the area disclose the fat content of their ground beef, make sure your store  knows about it.  </P> <P> "Then write to the head of the State Department of Agriculture and urge that  retailers be required to:  </P> <P>  -- Restrict "lean" claims to ground beef with no more than 10% fat by weight.  </P> <P>  -- Limit "extra-lean" claims to 5% fat or less.  </P> <P>  -- Prominently disclose the fat content on labels of all ground beef."  </P> <P> There are several ways butchers can make sure their basic ground beef complies  with the 70% lean standard.  </P> <P> Corbin explained, "Some butchers use a pocket-sized color comparison chart that  can be held next to ground beef to check the degree of redness. It comes pretty  close when it comes to accuracy.  </P> <P> "With experience a butcher will also know if his beef is in compliance. Some  operations also buy coarse ground beef from a USDA-inspected processing plant.  Products from that plant will be labeled concerning the percentage of fat and  lean. The in-store butchers then can add some trimmings from the store.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COOK IT LIGHT: NEW PIE CRUST RECIPE TAKES CARE OF PROBLEM  </P> <P> DEAR JEANNE: I have a recipe for a perfect pie crust. It makes several crusts  and can be frozen. Is there any way to lower the fat and cholesterol but still  keep the same idea? I don't make pies that often so I would settle for just  some improvement in the recipe. Would you be interested in trying it? -- P.J.,  Downers Grove, Ill.  </P> <P> PERFECT PIE CRUST  </P> <P> 4 cups flour  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon sugar  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons salt  </P> <P> 1 3/4 cups shortening  </P> <P> 1/2 cup water  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon vinegar  </P> <P> 1 egg  </P> <P> Place flour, sugar and salt in large bowl and mix well with fork. Add  shortening and mix with fork until ingredients are crumbly.  </P> <P> Beat together water, vinegar and egg in small bowl. Add to flour mixture,  stirring with fork until all ingredients are moistened.  </P> <P> Divide dough in 5 portions. Shape each portion with hands into flat round patty  ready for rolling. Wrap each in plastic or wax paper and chill at least 1/2  hour.  </P> <P> When ready to roll pie crust, lightly flour both sides of patty. Place on  lightly floured board or pastry cloth. Cover rolling pin with stocking and rub  in small amount of flour. Keeping pastry round, roll from center to 1/8-inch  thickness and 2 inches larger than inverted pie pan.  </P> <P> Fold in halves or quarters. Transfer to pie pan, unfold and fit loosely in pan.  Press with fingers to remove air pockets. Trim overhanging edge of pastry about  3/4 inch from rim of pan, fold under and flute pastry with fingers or press  firmly around edge of pan with tines of fork, dipped in flour occasionally to  prevent sticking.  </P> <P> Fill and bake as desired in individual recipe. (For baked pie shell, pierce  bottom and sides of pastry with tines of table fork. Bake on rack in center of  oven at 450 degrees 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on cake rack,  then fill as desired.)  </P> <P> DEAR P.J.: This pie crust recipe is indeed foolproof. Unfortunately, the  ingredients that assure its flaky texture and ease of handling are also the  very ones you want to reduce. After several attempts, I think I have come up  with an acceptably flaky and lower-calorie and lower-cholesterol pie crust.  </P> <P> You will notice that I have reduced the yield from five crusts to two, so you  don't have to make so much of it at any one time. Also, my revised crust should  not be handled more than is necessary or it will become tough. In this regard  it is not quite as perfect as the original, yet it does solve your problem  perfectly. -- JEANNE  </P> <P> PIE CRUST  </P> <P> 2 cups unbleached flour  </P> <P> 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1/2 cup cold corn-oil margarine  </P> <P> 1 1/2 teaspoons vinegar  </P> <P> 1 egg white  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons ice water  </P> <P> Place flour, sugar and salt in large bowl and mix well with table fork. Add  margarine and mix with fork until ingredients are crumbly.  </P> <P> Beat together vinegar and egg white with fork in small bowl. Add to flour  mixture and stir until all ingredients are moistened. Add water, 1 tablespoon  at time, stirring until dough forms pieces size of dimes.  </P> <P> Divide dough into 2 portions and shape each portion with hands into flat round  patty ready for rolling. Wrap each in plastic or wax paper and chill at least  1/2 hour before rolling.  </P> <P> When ready to roll pie crust, lightly flour both sides of patty.

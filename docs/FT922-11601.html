			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (9): A time to pick stocks with care - Recessions end eventually, and analysts remain convinced that, in the medium term, equities will outperform fixed-interest and cash THERE IS no prize for naming the most bombed-out equity market in the first quarter of 1992. Japan, as measured by the 225-share Nikkei Average, ended a truly dismal three months at its lowest level for more than five years; while the wider Topix index dropped below 1,400 for the first time since November 1986. Fund managers overweight in the Japanese market will have a tough time in quarterly investment reviews with their trustees, and it may take a lot more than talk of 'buying bargains at the bottom of the market' to sound convincing. Tokyo has been a sinking bottom. In terms of total returns in sterling, based on the FT Actuaries World Index, Japan showed a whopping minus 16.5 per cent in the January-March quarter - one of only three markets (the others being election-wobbly UK, and Denmark) to produce a negative return. Europe, excluding the UK, showed a useful 7.5 per cent return; the Pacific region, excluding Japan, almost double at 13.5 per cent. Sterling investors in Mexico continued their roller-coaster ride, with a total return over the quarter of almost 34 per cent. Malaysia had a very positive 20 per cent; the French market more than 11 per cent; and Germany, despite problems and fears over unification, just over 9 per cent. As ever, stock selection was almost as important as country allocation. Winners here included media stocks, automobiles, forestry and paper products, and chemicals; but most markets gave a thumbs-down to banks and other financial institutions, heavy engineering and textiles. The capital-goods economic group overall managed almost a 3 per cent total return, with some tentative signs of companies feeling a little more optimistic about growth prospects, especially in the US. Italy, like Britain, had election fever. Fund managers overweight in Japan had been reduced to praying and hoping that the authorities there would intervene to at least stabilise the market; and indeed, there was a move in Tokyo on April 1, when the Bank of Japan cut the official discount rate by 75 basis points (50 had been the market's average forecast) and the government unveiled an emergency economic package, in essence bringing forward some scheduled capital investment. But the market's first response was a yawn - and a further 4 per cent slide in the Nikkei Average, the main Japanese index which three years ago threatened to break through the 40,000 mark. But is it all doom and gloom ahead? Most market-watchers think not. Despite the current economic uncertainties, analysts remain convinced that, in the medium term, equities will continue to outperform fixed-interest and cash. Recessions, however deep and prolonged (as in the UK) eventually end, and markets are expected to anticipate the upturns, often by as much as a year or more. They are even taking some consolation from Japan, arguing that if the Nikkei was worth buying at 35,000-plus, there must be bargain-basement deals to be done at around the 20,000 level. The markets have been a shade over-optimistic about a decline in interest rates in Europe, given the tough stance of the Bundesbank on German monetary policy, but the national wage rounds there should be over by mid-year, holding out the prospect of a cut in German rates, which should allow other European markets to follow suit. The discipline of the ERM is likely to herald a period of moderate inflation levels, and the OECD is beginning to make optimistic forecasts of GNP growth in the main markets for 1993. Some recent US economic data is modestly encouraging. The second quarter has started with many markets in a cautious mood, and investors playing for the short term would do well to be overweight in cash. It might not be bad advice either for the more cautious fund managers, at least until the present uncertain investment dust settles.</p>

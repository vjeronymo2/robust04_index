			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town May 13 SAPA -- University of the Western  Cape [UWC] Rector Professor Jakes Gerwel will leave the  university next Tuesday to become director-general in the office  of President Nelson Mandela.    UWC spokesman Stan Ridge said the Senate and University  Council had met to approve Prof Gerwel's transfer to the  president's office. Vice-Rector Prof Jaap Durand, who was due to  retire in June, has been appointed acting rector until the end  of this year.    Historian Prof Colin Bundy becomes acting vice-rector and  deputy vice-chancellor for the same period.    Prof Ridge said Prof Gerwel, who was due to leave the  rectorate to take up a research position at UWC in 1996, had  been personally approached by Mr Mandela to head his office.</p>

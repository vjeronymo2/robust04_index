			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RED SCHOENDIENST, AL BARLICK ELECTED TO HALL OF FAME BY VETERANS COMMITTEE  </P> <P> Red Schoendienst, a sure-handed second baseman who led the National League in  fielding seven times, and former umpire Al Barlick were elected to the Baseball  Hall of Fame Tuesday by the veterans committee, but Phil Rizzuto was snubbed  once again.  </P> <P> Schoendienst, 66, spent 18 years in the major leagues -- 14 with the St. Louis  Cardinals -- and batted over .300 seven times. He also managed the Cardinals  from 1965-76, winning pennants in 1967 and '68 and a World Series title in '67.  </P> <P> "My wife thought I should be in a long time ago, but that's wives,"  Schoendienst said from his apartment in St. Petersburg, Fla., where the  Cardinals are in spring training.  </P> <P> Barlick, 73, known for his booming voice on balls-and-strikes calls, was one of  the youngest umpire to make it to the majors when, at 25, he was called up to  the National League in 1940. Barlick spent 27 full seasons in the league.  </P> <P> "I think it's a miracle that I got in," Barlick said by telephone from his home  in Gilbert, Ariz., where he is working as an umpire consultant for the National  League. "Other than that, I really don't have anything to say."  </P> <P> Rizzuto was the American League's most valuable player in 1950 for the New York  Yankees.  </P></p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures did little more than mark time in dull trading volume, making few attempts to lead the cash market, either up or down, writes Jeffrey Brown. The FT-SE 100 December contract was 3140 when pit trading came to an end, up 4 points. On the week the December contract has risen a net 62 points. Volume was again flat with 10,236 contracts traded, against 10,522. At the official 4:10 close, the premium to the cash market was 10 points or three points more than fair value.</p>

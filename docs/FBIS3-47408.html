The statistics compilers also cited as a factor in the  economic ordeal a decline in supplies from Russia of materials  used for manufactured goods.    Cattle breeding, the nation's key industry, suffered a bad  year due to the unusually cold spring, with the number of  livestock plunging 520,000 to 25.17 million.    Industrial production tumbled 13 percent, while the jobless  rate rose to 8 percent.    Retail prices saw a 2.8-fold increase. The price level was  18.4 times higher than 1991.    Last year's merchandise trade also shrank 10.5 percent from  a  year earlier to 722.4 million dollars in terms of value.    Exports totaled 360.9 million dollars and imports came to  361.5 million dollars, leaving the nation with a slight trade  deficit.    Borrowings from international institutions and other  countries amounted to 38.1 million dollars and grants 55.7  million dollars. Japan was the biggest donor, accounting for  more than half of the borrowings and 37.7 percent of the grants.</p>

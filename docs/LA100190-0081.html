			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANALYSTS PREDICT DEAL WILL TRIGGER SHORT-TERM DAMAGE TO ECONOMY;  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: BUDGET NEGOTIATORS BELIEVED THAT THEY HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO FORGE  AHEAD. THE TRUE TEST OF THE PACT IS EXPECTED SOON ON WALL STREET.  </P> <P> The new budget accord may be just what the doctor ordered for the nation's  ailing economy but the patient is likely to get a lot worse before it gets  better, government and private analysts said Sunday.  </P> <P> Although almost every economist has long prescribed a reduction in federal  borrowing, several expressed fears that the short-run impact will be negative,  nudging the economy ever closer to a recession.  </P> <P> "The economy is so weak right now that the last thing you want to do is hit it  over the head with a massive dose of fiscal restraint -- but that's what  they've done," said Irwin Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover  Bank in New York.  </P> <P> "You have to be honest and admit there will be a modest short-term  contractionary effect," Benjamin Friedman, a Harvard economist who has long  been a fervent proponent of cutting the deficit, said Sunday.  </P> <P> "The problem is that higher taxes and lower spending affect the economy  immediately, while lower interest rates take time to boost economic  investment," he explained.  </P> <P> Whatever the immediate damage to the economy, however, budget negotiators here  believed that they had no choice but to forge ahead.  </P> <P> Officials are hoping that their resolve -- which could easily have been  diverted by arguments that the Persian Gulf crisis should let them off the hook  once again -- will assuage financial markets that have long urged Washington to  produce a credible long-run deficit-reduction pact.  </P> <P> They also are hoping that the increased leeway on the budget will prompt  Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to ease interest rates.  </P> <P> "This is not a phony smoke-and-mirrors program," said Senate Finance Committee  Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.). "It ought to signal the Federal Reserve to  ease up in interest rates and start stimulating the economy."  </P> <P> But the Fed, which appears to be more worried about reviving inflation, is  likely to move cautiously as long as the dollar remains weak and oil prices  remain high.  </P> <P> To be sure, budget negotiators did not overlook the possibility that the harsh  medicine contained in the budget agreement might prove risky.  </P> <P> Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M.) conceded Sunday that the new budget accord "has  a lot of pain in it," but insisted that "the result is good for the country."  </P> <P> "While things may not tomorrow morning get better," Domenici added, "this  package is ultimately healthy for the American economy. . . . I'm convinced,  having worked on this kind of thing, that we'd better do it because we won't  get another chance."  </P> <P> The economic forecast that the budget negotiators published Sunday shows  precisely this sort of pattern.  </P> <P> Economic officials now expect the U.S. economy to eke out a bare 0.7% gain in  1990 -- essentially an acknowledgement that a recession is possible in the  months ahead -- before slowly recovering at a 1.3% pace in 1991 and 3.8% in  1992.  </P> <P> They also show the inflation rate -- expected to reach 5.21% in 1990 -- slowing  to 4.6% in 1991 and 3.4% in 1992.  </P> <P> If the projections prove accurate, President Bush should benefit from the  visibly improved economic situation in time for his reelection campaign in  1992.  </P> <P> But a lot of conservatives are convinced that Bush is making a fatal error in  signing a deficit-reduction pact that does not contain his long-sought capital  gains tax cut.  </P> <P> "This is a bad deal for the economy," said Jude Wanniski, known for his early  advocacy of former President Ronald Reagan's "supply-side" tax program.  "Getting the capital gains rate reduced and indexed is the only way of pulling  the economy out of its slump."  </P> <P> Many Republican lawmakers echoed Wanniski's views. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher  (R-Lomita) termed the package "a road map to recession" and added: "It's a  cave-in to the Democratic big spenders. . . . It's ridiculous. The system's  broken down."  </P> <P> Most economists, however, said that the true test of the deficit accord will  come soon on Wall Street.  </P> <P> If investors think the budget agreement will substantially reduce the federal  government's long-term borrowing needs, opening up fresh credit for private  investment, they could drive interest rates down in the bond market this week.  </P> <P> That will provide a glimmer of hope as Congress debates whether to approve the  budget measure.  </P> <P> "If financial markets believe this will put the government on the track of  smaller deficits in the future, they could provide a lot of latitude for the  Fed to ease," said Jerry Jordan, chief economist at First Interstate Bank in  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHAT THE ACCORD CONTAINS  </P> <P> Here are the major elements of the five-year, $500-billion budget deficit  reduction accord that President Bush and key congressional leaders announced on  Sunday:  </P> <P> Savings from domestic benefit programs: $119 billion.  </P> <P> * Requires 33 million Medicare recipients to pay more for health coverage. The  $28.60 doctor's care premium, which currently covers 25% of the cost, would  increase by $5.70 per month next year, and rise in steps for five years until  it covers 30% of the cost. The yearly deductible for hospital costs doubles to  $150. Saves $30 billion.  </P> <P> * Imposes new Medicare cost-cutting requirements on doctors and hospitals to  save $30 billion.  </P> <P> * Limits subsidies to farmers to save $13 billion.  </P> <P> * Eliminates civil service lump sum retirement payments for $8.1 billion in  savings.  </P> <P> * Reforms student loan program to save $2 billion.  </P> <P> * Requires Postal Service to cut $4.2 billion from costs.  </P> <P> * Delays unemployment insurance payments for 2 weeks, saving $4.6 billion.  </P> <P> * Reforms federal housing programs to cut costs by $2.5 billion.  </P> <P> Tax changes: $133.8 billion.  </P> <P> * Raises the gasoline tax to 19 cents a gallon from 9 cents in two  5-cent-per-gallon jumps.  </P> <P> * Adds a new tax on petroleum of 2 cents per gallon, which in turn affects  gasoline prices.  </P> <P> * Increases tobacco taxes from 16 cents to 20 cents next year; 24 cents in  1993.  </P> <P> * Raises levies on alcoholic beverages.  </P> <P> * Boosts airline ticket tax from 8% to 10%.  </P> <P> * Imposes a new luxury tax on purchases of expensive autos, furs, jewelry,  private airplanes and boats.  </P> <P> * Boosts salary cap on payroll taxes (1.45% out of total 7.65% Social Security  tax) from $51,300 to $73,000 to help cover Medicare costs.  </P> <P> * Limits itemized deductions for those with incomes above $100,000.  </P> <P> * Requires insurance companies to pay an extra $2 billion a year in taxes.  </P> <P> * Requires state and local employees to start paying Medicare taxes.  </P> <P> Domestic programs: Capped.  </P> <P> Non-military programs subject to annual appropriations would be held to the  projected rate of inflation. Any new programs must be introduced on a  pay-as-you-go basis.  </P> <P> Interest on the national debt.  </P> <P> Savings on interest due to lower borrowing needs would total an estimated $64.8  billion over the five-year period.  </P></p>

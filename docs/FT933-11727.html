			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Arts: Today's Television However tedious and repetitive television may be at the moment, you can hardly complain of lack of choice on radio, at least where music is concerned. At 7.00 in 'Folk On 2' Jim Lloyd introduces a group which has a new name, the Band of Hope, though four of its members have known one another for decades: Martin Carthy, Dave Swarbrick, John Kirkpatrick, and Roy Bailey. Steafan Hannigan joined slightly later to add 'a new dimension'. In the pop world of the 1970s they would have been known as a 'super group'. At 7.30 in BBC Proms Radio 3 offers one of Mahler's little efforts, the 6th Symphony, which lasts a mere 90 minutes, played by the BBC Welsh Symphony Orchestra under Tadaaki Otaka. If that seems too hefty, Classic FM's Evening Concert (8.00) is lighter: the Brahms Variations on a Theme by Haydn, Franck's Symphonic Variations, and Reger's Variations and Fugue on a theme of Mozart. On The Line (8.30 BBC2) investigates overtraining by top athletes. New research suggests that it may weaken the immune system dangerously, even fatally.</p>

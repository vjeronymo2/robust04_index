			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FHWA Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The FHWA agrees that there is a serious question whether the proposal to allow States to treat containers in international commerce as nondivisible loads is consistent with the Intermodal Safe Container Transportation Act of 1992 (Safe Container Act) (Pub. L. 102&hyph;548, 106 Stat. 3646, partly codified at 49 U.S.C. 508).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Briefly, the Safe Container Act requires the party tendering a loaded intermodal container or trailer with a cargo weight in excess of 10,000 pounds to provide the initial carrier a written certification of the cargo weight and a reasonable description of the contents. Each carrier in the intermodal chain is required to transmit the certification to the next carrier. Motor carriers are prohibited from hauling loaded intermodal containers or trailers subject to the Safe Container Act without receiving a certification. It is also illegal to coerce a motor carrier to haul such a container or trailer (1) without a certification or (2) when the certified weight would make the combination vehicle exceed applicable State weight limits. There are two statutory options if State enforcement personnel discover an overweight tractor-chassis-intermodal container (or tractor-intermodal semitrailer) combination which is on the highway because the motor carrier relied on a false or erroneous certified weight. First, the State is authorized to assess the overweight fine against the initial tenderer and to impound the container or trailer until that party or the beneficial owner of the cargo has paid the fine. Second, if the State fines the motor carrier instead of trying to collect from the shipper or beneficial owner, the motor carrier has a lien on the contents of the container or trailer equal to the amount of the fine imposed and any additional costs incurred in the incident until it receives payment from the tenderer or beneficial owner. If payment is not made within a reasonable time, the carrier may sell the contents to satisfy the lien. The FHWA's proposed regulations to implement the Safe Container Act were published on July 14, 1993, at 58 FR 37895.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Safe Container Act imposes administrative requirements and costs on tens of thousands of intermodal shippers around the world, and on the international transportation system, in part to reduce the number of overweight containers operating on the Nation's highways. The Safe Container Act is designed to give U.S. motor carriers enough information about the weight and cargo characteristics of intermodal containers and trailers to enable them to decide whether a particular vehicle can be transported without violating State weight limits. If States were allowed to continue routinely to issue nondivisible load permits for overweight containers, some of the essential purposes of the Safe Container Act would appear to be compromised. There would be little incentive for shippers to load intermodal containers or trailers with U.S. weight limits in mind, little if any reduction in the number of overweight vehicles (even though a permit makes them legal), and little reduction in pavement and bridge damage. Many of the expected benefits of the Safe Container Act would be lost, and the regulatory burdens it entails for shippers and carriers would be pointless, if the FHWA adopted the rule on containers proposed in the SNPRM. The FHWA has therefore decided not to promulgate a final rule dealing with containers, but to treat this subject in a separate notice of proposed rulemaking where the issue can be examined more explicitly and in greater detail. In the meantime, the FHWA's previous policy will remain in effect: the States may continue to issue nondivisible load permits to containers moving in international commerce.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Expert Knowledge or Specially Designed Tools: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Many of the comments focused on the third test for nondivisibility proposed in the SNPRM. If ``expert knowledge or specially designed tools'' were required to dismantle a load, it would be considered nondivisible. Most of the comments were critical.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation found the test to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Vague,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Impractical to measure or verify,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Subject to manipulation by industry,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 15 (KCNA) -- A spokesman of the  North side headquarters of the National Alliance of Youth and  Students for the Country's Reunification (Pomchonghaknyon)  issued a statement to the press Tuesday denouncing the Japanese  authorities' suppression of the General Association of Korean  Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and Koreans in Japan.    He said that the raid on the Kyoto prefectural headquarters  of Chongnyon by the Japanese police on June 6 was a downright  expression of the Japanese authorities' heinous hostile policy  toward the DPRK in collusion with the United States and the  South Korean puppets.    The Japanese authorities are escalating crackdown on  Chongnyon, talking about study of "measure for public peace at  home" and establishment of "emergency security arrangements" he  said, adding:    If the Japanese reactionaries think they can go scotfree  after provoking Chongnyon, a dignified overseas citizens'  organisation of the DPRK, and Koreans in Japan with a futile  design to realize the old dream of "greater East Asia  coprosperity sphere", it would be a big mistake.    The Japanese authorities must ponder over the consequences  of  their anti-DPRK and anti-Chongnyon racket, immediately give up  such moves and sincerely apologize for all the criminal acts  they have committed up to now and punish the criminals.    The spokesman expressed the belief that the Korean youth and  students at home and abroad under Pomchonghaknyon would actively  turn out in a struggle to defend the democratic national rights  of the Korean youth in Japan, our brothers and sisters, and the  dignity of the homeland from the Japanese reactionaries' ever  intensified fascist suppression.</p>

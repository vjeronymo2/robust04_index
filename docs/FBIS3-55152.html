General  Assembly circulated as its official document a statement by the  Russian Foreign Ministry in connection with the adoption by the  Latvian Parliament of a law on elections to the bodies of local  self-government.    The statement said that despite the inside and outside  criticism, the Latvian Parliament has adopted the second reading  of the draft law on the elections to the bodies of local  self-government. The draft deprives non-residents of Latvia of  not only their passive but also active franchise, introduces  language restrictions for non-ethnic Latvians (the right to run  public elections will be granted only to the candidates who pass  examinations in the Latvian language) and creates barriers (by  nationality) for the nomination of candidates in Riga and other  big cities with a large percentage of non-ethnic residents.    The statement also pointed out that Latvian lawmakers  continue to ignore recommendations by experts of the Council of  Europe and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  (CSCE), including CSCE Supreme Commissioner for Ethnic  Minorities Max van der Stoel who consider as inadmissible the  removal of non-residents who account for a considerable part of  the country's population (several hundred thousand people) from  participation in local self- government.    Because Russia's position at the bilateral talks has  received  no response from its partners, the Russian Foreign Ministry has  to draw the attention of the world community and human rights  organisations to the growing discriminatory policy in Latvia  aimed against non-ethnic residents, primarily Russians. Before  it is too late, it is necessary to do everything possible to  prevent aggressive nationalism from thriving in the Baltics.  This will pose a threat to Europe of which Russia has  repeatedly warned, the statement said.</p>

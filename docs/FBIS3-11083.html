A Caracol correspondent has reported that inmates Gustavo  Adolfo Gutierrez Arrubla (alias Maxwell and La Trapeadora), Luis  Carlos Aguilar Gallego (El Mugre), Jose Fernando Posadas Fierro,  and Carlos Mario Alzate Urquijo (Arete) are scheduled to be  transferred to Itagui. On 8 December 1993, the four confessed  drug-traffickers were unexpectedly transferred to Santa Fe de  Bogota's La Picota Prison.    The Caracol Network reports the inmates are being  transferred  to Itagui "despite recommendations against such a move by the  national government." Two weeks ago, a conflict arose between  Colombia's justice minister and the nation's prosecutor general  because the minister opposed the order to transfer the inmates  to another prison, warning that the transfer could help the  dismantled Medellin Cartel reunite despite Pablo Escobar's  December 1993 death.    Meanwhile in Medellin, it has been reported that the widow  of  Pablo Escobar, Victoria Henao, today visited her brother-in-law  Roberto, alias Osito, at Itagui Prison. Victoria Henao traveled  with her son Juan Pablo from her home in the Colombian capital  to Medellin, where she stayed only a few hours. In the  afternoon she returned to the Colombian capital aboard a charter  flight.</p>

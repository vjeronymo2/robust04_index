			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Branson halts share sale for Virgin Atlantic expansion MR RICHARD BRANSON has put on ice plans to sell a 10 to 25 per cent stake in Virgin Atlantic Airways. He says the future of his carrier and other smaller independent airlines is threatened by European Commission proposals on allocation of take-off and landing slots at congested EC airports. Virgin announced earlier this year that it was seeking to raise about Pounds 50m by selling a minority stake in its airline operations to investors to help fund expansion of routes and new aircraft. But Mr Branson said in Orlando yesterday that those plans were now in jeopardy because Virgin could not secure additional slots at London's Heathrow airport to operate new international services. He also said EC transport ministers were expected to approve next week new regulations on slots that were likely to make it even harder for smaller airlines to gain access at congested European airports. 'Without additional slots at Heathrow, the airline's development will come to a full stop,' Mr Branson warned. Potential investors in the airline were also holding back until Virgin's slot problems were clarified. Virgin wants to expand flights from London to San Francisco, Johannesburg, Washington, Singapore and Australia as well as starting a shuttle service between London and Paris, called Le Virgin Shuttle, to compete with British Airways and other large flag carriers. In Florida yesterday, Mr Branson launched a new holiday airline called Virgin Vintage Air Tours, operating old DC3 Dakotas between Orlando and Key West. The venture is also considering flying from Key West to Havana, Los Angeles to Palm Springs, and between Miami and Orlando. Mr Branson said Virgin was considering acquiring or leasing up to 18 wide-bodied aircraft over the next six years to expand and renew its fleet. Virgin currently operate eight older Boeing 747-200 airliners. Mr Branson said he was looking at the new Boeing 777 powered by Rolls Royce Trent engines, as well as Airbus A340 long-range airliners. Virgin's expansion was expected to double the airline's workforce from 3,000 to 6,000 over the next four years. Although the new EC proposals were designed to give smaller carriers more opportunities to compete at crowded airports like Heathrow, Mr Branson said the latest plans risked consolidating the dominance of big flag carriers at these airports. Mr Branson has written this week to Mr John MacGregor, UK transport secretary, asking him to block the proposals, due to be considered by EC transport ministers next Thursday as part of the liberalisation of European air transport. Virgin says the EC plans would legalise the controversial system of 'grandfather rights' whereby an airline has automatic rights to slots it has historically held at an airport. The EC originally proposed to confiscate some slots from bigger airlines to enable new entrants to operate at congested airports. Instead, the EC is planning to tighten so-called 'use it or lose it' rules. 'Big airlines will simply keep operating slots, unprofitably if necessary, to keep their slot banks intact and smaller competitors out,' Mr Branson said. In his letter to Mr MacGregor, the Virgin chairman said the EC proposals were 'perhaps the most anti-competitive piece of legislation ever suggested for an industry still rife with anti-competitive practices'. He warned the policy would result 'in permanently higher fares'. With an annual turnover of about Pounds 350m Virgin is expected to be about break-even this year. 'We might show a small profit or possibly a small loss,' Mr Branson said.</p>

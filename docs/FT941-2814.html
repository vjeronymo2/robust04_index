			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Email buys out US group Email, the Australian domestic appliance manufacturer and distributor, said yesterday that it was buying the joint venture which it owns with Westinghouse, the troubled US group, for around ADollars 65m (USDollars 46m). The Email-Westinghouse venture was set up in 1985, and has annual sales of around ADollars 120m. Its operations span a number of areas, including switchgear, metering equipment, air handling and printed circuit board products. Its main manufacturing sites are in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Manila. Email said that all the businesses are currently profitable and it expects the deal to enhance earnings per share. As part of the deal, the 11.1m shares in Email owned by the joint venture will be sold via Potter Warburg, the Australian broker. Due to this associated share sale, Email took the opportunity yesterday to make a profits forecast for the year ending this month. It said trading had been better than anticipated, and that 'this provides confidence that last year's reported profit of ADollars 60.1m will be exceeded by not less than 40 per cent'. NRMA, the Australian insurance group, said yesterday that it will decide whether to float on the Australian stock market in August. If it goes ahead, policyholders will be asked to vote on the plan in October, and the listing could take place in November.</p>

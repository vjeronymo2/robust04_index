			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["ban, fy" report: "Criticism of Defense Minister's White </F> Paper"]    [Excerpts] Bonn, 5 Apr -- The "White Paper on the Security  of the Federal Republic of Germany and on the Situation and  Future of the Bundeswehr" (1994 White Paper), which was  presented by the Defense Ministry in Bonn on Tuesday [5 April],  has been criticized as inadequate by defense politicians of the  Free Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD]. [passage omitted]    Florian Gerster, SPD defense expert and Rhineland-Palatinate  Bundesrat minister, has called the White Paper a document of  inadequacy. Decisive questions, such as how compulsory military  service will be shaped in the future, what structures the armed  forces will have in the future, and what has been changed about  deployment, remain unanswered. Gerster added that the White  Paper gives the impression that the central tasks of national  defense are being treated by those responsible in politics as if  they could be neglected. Instead of thinking about how the  relationship between society and the armed forces could be  improved, the White Paper concentrates completely on the  establishment of highly mobile crisis reaction forces and of  equipment that is conceived for missions outside Germany, and  even outside Europe.    In fact, in Gerster's view, the use of the armed forces  outside the country has become the actual new main task and has  thus been made virtually superior to national defense. This new  priority leads to the conclusion that the authors of the White  Paper have embarked upon a new course in security policy,  Gerster said. It is their goal to establish an interventionist  army consisting of five brigades and the air and naval forces  that are necessary for its use all over the world. The money  that the Bundeswehr still gets is concentrated on the investment  necessary for this purpose. The large remainder of the armed  forces, on the other hand, is treated without kindness and even  neglected.    Gerster said: "What is supposed to develop here is a new  Bundeswehr, which the FRG does not need to defend its own  country and which, in addition, would be based neither on the  approval of the people nor on that of most of the young men  eligible for military service who are supposed to serve in it."  The lack of planning security, which has already existed for  the troops and for the public so far, is not reduced by the  White Paper but rather increased. "Only one thing is clear,"  Gerster said: "A Bundeswehr with 370,000 men cannot be  maintained with these priorities and with financing that will  probably hit an upper limit of about 47 billion German marks  over the next few years."</p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Daly raps Major over IRA ceasefire Cardinal Cahal Daly yesterday took issue with Mr John Major over the IRA's 72-hour post-Easter ceasefire and appealed to the government to put the sincerity of republican leaders to the test. 'I believe the opportunity should not be passed by,' Cardinal Daly said. 'It should not be rubbished.' Speaking less than 24 hours after the prime minister denounced the IRA's move as 'self-serving and cynical', the Primate of all-Ireland said the ceasefire raised 'significant hope', although it was 'disappointingly short'. 'I am afraid, respectfully, I would not agree that this is a cynical exercise on the part of the IRA,' he added. 'The significance is that for the first time in 20 years they have initiated this cessation of violence. Why not test it?' As the leaders of the three main opposition parties in the Irish republic issued a joint peace demand to the IRA, Archbishop Robin Eames, the Protestant Primate of the Church of Ireland, responded to the ceasefire in a more downbeat vein. Although any cessation was to be welcomed, he said: 'The real Christian agenda for Northern Ireland must be written by those who see that a complete end to violence . . . will give us the opportunity to plan the way forward in peace and justice.' Yesterday's developments came as the British and Irish governments reaffirmed that the ceasefire, starting at midnight on Tuesday, falls far short of the permanent cessation required to admit Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, into round-table talks. Sinn Fein has called for 'immediate and direct talks' with the British government to obtain clarification of the Downing Street declaration signed by London and Dublin last December. Dublin has expressed 'extreme disappointment' with the IRA's response to the declaration, with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, urging Sinn Fein to spell out what it means by its latest clarification demand. A senior aide to Mr Reynolds said he would not seek to put pressure on Mr Major to open talks with Sinn Fein. He said that Dublin would keep communication open to Sinn Fein, and 'would have no objection' if London did the same. Underlining Dublin's growing exasperation with Sinn Fein, Mr Reynolds has departed for a week-long holiday in Cyprus. Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, has said he 'would not seek to protract' any talks with the British government and emphasised that Sinn Fein is not seeking negotiation, only clarification. Sinn Fein is expected to further outline its position tomorrow when Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of the party's national executive, addresses a rally in Dublin commemorating the 1916 Easter rising. Meanwhile, the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, said he planned to visit the US this month to 'tell the truth' about Northern Ireland. Mr Paisley is to address the National Committee on American Foreign Policy, which caused controversy when it invited Mr Adams to New York.</p>

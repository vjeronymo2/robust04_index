			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Foreigners flee Zaire mutiny FOREIGNERS began leaving Zaire over the weekend as relative calm appeared to have been restored after mutinous soldiers went on a two-day rampage of shooting and looting in the capital which left 65 people dead. The exodus of the expatriate community, already severely diminished as a result of frequent outbreaks of violence during the past 18 months, will further damage the collapsed economy of black Africa's second largest country. The latest outbreak of violence will also exacerbate the country's instability and deepen an 18-month-old political crisis as a divided pro-democracy opposition continues to try to wrestle power from President Mobutu Sese Seko. France began evacuating 160 expatriates from Kinshasa yesterday, ferrying them by boat under military escort across the Zaire river to Brazzaville, the capital of neighbouring Congo. About 300 foreigners, mostly Belgians and Germans, escaped the city on Saturday aboard President Mobutu's luxury riverboat. There are about 7,000 Europeans resident in Zaire and a much larger community of African expatriates. Many of them had their houses and businesses gutted during the two days of violence by soldiers angry about the introduction of worthless Zaire 5m banknotes. Elite troops from Mr Mobutu's Special Presidential Division appeared to have re-asserted control by Saturday.</p>

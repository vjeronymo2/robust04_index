			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Arts: An orchestral success story - Sponsorship The Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts (ABSA) is a two time winner from the Budget. The funding for the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme (BSIS), which ABSA administers, was increased by Pounds 750,000 to Pounds 5.6m. This is a sprat to catch the mackerel of corporate sponsorship and should add another Pounds 1.5m to the arts in 1995-96. In addition ABSA will operate a new scheme which extends the BSIS to historic buildings. There is only Pounds 200,000 of government money available at the start, but any company that fancies backing Stonehenge, or a royal palace, or a stately home, or a cathedral - their structure as well as events held there - will now get a top-up incentive. *** There is one place where arts organisations and sponsors happily embrace - abroad. It is virtually impossible for an orchestra or a theatre company to plan an overseas tour without sponsorship. The British Council does its bit, but these days the council almost always draws in business money as well - Pounds 3.6m from sponsors in 1993-94. It recently raised an impressive Pounds 400,000 from 30 companies to take arts groups like Cheek by Jowl and the Westminster Abbey Choir to Russia during the Queen's tour. For companies, helping to present a prestigious British arts event overseas offers unrivalled opportunities to offer key foreign contacts an evening's pleasure which could lead to contracts. The recent tour of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales to New York and Baltimore was a classic example of sponsorship in action. The orchestra had been invited to perform the annual United Nations Day concert in the chamber of the General Assembly in New York, There was, however, no fee and the orchestra had to pay a facility charge for recording the concert and converting the chamber into a performance space. S4C, the Welsh language television channel, stepped in to sponsor the event. It is not easy selling programmes in Welsh to foreign TV stations but such a celebrated event, plus party, gave its efforts the necessary lift. The fact the Prince of Wales has presented one of the company's animation projects was also a helped. With one concert underwritten, the orchestra looked for more dates. Next year Swansea is UK City of Literature and the Welsh Tourist Board jumped at the chance to support a Lincoln Centre concert. A trip down to Baltimore was inevitable: Cardiff Bay's regeneration plans, built around the proposed Opera House, are modelled on Baltimore, which used the arts to help revive an ailing sea port. There is something worrying when the arts become the plum in the pudding rather than a dish in their own right, but the enthusiastic response to the music justified pre-concert and post-concert receptions, at which Baltimore industrialists were introduced to the commercial opportunities in Cardiff Bay and New York travel agents were sold Swansea as the new Athens. The first American tourists are already booked. The S4C-backed tour should have delighted the heritage minister, Stephen Dorrell, since it was built around the promotion of tourism and business investment, the twin pillars of his focus for arts funding. As the BBC and the Arts Council pursue their delicate strategy of spreading orchestral music more fairly throughout the country while saving money and avoiding rows, the BBC National Orchestra of Wales is becoming something of a role model. By broadening its revenue base it has forged the path which vulnerable orchestras like the BBC Philharmonic and the Bournemouth Symphony will be encouraged to follow. The BBC still provides the bulk of its funding  - Pounds 3m; but the Welsh Arts Council, S4C, and sponsors also contribute to the pot. It became the first BBC band to attract substantial sponsorship - Pounds 300,000 from Hitachi, which took it to Japan. This winter the orchestra is pitching dozens of Japanese companies based in Wales in the expectation that they will fund the proposed return trip to Japan next year.</p>

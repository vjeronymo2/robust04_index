			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DRUG LOOT USES STIR CURIOSITY OF SUPERVISORS  </P> <P> The drug-forfeiture program has become big business for Orange County law  enforcement officials, who predict that police agencies in the county will  divvy up nearly $35 million in cash confiscated so far in narcotics busts.  </P> <P> An estimated $6 million of that amount has been allocated to the Sheriff's  Department -- and the Board of Supervisors, often at odds with Sheriff-Coroner  Brad Gates over budget matters, wants to know how the money is being spent.  </P> <P> Under a 1984 federal law, a portion of the money seized during drug  investigations is returned to local law enforcement agencies to fight drug  abuse. The county Regional Narcotics Suppression Program task force was formed  in 1986 to take advantage of that law, and all but four of the county's smaller  police departments participate in it and share in the proceeds.  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department has used its share of the money to pay for a  presidential visit, a drug education program and a narcotics investigators'  training facility. The regional task force has spent money on such items as  office supplies, rental cars for investigators, overtime pay and helicopter  surveillance.  </P> <P> None of the supervisors have accused the sheriff or the task force of spending  the money for non-drug-related items.  </P> <P> But they have asked for a report outlining how the money is being spent and how  police agencies in other counties are spending their drug money. The report,  being prepared by the county administrative office, is due in late January and  was ordered in October when Gates said he could not legally use the money to  pay for the county's new genetics-testing laboratory.  </P> <P> "I think we got to get a handle on it," Supervisor Don R. Roth said. "I'm in no  way saying that there is anything wrong, but I think we need uniformity on how  this money can be spent doing the most good. If something goes wrong, they  won't run to the auditor or the sheriff, they'll come to the Board of  Supervisors."  </P> <P> Information Needed  </P> <P> Roth said he knows of one police department that bought guns with the drug  money while other departments use it only for drug enforcement. The supervisors  should be fully informed on how the money is spent -- both by the sheriff's  narcotics program and the regional task force, he added.  </P> <P> Twenty-four federal and county law enforcement agencies staff the task force,  which does surveillance work, enlists informants and makes actual narcotics  raids.  </P> <P> The cash seized under the federal-forfeiture program comes back to the regional  program headed by a 14-member executive board made up of local police chiefs,  Gates and a variety of federal law enforcement officials. Some of the money is  then redistributed to cities for use by their police departments.  </P> <P> The federal government retains 10% of the seized drug money to administer the  program and the regional task force keeps 25% to finance its operation.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Capt. Tim Simon, who heads the regional drug task force, said Monday  that a total of $47 million had been confiscated since the regional anti-drug  effort began in December, 1986, but $12 million of that was transferred to  police agencies outside the county for participating in joint investigations.  </P> <P> So far, Simon said, the regional task force has received $7.8 million and  another $27.2 million is in "the pipeline." He said he did not know how long it  would take for that money to make it through an "overburdened and bureaucratic"  federal system.  </P> <P> About $2 million of the $7.8 million has been disbursed to the Sheriff's  Department, with local police departments getting another $4 million or so.  </P> <P> Simon said the Sheriff's Department would eventually receive about $6 million  of the $35 million.  </P> <P> "The good thing is that none of the money we spend comes from the county  general fund," Simon said. "None of it is tax dollars. All the money is seized  from major drug dealers."  </P> <P> Major expenditures of the sheriff's drug-fighting money so far have included  the launching of a countywide drug abuse education program along with nearly  $350,000 to fix up the confiscated Rancho del Rio, a remote property near the  Riverside County line which lawmen hope someday will become an international  drug investigation training facility.  </P> <P> The task force has had $1 million-plus seizures totaling 11, Simon said. During  those drug raids, agents have confiscated 11,000 pounds of cocaine.  </P> <P> The largest single seizure, of $5.2 million, came in early 1988 when regional  narcotics agents raided residences in South Gate and Riverside. In addition to  the cash, agents confiscated 18 pounds of heroin and arrested three Mexican  nationals.  </P> <P> Simon said the county auditor-controller monitors expenditures by both the  sheriff's narcotics program and the regional drug-fighting program. The  regional task force is also subject to federal and state audits, he added.  </P> <P> Surprise Audits  </P> <P> Even the Sheriff's Department conducts surprise audits of the regional program,  Simon said.  </P> <P> Records at the auditor's office showed that much of the money spent by the  regional task force went for day-to-day operations such as telephone bills, car  rentals, overtime for agents, and, in some cases, office equipment and  supplies. Bills for cellular car telephones used by drug investigators,  informant payments and money used for drug buys are not itemized but are kept  in what is called the 240 account.  </P> <P> That account can run a balance up to $1.8 million.  </P> <P> Rental car bills can run as high as $18,000 a month. Investigators change cars  continuously to avoid detection by suspects, Simon explained.  </P> <P> "There's not much glitzy stuff," Simon said, adding that the cars that the  investigators drive are like the ones driven by the average person. But he  added: "When we need a stretch limo or a big Mercedes, we can rent it."  </P> <P> Monthly helicopter costs for the task force can run into the tens of thousands  of dollars. Crowded freeways, officials said, have made the use of helicopters  a must when following drug traffickers. Overtime for narcotics agents becomes a  major expense because of long stakeouts during lengthy investigations.  </P> <P> Gates' use of the drug money also became a focus of controversy earlier this  year when it was learned that he spent thousands -- the final bill was $335,061  -- to pay for President Bush's visit to Rancho del Rio last April. The U.S.  Justice Department determined that the financing of Bush's anti-drug speech was  a proper use of the money, but Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley said he and  his colleagues "would have swallowed several times" had they known what the  final cost would be.  </P> <P> County auditor's records showed that $3,995 of the sheriff's drug-fighting  money was used for a catered lunch at Rancho del Rio when the President visited  while tens of thousands were used to paint, fix up, and re-grade the road to  the remote ranch. Another auditor's item showed that $7,239.03 was paid to  Abbey Party Rents Inc. to prepare for the Bush visit.  </P> <P> Another $29,083 was paid to a lumber company and $64,942 to the Ortega Rock  Quarry for improvements to the ranch road.  </P> <P> Other bills paid out of the sheriff's program included $3,610 for rubbish  removal, $750 for laser firearms fees and $259 for a rented trailer to haul  furniture to Rancho del Rio.  </P></p>

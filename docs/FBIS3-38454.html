Earlier there was talk of the British and French  Governments in particular considering such a withdrawal.  According to The Hague, such a withdrawal would result in the  "moral bankruptcy" of the international community.    Defense Minister Ter Beek considers the humanitarian task of  the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] in Bosnia as being "of great  importance" and the deployment of Netherlands troops as  "exceptionally meaningful," the minister said in Parliament on  Tuesday [1 February].    Parliament was informed of recent details concerning the  stationing of the 1,230 troops from the Army's reinforced Light  Mobile Battalion in central and eastern Bosnia. Parliament was  in full agreement over the stationing of the troops.    Senior officials, who met with the European Union's  Political  Affairs Committee, confirmed in Brussels on Tuesday that none of  the member states was considering a unilateral withdrawal of  troops from Bosnia. According to Ter Beek, the departure of the  United Nations from Bosnia would "increase fighting and human  rights violations. It would mean accepting aggression,  atrocities, and rule of the strongest. That is too high a  price."    Ter Beek was pleased with Parliament's support for sending  troops to the Muslim enclaves of Srebrenica and Zepa, which must  be protected. "The Netherlands will keep its word, also in  difficult circumstances," the minister stated.    His fellow party member, Van Traa, stressed that Parliament  would continue to support the dispatch of the Light Mobile  Battalion even if there were losses on the Netherlands side. He  wanted to dispel the suggestion that The Hague "would get cold  feet if body bags started coming back to Schiphol airport."    Ter Beek and General Van der Vlis, chief of the defense  staff, reassured Parliament that the Netherlands ground troops  are going to Bosnia "well trained, sufficiently armed, and  highly motivated." The 750 men of the Light Mobile Battalion  are carrying out their mission at the UN request in Srebrenica  and Zepa.    The logistics support unit of 480 men is stationed in  Lukavac, 140 and 190 kilometers from Srebrenica and Zepa  respectively. In spite of this, Ter Beek considers this to be  the best location as the town is close to the reopened Tuzla  airfield and can be easily reached from Zagreb and Split.    Ter Beek confirmed that the Security Council and NATO  Council  are required to give express permission for carrying out air  strikes against Serbian targets. These would be reprisal  bombings and would make UNPROFOR a party to the conflict. The  minister sees the risks of this as too high.    Air support can, however, be granted for the direct defense  of the Netherlands units. Also, if these units are obstructed  from carrying out their task or if they are met with violence in  carrying out their task, then both air support by NATO and  ground support by other UNPROFOR contingents may be granted.    One 1 March, a Netherlands brigade general is to be  appointed  chief of staff of the Bosnia-Herzegovina command in Kiseljac,  headed by General Rose, of Britain, for one year. According to  Ter Beek, the appointment to this "senior, difficult and  important position" is partly due to the Netherlands'  substantial contribution to UNPROFOR.</p>

			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: ROUNDING UP SUSPECTS IN S&amp;L HEIST  </P> <P> Numerous questions are now being asked in this country about who is responsible  for the half-trillion-dollar savings and loan scandal.  </P> <P> Before we continue the witch hunt, we have to realize that there are many who  are innocent until presumed guilty -- but there are even more who are guilty  until presumed innocent.  </P> <P> The White House is dealing with the problem like an adult by blaming the fiasco  on the Democrats. The reason the White House is so sure that the Democrats are  behind the S&amp;L loss is because this is going to be a big issue in the fall  elections. The President's position is that, when you have a disaster of this  magnitude, there is never enough political blame to go around.  </P> <P> The Democrats are certain that the Republicans destroyed the nation's mortgage  banking system when they deregulated the S&amp;Ls and permitted them to give  money to anyone who wanted to build a chocolate bunny factory.  </P> <P> There is no question that the Democrats intend to lay the S&amp;L boondoggle on  the Republicans' doorstep, even if it means blaming the President's son.  </P> <P> There is so much mudslinging about this scandal because no matter where a  congressman or senator comes from, there was at least one S&amp;L down the  block. Some of our politicians' best friends were also some of the politicians'  most generous contributors.  </P> <P> To quote bank robber Willie Sutton for the 1,000th time, "The reason that  members of Congress gave the S&amp;Ls everything they wanted was because  'That's where the money was.' "  </P> <P> Nobody knows the amount of campaign funds that changed hands during the '80s,  when the S&amp;Ls were permitted to do anything they wanted. But there is no  doubt that the relationship between the banks and elected officials was warm,  sympathetic and user-friendly.  </P> <P> If it's true that there will be a war between Republicans and Democrats over  the multibillion-dollar deficit, then this is the kind of rhetoric we can  expect to hear.  </P> <P> The Republican TV commercial would go something like this: pan to a man opening  a safe which turns out to be empty.  </P> <P> He says, "This savings and loan bank has been cleaned out. Who, you ask, did  it? Well, I'll tell you who. Willie Horton stole your savings. The Democrats  have been soft on S&amp;Ls for years, and that's why it's going to cost every  man, woman and child in the U.S. $4,000 each, so that Willie can get a weekend  furlough to go to Disney World."  </P> <P> The Democratic commercial would show a bunch of fat S&amp;L owners with grease  all over their faces eating legs of lamb with their bare hands. The voice-over  would say, "This is a $10,000-a-plate dinner for the National Republican Party  given by the savings and loan industry. If it hadn't been for Reagan  deregulation rules, we wouldn't be eating lamb while you eat Alpo this evening.  Let's make the government get onto the S&amp;Ls' backs once again. If you add  up what it will cost you, flag burning is no longer this country's burning  issue."  </P> <P> The White House is very sensitive about the S&amp;L bailout, and this is  because the President's son, Neil, is involved with an S&amp;L scandal in  Colorado.  </P> <P> For reasons that no one understands, the Democrats are making hay with this  information.  </P> <P> Just last week a Democrat called me. He told me that he had heard the White  House was going to install drive-in S&amp;L deposit windows at 1600  Pennsylvania Ave. for the convenience of lobbyists trying to get their message  to the President.  </P> <P> In any case, everyone is agreed on one thing: The guilty should be punished  and, at the very least, be ex-communicated by Cardinal O'Connor.  </P></p>

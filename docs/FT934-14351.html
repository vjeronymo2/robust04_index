			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Paying with cash costs UK consumers Pounds 800m a year IT COSTS the British Pounds 800m a year in lost interest income to carry around banknotes and coins in wallets and handbags, according to a study of the costs of circulating cash around the economy. The first detailed study for 20 years estimates that it costs Pounds 4.5bn to lubricate the Pounds 250bn flow of cash payments made in Britain each year. Individuals pay Pounds 800m, with a further Pounds 800m from shops and business, Pounds 700m from the Post Office and Pounds 2.2bn from the Bank of England and commercial banks. The study, carried out by the Boston Consulting Group for De La Rue, the banknote printer, estimates that the use of cash costs each of Britain's 22m households Pounds 210 a year in lost interest and handling expenses. Each household holds an average of Pounds 460 in cash at any one time, it estimates. The figure is thought to be so high because it is artificially boosted by the 'black economy' of unregistered and criminal enterprises which deal largely in cash. The cost of the cash-handling system has quadrupled since the last detailed analysis in 1973, when it was estimated at Pounds 540m at 1992 prices. Handling cash now costs each commercial bank between Pounds 200m and Pounds 300m a year. One reason for the rapid escalation in costs of cash handling is that automated teller machines (ATMs) installed over the past two decades have made it easier to obtain cash, and so increased the strain on the cash distribution system. Since 1975, ATM cash withdrawals have quadrupled, while bank counter withdrawals have declined only slightly. Mr Simon Farmbrough, a Boston Consulting Group vice-president, said banks could reduce costs by improved automation and analysis of cash handling. 'There is potential to drive down costs quite significantly.' The finding that the average household held Pounds 460 in cash had been checked with financial institutions because it appeared so high, he said. 'It is clear that some of that money is being carried around in suitcases,' Mr Farmbrough said. The study follows an analysis by the banks' Association for Payments and Clearing Services earlier this year, which found that cheque and cash clearing costs banks about Pounds 4.5bn a year, of which about half is the cost of cash handling. This agrees with the Boston Consulting study, which estimates the cost of cash handling for banks at Pounds 1.9bn, with another Pounds 300m in forgone interest. The Pounds 800m cost for businesses is half handling expenses, and half forgone interest. The study estimates, however, that in spite of the costs, Britain's cash-handling system is cheaper than the system in either France or Germany. Cash mountain haunts banks Page 9</p>

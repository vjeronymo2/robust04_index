Yin Jun delivered a speech in which he maintained: The  current congress session is being held at a crucial moment and  at a time when China is entering a new stage of reform, opening  up, and economic development. The participants in the current  session have held discussions on such topics as reform,  development, and stability; drawn on collective wisdom; absorbed  all useful ideas; acted as masters of the country; and  demonstrated a strong sense of mission. A large number of work  reports and resolutions have been deliberated on and adopted at  the current session, thereby affirming our achievements; summing  up experiences; laying down clear-cut tasks, goals, and work  measures for this year; and fully embodying the will and  aspirations of the people of all nationalities in Yunnan. The  current congress session has been a successful, democratic,  united, truth-seeking, and confidence-boosting meeting, capable  of mobilizing the people of all nationalities in Yunnan to work  with one heart and one mind, continually carry out explorations,  and constantly forge ahead. Now that the current congress  session has laid down clear-cut goals and tasks for Yunnan's  reform, construction, and development in 1994, the crux of the  matter lies in carrying out these goals and tasks to the letter  and in conducting our work in a down-to-earth manner.    Yin Jun concluded his speech by saying: Let us unite more  closely around the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang  Zemin as the core; hold aloft the great banner of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics; and mobilize and unite the people of all  nationalities across the province to bravely forge ahead to  build a new socialist economy structure and to fulfill all the  economic and social development goals set for this year under  the leadership of the Yunnan Provincial CPC Committee!    He Zhiqiang [governor] also attended this morning's closing  meeting. [passage omitted]</p>

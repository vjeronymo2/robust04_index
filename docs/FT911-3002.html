			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (17): Sweden and Spain record the biggest gains in a mixed Europe / Equities EUROPE excluding the UK, as measured by the FT-Actuaries World Indices, showed a total return of 13.8 per cent in sterling terms in the first quarter. Measured in local currency, January was just 1 per cen higher; February saw a rise of 11.9 per cent; but the climb slowed to 2.4 per cent in March. The quarter began with the same caution that had followed the slide in equities which began in August and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The European market also shivered on January 11, as Soviet troops moved on key installations in Lithunia; and it took its time about reacting to open warfare in the Gulf, which began less than a week later. Optimism about an early end to the war brought the gains in February, which were consolidated and improved on in March. However, the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index was actually a little lower at the end of March than it had been nearly three weeks earlier. The quarter saw wide variations between countries, with Sweden and Spain (up 28.5 and 26.5 per cent respectively) at the top of the list, and Norway and Germany (up 8.3 and 7.7 per cent) at the bottom. Sweden's economy, by the second half of last year, had been heading into recession, with foreign investors withdrawing from its former high-flyers, international blue chips such as the telecommunications group Ericsson. This year, however, domestic financial institutions, flush with cash, have returned to the home equity market. The economic and fiscal position has improved, and there has been a spate of corporate activity to excite equity investors. In Spain, the economic squeeze imposed on consumers as long ago as 1988 has borne fruit. Early in March, the strength of the peseta, the prospect of an interest-rate cut and an improvement in the inflation figures took the market up by some 8 per cent over eight days. Brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd said this month, in its continental European strategy monthly, that for those with an upbeat view on the dollar, Norway's shipping, oils and metals (where profits and asset values are dollar sensitive) provide significant gearing to dollar strength. 'Our view,' they said, 'is that this is more a story for 1992.' Germany has moved from euphoria to gloom. Between the peak of Ostphantasie, in March 1990, and the end of the year, its DAX blue-chip index dropped by 29 per cent, as hopes for the domestic market were replaced by anxiety about international recession and its effect on big overseas producers such as the chemicals company BASF or exporters such as Volkswagen. This year, the market has laboured under the burden of reunification costs. There have been estimates that the growth rate in Germany's GNP could fall by between 0.5 and 1 percentage point. Tax increases that will pay for restoring the former east Germany to health are expected to complicate a wage negotiation round, which is already potentially acrimonious. And the weakness of the Deutsche Mark shows how uncertain the economy has become. For the rest, there are a range of opinions. BZW expects Europe to hold up against the world index after what it sees as 12 months of underperformance. Kleinwort Benson is 'generally bearish' but adding: 'The markets are set for a period of consolidation after their recent strong run, but we do not look for a significant setback in view of continuing high levels of liquidity.' Mr David Roche, of Morgan Stanley, has advised his clients to go underweight in equities and raise cash, or to lock in profits using derivatives. 'In the past 10 years,' he said in a mid-March EuroLetter, 'dividends have grown faster than profits, which grew faster than national income. In the next five years this order will be reversed.'</p>

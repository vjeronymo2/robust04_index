(Fisher-Price), of East Aurora, New York, has appealed a decision by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that denied Fisher-Price's petition that its noncompliance with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 213, ``Child Restraint Systems,'' be deemed inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety (Docket No. 93&hyph;79; Notice 2, 59 FR 23253; May 5, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice of receipt of Fisher-Price's appeal is published in accordance with NHTSA regulations (49 CFR 556.7 and 556.8) and does not represent any agency decision or other exercise of judgment concerning the merits of the appeal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph S5.7 of FMVSS No. 213 states that ``[e]ach material used in a child restraint system shall conform to the requirements of S4 of FMVSS No. 302 (`Flammability of Interior Materials') (571.302).'' Paragraph S4.3(a) of FMVSS No. 302 states that ``[w]hen tested in accordance with S5, material described in S4.1 and S4.2 shall not burn, nor transmit a flame front across its, surface, at a rate of more than 4 inches per minute.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted in Notice 1 (58 FR 59511; November 9, 1993) of Docket No. 93&hyph;79, Fisher-Price determined that some of its child safety seats failed to comply with FMVSS No. 213, and filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR part 573, ``Defect and Noncompliance Reports.'' Fisher-Price petitioned to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (Act) (15 U.S.C. 1381  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 5, 1994, NHTSA published a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  denying Fisher-Price's petition, stating that the petitioner had not met its burden of persuasion that the noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. The reader is referred to that notice for a further discussion of the noncompliance and the agency's rationale in denying the petition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 6, 1994, Fisher-Price submitted an appeal of the agency's decision to deny its petition. The appeal contains an analysis of the agency's decision, a summary of the supplemental information Fisher-Price submitted (which is described below), and the affidavit of Gail E. McCarthy, Ph.D, P.E., of Failure Analysis Associates (FaAA). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> Supplementary Information:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Notice 1 to this docket established a 30-day public comment period, which expired on December 9, 1993. Nevertheless, Fisher-Price submitted additional information related to its petition on three occasions: February 25, 1994, March 17, 1994, and March 24, 1994. Fisher-Price also submitted additional information with its May 6, 1994, appeal. These materials are available for public review in the NHTSA docket. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The March 17, 1994, document contained research conducted by FaAA for Fisher-Price, including burn tests and a search of the literature and accident data regarding child seat fires. The submission also included a calculation of an alleged incremental risk associated with a recall of the noncompliant seats. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The March 24, 1994, document, entitled ``Supporting Documentation for Evaluation of the Fire Safety of Fisher-Price, Inc. Child Restraint Shoulder Harness Webbing,'' contains the detailed data and test results on which the material in the March 17, 1994, document was based. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fisher-Price's May 6, 1994, appeal raised the following points: (1) In the notice of denial, NHTSA stated that Fisher-Price ``determined'' that some of its child restraints failed to comply with FMVSS No. 213; Fisher-Price states that it has yet to make this determination. (2) In the notice of denial, NHTSA stated that it believes flammability requirements for child restraints should be strictly adhered to; Fisher-Price believes that NHTSA should not hold child restraints to what it perceives to be a stricter standard than is stated in the Act. (3) Fisher-Price cites the grant by NHTSA of a petition for inconsequentiality filed by PACCAR, Inc. in which tape edging on a mattress had failed FMVSS No. 302 requirements (57 FR 45868; October 5, 1992). The petition was granted by NHTSA based in part on the fact that the tape edging was a very small portion of the mattress. It also cites an appeal to a petition filed by the American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (Honda) (49 FR 15046; April 16, 1984) which was granted. The agency's rationale for granting the appeal was based in part on the fact that Honda had not received any complaints regarding the noncompliance. (4) Fisher-Price claims that the data it submitted in support of its contention that children's clothing poses a much greater risk to safety than the noncompliant webbing were not adequately refuted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the affidavit submitted with the appeal, Dr. McCarthy argues that: (1) The shoulder belt webbing should properly be viewed as meeting the requirements of FMVSS No. 302; (2) any noncompliance that might be deemed to exist has no impact on motor vehicle safety; and (3) possible remedial measures would create substantially greater risk of injury to children than that presented by the webbing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments on the appeal of Fisher-Price, described above. Comments should refer to the docket and notice number and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, room 5109, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. It is requested but not required that six copies be submitted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All comments received before the close of business on the closing date indicated below will be considered.

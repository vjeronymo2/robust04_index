			<p><P> May 29, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES: REFLECTIVE ROBERTO CARLOS RESISTS CHEST-THUMPING  </P> <P> Universal Amphitheatre has developed quite a knack for packing the house by  booking big-name Latin pop stars, many of the saccharine crooner variety.  Fortunately, Brazil's Roberto Carlos did much to resist the chest-thumping  sentimentality and "My Way"-narcissism of his peers during his show there on  Friday.  </P> <P> Carlos' better love songs transcend mere retelling of the heart's loses.  Instead, like Garcia Marquez's eternally lovesick Florentino Ariza, Carlos  invokes a balancing femininity; a sensual and moral ethic for facing life and  death. His rendition of Gardel's classic tango "Volver," and "Detalles," an  exceptionally poignant song in which Carlos accompanies his dense, reedy,  vibrato-less voice on solo guitar, illustrate this deeper side.  </P> <P> His mostly female audience, however, didn't seem ready to accept the  reflective, older, more domestic fellow Carlos seems to have become. Rabid  females, soaring over Carlos and his formidably loud 16-piece band, repeatedly  screamed amorous declarations. He also indulged in some sing-song trifles ("Mis  Amores"), and the easy moralizing of "Apocalipsis," a slightly acid-rock tune  condemning abortion, drugs and violence in one breath.

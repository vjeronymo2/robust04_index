			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Statements by political figures, from INTERFAX, POSTFAFTUM, </F> and ITAR-TASS material; places and dates not given: "Man Guilty  of National Consensus Found: an Honest Jurist Follows in the  Footsteps of Procurator Pilate"]    [Text] Sergey Yushenkov (chairman of the State Duma  Defense Committee): "Aleksey Kazannik's resignation as  Russian Federation procurator general is to his credit; it  shows, however, that the procuracy is poorly prepared for  practical work. The Constitutional Court also could have  demanded that the Duma stick to the rules, but there is no law  on the Constitutional Court. Overall, this speaks of the  weakness of the president's power.    "The government is not against carrying out the amnesty.  Indirect proof of this is the way the PRES [Party of Russian  Unity and Accord] and the pro-government New Regional Policy  faction have voted... The government does not have a concrete  program and is looking for a scapegoat on whom to dump  responsibility for what is happening in the country."    Viktor Mironov (deputy chairman of the Duma Security  Committee, member of the Russia's Choice faction): "Having  accepted the amnesty, the criminals acknowledged their  responsibility for the hundreds of people killed... I hope that  the president and the enforcement structures will not allow it  to come to a civil war... The duty of democratically minded  people is to unite around the Russia's Choice party."    Lev Ponomarev (cochairman of Democratic Russia  movement): "Kazannik betrayed the president, who had  appealed to him to hold up the amnesty process."    Ivan Fedoseyev (Russian Federation Supreme Soviet  Constitutional Committee, Russia faction coordinator, Russian  All-Peoples Union cochairman): "I hope that Ruslan  Imranovich will have enough wisdom not to exhort people to mass  actions today... The legitimacy of both the new Constitution and  the State Duma is questionable; however, it is unlikely that the  voters would agree with it, and Ruslan Khasbulatov must take  this into account.    Ivan Shashviashvili (Russia faction): "Ruslan  Imranovich should enter the political arena in his old capacity  as Russian Federation Supreme Soviet chairman--the only  legitimate body of state power despite the October massacre."    Vladimir Isakov (Russian Federation Supreme Soviet  Constitutional Committee, chairman of the Legislative and  Judiciary Reform Committee): "I hope that the released  prisoners will have enough political wisdom not to jump into  politics in the next few months. This would seriously complicate  the situation in the country."    Mikhail Astafyev (chairman of the Constitutional  Democratic Party): The key figure today is Aleksandr  Rutskoy. There are two presidents in Russia today, and only one  of them--Rutskoy--is the legitimate one. This seriously  complicates the political situation."    Ruslan Khasbulatov: "I do not see real politicians  in our country, I do not see anyone in the leadership with whom  you could reach an agreement and who would then keep their word.  Machiavelli is a child compared to them. For me, on the other  hand, moral principles in politics are particularly important...  Had I not been released by the Duma decision, I would still have  been freed--first, because the investigators were not able to  find corpus delicti, and second, because of my state of  health... An attempt to return to Lefortovo those who have been  released from the investigative detention facility under amnesty  will only underline the stupidity of the organizers of such  actions. In the near future I intend to sort out my papers... I  have felt my heart for the first time, how it hurts; therefore,  I have to take care of my health right now..."    Ilya Konstantinov (National Salvation Front  leader): "The former Lefortovo prisoners do not want to see  the political struggle in Russia transcend the boundaries of  legitimacy, and intend to help stabilize the political  situation... Attempts to link the political amnesty with the  beginning of a new round of civil war in Russia are a political  provocation."    Vyacheslav Kostikov: "The act of releasing from  Lefortovo the organizers of and participants in the October 1993  events is a blasphemous deed... People who were ready to push  Russia into a bloodbath have been set free without a trial...  The deputies abused the trust people vested in them and took the  side of state villains... Aleksey Kazannik's resignation is the  reaction of an extremely noble and decent man who has been put  in a difficult legal situation... Until a new general procurator  is appointed, the situation will be deadlocked."    Gavriil Popov, Russian Democratic Reform Movement  chairman): "The president's staff has displayed amazing  inaction... The president could have made an anticipatory move  on the Duma decision by offering it his own version of amnesty,  which would have precisely and clearly specified the terms on  which the criminal case is dismissed; one such term could be a  ban on participation in political activities for a certain  period of time... The course of investigation in the GKChP  [State Committee on the State of Emergency] case and the October  events has demonstrated the complete helplessness of the law  enforcement system; a top to bottom purge of the procuracy is  needed."    Sergey Shakhray: "The amnesty is in line with the  strategic interests of the president and the government... The  president loses more politically by keeping his opponents behind  bars... At the same time, the result of violating the logic of  the national reconciliation plan proposed by the PRES, in which  the amnesty is only one element, bundled together with a  memorandum of accord and the decision on disbanding the  commission on investigation of the October events, will be that  those released will again jump into political struggle. Its  outcome will depends on random factors... Aleksey Kazannik's  resignation may plunge the procuracy into the orbit of political  passions."    Shmidt Dzyublyayev (general secretary of the Assembly  of North Caucasus Democratic Forces): "The economic and  political situation makes it incumbent on the president of  Russia to impose a state of emergency... The Duma decision is an  unprecedented act of absolute disrespect for the law... Sergey  Shakhray should share responsibility for this with the communist  obscurantists."    Yuriy Baturin (the president's national security  adviser): "The president of Russian Federation's appeal to  the State Duma with the proposal to modify the decree on the  amnesty should have cleared the way for the reconciliation  process. However, the haste of general procuracy members  considerably complicated the situation... This haste was  displayed even contrary to the position of the State Duma  itself... It is clear that General Procurator Kazannik's own  position in this case was duplicitous... I can say that he has  deceived us."    Ivan Rybkin: "If some people show that they do not  have enough brains and compassion not to start a confrontation,  the State Duma will see to it that such people are severely  punished... Perhaps in the future a memorandum should be  adopted, upon concurrence with other branches of authority, on a  system of criteria and the mechanism of responsibility of state  institutions and politicians for decisions aimed at reaching  civic peace, national reconciliation, and consensus."    Mikhail Poltoranin: "The president cannot relax  the reins of power; otherwise, the chariot of Russian statehood  will overturn."</p>

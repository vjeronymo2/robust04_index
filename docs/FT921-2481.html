			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: JVC to cut product range VICTOR Company of Japan (JVC) plans to reduce its range of products, increase outside component sales and lengthen product cycles to fight back against the effects of the consumer electronics slump, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Almost half of JVC's sales are in videotape recorders, a flat market. In February, JVC forecast a parent pre-tax loss of Y2.8bn (Dollars 21m) and a group pre-tax deficit of Y4.4bn for the year to the end of March. It would be its first loss in 40 years. To trim design and development costs, it plans to reduce the number of its products by 20 to 30 per cent by eliminating products that are considered too similar to others. JVC will also sell more components - such as the magnetic heads used in videotape recorders - to other manufacturers, and produce more components internally for its own use.</p>

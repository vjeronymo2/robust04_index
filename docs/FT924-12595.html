			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Memo reveals plan to thwart BNL inquiry THE US Department of Justice sought to thwart congressional investigations of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) Iraqi loans scandal two years ago, according to an internal memorandum from the department made public in Congress yesterday. The September 1990 memo was prepared to brief Mr Dick Thornburgh, then the US attorney-general, before he telephoned Mr Henry Gonzalez, the House banking committte chairman who has spearheaded congressional inquiries into the BNL affair. The memo states: 'Our best attempt to thwart any further congressional inquiry by the House banking committee into this case is to have you contact Chairman Gonzalez directly.' Mr Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat, charged last night that the Justice Department had worked 'systematically' to prevent his probe of the Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.9bn) of illegal Iraqi loans made by BNL's Atlanta branch. He disclosed yesterday that in 1990 he had refused to discuss the BNL case with Mr Thornburgh and went ahead with his investigation anyway. The House banking committee chairman also accused yesterday Mr William Barr, the current attorney-general who is a close aide to President George Bush, of withholding hundreds of documents from his investigation. He called for Mr Barr to resign over his handling of the BNL affair. Mr Gonzalez also released Justice Department documents which appear to show that Mr Joe Whitley, the top US prosecutor in Atlanta, had been involved in the management of the BNL case even though he had supposedly disqualified himself in 1990 because of a conflict of interest. The Justice Department declined to comment last night.</p>

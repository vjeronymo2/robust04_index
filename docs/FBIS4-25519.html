			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, 8 Jun (XINHUA) -- Zhou Nan, director of  the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong branch, expressed his hope here  that the broad masses of Hong Kong Government functionaries will  remain in Hong Kong after 1997, serve in the future special  administrative region, and continue to contribute to the welfare  of the broad masses of Hong Kong people.    Zhou Nan made the statement while meeting and feting key  personnel in charge of the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants  Association [CCSA] which is the largest organization of  government functionaries in Hong Kong. He said, "When handling  issues on government functionaries, including their appointment,  promotion, welfare, and remuneration, the Chinese Government  will strictly abide by relevant provisions of the Basic Law.  There will not be a so-called `major reshuffle' let alone such  an issue as `settling accounts afterward'."    Zhou Nan expressed his hope that the Hong Kong Government  functionaries will make more contributions to serve the society,  ensuring a smooth transition of Hong Kong in 1997, and to  safeguard Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity.  Meanwhile, he also hoped that the CCSA will further exercise  its influence in this regard, and will continually unite the  broad masses of government functionaries so that they will  retain their posts and continue to serve in Hong Kong after 1997.    Speaking at the banquet, Zhou Nan commended the CCSA for its  continuing efforts to fight for the rational rights and  interests of government functionaries for a prolonged period,  and affirmed the CCSA's contributions to Hong Kong society. He  also indicated his appreciation for the CCSA's stance that  government functionaries should be "apolitical" and for its  practical, steady, earnest, and responsible work style.    CCSA leaders commented on the CCSA's celebration of its 80th  founding anniversary in 1994. They also expressed their views  on issues including government functionaries' pension saving  fund, their appointments and working conditions, their  localization issue, and their transfer to another administrative  system.</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / PM shrugs off concern over speed of recovery: Major hints at tax rises and says loopholes in system will be closed MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday shrugged off concern that the economic recovery may be faltering and reinforced expectations at Westminster of higher taxes in next month's Budget. Amid angry exchanges in the House of Commons with Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, Mr Major also hinted that the Treasury will seek to raise part of the additional revenue it needs by closing so-called tax loopholes. Mr Major's upbeat assessment that the economic recovery will be sustained followed a warning to the cabinet from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, that the government's Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement must be reduced. But fears that recession elsewhere in Europe and weakening consumer confidence could abort the upturn prompted renewed warnings from prominent Conservative backbench MPs about the risks of large tax increases. While a majority of Tory MPs appear resigned to an overall rise in tax of Pounds 2bn or Pounds 3bn, Mr Clarke was told at an 80-strong meeting last night of the party's backbench finance committee to rule out higher income taxes. Mr John Townend, the chairman of the committee, said afterwards the general view was that Mr Clarke should do nothing to prejudice the economic recovery. That caution was reinforced by a recommendation from the Treasury's panel of outside economic advisers that Mr Clarke should opt for only a 'modest' tightening of fiscal policy next year. The advisers said this should be accompanied by an early cut in interest rates and by a medium-term package of spending and tax measures to reduce borrowing. After an hour-long cabinet discussion of the economic outlook, Downing Street issued only a brief statement saying that Mr Clarke would 'take into account' his colleagues' views when framing the November Budget. But ministers said the chancellor - with the support of some cabinet ministers - had left no doubt that he was planning to add to the Pounds 7bn package of tax increases pencilled in for April. Most senior ministers believe Mr Clarke will be obliged to raise at least an extra Pounds 3bn in revenue despite the opposition of several rightwing colleagues. Some believe that if the economic outlook improves over the next few weeks the figure could be closer to Pounds 5bn or Pounds 6bn, with a 1 percentage point cut in interest rates to 'sweeten' the package. Several cabinet ministers, including Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, are thought to favour further restrictions on mortgage interest relief, perhaps limiting it to 15 per cent. Others believe personal income tax allowances should be restricted to the 20p rate, a move which might be combined with a modest extension of VAT. Rejecting calls from Mr Smith to reverse the planned introduction of VAT on fuel, Mr Major underlined his determination to reduce borrowing by telling MPs: 'The reality is that we need to cope with the fiscal deficit and we have the courage to do so.' But he responded positively to Labour calls for any tax rises to focus on ending tax concessions enjoyed by wealthy individuals, companies and overseas residents. Alluding to the Treasury's internal forecast that the economy will grow by about 1.75 per cent this year, Mr Major added that evidence that recovery had taken root was 'unmistakable'. Mr Clarke echoed that view at a meeting of the National Housing and Town Planning Council. 'Wise men' warn over tax rises; Tighter fiscal policy urged, Page 12 Editorial Comment, Page 19</p>

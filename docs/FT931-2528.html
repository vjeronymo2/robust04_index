			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / 24-hour BBC news opposed A LARGE majority of those questioned in a Mori poll commissioned by Reader's Digest has condemned one of the main initiatives of Mr John Birt, BBC director-general, Gary Mead writes. Seventy-three per cent opposed the launch of a 24-hour radio news service, which is planned for next year. That rose to 80 per cent for those aged 65 and over. Plans for an all-day television news service were even more strongly rejected - by 81 per cent. But BBC1 appears to be popular: 73 per cent of those in the survey said they would miss the channel if it went off the air. Only 44 per cent felt the same affection for BBC2. More than half (56 per cent) believed television broadcasting quality would deteriorate if the BBC was changed. However, 60 per cent said they favoured replacing the television licence fee with commercial advertising. Attitudes towards the licence fee have scarcely altered since Mori's last Reader's Digest poll on this issue in 1988. Then, 58 per cent said they wished to see the end of the licence fee. Almost 70 per cent in yesterday's poll said they would miss some form of BBC radio - local or national - if it ceased broadcasting.</p>

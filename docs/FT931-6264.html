			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: North Broken Hill Peko up 24% NORTH Broken Hill Peko (North), the Australian resources group, has reported a 24 per cent increase in net profit to ADollars 52.3m (USDollars 36m) for the six months to the end of December. However, the group said pre-tax profit fell by ADollars 25m to ADollars 113m, partly because of the cost of restructuring in the forestry and paper production divisions. The improvement in net profit reflected a gain of ADollars 16.8m from the sale of shares and a reduction of ADollars 11.4m in net interest costs, which fell to ADollars 23.4m as a result of debt reduction and lower interest rates. The board said second-half net profit should equal the first-half result, but warned that earnings would be affected by lower iron ore prices and difficult trading conditions facing the forestry and paper businesses. At the operating level, the group said three of its four divisions suffered falls in pre-tax earnings. Warman International, the mining pump manufacturer, increased profit by 70 per cent to ADollars 14m. Sales fell 7 per cent to ADollars 751m.</p>

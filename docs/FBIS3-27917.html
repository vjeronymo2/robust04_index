			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Economic Planning Board [EPB] yesterday  announced the restructuring of the top economic policy-making  body by trimming redundant organs. Under the plan, two  assistant minister-level posts--assistant minister for  international policy coordination and one in three standing  members at the Fair Trade Commission [FTC]--were abolished.    The plan also called for abolishing two director-general  posts, one in the international policy coordination office and  economic information and education bureau.    At the same time, eight director-level posts in the  international policy coordination office, economic information  and education bureau and performance evaluation bureau were  scrapped.    Instead, five director-level posts--three in the budget  office and two in the FTC--will be established to adapt to the  changing economic environment, resulting in a net loss of three  director-level posts, EPB officials said.    The EPB said the organizational change came in response to a  widely-claimed principle for a "small but efficient" government  which President Kim Yong-sam has advocated consistently since  taking office last February.    Analysts said the EPB moves will spark a chain reaction to  slim down other government ministries which have been concerned  about public clamor for a small government.    Under the plan, an assistant economic planning minister will  be authorized to oversee the function of the now-defunct  assistant minister for international policy coordination.    The international policy coordination office will be scaled  down to a bureau which will encompass five divisions and will be  led by two directors general.    The most striking of the EPB's organizational changes was to  establish a new bureau commissioned by a director general fully  in charge of the defense budget in the budget office.    The EPB said the establishment of a new bureau in the budget  office is aimed at making a thorough examination of the defense  budget which has long remained as a sanctuary in the government  budgeting process.    Analysts said now the EPB will be able to examine government  outlays made under the Yulgok military buildup program, which  has stirred a major controversy over irregularities recently.</p>

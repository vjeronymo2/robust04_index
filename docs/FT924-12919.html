			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Markets: Peps prove popular . . . - At a Glance New figures for the amount invested in personal equity plans show that Pounds 2.26bn was invested in Peps for the 1991-92 tax year, with more than 640,000 new general plans taken out. This is a rise of Pounds 660m from the previous year, when the amount invested was Pounds 1.6bn. The increase was caused in large part by new investment trust launches, which allowed the full annual limit of Pounds 6,000 to be put into a Pep. Changes announced in the Budget this year lifted the Pounds 3,000 limit on unit and investment trusts. The Treasury also attributed last year's rise in investments to the introduction of single company Peps. The total invested in general Peps since their introduction in 1987 now amounts to more than Pounds 6bn.</p>

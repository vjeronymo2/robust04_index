			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 23 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  both want to agree during ongoing informal talks in Washington  to resume the stalled bilateral trade framework talks, Vice  Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito said Monday [23 May].    Saito told a news conference it is clear the two sides want  to reach agreement on the resumption during the unofficial vice-  ministerial talks to be held again Monday and that he hopes  Tokyo and Washington would make efforts to achieve that.    Japan and the U.S. have held three rounds of exploratory  talks since last week to weigh terms and conditions for resuming  the negotiations under the so-called "framework" agreement  concluded last July.    The trade talks, which are aimed at widening foreign access  to the Japanese market and paring down Japan's vast trade  surplus, broke down in February after Tokyo rejected  Washington-proposed yardsticks to gauge progress in Japanese  imports.    Saito also said a visit to the U.S. by Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa is a possibility depending on the outcome of Monday's  unofficial talks.    Kakizawa has repeatedly expressed his intention to visit the  U.S.    Saito said the government will consider what steps should be  taken after the ongoing talks end.</p>

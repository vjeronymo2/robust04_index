			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Leading council officer arrested A MIDLANDS local authority was last night at the centre of a fraud inquiry following the arrest of one of its senior executives. Mr Geoff Wilson, chief planning officer at Warwick district council, was arrested after a year-long police inquiry, Tim Burt writes. Warwick police said the inquiry involved planning applications for housing and industrial developments. Serving councillors, former councillors and officials will also be questioned. Mr Wilson, one of the longest-serving chief planning officers in the country, was arrested at the headquarters of the Tory-led council. Police sealed off the building's first-floor planning offices and removed a large number of documents. It emerged yesterday that Mr Tony Dalton, leader of the council's Tory group, had been helping with the investigation for more than a year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 3 (XINHUA) -- The Standing Committee of  the National People's Congress (NPC), China's legislature, is  expected to formulate a decision on punishing criminals who  violate copyrights at the committee's seventh session which  opens May 5.    Spokesman of the General Office of the NPC Standing  Committee  Shen Zhangrong said this morning that China's Copyright Law has  played a "significant role" in protecting copyrights and  promoting the development of China's cultural and scientific  causes since it was put into effect on June 1, 1991.    "However, piracy of books, audio and video tapes, and  computer software has become quite rampant in recent years, in  illegal attempts to reap huge profits," Shen said.    This has infringed upon the rights of the authors and  destroyed the normal order of the socialist cultural market and  economic activities. "It has also affected foreign trade of the  country and its cultural and scientific exchanges and  cooperation with foreign countries," said the spokesman, adding  that perpetrators of this kind of activity should be severely  punished.    During the eight-day session, the legislators will also  deliberate over nine other draft laws and regulations. They are  the draft law on management of urban real estate, draft  supplementary provisions to regulations governing offenses  against public order, draft amendments to the regulations on  active service and ranks of military officers of the People's  Liberation Army, the draft law on judges and the draft law on  prosecutors.    The legislators will also hear a report on the construction  of the Three-Gorges Dam project.</p>

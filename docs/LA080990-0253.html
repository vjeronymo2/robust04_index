			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> BARDOT URGES CHIMP'S RETURN  </P> <P> Brigitte Bardot is demanding that Japan return a chimpanzee that a French zoo  traded to a Japanese research institute for 10 monkeys.  </P> <P> The former film star said during a meeting with Japanese Ambassador Akitani  Kiuchi that the 10-year-old chimpanzee named Chloe was living "worse than  badly, in a frozen universe" at the University of Kyoto's Primate Research  Institute.  </P> <P> Chloe was traded along with an orangutan by the Zoo de Vincennes in Paris for  10 macaque monkeys in 1984. The orangutan died earlier this year in a concrete  cage, Bardot's Society for the Protection of Animals claimed.  </P> <P> "Chloe is in a basement, lacking sunlight, space, contact and especially lacks  affection, like all laboratory subjects," it said in a statement. The type of  research was not specified.  </P> <P> The Japanese government will investigate Bardot's claims, a spokesman said. But  he noted that the animal trade was made between private institutions.  </P> <P> Bardot, 55, who rose to world fame in the 1956 movie "And God Created Women,"  gave up her film career in 1973 and has since worked to protect animals.  </P></p>

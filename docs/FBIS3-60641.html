			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Tokyo Asahi Television Network in  Japanese at 0219 GMT on 28 November, as part of its 105-minute  talkshow "Sunday Project" which begins at 0100 GMT carries an  approximately 15-minute report on an exclusive interview with  exiled North Korean Lieutenant Im Yong-sum by "KOREA REPORT"  chief editor Byon Jin-il in Seoul. In the recorded interview  conducted in an unidentified room in Seoul, Im Yong-sum speaks  in Korean with Japanese voice-over translation. Date of the  interview is not given.    Concerning North Korea's alleged construction of various  facilities underground, Im Yong-sum, who was reportedly in  charge of facilities construction, says: "[In building  underground facilities] North Korea is making use of Iraq's Gulf  War experience, wherein the U.S. military and allied forces made  saturation air raids and Iraqi airfighters were unable to  demonstrate their abilities. Therefore, an effort is being made  in North Korea to build a runway under ground so that airplanes  can be launched even if a runway is destroyed."    With regard to the DPRK's suspected development of the  missile "No Dong," the exiled officer notes: "Missile launch  pads have been built in Hate, North Hamgyong, and in Munchon,  Kangwon; and another missile launch pad is under construction in  Chungan [as heard] in a border area near China. These are the  major launch pads. When I was building military facilities, I  heard that the existing missiles are deployed to counterattack  Japanese and U.S. air raids, and at that time, I firmly believed  that if we got serious about it, our missiles could destroy even  Japan, the United States, or South Korea."    Asked if he thinks North Korea has already had nuclear  weapons, Im Song-sum answers: "Yes. In North Korea, even  rank-and-file soldiers think so. All North Korean executive  military officers know that two facilities located in Yongbyong  are the nuclear facilities. If these two facilities are open to  inspections, North Korea's nuclear development technology will  be revealed." He then notes that when he was in North Korea, he  believed that North Korea had already developed nuclear weapons  as a nuclear deterrent. He then stresses if North Korea should  provoke a war, the United States would joint the war, and  therefore, Japan's participation in the war would be inevitable,  noting: "As a preemptive strike, North Korea would attack U.S.  military bases in Japan and then make air raids on Japan's major  military bases." He says all the soldiers were ordered this  year to prepare for a semi-war.    Im Song-sum then discusses growing dissatisfaction with Kim  Chong-il within the military. He also speaks about North  Korea's food situation. He says "living condition of the people  living beyond Pyongyang is miserable."    The interview ends at 0234 GMT.</p>

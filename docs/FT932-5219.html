			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Sweden strengthens on Procordia split BOURSES showed a tendency towards improvement in the afternoon, in spite of Wall Street's early declines, writes Our Markets Staff. STOCKHOLM was boosted by the announcement that Procordia's pharmaceutical and consumer products divisions were to be split, with Volvo taking a controlling stake in the latter, to be called Branded Consumer Products. The government also said that after the demerger it would sell its stake in Procordia. The shares responded with Volvo B's rising SKr16 or 4 per cent to SKr406 and Procordia B's by SKr29 or 17.6 per cent to SKr193. The news lifted the market overall, with the Affarsvarlden general index putting on 22.40 or 2.1 per cent to 1,091.30 as turnover rose to SKr1.03bn. Most analysts were satisfied with the announcement, noting that Volvo's cash flow would be improved through BCP. However, some noted that given the downturn in the European consumer products sector the group's recovery growth might be 'dulled'. FRANKFURT moved from early disappointment with German GDP figures to a small rise on short covering at the end of the official session, after the Bundesbank left interest rates unchanged. The DAX index closed 4.41 higher at 1,629.62, turnover rising from DM3.7bn to DM4.3bn. Volkswagen, up DM2.50 to DM319.50, put on another DM3 in the post bourse after the AGM was told the company could break even this year after a first half loss. The rise was obscured as the shares went ex a DM2 dividend and its associated tax credit for domestic shareholders. Viag, the energy-based conglomerate, climbed DM6.80 to DM350.80 for a two-day gain of DM11.30, dealers saying that the appointment of a new Bavarian prime minister had enhanced Viag's chances of a merger with Bayernwerk, one of Germany's leading power utilities, currently owned 60 per cent by the state of Bavaria, and 39 per cent by Viag. AMSTERDAM concentrated on KLM which released fiscal 1993 results much in line with analysts' forecasts. Encouraged by the figures, the shares moved up 6 per cent, before easing slightly to Fl 26.30, a gain on the day of 90 cents, or 3.5 per cent. Mr Richard Brakenhoff, transport analyst at Pierson, Heldring &amp; Pierson in Amsterdam, commented that the airline remained under pressure, particularly in light of its large debt burden. The CBS Tendency index put on 0.1 to 104.7. PARIS suffered technical problems which suspended trading for a couple of hours in the afternoon. As a result turnover was low at FFr1.6bn as the CAC-40 index fell 7.92 to 1,867.92. Both Peugeot and Michelin fell to new year lows following negative news this week on prospects for European car sales. Peugeot lost FFr15 to Ffr515 and Michelin FFr6.80 to FFr134.20. MILAN settled back with many investors preferring to stay on the sidelines ahead of this weekend's local elections. The Comit index closed off 3.61 at 538.19. Fiat remained active following the publication of unexciting results on Monday. The shares lost L161 to L5,649 and hit L5,580 on the kerb. ZURICH closed on its end-May highs, strong financials and chemicals taking the SMI index up 9.7 to 2,268.9. Insurers continued to narrow the differentials with banks, Winterthur bearers adding SFr70 francs to SFr3,270, Swiss Re SFr30 to SFr3,110 and Zurich SFr50 to SFr2,290. Roche and Sandoz led chemicals, but other industrials put in the big share price rises. Bearers in Ascom, the telecoms group, extended their recovery from a strong fall some weeks ago, rising SFr75 to SFr1,265. WARSAW tumbled, writes Christopher Bobinski. Poland's emerging equity market, which has seen share prices rise by 175 per cent since Easter, fell by 9.6 per cent yesterday. All 18 stocks quoted on the exchange dropped, all but one of them down by 10 per cent, the maximum in any one session. This brought the WIG indicator down from 3,710 on Tuesday, when it indicated some uncertainty with a 2 per cent decline, to 3,354. Turnover was still high at 371.9bn zloty.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- June 3                                              THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1157.64    1157.05    1157.99    1157.94 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1215.30    1213.56    1215.96    1216.06  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1158.44    1159.00    1160.55    1160.81 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1215.81    1216.08    1217.44    1217.28  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Jun 2    June 1    May 28    May 27    May 26  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1155.78   1153.22   1161.58   1165.01   1162.51 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1215.58   1215.43   1224.85   1231.31   1226.76  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1161.55; 200 - 1218.13 Low/day: 100 - 1156.84  200 - 1213.56.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are especially interested in comments regarding an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment for non-proprietary hospitals that make payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in lieu of taxes and on a methodology for determining such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an adjustment. As we previously noted, 13 percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-proprietary hospitals report payments in lieu of taxes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The uncertainty about the exact nature of those payments is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one reason why we have decided to delay implementation of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific property tax adjustment for those hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, our initial limited investigation of this issue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggests that those payments do not reflect assessments that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can be categorized as capital-related costs under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;413.130(a)(3). It appears that some non-proprietary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals may have reflected payments made for assessments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are not based on the valuation of the hospital's real  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or personal property. Thus, the available evidence does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support adoption of an adjustment for non-proprietary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals' payments in lieu of taxes. However, we will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to study this matter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any property tax adjustment would have to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implemented in a budget neutral fashion, so that total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated payments under the prospective payment system for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capital-related costs with such an adjustment would equal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total estimated payments in the absence of a property tax  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment. A property tax adjustment applied to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal rate thus requires a corresponding reduction to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> base Federal rate to assure budget neutrality. It is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impossible to determine the precise magnitude of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required adjustment to the Federal rate until we determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both the status of those proprietary hospitals that are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently reporting taxes and the nature of the payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reported by non-proprietary hospitals in lieu of taxes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, since our preliminary data indicates that tax  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments by proprietary hospitals are at least 0.77 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of total capital costs, we believe that a reduction to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> base capital rate of at least 0.77 percent would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary. The final amount of the necessary adjustment to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Federal rate would depend upon the ultimate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination concerning the proprietary hospitals not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting tax payments and the nature of the payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reported by non-proprietary hospitals. We welcome comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the equity of removing tax amounts from the base Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate and distributing them only to tax-paying hospitals in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the form of an adjustment to the Federal rate payment. Our  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concern is that special payment adjustments recognize only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs that are distinguishable and unique. We also wish to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> avoid granting unwarranted advantages to any particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> class of hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We plan to conduct further analysis on this issue prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the publication of the final rule. We will also analyze  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments and recommendations submitted in response to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussion. We will make a determination concerning whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to adopt a property tax adjustment, and the form that any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such adjustment would take, when we have obtained sufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relevant data and have resolved all significant problems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inherent to any adjustment methodology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Revision of Provision Relating to Exceptions Payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (&sect;412.348)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 412.348 provides that, during the transition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period, a hospital may receive additional payment under an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceptions process when its regular payments are less than a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum percentage, established by class of hospital, of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital's reasonable capital-related costs. The amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the exceptions payment is the difference between the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital's minimum payment level and the payments the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital would receive under the capital prospective payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system in the absence of an exceptions payment. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparison is made on a cumulative basis for all cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting periods during which the hospital is subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the capital prospective payment transition rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under current &sect;412.348(b)(1), the minimum payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentages by class of hospitals for FY 1995 are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

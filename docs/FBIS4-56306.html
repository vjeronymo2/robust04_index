			<p>BFN     [Text] Panama City, 2 May (ACAN-EFE) -- The Democratic  Revolutionary Party [PRD] reported today, Monday, that a  policeman tried to shoot presidential candidate Ernesto Perez  Balladares with a pistol. The man, who is in custody, said he  drew the gun to fend off an assault.    The PRD, an opposition party, issued a communique describing  the incident as "a foiled attempt" on Perez Balladares, whom  opinion polls show as the favorite in next Sunday's general  elections.    Electoral Tribunal Magistrate Dennis Allen, however, said  the  policeman, whom the PRD identified as Maritime Service Corporal  Juan Bautista Zapata, said after being detained that he was just  trying to repel an attacker who assaulted him while he was  attending the PRD rally in downtown Panama City. Bautista  Zapata was wearing civilian clothes at the time of the incident.</p>

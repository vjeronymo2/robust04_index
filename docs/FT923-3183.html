			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: UK stock market Markets thrive on rumour, not least in the so-called close season ahead of results when companies are not permitted to state their case. But according to the chief executive of one Footsie company last week some of the wilder stories of the last few weeks - particularly in the food sector - have become a serious drain on management time and company morale. Traders are obviously desperate to drum up business - by any means - but it is also the case that the UK economy appeared to take another dip earlier in the summer just as boards were going into purdah. Investors should beware, but vicious tongues are merely one reflection of the market's inability to find an appropriate level.</p>

			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Britain and France agree last-minute deal on Orly Britain and France agreed a compromise yesterday on the opening up of Orly airport in Paris to UK airlines, just 24 hours before the escalation of a potentially damaging dispute. Under the accord, reached after two days of intensive telephone negotiations between the two countries' transport ministers, France agreed to open Orly to flights from London by the end of next month at the latest. Britain, meanwhile, will consider improving access for French airlines to London airports, particularly Heathrow, in line with European regulations. British Airways and Air UK had threatened to defy a ban by the French government and launch services to Orly this morning. They had announced plans to start flights to the airport in southern Paris following a ruling last month by the European Commission which said France must immediately open the London-Orly routes. After the agreement was announced, Mr John MacGregor, the UK transport minister, said it was 'a victory for European open skies'. The dispute had been 'the first test case' for implementing the European Union's new liberalised air transport market. Mr MacGregor's French counterpart, Mr Bernard Bosson, who had warned British airlines against trying to fly to Orly without official approval, described the deal as equitable. The dispute came to a head last week when Mr Bosson declared that the planned London-Orly flights could not start until a number of problems had been resolved. These included measures to ease congestion at Orly, environmental considerations for local residents and improved access to Heathrow for French airlines. In a joint statement, the two governments said France would do 'everything in complete transparency' to solve the problems at the airport, in accordance with European provisions. BA and Air UK both welcomed the agreement. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, said: 'Our objective all along was to secure our right to fly to Orly and we have done that.' Air UK will delay starting its Orly services from London's Stansted airport. Both BA and Air UK will continue operating services to Charles de Gaulle, Paris's other airport. Mr MacGregor confirmed that Britain would continue to oppose French plans to inject FFr20m (Pounds 2.3m) of fresh capital into Air France, the financially troubled French national carrier. He also said the UK would continue to take a strong position against state subsidies for other European national carriers. The UK and its airlines are also expected to keep putting pressure on France to open Orly, the main airport for domestic French destinations, well before the end of the June deadline. Despite the agreement, the French government faces more opposition from trade unions to increased competition on domestic airline routes. Union groups at Air Inter, the domestic subsidiary of Air France, are planning a one-day strike tomorrow to protest against the liberalisation of the French airline market. The French government is also resisting the timetable of deregulation which has been demanded by the European Commission. It is appealing to the European Court of Justice against a Commission ruling that the Orly-Toulouse and Orly-Marseilles routes must be opened to competition within six months. TAT European Airlines, BA's French affiliate, said yesterday's agreement encouraged it to believe that France would implement the Commission's ruling on these routes.

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo alert Takeover speculation in Lasmo, the oil exploration group, continued unabated yesterday as marketmakers reported heavy trading in the ordinary shares, the 'new' nil-paid stock and in the traded options market. Heavy activity in traded options earlier this week alerted the market to the possibility that a potential bidder could be stalking the company. Elf remains the market's favourite to bid for Lasmo, although other names, including Enterprise have been mooted. Yesterday saw 11m ordinary shares traded, 9.8m new shares change hands and the equivalent of over 5m shares traded in the options. Dealers said the pattern of trading in Lasmo shares and options yesterday was the same as earlier in the week. The ordinaries opened better, eased in mid-session and then moved up again as the buyer of the options re-appeared during the afternoon. 'It certainly feels as if a stake-builder or bidder might be operating,' said one broker.' Lasmo ordinaries closed a further 4 higher at 145p and the 'new' nil-paid 4 up at 41p, after 43p. Lasmo options were the second heaviest traded. An institutional seller of over 6m shares in Rank Organisation - around 2.5 per cent of the company - boosted total turnover in the leisure group to 14m, the third highest volume ever. SG Warburg, the company's broker, was said to have bought the stock at 618p and sold it to several institutions at 621p. One dealer said the small discount to the current Rank share price and the speed of the placing was an indication of the strong sentiment underpinning recent strength in the stock. Rank shares slipped 3 to 423p. In another big deal, 16m Iceland shares - over 6 per cent of the frozen food retailer - were crossed by Charterhouse Tilney at 155p. The shares ended steady at 164p. A stock overhang in Compass Group, with dealers talking of an unplaced line of 1.5m, saw the shares retreat 14 to 333p. Disappointing figures from Albert Fisher knocked the shares, off 6 at 57p. BICC outperformed the market, the shares closing 8 firmer at 443p in the wake of as series of upbeat institutional presentations in Scotland yesterday and in London on Wednesday. The company was said to have told institutions that European markets are performing better than had been expected and that the US businesses continued to perform strongly. Vodafone jumped 12 more to 512p as NatWest's positive stance on Wednesday was followed yesterday by a profits upgrading and buy recommendation issued by Hoare Govett. The broker increased its 1996 forecast by Pounds 45m and said it expected 1m new subscribers for Vodafone this year. Continuing worries that the UK merchant banks and financial institutions have suffered badly from the downward spiral in bond markets since mid-February triggered renewed weakness in merchant banks where Hambros lost 17 more to 348p and Kleinwort the same to 448p. Financial services groups were hit as senior market traders suggested that Lloyds' move to absorb C &amp; G could well bring substantial redemptions of unit trusts with monies being deposited ad hoc in building society accounts to take advantage of any further moves by banks to absorb building societies. Mercury Asset Management, one of the UK's leading fund management groups, retreated 5 to 590p. Hogg Group moved up 10 more to 234p as the market became increasingly convinced that an opening shot of around 240p in a potential takeover battle for the insurance broker is imminent. HSBC, remains the market's favourite to initiate the battle, with several probable bidders in the wings. Better than expected first quarter figures from SmithKline Beecham saw the pharmaceutical group's shares rise 8 to 372p on turnover of 1.7m and the Units add 12 at 339p with 1.7m dealt. A profit warning from Transport Development sent the shares down 10 to 252p. Conglomerate Williams Holdings rose 9 to 394p as SGST advised clients to switch out of TI, down 2 before rallying to close 4 better at 418p. Other statistics, Page 29</p>

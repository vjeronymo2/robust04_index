			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Top Supreme Court liberal to stand down Justice Harry Blackmun, the US Supreme Court's leading liberal, yesterday announced his retirement at the end of the court's summer term, giving President Bill Clinton the chance to name his successor. Mr Clinton yesterday gave a brief and moving tribute to Justice Blackmun, famous for his ruling upholding abortion rights. But he gave no clues on who would get his second nomination to the bench since coming to office. 'This is Justice Blackmun's day,' Mr Clinton said. The president is thought likely to pick someone close to Justice Blackmun's views, meaning little immediate change in the political balance of the Court. The prospect of right-wing domination of the bench, which seemed on the cards during the Reagan and Bush presidencies, has receded. But the delicate mechanisms of the bench may persuade Mr Clinton to seek a nominee more inclined to conciliation and consensus than the independent-minded Justice Blackmun, who took pride in his own principled dissent. Mr Blackmun was appointed to the bench by President Richard Nixon in 1970 as 'a strict constructionist' following the failure of two earlier conservative nominees to pass muster. However, although a lifelong Republican leavened by the progressive traditions of his native Minnesota, Justice Blackmun quickly emerged as a liberal bulwark. On the current Court he is aligned with Justice John Paul Stevens, another Republican appointee, with the middle ground occupied by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy and David Souter and the right by Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. Justice Blackmun will always be known for two judicial stances. He was the principal author in 1973 of the 7-2 Roe v Wade ruling protecting the right to abortion. Unapolegetic to the end for this ruling, for which he has been much vilified by conservatives, he simply said yesterday he thought it 'a necessary step on the road to the full emancipation of women'. He also remained an adamant opponent to capital punishment on the grounds he could find no evidence that it served as a deterrent. But he frequently conceded that he was swimming against a national tide, with two-thirds of the states now employing the death penalty (proudly, he would point out that Minnesota had legally executed nobody in more than 80 years). 'It hasn't been much fun on most occasions,' Justice Blackmun wryly noted yesterday of his frequent status in the Court's minority. But Mr Clinton, an old acquaintance, saw it otherwise: 'Justice has not only been his title, it has been his guiding light.' Senator George Mitchell of Maine and Mr Bruce Babbitt, interior secretary, are among the leading candidates to replace Justice Blackmun. Other candidates include three federal judges - Mr Jose Cabranes from Connecticut, who, if selected, would be the first Hispanic justice, Mr Stephen Breyer from Massachussetts and Mr Richard Arnold from Arkansas. All were mentioned in last year's search for a nominee, a position filled by Mrs Ginsburg.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 4 KYODO -- Former Prime Minister  Sosuke Uno said in a New Year interview that he is not confident  that the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will soon be  able to regain the reigns of power. Uno, who served as Japan's  prime minister for three months through early August 1989, also  told KYODO NEWS SERVICE he considers it unlikely that the LDP  will splinter any further.    Uno said he is not optimistic about an early LDP comeback  because "the ballots cast by the people are not really so  ambiguous." Noting that the LDP would need to win back over 30  seats in order to obtain a majority in the House of  Representatives, he said, "it will probably be difficult to  regain them in the next election."    He said that while it cannot be helped if a small number of  parliamentarians leave the party, "I want to tell them: `don't  do anything funny.' The LDP has lots of flaws, but they can't  be fixed in one fell swoop. Everyone must chime in to fix them."</p>

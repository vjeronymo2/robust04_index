			<p>BFN     [Text] As has already been reported, Crimean President  Yuriy Meshkov personally dismissed Oleksandr Plyuta from the  post of interior minister of this autonomous republic.  Ukrainian Interior Minister Andriy Vasylyshyn sent a letter to  the executive head of that autonomous area about this matter.    The letter notes in particular that the Crimean president's  decrees run counter to Ukraine's current legislation. The  militia is a unified system of bodies, which are part of the  structure of Ukraine's Interior Ministry and as such are  subordinate to Ukraine's Interior Ministry. In Andriy  Vasylyshyn's opinion, the Crimean president's decision regarding  the interior minister should be reviewed.    This was reported by the Interior Ministry's main public  relations center.</p>

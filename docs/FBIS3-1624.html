CRI  [China Radio International] correspondent (Li Gengxian) reports  from Zhengzhou, capital city of central China's Henan Province.  Their large-scale grain wholesale market there is playing a  pioneer role in the burgeoning price reform. Here is Du Lijun  with the story:    [Du Lijun] The price of farm products has long been under  strict government control. Under this system, the local  governments bought grain from farmers and sold it to the rural  residents at fixed low prices. Farmers did not feel motivated  to do their job well because there was no profit incentive. In  central China's Henan Province, the bread basket of the country,  farmers have wished for grain price reform for a long time.  Finally, a new grain wholesale market with no preset price  control has been set up. Grain and edible oils can be bought and  sold at real market value. The Zhengzhou grain wholesale market  is the first and only trial market of its kind which has been  approved by the State Council. It has been co-organized by the  Ministry of Internal Trade and the Henan provincial government.    Our correspondent (Li Gengxian) said that since the market  opened its doors in 1990, great economic and social benefits  have been achieved. It has over 380 network members in 24 of  China's provinces and municipalities. They study market demand  in order to coordinate grain distribution throughout the  country. By the end of last year, about 4 million tonnes of  grain and edible oil had been traded. Trade volume in the new  market has reached 3.5 billion yuan, or about $410 million.  Open and fair competition defines the spirit of the Zhengzhou  wholesale market. The grain price settled on among buyers and  sellers here is a good source of information for foreign grain  market observers.    (Li Gengxian) said that because of the success of the  wholesale market, the Zhengzhou Commodities Exchange made it  stable in May of last year. It is the first farm and subsidies  future in China. [sentence as heard] During the second half of  last year, the futures market signed more than 1 million  standard contracts at a total volume of 3 billion yuan. At the  same time, transaction rules and management at the exchange  center have improved.    The commodity exchange is now automated to enable more  efficient trading. Each day, the exchange center delivers  information to the world through the ASSOCIATED PRESS and  REUTERS news agencies, as well as the China Broadcasting  Communications Company. The grain futures exchange center is  also building strong business links with its foreign  counterparts in the United States, Japan, and Canada. The quick  development of the Zhengzhou grain wholesale market and futures  exchange center is another door opened for China's rapidly  growing economy. [end Du Lijun recording]</p>

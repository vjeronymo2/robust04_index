			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / LWT falls to Pounds 760m bid from Granada Granada won control of London Weekend Television for Pounds 760m yesterday after the first successful hostile bid in the UK television industry. The combined group will command about 30 per cent of UK television advertising revenue. Mr Alex Bernstein, Granada's chairman, said: 'This is good for the industry and good for both sets of shareholders.' But LWT chairman Sir Christopher Bland criticised those shareholders who had failed to back a management team which 'has performed outstandingly well for them'. He singled out Mercury Asset Management, which accepted the offer for its 14.2 per cent stake on Thursday, and suggested it had been swayed by its large stake in Granada. 'If there's one single reason why we lost, it is that MAM has around Pounds 400m of Granada and less than Pounds 100m of LWT.' The directors and senior managers of LWT have the consolation that the value of their shares in the company has doubled to about Pounds 75m since Granada first took a stake in LWT last year. The shares were issued to 50 individuals following the controversial golden-handcuff scheme put in place five years ago. Sir Christopher's holding is now worth about Pounds 14m. Mr Greg Dyke, chief executive, has a Pounds 9m stake. Granada expects to make significant cost savings from combining its north-west ITV franchise with LWT's weekend station in London. Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive, insisted they would 'remain separate franchises'. He would not be drawn on likely job losses. As for the LWT directors, Mr Robinson said that Sir Christopher had agreed 'right from the start' that there would be no place for him in the enlarged group. Mr Dyke's future was still a matter for discussion. News of Granada's victory came shortly after the close of the bid at 3pm yesterday afternoon. Granada said it had valid acceptances in respect of 40.3 per cent of LWT's shares which, together with the shares it already owned, gave it a total of 57.8 per cent. Institutions that accepted the bid included PDFM and Fidelity. It is thought that AMP sold its shares in the market. When loyalty loses, Page 12 London stocks, Page 17 Lex, Page 26</p>

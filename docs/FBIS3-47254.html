			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 11 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  presided over the sixth meeting for promoting "a new economy" on  Tuesday as a gesture of determination to materialize his vision  of a viable economy based on deregulation and strong competitive  edge, commonly called "ynomics."    Kim set the direction for economic policy and then listened  to reports from 11 related agencies, starting with the Science  and Technology Ministry.    The man who pledged to be an "economic president" showed his  priorities by the order in which he heard the reports from his  cabinet.    His predecessors had called in ministers with security and  diplomatic portfolios first for their new year reports. In  contrast, Kim heard from the Economic Planning Board first and  then listened to reports from each economy-related ministry.    On Monday, he had lunch with three former presidents and  heard about various projects to promote science and technology  from Yi Sang-hui, chairman of the advisory council on Science  and Technology. Kim promised to strengthen the country's  economic competitiveness within his five years in office.    Naming expansion of social overhead capital, balanced land  development, deregulation, science and technology development,  resolution of regional economic imbalances, and stronger  competitiveness of rural areas as the main tasks to improve the  country's economic competitiveness, he said he will personally  see that they are carried out.    Chong Chae-sok, deputy prime minister and Economic Planning  minister, reported that his team will draw up a comprehensive  measure to rebuild rural communities to adapt to  internationalization, radically improve the business environment  to boost business activities, expand the infrastructure fund and  create equal regional development, accelerate structural reforms  and systems to prepare for free global trade, improve living  standards, stabilize prices, and encourage frugality.    Emboldened by the first balance of payments surplus in four  years, the president is determined to accomplish a second  economic leap forward for Korea by keeping industrial relations  at peace and by getting the help of businessmen, workers, public  servants and farmers, presidential aides say.    Peaceful industrial relations and stable pay are most  important to raise international competitiveness, Kim said in  the meeting, instructing the ministers to rack their brains for  ways to cement partnership between labor and management.    Designating 1994 the year of economic recovery, Kim was most  attentive to economic revitalization and to radical science and  technology development, said Pak Chae-yun, senior presidential  secretary for economic affairs.    He noted that Kim has retired his stock phrase  "pain-sharing"  in the new year.    He did not call for pain-sharing in the economy meeting, but  put stress on peaceful industrial relations, stable wages, and  reforms in economic thinking and systems.    He may believe that pain-sharing, in other words a frugality  campaign, took root last year in the gale of reforms and  changes, aides say.    Or he may have realized that the call for pain-sharing to  rebuild the country no longer appeals now that a year has passed  since his administration was born, they say.    Kim must have concluded that it was time to implant real  hope  and expectations in the people that the economy can be brought  back to life, they speculate.</p>

			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> LANE CHANGE: Even as officials take up the touchy issue of how to go back to  the voters with a new transportation sales tax (B1), some vocal foes of last  fall's failed tax measure are mulling their own proposal. . . . A change of  heart? Not really. The group, Drivers for Highway Safety, fought the 1989 tax  because some of the money would go to car-pool lanes. . . . Any proposal coming  from the group would preclude funds for car pools and rail transit, sources  said. Mark I. Pinsky and Steve Emmons  </P></p>

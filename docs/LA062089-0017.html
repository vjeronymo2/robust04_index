			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RAW SEWAGE SPILLS INTO STREET, RIVERBED  </P> <P> An estimated 100,000 gallons of raw sewage spilled into the streets of a Santa  Clarita Valley neighborhood and flowed into a nearby dry riverbed after  construction materials clogged a major sewer line Sunday night, authorities  said.  </P> <P> The sewage backup occurred in the area of Santa Clara Street and Honby Avenue  about 8 p.m. when a 21-inch underground pipe became clogged by chunks of  concrete and rock. The untreated sewage flowed into the intersection of the  streets and drained into a ditch before settling in the Santa Clara River.  </P> <P> It took crews more than four hours to get the line flowing again, and the  cleanup took until Monday afternoon. After the cleanup, authorities said there  appeared to be no environmental or health hazard.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts officials said the concrete and rock  had apparently been illegally dumped into a sewer drain by vandals or negligent  contractors.  </P></p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Drug dealing The frenzy of deal-making among pharmaceutical companies is a recognition that returns on investment in new drugs will be lower than in the past. Making the most of existing products and looking for profits elsewhere is a natural response. Governments taking a tough line on the cost of prescription medicines are also encouraging patients to buy medicines over-the-counter. So the triple alliance between Wellcome, Glaxo and Warner-Lambert has a compelling logic. Merck has already addressed the OTC market by linking with Johnson &amp; Johnson. Its decision to spend Dollars 6bn buying one of its biggest customers is more difficult to fathom. Such vertical integration has worked in other markets, but it remains open to question whether Medco can defend its share of mail-order medicines once its independence is called into question. Mr Richard Markham, who resigned unexpectedly as Merck's chief executive earlier this month, may have harboured similar doubts. Both Wellcome and Glaxo are surrendering profits from potential OTC medicines - based on the Zovirax anti-viral treatment and ulcer drug Zantac respectively - in exchange for Warner-Lambert's experience and clout in consumer marketing. But while Wellcome is taking an equity stake in what will be one of the world's largest consumer healthcare companies, Glaxo is sticking resolutely to its guns as a prescription drugs company. If that dispels lingering fears of a big acquisition in consumer healthcare, so much the better. Zovirax has already won OTC approval in several countries and should have a free run of several years before competition comes along. An indigestion remedy based on Zantac is at best three years away - pending regulatory approval, which is by no means certain - and could be second or third on to the market. The 4 per cent rise in Wellcome's share price yesterday, against a 2 per cent rise in Glaxo, thus looks a measured response. The days when prescription drugs companies could afford to look down on margins earned in consumer markets have clearly passed.</p>

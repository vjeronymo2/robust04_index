			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter was concerned that takes by physical harassment is not defined, that harassment parameters are based upon tests on humans in an air environment, and the relationship between avoidance behavior caused by aircraft and that of the detonation. This commenter (and others) was also concerned that marine mammals would not be detectable from the air, making the incidental take tables suspect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The commenter is correct that a definition for physical harassment has not been provided and that human volunteers have been used for testing the effects of explosives in the water (not in the air as the commenter stated) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in order to determine the parameters for physical harassment. Physical harassment of cetaceans due to tactile ``stings'' from the shockwave accompanying detonations has been inferred from studies with humans. This inference seems plausible given studies on dolphin skin sensitivity where the authors <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  concluded that ``the most sensitive areas of the dolphin skin (mouth, eyes, snout, melon and blowhole) are about as sensitive as the skin of human lips and fingers.'' Skin sensitivity on pinnipeds and large whales has not been tested. Therefore, until tests can be conducted to determine the overall sensitivity of the skin of marine mammals, NMFS and the Navy have made the assumption that both humans and marine mammals have similar tactile sensitivity in the water.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  The reference for human testing in the EA was in error.

Harass is proposed to mean, under the definition of ``take'' in the MMPA, ``an intentional or negligent act or omission that results in, an injury to a marine mammal, a disruption in the behavior that a marine mammal was exhibiting prior to the act or omission, or a significant effect on the normal behavioral patterns of a marine mammal, including, but not limited to, breeding, feeding, sheltering, or migration patterns.'' This definition, if implemented in that rulemaking, will apply also to these small take regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated in the application, for reasons of safety, aircraft cannot be airborne at the time of detonation and will need to leave the area approximately 3 minutes prior to detonation. Therefore, ``avoidance behavior'' by marine mammals, unfortunately, will not be directly observable from the air. Harassment takes will be calculated indirectly as those animals detected within the 3-nm post-test search zone, but outside the area wherein the test is considered to have resulted in death or injury.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS and the Navy recognize that some marine mammal species will be difficult to detect from the air and that some injurious and/or lethal takes may occur even with the mitigative measures being implemented to reduce takes. The ability of aerial observers to detect these species has been taken into account when calculating incidental take levels (refer to Table 14 and accompanying text in the EA; also see ``Mitigation'' responses below).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter believed that it was unclear whether all marine mammals will be regarded as ``may have been harassed'' if they are found within the safety zone subsequent to a test. This commenter also wanted NMFS to clarify the relationship between danger, shock, and safety zones and to specify the size of the safety zone in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Marine mammal scientists will categorize marine mammals detected within a search area of approximately 3-nm radius of a 10,000-lb charge detonation according to whether they are: (1) deceased, or severely injured and likely to die;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) ``injured'' but not likely to die; and (3) harassed. If the marine mammal is believed to have been within approximately 1 nm of the test site at the time of detonation, it will be listed as either dead or seriously injured; ``injured, but not seriously, if outside 1 nm but within approximately 13/4 nm, and ``harassed'' if outside 13/4 nm but within the 3-nm search area. NMFS notes that counting all marine mammals observed within 3 nm of a test site should account for all incidental takes, since outside the monitoring area, the 160 dB level for the onset of harassment takes will be found only at a significant depth. The LOA will specify the conditions for categorizing marine mammals, and, among other things, the size of the safety zone for each detonation weight. The final rule has been written to clarify terms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma by an </F> unidentified reporter; place and date not given: "The First  Serious Test for the Agreement by Three Presidents Will Be Its  Ratification"]    [Text] The Moscow meeting of the three presidents that  committed Ukraine to getting rid of its nuclear arsenal remains  in the limelight of public attention. KIEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI asked  Leonid Kuchma, a politician and expert in missile-building, to  comment on the event.    [Reporter] Your opinion about the decision of the Russian,  U.S., and Ukrainian presidents is interesting as the position of  a politician and, more importantly, as a professional who has  spent many years designing and building missiles.    [Kuchma] Let me single out several aspects of this  undoubtedly momentous event for Ukraine. It is so important  that I think the Ukrainian president should have first consulted  with the public before making such a decision. He could then  have used some trump cards in his discussions with parliament.  Generally speaking, people should be involved in making such  key decisions as this one, so that no one gets the impression  that some deal was cut.    Now on to the decision itself. Its first aspect is purely  political. It is no secret that over the past two years,  deliberately and with the active participation of international  media, people have been cultivating the image of Ukraine as a  resentful, unstable, and unpredictable partner. Unfortunately,  at that time, the world equated our country with such countries  as Libya, North Korea, or Iraq. The main directions of this  misinformation, and that is putting it mildly, are well known --  "communist reserve," "the country of bellicose nationalism,"  etc. But what really strikes the nerve of Western society is  the notion that Ukraine is a "new nuclear monster."    I believe that in the beginning of this year, all conditions  were ready for the complete political isolation of Ukraine  followed by the liquidation of its independence. This state of  things called for a breakthrough, a move capable of refuting at  least some of the unfounded accusations thrown at Ukraine. And  such a move that invoked positive reaction of the world has been  made, I believe.    Secondly, a pretext for uncivilized economic pressure on  Ukraine exerted by forces interested in it was removed. At  present, one can no longer say that Ukraine poses a threat to  Europe or the world, or that it stands in the way of global  nuclear disarmament. This is why one needs to change their  attitude and language during negotiations with Ukraine.    Third, it is a change in character of general European  politics. On the one hand, Ukrainian stubbornness in 1993 made  Europe and the whole world aware of its existence and managed to  get the point across that it was ready to comply with  international agreements -- only without hurting itself and with  respect to its rights and interests, including economic ones.  On the other hand, the hand- twisting practices applied by its  partners in negotiations have hardly earned them much credit in  Europe, showing that there are "little" and "great" countries in  relations among states.    [Reporter] What can you say about the economic aspects of  the agreement? Is it good for Ukraine, considering its trade and  payment imbalance and growing oil debt to Russia?    [Kuchma] I would rather refrain from making an outright  euphoric assessment. Ukraine was granted the right of full  participation in nuclear disarmament, enjoying all of its  benefits and advantages. Let me also not repeat the widely held  belief that Ukraine supposedly received a generous gift. As of  now, Ukraine has received nothing more than documented  confirmation of its right to receive compensation for giving up  its nuclear weapons, which were created to a large extent at the  expense of its natural resources, finances, and labor potential.  I am not excessively optimistic about the agreement's economic  aspects, because I am confused by the all-too-vague terms of  Ukraine's admission to the uranium markets, too vague terms and  degree of compensation, as well as Bill Clinton's equivocal  promises about economic cooperation and unrestrained investments  in Ukraine.    Generally speaking, I agree that we undoubtedly saw Europe  take a big step toward peace. It is hard to ignore the  political significance of the event. However, the way the  agreement was signed and the methods applied to reach a  consensus were humiliating, not so much for Ukraine as for its  overseas partner. In particular, I am sure that Mr. Clinton's  tactless remark at Boryspol Airport in Kiev was humiliating to  himself, most of all.    [Reporter] As far as I can remember, your position at the  closed Supreme Council session in June of last year was slightly  different. At that time, you were against Ukraine's nuclear  disarmament.    [Kuchma] That is not true. I have always believed that for  Ukraine, nonnuclear status is the only correct path for the  future. I have always stressed this. However, in June of last  year, we were told to disarm without any serious security or  territorial guarantees, as well as any hint of compensation.  The Ukrainian budget and economy will not survive nuclear  disarmament on their own. Let me remind you that it was my  government that came up with the proposal to handle the issue of  nuclear disarmament in a complex manner, taking into  consideration dismantling, transportation, processing, and so  on. It was the first to bring up the problem of compensation  for tactical missiles and emphasized the need to respect  Ukrainian interests and rights in solving the problem of  strategic missiles and intercontinental missile silos. I am  glad that these rights and interests have eventually been  recognized and taken into consideration.    In addition, the agreement provides Ukraine with access to  large long-term credits, which would enable the country to  establish a stabilization fund for its national currency and,  therefore, curb inflation. The latter is the main precondition  for saving the Ukrainian economy from collapse and increasing  investments into it. One should not think, however, that this  will come automatically without a hard work. We have no right  to lose our chance, as was the case in 1992, when Ukraine had  the potential to overcome the crisis.    [Reporter] What do you think will next happen to the  agreement? It was negatively assessed by almost all Ukrainian  political parties.    [Kuchma] The agreement's fate will depend on the goodwill of  politicians. We know some "patriots" who did not manage to  become professionals and whose words and judgments are much  faster than their reasoning. At first, they forced the  nonnuclear status into the Declaration of Independence, and now,  the same people do not want to keep their promise to the people  and the world. It would be a good thing to ask them when they  were sincere -- when they promised an influx of Western money in  return for nuclear weapons, or now, when they want to intimidate  everyone with the missiles? In my opinion, their criticism is a  result of a lack of political professionalism. Anyway, the  first serious test for the agreement of the three presidents  will be its ratification by the Ukrainian Supreme Council. I am  afraid that, as usual, instead of the document's text or its  geopolitical meaning being addressed, the main topics of  discussion will be personal squabbles and a clash of interests  between the executive and legislative branches.    If we manage to overcome this hurdle, the rest will depend  on  the goodwill and readiness of the United States and Russia to  fulfill their obligations, as well as on our ability to take  advantage of this historic opportunity.</p>

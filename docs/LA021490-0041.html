			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCREEN STYLE : HORSEFEATHERS!  </P> <P> THE SHOW: "Mr. Ed," a '60s series in reruns on Nick at Nite, the Nickelodeon  cable channel, airing intermittently throughout the week.  </P> <P> THE SET-UP: Newlywed architect Wilbur Post (Alan Young) discovers that his  purchase of a home in the 'burbs includes a talking horse -- not as good as  finding an attic full of antiques, but better than septic problems.  </P> <P> THE CLOTHES: Wilbur (pictured) is a man of the '90s (which is kind of like the  '60s upside down), working out of his home and dressing casual chic. He wears  slim-cut dark slacks (actually, all the clothes are pretty dark -- it's a  black-and-white show) and sports shirts hiply buttoned to the top. He'll greet  clients that way, but dresses up in a Beatles-like suit with a pencil-thin tie  to play bridge. Carol (Connie Hines), who would fit right into today's  post-feminist attire, dons tight, figure-revealing dresses or stirrup pants.  Mr. Ed, on the other hand, is pretty much a fashion frump. He favors straw hats  with flowers and tacky sunglasses. You'd think a talking horse could do a  better job accessorizing. Well, it is hard to find cool clothes in the larger  sizes. Intruding on the happy threesome are buttinsky neighbors Kay and Roger  Addison. Kay is always classically over-dressed. Roger looks like a gentleman  farmer.  </P> <P> THE LABELS: Originally from (uh-oh) Ohrbach's, now in syndication at trendier  thrift stores everywhere. ROBERT BURNS  </P></p>

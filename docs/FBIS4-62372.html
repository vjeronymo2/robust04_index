			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Internal Affairs Minister Viktor Yerin by </F> Vladimir Klimov: "Providing a Contract Killing Service"]    [Text] [Klimov] First of all Viktor Fedorovich, I want to  hear your assessment of the crime situation. What are its  particular features at the moment?    [Yerin] Recently ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA published an Internal  Affairs Ministry report to the citizens of Russia. It described  in some detail both the main, very complex trends in the  development of crime and the measures that the internal affairs  organs are adopting to counter it.    We ourselves are seeking to convey to citizens our worries  about the way some socioeconomic processes are going. Why?  Well, because they are leading to the appearance of dangerous  new criminal phenomena. For example, the illegal trade in  firearms. When they fall into the hands of criminals, they  become a threat to the lives of thousands of citizens. The  credit and banking sphere is being criminalized and thefts of  many billions of rubles have been identified. The same is  happening in export-import deals. Every day we stop attempts to  export raw materials and supplies that constitute Russian  national assets. Serious problems are also arising in the  privatization process and the development of the gambling  business.... The list goes on.    Unfortunately the social danger of crimes of this kind is  not  always correctly reflected in the media. They are presented  merely as another sensation. But the most important things --  the causes and conditions of crimes that jeopardize our state's  national security and the results of the hard work to detect  them -- escape public attention.    [Klimov] Contract killings have become more frequent of  late. What are the statistics, and what do the figures tell us?    [Yerin] Before the mid-eighties we did not really encounter  this phenomenon (aside from individual instances of the contract  killing of a wife ordered by a husband or vice versa). It  became a reality, in the first place, with the emergence of  clients capable of paying considerable sums for the  implementation of the criminal plan, and, second, the appearance  of people (often with the essential combat experience) mentally  prepared to carry out any contract, however dirty, for money.    An analysis shows that murders by hired killers have become  more frequent in the past two years. In 1992 around 100 were  recorded; in 1993 there were 2.5 times more. As a rule, each of  them captures public attention because the victims are people  who are pretty well known in their own milieu.    Increasingly we are encountering cases where violence is  used  as a means of pressuring representatives of the authorities, or  as a means of intimidating or removing business rivals.    Militia officers prevent a large number of these crimes at  the planning or preparation stage. Nonetheless, bloody clashes  between criminal formations, attacks on competitors, and the  killing of people working in commerical structures are almost  daily events.    Militia officers are hard at work all the time, often  risking  their lives. I sincerely regret that the results of their  dangerous work are of little interest to journalists. It occurs  to me that it might be to someone's advantage to give the public  the impression that the militia is not detecting this kind of  crime, that it is not doing its duty. Far from it. In St.  Petersburg, in February, militia officers arrested two hired  killers from Tajikistan. They had been hired by an entrepreneur  who was being plagued by racketeers in order to deal with his  tormentors. The killers shot seven people, using  submachineguns. The murderers were arrested, but the  entrepreneur who ordered the punishment was a criminal too.    Some days ago officers from Moscow Main Internal Affairs  Administration organized crime and criminal investigation  components arrested six members of an established criminal gang  who were providing a contract killing service. They would go  all over Russia to commit the crimes. Believe me, it is very  difficult tracking down and neutralizing gangs like these. But  criminal militia officers have now accumulated considerable  experience, mastered new methods, and are achieving decent  results. Sure, unfortunately we are not yet managing to solve  every murder. But we are trying to do so.    [Klimov] What specific cases of contract killings can you  tell us about?    [Yerin] First of all I want to say that in the process of  detecting and investigating a crime such as a contract killing  militia officers and Prosecutor's Office staff usually encounter  a very experienced, brutal, and shrewd opponent, who takes care  to cover his tracks. So we cannot expect this kind of crime to  be cleared up quickly -- in, say, a few hours. It is a long and  painstaking job. For instance, the Udmurt Republic Internal  Affairs Ministry organized crime administration found that a  certain B. had been involved in more than 30 contract killings.  He was referred to the criminal investigation department. But  the numerous clients heard about it and, fearing exposure, dealt  with him themselves. He was found in the woods with a bullet in  the back of his head, together with the pistol that shot him.    The deputy administration chief of D. city was killed in  Tver  by a bullet from a revolver. The investigation team that  analyzed the motivational aspect of the case established that  there had been a difference of opinion between the victim and a  group of local businessmen and dealers from neighboring  countries over an order for the construction of a prestige  development and the right to preferential use of the plot of  land allocated for that purpose. All the criminals could come up  with was the idea of hiring a killer, who removed the "obstacle"  in the person of the leader.    Criminal investigation officers in Moscow exposed the deputy  general director of a joint venture who, in an effort to conceal  some illegal financial transactions, hired a killer, who shot  one of his business partners. Then another strangled the  perpetrator of the first murder, thus removing a damgerous  witness.    I could continue to give examples of this kind, but there is  something more important. Analysis shows that the bulk of the  contract killings are committed because of conflicts in the  sphere of commercial and financial activity arising in the  struggle for markets, for spheres of influence, and for other  mercenary motives.    [Klimov] Figures have appeared in the press that some 30,000  murders have been committed in three months. The Internal  Affairs Ministry is accused of doing nothing about it. What  have you to say about this?    [Yerin] Accusing the Internal Affairs Ministry is a familiar  ploy, and the normal thing to do for many people. Although it  is forgotten that it is not the Internal Affairs Ministry system  that causes crime. It is a product of relationships in society,  of its diseases.    As for the figures you cited, I would say that they are  untrue. In the first quarter 7,581 murders or attempted murders  were recorded. Some 4,659 or 75 percent of them were solved  through the militia's efforts. Three-fourths of the killers  were arrested. A substantial and tangible result. But we still  have a great deal to do to improve this work.    But let us consider something else. Last year internal  affairs organs for the first time had to identify and solve  murders committed in order to obtain privatized housing. In  Moscow alone it was established that more than 20 people had  been killed after sales contracts had been drawn up. Killings  masquerading as cases where citizens have disappeared without  trace are also becoming widespread. Why is it that those who  establish and adopt the procedure for legal arrangements  relating to privatization and inheritance fail to rectify these  things immediately in order to prevent further tragedies?    Weapons have become an independent and constant factor in  the  deteriorating operational situation. In 1992 and 1993 the  number of crimes in which firearms were used doubled.    The full-scale "Signal" and "Arsenal" operations that the  Russian Internal Affairs Ministry is conducting are producing  definite results. We have seized a large quantity of weapons  and ammunition, thus preventing a number of dangerous crimes.  But these weapons come from the enterprises that made them and  from militarized components. Are their leaders thinking about  ways to keep their extremely dangerous property safe? Have they  done all they can to rule out any possibility of thefts or  losses and illegal sales of weapons?    Militia operational services and the investigative  apparatus have been under extreme pressure for a long time,  facing two-to-four times as much work as normal. The physical,  mental, intellectual, and emotional capacity of the officer is  being tested to the limit.    Recently they have succeeded in neutralizing a whole series  of bandit gangs. For instance, a gang headed by S., a former  convict, was arrested for committing 15 or so assaults and  murders of heavy truck drivers in Moscow and Moscow Oblast in  order to seize the truck and its load. Similar gangs have been  detained in Krasnodar and Maritime Krays and Khakasia.  Dangerous maniac killers have even been identified and exposed  in Moscow and Khabarovsk.    Our most skilled cadres are always sent in to solve crimes  like these and arrest and neutralize the criminals. We expect  officers to be tough and uncompromising in these extreme  situations and use weapons and special facilities on a  legitimate basis. Last year the militia used weapons on 2,739  occasions; 1,561 criminals were wounded and 376 were killed.    In 1993 the murder rate increased by around 50 percent, this  year it has increased by less than nine percent. For the first  time in some years the number of killings fell in 28 regions.  In three months the ongoing investigations of more than 4,700  murder cases were completed as a result of measures adopted in  conjunction with the Prosecutor's Office investigative  components. In 29 percent of the remaining cases we now have  defendants, and the files on them will be passed to the courts.    [Klimov] What and who is hindering the militia's fight  against crime?    [Yerin] Briefly, first and foremost, shortcomings in the  existing legal base and elements of inconsistency in the  implementation of a unified legal policy. Criminal laws must be  hard-hitting -- not savage, but capable of effectively  neutralizing criminal activity. Their observance and unfailing  execution will make it possible not only to curb but also to  suppress crime.    The increase in crime requires a further strengthening of  the  staffs of operational, investigation, criminal expert, and other  services, the improvement of vocational training and retention  of cadres, and the provision of better equipment. And we are  talking about not only Internal Affairs Ministry organs but the  Prosecutor's Office, the courts, forensic medicine, and judicial  administration. Our work on solving murders is bound up with  investigations by the Prosecutor's Office, where the situation  is rapidly deteriorating. For example, in a number of rayons of  Khabarovsk Kray there are no Prosecutor's Office investigators  at all any more. You have a similar situation in Irkutsk and a  number of other oblasts.    The existing principle of merging minor with greater  penalties looks archaic in present-day circumstances. Because  of it defendants will be in the same position whether they have  committed one or dozens of dangerous crimes.    In recent decades a liberal attitude to the application of  the law has been gaining a foothold in investigation and  judicial practice. I am not bloodthirsty but, if society is  really concerned about the problem of crime, then it must ensure  that those who break the law, especially those who do it  deliberately, are severely punished.    The militia is tired of waiting for new laws reflecting the  realities of social relations today. It is no accident that  components of the Federation have lately begun issuing their own  legal acts. The practice of applying them in Tatarstan,  Bashkortostan, and Mordovia has not only demonstrated their  effectiveness but has also revealed a curious phenomenon:  Criminals have started actively "emigrating" from the republics  on sensing the changes in the legal climate.    The Internal Affairs Ministry collegium, the leaders of the  Internal Affairs Ministry, internal affairs admnistrations,  transport internal affairs administrations, and other subunits  and the vast majority of personnel are working hard to protect  Russians from offenders. This is not an attempt to protect our  reputation. We give no quarter to those internal affairs organs'  officers who fall short of the high requirements of the job, who  betray the interests of the service, or who are in cahoots with  the criminal element. We have a great deal to do to increase  the professionalism of the personnel and general standards.    At the same time, I believe that without a united front in  the fight against crime we will not prevail. Everyone must do  his bit to fight it: militia officer and journalist, moviemaker  and pedagogue, deputy and scholar. It is a common cause.</p>

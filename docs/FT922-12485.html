			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / UK Company News: First challenge to SE ruling is brought forward The Stock Exchange succeeded on Thursday in speeding up the hearing of the first judicial review brought against it, after Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, the exchange's chairman, warned of the dangers of a delay. In an affidavit to the High Court, Sir Andrew said that the delay in hearing the review was causing uncertainty and could lead to further challenges to the exchange's decisions. 'In a time when the effectiveness of City regulation is being questioned, there is need for visible certainty that the Stock Exchange is exercising its authority legitimately,' Sir Andrew said. The judicial review has been sought by two shareholders of Titaghur, a jute manufacturing company which was delisted after its chairman was arrested on insider dealing charges three years ago. The case would have taken another 18 months to be heard, prompting Thursday's hearing at which the Stock Exchange urged an earlier date to be set. The exchange is the Competent Authority for listings in the UK, as required by the European Community's 1979 Admission Directive.</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Survey of Global Custody (13): Carried abroad on a new wave of assets - United States It is not difficult to see why the interest of US custodians in the international financial markets has intensified this year. The domestic US custody market has been pretty cut-throat for some time, of course, while handling cross-border investments has been less competitive and hence more profitable. This year, though, two other factors have tilted the outlook internationally. The custodians are being carried abroad on a new wave of US assets: their domestic customers, led by mutual funds, have turned with renewed interest to foreign markets in search of better investment returns than those available at home. And the activity (and price) levels in some emerging markets have reached such heights that they have produced substantial revenues for clearing and custody firms. Other factors have also been at work. According to Mr Mike McShee, in charge of asset services for the Wyatt Company in Europe, US pension fund accounting rules introduced in the late 1980s prompted standardised reporting of US multinationals' worldwide pension funds for the first time: this, in turn, has led many US financial executives to focus for the first time on what their overseas funds were doing - encouraging a greater centralisation of worldwide investment management and (inevitably) custody. The commercial banks with a long-standing international presence have benefited most from these shifting patterns. They include Chase Manhattan, the world's biggest custodian with more than Dollars 1,000bn in assets, Citibank, which clung hard to its far-reaching international network when other US banks cut theirs and which remains the biggest custodian in non-US markets with Dollars 250m of assets, and two newer entrants - Bankers Trust and J P Morgan. The cross-border element of the Dollars 16,000bn custody business, already at 8 per cent, is set to climb to 15 per cent, says Mr Steven Baker, head of Citibank's global custody business. It will be US institutional investors, who have traditionally been less active internationally than their counterparts elsewhere, who will drive much of this growth, he says. Cross-border business is already more important to the US custodians than the broad figures suggest. Most of the big custodians deal with three or four times the assets in the US that they handle abroad. The higher margins on international business, though, and the opportunity to handle foreign exchange transactions for customers, make the revenues from domestic and international much more even. The US custodians have been busy investing in new technology and reorganising their own businesses to keep up with these developments. Chase, for instance, is in the process of transferring its US customers on to a new multi-currency accounting system (it used to have separate domestic and global systems). Citibank this summer reorganised away from management along geographic lines to management by product, switching its focus to three areas with the greatest opportunities internationally: custody, clearing, and the handling of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). When the international tide of US money slows, the custodians will find their ambitious investment plans harder to justify. Their fee income may not move up and down exactly in line with asset prices in world markets, but there is nonetheless a degree of correlation. Also, clearing operations depend heavily on activity levels. A price fall in some of the hottest emerging markets - which have also been among the most actively traded - would hit revenues hard. In the domestic US market, meanwhile, aggressive pricing in pursuit of market share is at last beginning to throw up a clear set of dominant institutions. State Street Bank, Boston Safe Deposit and Trust and Bank of New York, alongside the other big New York-based commercial banks, have all strengthened their hold. 'The market leaders in each segment of the market are beginning to be able to price as leaders,' comments one. Two forces have been at work. One has been a focus by different institutions on different sectors of the US market. Rather than talk about one domestic market, custodians now talk about a handful of separate markets: mutual funds, mastertrust (largely corporate pension funds), insurance companies, defined contribution pension plans (mainly section 401k plans) and mastercustody (public sector custody work). 'Everyone is searching out their own niche,' says Mr Peter Derrenbacher, heard of Chase's North American custody business. 'You don't see people bidding to get into certain market segments: if they're not already in the insurance business they're not trying to get into it.' The second force reshaping the domestic market has been a growing consolidation among custodians. The biggest deal to date - American Express's sale this year of Boston Safe to Mellon Bank - has not been without problems: Mellon is suing Smith Barney, which took over Amex's Shearson broking business, for interfering with its handling of the custody of Shearson's family of mutual funds. With market share the focus of most institutions' strategy, such squabbles over the right to handle assets are not surprising. Other expected big deals have been slow to materialise. As long as the big custodians can support their ambitious investment plans with buoyant income from their international business, that may continue. But the talk of consolidation is likely to turn into action should the international gravy train lose momentum.</p>

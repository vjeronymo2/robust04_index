			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / US sets out aims of foreign policy THE promotion of economic reform, trade, democracy and human rights will be the cornerstones of US policy towards both Latin America and Africa, according to two speeches delivered this week by senior members of the Clinton administration. On Latin America, Mr Clifton Wharton, the deputy secretary of state, engaged in few specifics, but said that the US had no intention of trying to overthrow President Fidel Castro of Cuba but hoped the Cuban people would be able to win their freedom through 'peaceful transition'. He endorsed the controversial Cuban Democracy Act, which curbs commercial links with Cuba, as part of a twin-track policy - refusing 'support for the Castro dictatorship' while simultaneously opening a door to Cuba to rejoin 'the democratic community'. Soon, he predicted, the Cuban government will no longer be able to 'defy political gravity'. Mr Wharton argued that the North American Free Trade Area 'is in the over-riding economic and foreign policy interest' of the US. Restoring democracy in Haiti was also a priority. On Africa, Mr Anthony Lake, the White House national security adviser, took comfort in the trend towards multi-party elections on the continent. He pledged an activist approach to 'disasters in the making', such as Somalia, and to resolution of conflicts in Zaire, Sudan, Liberia and Togo. Both speeches represent the first attempts by the administration to place the respective continental policies in a conceptual framework. The Latin America policy statement marks a departure from the attitudes of President Ronald Reagan, consumed by the need to fight communist insurgencies, and of President George Bush, often dominated by the need to combat the narcotics trade. Many of its sentiments resemble the policies of the Carter administration. Mr Wharton also specifically praised the leadership of Presidents Salinas of Mexico, Menem of Argentina and Aylwin of Chile for liberating economic capabilities. Mr Lake said the new administration not only knows 'where Africa is' but intends to contribute to 'where it is going'. He admitted that, with hindsight, 'we should have acted more aggressively' in the aftermath of the elections in Angola, presumably to ensure acceptance by Mr Jonas Savimbi's Unita movement. He said that the US, working with France and Belgium, had made it clear to President Mobutu of Zaire that 'we support the democratic process.'</p>

			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Leading Article: End set-aside HATS OFF to Clark. No, not the publicity-hogging Kenneth Clarke, but David Clark, the Labour party's shadow agriculture minister. Unlike John Gummer, self-proclaimed advocate of efficiency in a supposedly pro-market government, Dr Clark knows interventionist nonsense when he sees it. And in the set-aside scheme for taking land out of production he has, indeed, found 'one of the more insane aspects of the common agricultural policy'. The objection to set-aside is not, as the Sunday Times has tried to show, that it is vulnerable to fraud; fraud is certainly not needed to make it an outrage. First, policy-makers pay farmers to produce surplus food; then, to deal with the surpluses, they dump the excess on world markets, at vast cost to EC taxpayers and less cossetted competitors; now, to limit the surpluses, they pay farmers not to produce and the more land they agree not to produce on, the more they will pay. The law of the conservation of absurdity applies here: policy may change, but total absurdity remains constant. Dr Clark's parliamentary probing has revealed that money is being paid out in bushels. Six farmers in England and one in Scotland are being paid more than Pounds 70,000 a year each to leave their land alone. A further 70 receive annual payments of more than Pounds 30,000. To those who have land, it shall be given. But why should any business be paid to leave its least productive plant idle. And why can it use the money to invest in the rest of its plant, when the aim of the policy is to lower production? The right way to reform the CAP is to lower prices to market clearing levels; provide time-limited income compensation to farmers; and pay farmers to look after the land. To the extent that the latter means more production, as it will, internationally agreed limits will be needed. Current proposals for CAP reform represent real progress in some areas, above all on prices. But they must go further if they are to be accepted abroad and avoid being a laughing stock at home.</p>

			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAVINGS PLANS CALLED SAFE BET FOR MIGRANTS;  </P> <P> CRIME: A LEGAL ASSISTANCE GROUP IS URGING WORKERS TO TRUST THEIR MONEY TO BANKS  RATHER THAN LOSE IT TO ROBBERS.  </P> <P> Vicente Morales died angry. A bullet pierced his chest less than two weeks ago  during an armed robbery of six North County migrant laborers.  </P> <P> Detectives say a man and woman surprised the group inside a darkened barn in  rural Valley Center. As two fellow workers nervously emptied their pockets, the  35-year-old Mexican native got mad. He took one small, fateful step toward the  robbers.  </P> <P> The man opened fire. Morales died almost instantly as the thieves sped off into  the night with their take: $90.  </P> <P> Less than 35 miles away in a small Oceanside office, Claudia Smith has grown  weary of such violence -- the robberies, stabbings and the deaths -- that  authorities say are on the increase in isolated migrant camps across the North  County.  </P> <P> And she knows why the crimes are happening.  </P> <P> An attorney for California Rural Legal Assistance, or CRLA, a migrants rights  group, Smith and her small staff have visited countless local laborer camps.  She's seen the way many workers spirit away their hard-earned pay -- stashed in  mattresses, sewn into the lining of clothes or buried in spider holes.  </P> <P> On Saturday, Smith escorted a handful of workers on a mission she hopes others  will follow, one that might spread the word to would-be thieves that migrant  camps aren't going to be such lucrative territory from now on:  </P> <P> They opened savings accounts.  </P> <P> With the cooperation of two local banks, Smith has embarked on a program to  persuade the county's estimated 12,000 migrant laborers that there are much  safer ways to keep their cash than stuffed in their pants pockets.  </P> <P> "A lot of our clients have told us about being robbed, ambushed by people who  seem to know when they get paid," Smith said. "And there were all those people  who lost their savings when their camp burned to the ground last year in Rancho  Penasquitos. We figured something had to be done."  </P> <P> The banking campaign is being waged on two fronts, Smith said. She wants to  clear up the confusion many laborers have about how banks operate -- as well as  persuade North County bank branches that migrants are loyal customers whose  business is worth recruiting.  </P> <P> "Most of these workers don't trust banks because they've never dealt with  them," she said. "Many are from deep in the heart of Mexico, from little  villages where people pay cash, where they have their money in hand."  </P> <P> CRLA community worker Gloria Soto added: "And many smaller banks in North  County don't have bilingual tellers. Many haven't felt that the migrant dollar  was worth the effort. That's the attitude we're trying to change."  </P> <P> With the help of a $15,000 grant from the Bank of America Consumer Education  Fund, CRLA workers have distributed 3,000 comic books throughout Oceanside,  Carlsbad and Encinitas, using humorous cartoon characters such as Chucho the  thinking dog to spread their banking message: "It's preferable to prevent than  to lament."  </P> <P> Public service announcements also have been broadcast on two Spanish-language  North County radio stations. And a local theater group has performed skits  before several migrant audiences to drive the point home.  </P> <P> In each case, in the lively slang used by most migrants, the characters tell  how robberies have stripped them of the necessary cash to return home to see  their families or send them gifts.  </P> <P> The spots also stress the requirements most banks have for opening accounts --  such as valid identification and, often, a post office box or permanent  address.  </P> <P> Smith said North County's migrant population is unique because most live in  isolated encampments -- and are considered homeless by most bankers -- instead  of living in apartments like workers in other parts of the state.  </P> <P> CRLA workers have gone to camps to answer the questions laborers have about  placing their savings into the hands of others. The hope, Smith says, is that  respected migrant leaders will take the initiative and that, in time, the rest  will follow suit.  </P> <P> But, for many workers, questions remain. Although most are amused by Chucho the  talking dog's remarks in the comic book, they nonetheless have concerns over  how they could reach their savings on nights or weekends. And just who gets  their money if they're ever killed?  </P> <P> "A few were afraid that they were going to be sent off to war and that the bank  would keep their money," Smith said.  </P> <P> "So, before we talked about banking, we had to convince them that a whole  battalion of North County migrant workers wasn't going to be sent off to Iraq  as a secret weapon against Saddam Hussein."  </P> <P> Smith's campaign has gone beyond migrant campfires -- to the board rooms of  area banks as well.  </P> <P> CRLA has sent letters to eight North County bank branches near large migrant  encampments to explain the need for providing Spanish-speaking employees who  can communicate with the functionally illiterate.  </P> <P> So far, three local branches of Union Bank and Bank of America have agreed to  take part in the program to encourage migrant customers by such methods as  providing passbooks and reducing the initial deposit needed to open an account  from $100 to $25. They also have agreed to accept post-office boxes as an  address.  </P> <P> Smith hopes other banks will show compassion for workers who might want to use  their services but don't understand how they work.  </P> <P> "Not surprisingly," her letter says, "opening a new account is the most  daunting barrier our clients encounter."  </P> <P> In the past, she said, several local bank branches have refused to cash  migrants' checks -- sometimes even those drawn on the bank itself.  </P> <P> "A big problem was communication," Smith said. "Or the worker didn't have a  street address. Or the teller wasn't familiar with the resident alien card the  worker was using for identification.  </P> <P> "She may look at him and say 'How did this man get this much money?' I had to  put some workers in the car and take them down there to work it out. Sometimes,  I had to give the bank my address to get the check cashed."  </P> <P> Jim Bliesner, reinvestment director for a city-county task force that recently  examined area banking practices, said many banks have simply chosen to ignore  the migrant customer.  </P> <P> "They haven't provided a service to that segment of the population in the same  way they have to others," he said. "The banks have been inadequate. But  migrants also need some education about the services available. It's a two-way  street."  </P> <P> Michael Petermann, a district administrator for Bank of America, said local  branch managers have always been aware of the unique circumstances of the  migrant customer.  </P> <P> "But there hasn't been attention focused on the issue from high-level  management," he said. "Some people in the industry probably have concluded that  the migrant dollar wasn't worth the effort.  </P> <P> "But our banks are doing what they can to serve their areas, even if it is a  small market niche. The way we look at it, it's not only the moral thing to do,  it's good business."  </P> <P> Support for the banking program has come from law enforcement as well.  </P> <P> While statistics are hard to come by, authorities say that violent crimes  against migrant workers are on the rise in the county. Opportunists have often  raided isolated migrant camps after paydays and made off with huge hauls.  </P> <P> Savings accounts for migrants might discourage such crimes, authorities say.  </P> <P> "They're the perfect victims," Lt. Bill Flores, commander of the San Diego  County Sheriff Department's Fallbrook substation, said of the migrant workers.  "They set up camps in the middle of nowhere with no access to telephones.  They're in areas where it's hard for patrol cars to reach.  </P> <P> "Many robbers know when they get paid. They raid the camps -- it's just been  too easy for them. But we don't hear about most of these crimes because the  workers don't report them due to the language barrier and concern over their  immigration status.  </P> <P> "I'm in support of any program that would take the attention away from these  people as easy marks."  </P> <P> For Smith and her staff, however, the going has not been easy. They have been  forced to return several times to some encampments to reason with skittish  workers.  </P> <P> Many workers are more concerned with trips home for the holidays than opening  accounts. But Smith hopes that many will return with a new plan for protecting  their savings.  </P> <P> "We're not kidding ourselves," she said. "It's a long-term project to change  the way people think -- and to wait for the message to spread by word of mouth.  We just never dreamed we'd have to make so many visits to the camps.  </P> <P> "But we're getting the workers to mull it over. And that's a first step."  </P> <P> In time, Smith hopes that banks countywide will take part in her program. "We  want to make the point with them that these people are worth their time.  They're very loyal customers. I see it as a real opportunity for the banks."  </P> <P> And possibly someday, she says, North County migrant workers will be served by  their own credit union.  </P> <P> "For now it's only whimsy, but we'd like to have things like bus transportation  to credit union offices. And maybe loans for small businesses migrant workers  might decide to launch and money we could offer if emergencies occur back home.  </P> <P> "It'd be a way for these workers to feel that they, too, had a piece of the  rock."  </P></p>

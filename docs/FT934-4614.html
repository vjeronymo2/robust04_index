			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Hanson to float housebuilding side Hanson, the industrial group, intends to float its UK and US housebuilding divisions to cut its debt. The Anglo-US conglomerate may raise more than Pounds 500m from the two sales, analysts estimate. The businesses came from Hanson's acquisition of Beazer in 1991, when Beazer was planning a flotation of the housebuilding activities. Since then, the UK and US subsidiaries have been expanded through small acquisitions. A flotation of all of Beazer Homes, the fourth largest housebuilder in the UK, should go through by the end of March, and might raise more than Pounds 400m. The business made an operating profit of Pounds 42m in Hanson's 1993 figures. A float of 70 per cent of Beazer Homes USA, which made Pounds 16m, and a simultaneous offer of Dollars 125m (Pounds 83.8m) of senior notes, should come earlier. A filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission is likely next week. Lazard Brothers will sponsor the UK float, with Hoare Govett and James Capel as brokers. Hanson made the announcement yesterday with its annual results, which showed a sharp fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.29bn to Pounds 1.02bn in the year to September 30. The fall in profits, warnings of much higher interest charges, and Hanson's failure to increase its quarterly dividend, unsettled the shares, which fell 15 3/4 p to 268 1/2 p. For the first time, Hanson held a press briefing on its results. Lord Hanson, the chairman, was not present. The meeting was headed instead by Mr Derek Bonham, the chief executive and heir-apparent. Profits were depressed by the US coal strike, which cost Pounds 125m in the year; by a fall in exceptional profits from Pounds 172m to Pounds 24m; and by a Pounds 32m drop in interest receivable to Pounds 14m. In his statement, Lord Hanson said recovery was 'now evident in most of our major markets' and that trading profit would improve in 1994. However, Mr Bill Landuyt, finance director, said Hanson might suffer a Pounds 275m cut in interest earnings because of acquisitions and the narrowing gap between UK and US rates. Hanson is one of the groups that had been thought likely to bid for parts of a privatised British Coal. However, on the day the that the coal privatisation bill was published, the company was understood to be no longer interested in buying any part of the UK coal industry.

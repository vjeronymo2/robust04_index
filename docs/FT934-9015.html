			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Hutchison digital network Sir, Lex's note on Hutchison and Mercury (October 6) stated that 'the two digital networks cover complementary geographical areas. . .'. This implies that the Hutchison PCN network does not cover London or within the M25. In fact the Hutchison digital PCN network as currently deployed covers not only London, but offers ubiquitous coverage within and beyond the M25. Our own tests have indicated that Hutchison coverage in London and within the M25 is currently better, and offers better in-building penetration than Mercury's One-2-One network. Given this fact, speculation that the two networks might be merged is totally unfounded. Although there would be an obvious benefit to Mercury One-2-One subscribers to be able to roam on to the Hutchison network, there would be no benefit whatsoever to Hutchison subscribers to roam on to One-2-One's network. I would say this puts the odds in Hutchison's favour for generating subscribers, and also makes us the stronger, not Mercury. I agree, however, that Mercury presently has the far stronger brand name, but we do intend to change that over time. The Hutchison PCN network will, at launch, cover London, everywhere within the M25, the south east, Bristol, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and all main connecting routes and roads (ie 50 per cent of the population.) By the end of 1994 we will cover fully 70 per cent of the UK population, and will continue to roll out to 90 per cent. This is not a 'negotiating tactic' or a 'bluff' as the article suggests. More than 1,000 sites have already been acquired, and more than 700 have equipment installed.

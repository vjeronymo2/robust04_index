			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Nikola Koljevic, vice president of </F> the Srpska republic, by Slobodan Jankovic in Belgrade on 8  February -- live]    [Text] [Jankovic] Good day, Mr. Koljevic.    [Koljevic] Good day.    [Jankovic] We begin this conversation with an unfortunately  grave fact, and that is that prior to every round of  negotiations -- from Lisbon to the present -- war drums have  accompanied the peace process, along with stimulation for  continuing the civil war between the three peoples. Mr.  Koljevic, tell us exactly what is being planned at the moment.  What are we preparing for Geneva?    [Koljevic] Well, to be brief, we are setting out for Geneva  with, like always, our readiness for peace; of course, a just  peace, and one that will be equal for all three sides in the  conflict. Concretely, in this case, we are prepared to discuss  the internationalization of the Sarajevo region; we need to  approach this theme very seriously and keep in mind all its  present and future implications.    [Jankovic] How far do the Serbian side's concessions reach?  Is there a limit to the negotiations when -- just prior to this  round of negotiations, so to speak -- something in the vein of  the Sarajevo Markale market happens? Is this actually a forced  concession?    [Koljevic] I do not think that this is a forced concession  if it concerns peace, even a partial peace, but there can be no  doubt that this represents certain pressure. However, I think  that this pressure, in the form of such a large-scale and  scandalous tragedy, cannot be real political pressure on us,  because in this tragedy, this two-day tragedy -- first in the  Dobrinja district, followed by the market -- the scenario was so  familiar that we cannot even accept this as political pressure;  actually, we can only accept this, treat this, as a great crime,  accompanied by a scandal. When I say scandal, I have two things  in mind: Primarily I mean that General Rose did not react on the  first day but on the second day with his statement concerning  Dobrinja -- that the shell came from the direction of Serbian  positions. Whether he did this because he is new or for some  other reason, I do not know. However, this is not the first  time that a shell came from the direction of Serbian positions  but not from Serbian arms. The simplest way -- employed at  least 10-15 times so far -- is for the Muslim forces to position  themselves on the same direction with the Serbian forces but  farther back and to fire from that direction. Therefore, this  is not proof as far as the first day and the first accident,  first tragedy, is concerned.    As far as the second one is concerned, I believe that it is  a  true and real scandal that such a crime was not prevented --  that is, that people, experts whom we offered, were not allowed  to simply seal off the area so they could swiftly and  objectively investigate who was the perpetrator of such a  terrible crime. [sentence as heard] This proposal of the  Serbian side -- I myself was at the airport and five minutes  after receiving the news, we immediately proposed this; our  people were ready to go to the site -- was unfortunately  rejected, and the first, most basic ways, so to speak, which  allow the culprit responsible for causing such a tragedy to be  identified, were undermined. I believe that regardless of the  fact that this first state of affairs was covered up, destroyed,  so to speak, we have to go on insisting on this [words  indistinct], and one which would establish not only the military  but also the pathological aspect of this act.    [Jankovic] Thank you.</p>

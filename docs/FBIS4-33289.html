			<p>BFN     [Text] The Moncada II-94 exercise has showcased the high  level of readiness of unit commands and defense councils of  Guantanamo Province to confront and repel any aggression. It  could not be any different. Even though this is a period of  relative calm, the enemy is combat-ready on the other side of  the fence. The people of Guantanamo cannot forget that sad  privilege.    The exercise allowed command posts and defense councils to  demonstrate their skills in command and cooperation, as well as  in directing operations, and the fight.    Juan Carlos Robinson Agramonte, president of the provincial  defense council, affirmed that Moncada II-94 was more than a  defense exercise; it also contributed to accelerating the work  being done to repair the damage caused by the recent rains and  the efforts to build over 500 homes for the people affected,  marked the restart of the sugar harvest, and highlighted efforts  to restore the provincial road infrastructure, for which heavy  earth moving equipment is needed to speed up reconstruction of  bridges and sewers.</p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP WEDNESDAY;  </P> <P> WINTER SPORTS PLAYERS OF THE YEAR;  </P> <P> BEGINNING TO END, A STANDOUT SEASON;  </P> <P> THE PIECES ALL CAME TOGETHER FOR MISSION VIEJO'S MOORE  </P> <P> Joe-Max Moore's senior season with the Mission Viejo High School soccer team  reads like a Hollywood movie script, or maybe even a fairy tale.  </P> <P> Moore, one of the smallest players on his team at 5-feet-7, 130 pounds, led the  South Coast League in scoring with 25 goals and 10 assists and was named the  league's player of the year.  </P> <P> His team held the No. 1 ranking in the boys' Southern Section 3-A all season  and advanced to the 3-A final. There, Moore scored the winning goal on a  penalty kick with three minutes left in the second and final overtime to give  the Diablos a 2-1 victory over Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> "Everything happened the right way," said Moore, 18, The Times' player of the  year. "It couldn't have been any better. Everything fell in the right place,  perfect."  </P> <P> The individual and team awards were all part of Moore's plans. While working  out with weights over the summer, he set his sights on winning the 3-A title  and league player of the year honors.  </P> <P> Now he has his sights set on a professional career in the United States or  Europe. But first, he'll go to college. Moore said he has made an oral  commitment to attend UCLA.  </P> <P> Coaches there may hold him out of competition his freshman season to let him  grow a little, Moore said. He has already grown a couple of inches his senior  year and expects to grow taller than his 5-foot-10 father, Karl, who also  matured late.  </P> <P> Though small in stature, Moore's exceptional skills distinguish him as a  player.  </P> <P> His knowledge of the game, ball skills and, most of all, his high level of  work, are the reasons for his success, Diablo Coach Cal Foster said.  </P> <P> "A lot of professional coaches and players talk about (giving) that 110%,"  Foster said. "He is one of those players giving you that plus, giving  everything to make himself a better player and his team a better team. He's got  a great desire and ability to play the game.  </P> <P> "I think that he is one of those rare individuals who has a great shot at being  on a national team and maybe making an Olympic team."  </P> <P> Moore, in the meantime will stay close to the beaches of Southern California  for his college career so he can continue to surf in his spare time.  </P> <P> He also enjoys riding dirt bikes. He got involved in motocross growing up on  his parents' 80-acre spread in Oklahoma and now owns a Honda dirt bike that he  takes to Riverside to kick up some dirt when he's not kicking a soccer ball.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ALL-COUNTY BOYS' SOCCER TEAM  </P> <P> FIRST TEAM  </P> <P> NAME: MIKE AMMAN  </P> <P> WT: Forward  </P> <P> YEAR: Senior  </P> <P> SCHOOL: Mater Dei  </P> <P> Amman came out of the goal halfway through Angelus League play to spark the  Monarch offense and lead Mater Dei to the Angelus League title with five goals.

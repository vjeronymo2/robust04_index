Carboxymethylcellulose is used to impart lubrication and viscosity. Saliva substitutes that contain natural mucins maintain a surface tension similar to that of natural salival. Salts are added to artifical saliva to mimic the electrolyte content of natural saliva.15 According to Brastings,16mucin-containing salivas are preferred by patients because carboxy-methylcellulose compounds seem to be uncomfortably sticky. Preparations containing mucin are considered to provide formualtions that most closely resemble human saliva.17 When applied using an atomizer, saliva substitutes wet the oral cavity for about 30 minutes.18 In addition, intraoral reserviors have been designed to allow continuous wetting of the oral surfaces. Recently, a denture with a palatal reservoir for artificial saliva has been constructed. The reservoir holds 2&hyph;3 cc of substitute and needs to be refilled every 2&hyph;5 hours.16 Several saliva substitutes are available and appear to be most successful when used at night.3 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Parasympathomimetic drugs have been used as pharmacologic sialagogues in the treatment of xerostomia. Fox et al4 demonstrated that in persons with documented salivary gland disease who have some functional salivary gland tissue, an orally administered systemic agent is effective in relieving xerostomia and increasing silivary output. Orally administered pilocarpine increases the production of saliva by parotid and submandibular or sublingual glands and relieves the sensation of oral dryness. The investigators suggest that a sustained-release form of the drug may offer increased therapeutic benefit. Scully11 recommends pyridostigmine because it is longer acting with fewer side effects than other pharmacologic agents. According to Vissink et at14 the usefulness of pharmacologic sialagogues is limited because of their side effects and contraindications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By application of the concept of electrically stimulating nerves to elicit a response, electrostimulation was developed for use in the oral cavity to stimulate the salivary reflex. Investigators have reported that electro-stimualtion increases salivary output and should be used to treat patients with xerostomia secondary to Sjogren's syndrome.37 The cost of a battery-operated, hand-held stimulus probe that can provide electrical stimulation to the tongue and hard palate is approximately $1,500. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Rationale <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Proponents of electrostimulation as a method to increase salivary production suggest that this procedure enhances the patient's ability to generate saliva by augmenting normal physiologic salivary reflexes. Salivary secretion is normally controlled by reflex stimulation with effector nerve impulses traveling along sympathetic as well as parasympathetic nerves to the glands. Sympathetic nerve stimualtion produces a sparse viscous secretion, whereas the parasympathetic nerve stimualtion produces a voluminous watery secretion.19 The dual secretion (saliva) is a flued mixture produced from paired major salivary glands (parotid, submandibular, and sublingulal) and many smaller aggregations of minor salivary glands imbedded in the submucosa of the cheeks, lips, hard and soft palates, and tongue. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proponents believe that xerostomia secondary to Sjogren's syndrome can be caused by interruption of the stimulus that elicits salivation at the effector site; such interruption results from loss of glandular tissue with replacement by round cell infiltration, scar, or fatty tissue. They postulate that an electronic device that touches the tongue and roof of the mouth simultaneously will stimulate tactile receptors, taste receptors, and intrinsic muscle mechanoreceptors within the mucosa of the dorsum of the tongue and the roof of the mouth. This produces electrical stimuation to the oral and pharyngeal afferent nervous system resulting in a reflex volley of efferent impulses to all residual salivary tissue, major and minor, in the oral and pharyngeal regions causing salivation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Review of Available Literature <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> It has long been known that the nerves to salivary glands control the secretion of saliva. According to Garrett19 an experiment in 1850 by Ludwig demonstraed that electrical stimulation of the chordalingual nerve in the dog caused a copious secretion of submandibular saliva. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1986 Weiss et al7 reported on the use of an electronic stimulator as a mothod for increasing salivary production. In this prelimianry investigation, 9 of the 24 patients with a primary complaint of xerostomia had Sjogren's syndrome (diagnosed on the basis of mdical history only). Following a visual examination of the oral cavity as well as a gloved finger test to determine the presence of moisture (any reflection was considered a sign of wetness), patients were administered a 3-minute stimulus to the tongue and roof of the mouth with the probe (electrodes) of the hand-held stimulator. The maximum voltage delivered by the device is 6V with a current of 9 &mu;A. Patient tolerance controls and determines the level of stimulation. Two subsequent stimulations of 3 minutes each were conducted at the same sitting by most of the patients (actual numbers not reported). Each stimulation procedure was followed by a subjective patient evaluation of improvement and a repeat clinical examination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Ssangyong and Mercedes-Benz in car link-up MERCEDES-BENZ, the German luxury car maker, has entered a far-reaching co-operation deal with Ssangyong Motor to enable the South Korean vehicle maker to begin car production in Korea based on Mercedes-Benz technology. Ssangyong, the fifth largest Korean vehicle maker, plans to produce up to 50,000 cars a year from 1996 for sale in domestic and export markets. Mercedes-Benz, the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial corporation, said the Ssangyong car would be based on components and systems from its mid-range Mercedes-Benz 200/300 series. The car would be developed by Ssangyong, with assistance from the German car maker, and would be produced only in Korea. It would have a different design from current Mercedes-Benz products and would not be sold under the Mercedes-Benz name. It would be marketed 'at Korean price levels'. Mr Werner Niefer, Mercedes-Benz chief executive, said the deal gave his company 'the key to one of the biggest growth markets of the future'. Mercedes-Benz will receive licence fees and is expected to supply the transmissions from Germany. But most other components and systems, including engines, will be made in Korea. Mercedes-Benz said Ssangyong would invest about DM500m (Dollars 302m) developing the car range and production lines. Mr Jurgen Hubbert, director of the Mercedes-Benz car division, said the deal would allow the group to overcome entry barriers to the Korean market. Separately, Mercedes-Benz is considering assembling cars in Korea from German-made kits, to sell them under the Mercedes-Benz name. The car deal is the latest in a series of links between the German group and Ssangyong. In 1991, Mercedes-Benz licenced Ssangyong to produce up to 50,000 MB-100 vans and 100,000 engines a year, starting in 1994. In October, Daimler-Benz took a 5 per cent equity stake in Ssangyong Motor, with an option to raise it to 10 per cent. Ssangyong currently produces only commercial vehicles and four-wheel drive leisure/utility vehicles. Korea's Ministry of Trade and Industry is expected to approve the deal despite worries that the Korean car industry may soon have an excess number of producers.</p>

			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / Books: Beautiful people PARIS AFTER THE LIBERATION: 1944-1949 by Anthony Beevor and Artemis Cooper Hamish Hamilton Pounds 20, 531 pages Artemis Cooper has published an excellent account of Cairo In The War, not to speak of editing the correspondence of Evelyn Waugh and Diana Cooper (her grandmother). Anthony Beevor is responsible, among other things, for a first-class history of the Battle of Crete. They are married. Paris After The Liberation is a good idea which does not quite come off. That deserves explanation. The story - of Paris between the Liberation of August 1944 and the economic stabilisation in 1949 - is fascinating, and calls out for an accessible, layman's account on the 50th anniversary (this book does not pretend to be a work of academic scholarship, a field which is being intensively tilled at present). The authors are privileged: they benefit from access to the diaries of the British ambassador Duff Cooper (grandpa), Nancy Mitford's unpublished letters, and various other archives of the English Establishment to which, I assume, they belong. The value of this access is less clear because it tilts the narrative towards the beautiful people. It is amusing to have it confirmed that Diana and Duff called de Gaulle 'Charlie Wormwood' (as in 'wormwood and gall'). We get an insider's view of Louise de Vilmorin (Duff's lover), of Nathalie Barney ('l'imperatrice des Lesbiennes'), of Gaston Palewski (Nancy Mitford's boyfriend), even of Cocteau, of Poulenc, of Christian Berard. The first hundred pages are in effect a brisk introduction, which is a dangerous tactic in book-making because it misleadingly suggests a superficial and over-hasty tone to what, from 1944, becomes detailed, analytical, better. With the arrival of Duff Cooper's diaries, the book looks up. The first theme has to be the end of Occupation and the subsequent epuration sauvage. Again, this is a subject which has at last been heavily investigated, and we read of Paris only. Collaboration was a nightmare subject which brought much head-shaving and arbitrary execution in late 1944 and even more guilt for many years to come. Arletty and Sacha Guitry, Drieu la Rochelle, Celine, Colette, Chanel, Lifar, Giono, de Montherlant, even Simenon, Barrault and Clouzot, were among many artists who came under different degrees of suspicion. It was, and remained for years, a terrifying topic. Isaiah Berlin here offers a useful definition of acceptable conduct under the German Occupation: you could do business with them but 'you did not have to be cosy with them'. One problem, of course, was that the French communists had suffered particularly under Vichy with the execution of hostages and deportation of slave labour. Now the communists could see a way to exploit their sufferings in their bid for post-war power. This is the central political subject of these years, and the second theme of this book. 'There are only two real forces in France today,' said de Gaulle in December 1945. 'If the communists win, France will be a Soviet Republic; if I win, France will stay independent.' It was not to be as simple and the Beevors (if I may call them that) track the story in fair detail until it is clear by 1949 that the Fourth Republic has come through. The weakness of the style of this book is immediately confirmed: 'The mood of optimism was further reinforced on 18 July (1949), when Odile de Lenoncourt married the Duc de Guiche, eldest son of Duc de Gramont, at the Church of Saint-Louis des Invalides. The right people were still marrying the right people.' And the bride wore Dior. So that was all right. In between many pages of political and diplomatic history we have been given the cultural and literary story. We are assured of the 'arrogant irresponsibility' of the French intellectuals, their trahison des clercs, the 'dictatorship of the progressive intelligentsia', the eventual failure of radical ideas to overcome the French bourgeoisie - big themes - but the reader is not always convinced. The problem, I suggest, is that the Beevors have bitten off more than they can chew. They have written an interesting but awkward combination of a politico-diplomatic history of France in the immediate aftermath of war and the cultural story of those same years. But in the event, they have fallen between two stools.</p>

			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Newspaper distribution attacked VG DISTRIBUTORS, the independent high-street grocery chain, has renewed its attack on newspaper wholesalers with a second submission to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. It has told the MMC inquiry into newspaper wholesaling and retailing that the market is 'rigged' and the fixed newspaper distribution territories should be dismantled. The group says it is campaigning on behalf of more than 40,000 convenience stores which cannot get supplies of newspapers to sell although newsagents are increasingly entering the grocery sector by selling such items as milk, bread and baked beans. It rejects the arguments of wholesalers that the product is unique because of its short shelf life. It says there are many short-life retail products such as chilled foods and sandwiches, and adds that newspaper wholesalers have started supplying superstores.</p>

			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEGO;  </P> <P> OUTGOING MAYOR DECRIES CONFLICT  </P> <P> Decrying the divisiveness that has split the City Council, outgoing Mayor  Christian W. Keena warned Tuesday that continuing "political conflict will  produce little good for the city."  </P> <P> "We have learned that the failure to compromise has a great cost," Keena said  in a prepared farewell State of the City report. "I shudder to read of  political battles brewing in our city and those in neighboring cities. . . .  Conflict distracts leaders from their collective objectives and depletes the  city of its spirit."  </P> <P> The conflict on the council peaked earlier this year when some council members  supported a recall effort against Councilman Robert A. Curtis. The failed  effort was heavily financed by the Mission Viejo Co. and other developers.  </P> <P> Some political observers here attributed Keena's decision not to seek  reelection to the fact that he would have been targeted for defeat by Curtis'  allies. Keena, however, has insisted that after seven years in Mission Viejo  politics, he wanted to devote more attention to his law practice "and volunteer  for a good community cause."  </P> <P> Alluding to the bickering on the council, Keena said: "As I see it, the root of  the problem has been a fundamental disagreement on the level of politics that  is appropriate for Mission Viejo. . . . We have learned that the failure to  compromise has a great cost; that before we disrupt city business to win on a  point we should always consider the cost."  </P> <P> Keena declared that "Mission Viejo's financial affairs are in order." The city  has an estimated $2-million surplus in the current fiscal year and more than  $20 million in reserves.  </P> <P> Keena cited the acquisition of a building to serve as City Hall as a "historic  milestone." The purchase will save the city $400,000 annually, he said.  </P> <P> The city staff is scheduled to occupy the new offices by next April. But the  issue of the new City Hall became a campaign issue, and Curtis has said that he  and other council members are likely to reverse the decision to occupy the  building.  </P> <P> Keena also said the city had worked to make Mission Viejo safer for residents.  During the last year, residential burglaries have decreased by 11%, commercial  burglaries by 17% and traffic accidents by 1%, while drunk-driving arrests have  increased by 24%, he said.  </P> <P> Keena called on South County cities to set up a regional detention center to  improve police services in the area. "Every time a deputy makes an arrest the  suspect has to be transported to the County Jail in Santa Ana," he said. "The  time it takes to transport and book suspects reduces the number of hours  deputies are on patrol."  </P> <P> The outgoing mayor warned cities to resist attempts by state and county  government to pass on "to cities the costs of traditionally non-city services."  </P> <P> Keena called on the new council to "lead Mission Viejo from a past of promises  to a bright new future full of promise."DAVAN MAHARAJ  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Russian Deputy Minister of Communications </F> B.P. Butenko by unidentified ARGUMENTY I FAKTY correspondent;  place and date not given: "Poor Subscriber...: In 1993 Postal  Service Losses From Distribution of Periodicals Amounted to More  than 62 Billion Rubles"]    [Text] Increasingly items are appearing in the press  that the postal service, by increasing its rates on distribution  of periodicals, is making prices for newspapers and magazines  unaffordable. Since this problem also concerns the multimillion  audience of ARGUMENTY I FAKTY readers, we asked Russian Deputy  Minister of Communications B.P. Butenko to clarify this  situation.    [Question] Boris Petrovich, we heard that the Judiciary  Chamber for Information Disputes has made a ruling regarding  postal service rates. Please comment on it.    [Butenko] Unfortunately this document, prompted by articles  in the newspapers IZVESTIYA, TRUD, and others, was not even  coordinated with the Federal Postal Administration of Russia and  was written in an extremely improper manner. The chamber  discussed our rates, which in principle, according to the  existing statute, it is not supposed to do. The entire document  is built on emotions instead of the language of figures. We are  accused of being a monopoly with respect to conduct of the  subscription campaign. We say--take the subscription part. But  nobody wants it--it is too hard. This is how we became an  unwilling monopoly.    [Question] Is there no alternative to the postal service?    [Butenko] Foreign experience shows that delivery of printed  material is the publishers' business. Over there the postal  service works only on a contract basis and delivers only about  30 percent of subscriptions. In our country all newspapers and  magazines traditionally are distributed mainly through the  postal service. Although by the current law on the mass media  the publishers are supposed to distribute their product  themselves on a contract basis, that is, the postal service may  be just one of the systems engaged in distribution. Therefore  we, the communications industry, offer our skills and experience  for setting up alternative structures.    [Question] Still, why is it that nobody wants to seriously  deal with this? Unprofitable?    [Butenko] More than that--it is pure loss! Last year our  losses from distribution of newspapers and magazines amounted to  62 billion rubles. Here is your answer. We are accused of  rigging the figures, of postal subscription rates being  unjustifiably high. But we are willing to provide objective  information to any publisher at any time; we are willing to  undergo any audit with respect to correctness of rate-setting.  Another important point is that in setting local rates we  recommend that these rates be coordinated with local committees  on prices. We cover our losses with profits from other services  and the state subsidy the postal service receives as a whole.    [Question] This does not make things easier for the  subscriber. After all, he is paying out of his own pocket, and  increasing amounts every year.    [Butenko] Readers should clearly understand that there are  only two options. Either they have to pay what a newspaper or a  magazine costs, including the entire publication process and  delivery, or state subsidies are needed; this decision should be  made at the government level. Subsidies should be targeted, and  the population widely informed of this.    [Question] By the way, why is it that postal service prices  differ in different oblasts of Russia sometimes by a factor of  five to six?    [Butenko] There is nothing strange about that. Conditions  are  different everywhere; different delivery route distances,  different gasoline prices, and so on. Besides, in some oblasts,  where local authorities provide subsidies to the postal service,  subscribers pay less.    There is one more nuance: Readers pay in advance, but no one  can tell with certainty what inflation will be over this period,  while both the publishers and the postal service must make good  on their obligations to subscribers. Instead of finding a way  out of this situation, many publishers started looking for a  scapegoat, and found us--the postal service. But this handling  of the problem will only result in bitterness between potential  partners and will not help the cause. Moreover, it may bring  antagonism between postal service staff and publishers even at  the local level.    [Question] But, Boris Petrovich, you will not deny that  local  postal service systems do not have clear guidance in setting  rates, and in some places they are pushing prices sky-high.  Which immediately affects the number of subscribers.    [Butenko] I think that the Federal Postal Administration  will  sort things out with these oblasts and will provide  recommendations to local branches. Our task is to keep rates at  a level people can afford. But the postal service is a state  structure, and the subsidies it gets mostly go into those  services the population uses frequently: delivery of letters,  small packages, parcels. I want everyone to understand--there is  nothing there to make us rich, but the postal service, as  before, will try to deliver to the readers the latest news in  newspapers and magazines in a timely manner.    FROM THE EDITORS. There is no question that our  communications industry is experiencing a lot of problems.  Neither can its personnel boast of high salaries. We agree with  B. Butenko that without government help, there is no solution.  At the same time, however, we think that the postal service,  too, can still do a great deal. ARGUMENTY I FAKTY is willing to  work closely with the communications industry. The main goal is  for subscribers to get their newspapers on time and at a  reasonable price.</p>

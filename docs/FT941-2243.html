			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Observer: Ici EC? Whatever prompted Theo Waigel to stop by yesterday's meeting of European Union finance ministers? The German finance minister graces such gatherings but rarely - and then generally only in times of crisis - to the extent that peers have taken his absences as a calculated snub to the European cause. So why should the garrulous Bavarian have changed his ways? Could it just be that his thoughts have turned to the early summer nomination of his country's two new European commissioners? Waigel will have none of it - 'it is all very flattering but there is no question (of my candidacy),' he made out yesterday. Still, the attractions of a perk-filled five-year spell in Brussels cannot have escaped Waigel as he labours to contain the costs of unification, and attempts to put behind him his failure to secure the Bavarian premiership. Indeed, in the run-up to the general election, a certain cageyness would be understandable. His predicament is nothing compared with that of chancellor Kohl, who has to choose his commissioners some four months before he knows whether he has a mandate to govern the country beyond October.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final regulations provide a rule coordinating the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general asset account rules with the rules in &sect;1.8611&hyph;9T(g)(3) relating to allocation and apportionment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest expense under the asset method. A general asset  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account will be treated as a single asset for purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applying the rules in &sect;1.861&hyph;9T(g)(3). If the general asset  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account generates income in more than one separate grouping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (statutory and residual), then the account is a multiple  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> category asset, as defined in &sect;1.861&hyph;9T(g)(3)(ii), and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income yield from the general asset account must be computed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as if the account were a single multiple category asset.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final regulations also provide rules for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining the source of income from a disposition of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asset in a general asset account. If the general asset  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account includes assets generating both United States and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foreign source income, any amount of ordinary income, gain,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or loss recognized on the disposition must be apportioned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between United States and foreign sources based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocation and apportionment of depreciation allowed for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general asset account or for the disposed asset, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable. If the general asset account includes assets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that generate foreign source income in more than one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate category under section 904(d)(1) or another section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Internal Revenue Code, or under a United States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income tax treaty that requires the foreign tax credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limitation to be determined separately for specified types  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of income, then the amount of ordinary income, gain, or loss  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognized on the disposition that is treated as foreign  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source income must be allocated and apportioned to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable separate category or categories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Disposition of All Assets or the Last Asset. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commentator questioned whether the rule under the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations that provided that a general asset account  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminates on the disposition of all of the assets in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account or the last asset in the account was mandatory. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response to this comment, the final regulations clarify that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rule is an optional rule for taxpayers that maintain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records showing the disposition of assets in a general asset  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account. The final regulations also provide that a taxpayer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopts the rule by reporting the gain or loss on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxpayer's income tax return for the taxable year in which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the disposition of all of the assets, or the last asset, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the general asset account occurs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Qualifying Dispositions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Under the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations, a qualifying disposition of an asset in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general asset account occurs when the asset is disposed of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a direct result of a cessation, termination, curtailment,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or disposition of a business, manufacturing or other income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> producing process, operation, facility, plant, or other unit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (other than by transfer to a supplies, scrap, or similar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account). One commentator recommended that the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations should provide an example showing that the sale  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of an undivided interest in mineral property, along with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related operating equipment, is a curtailment of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxpayer's business and, thus, constitutes a qualifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposition. A curtailment was intended to be limited to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> genuine business contraction and not to include transactions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involving the sale of an undivided interest, other than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxpayer's entire interest in assets. To avoid any further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misinterpretation, the final regulations delete the term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``curtailment.'' The final regulations also clarify that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxpayer adopts the rule to terminate general asset account  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment for an asset in a qualifying disposition by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting the gain, loss, or other deduction on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxpayer's income tax return for the taxable year in which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the qualifying disposition occurs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Anti-abuse rule. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The final regulations add examples of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transactions subject to the anti-abuse rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

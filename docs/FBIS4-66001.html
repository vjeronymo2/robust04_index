			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has declared that a  new Europe emerged with the termination of the era of separate  blocs and it is beneficial to seek solutions for the conflicts  in Central and Eastern European and (?Baltic) countries. Cetin  is currently in Paris for the European Stability Pact  conference, which aims to prevent the ethnic problems in Eastern  European countries from causing new clashes similar to those in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Cetin replied to reporters' questions.    The foreign minister stated that the conference is seeking a  kind of diplomacy that will avoid conflicts. He said that  minority and border issues were discussed at first. Stressing  that disputes must be resolved between neighbors, Cetin remarked  that countries which will join the European Union [EU] must  first solve their problems with their neighbors. Greece is such  an example, Cetin noted, adding: It was admitted into the EU  without resolving its problems with Turkey and these problems  are now causing trouble for the EU.    Recalling that Turkey solved its problems with Bulgaria in a  friendly manner, Cetin declared that the clashes in the Caucasus  constitute a great loss both for the Azerbaijanis and the  Armenians.    The foreign minister, who held meetings with his Russian,  German, and British counterparts in Paris, also met with French  Foreign Minister Alain Juppe.</p>

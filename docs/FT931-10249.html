			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Powerscreen disposes of Guzzler for Dollars 24m POWERSCREEN International, the Northern Ireland-based maker of screening and crushing equipment, has sold one of its US subsidiaries for Dollars 24m (Pounds 16.8m) to Federal Signal Corporation. Guzzler Manufacturing, which makes truck-mounted vacuum cleaning equipment for industrial sites and sewers, was bought by Powerscreen for Dollars 17.9m in August 1990. Mr Barry Cosgrove, finance director, said Federal Signal's first approach had been rebuffed. An improved cash offer had changed the management's mind. He added that Powerscreen had taken Dollars 5.3m cash out of Alabama-based Guzzler in debt repayments and interest since its purchase. The US company made Dollars 2.1m in after-tax profits on Dollars 27m sales in 1991-92. But that was on a low tax rate of 10 per cent. By next year that rate was expected to rise to 38 per cent. Mr Shay McKeown, chief executive, said profits from Guzzler were expected to fall to Dollars 1.6m pre-tax this year. It was the one company in the group not performing to budget. Guzzler's margins had been eroded by price competition in the contractor market. Federal Signal, which has a street cleaning operation, was in a better position to expand Guzzler in the municipal market, whereas Powerscreen would have had to expand its product range into sweepers and refuse vehicles. 'We don't want to be a conglomerate,' said Mr McKeown. The group had decided to concentrate on materials handling, where it has built up international sales of mobile equipment. North America would account for approaching 30 per cent of group turnover even after the Guzzler disposal. Powerscreen was now expected to have at least Pounds 20m cash in hand at the March year-end. The prime candidate for the next acquisition would be a North American crushing equipment company, preferably involved in the recycling of demolition material or timber. The UK, which accounted for 29 per cent of first-half sales, would also be an attractive hunting ground. Targets on the Continent tended to look expensive because of the weakened pound. Powerscreen, which has kept profits moving ahead during the recession, is forecast to increase pre-tax profits from Pounds 18.8m - on Pounds 88.1m sales - to between Pounds 22m and Pounds 23m this year. Its share price closed down 1p at 359p yesterday. That compares with 156p at the time of the Guzzler acquisition. The 6.16m shares allotted to the vendor were placed - they are worth Pounds 22m compared with less than Pounds 10m then.</p>

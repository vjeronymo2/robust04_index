			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Clinton offers aid to Georgia PRESIDENT Bill Clinton of the US yesterday threw his weight behind Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the embattled Georgian leader, expressing his full support for the Georgian president and 'territorial unity and sovereignty' of Georgia. In a letter to Mr Shevardnadze, Mr Clinton offered to send more humanitarian aid and to act as a mediator in the bitter conflict between the Georgian government and Abkhaz separatists, who seized most of Abkhazia last month. Mr Clinton also invited Mr Shevardnadze to talks in Washington. The invitation provides a boost for Mr Shevardnadze, who has suffered losses both to Abkhaz separatists and to rebels loyal to the former leader, Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia. The situation in western Georgia, scene of the fighting between rebel forces and the government army remained confused. The government claimed to have seized the port of Poti but Mr Gamsakhurdia denied the report. Reuter adds: Mr Gamsakhurdia said yesterday his rebels controlled most of western Georgia and that he did not intend to take the capital Tbilisi by force.</p>

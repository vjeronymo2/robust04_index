			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Caribbean finds itself in US trade deal slow lane: Islands and central America see Mexico overtake them in Washington's priorities MEXICO's free-trade negotiations with the US have sent a worried shiver down Caribbean spines. But the foreign ministers of central America and of the Caricom bloc of English-speaking Caribbean states, meeting together for the first time at the end of last month in the Honduran city of San Pedro Sula, quietly sidelined a proposal by the host nation to look towards a Caribbean free-trade zone. The idea was that, with a population of 50m and a total gross national product of Dollars 50bn (Pounds 27.6bn), this would be a way to reach 'critical mass' in economic activity and diplomatic clout. Instead, they agreed to establish a Consultative Forum, inviting other Caribbean basin nations. The forum will concentrate on the defence of their privileged trading position with the US, enshrined since 1984 in the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), which promotes 'non-traditional' export production through duty-free access to the US market. The problem faced by the Caribbean basin is a simple one: the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative - with the Mexican free-trade agreement as its centrepiece - has overtaken the CBI as the US trade policy flagship in the area. The North American Free Trade Area (Nafta) is expected to give duty-free entry to the US for all the products included in the CBI. According to Mr Fafael Callejas, the Honduran president, this 'raises the spectre of the Caribbean basin's relatively small, young and inexperienced industries being steam-rollered by the relatively large, well-established and seasoned Mexican industries'. The Caribbean basin's response has been to attempt to hang on to the coat tails of any Mexican agreement, requesting that the CBI be expanded to incorporate the additional concessions ceded to Mexico. But requests that this be included in any Nafta legislation have had short shrift from Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, who will have enough problems negotiating the Mexico agreement in Congress, without sending up smoke signals to the effect that the whole of the Caribbean basin would be covered by the legislation. She has made it clear that, after Mexico, Chile is the next in line for a free trade agreement, with the Caribbean basin nowhere in sight. At the same time, while the low-cost central American banana giants are avidly sizing up the prospects of a quota-free Europe next year, the small Windward Isles economies - dependent on European banana quotas for up to 60 per cent of their export revenues and with no hope of competing to defend the privileges enshrined in Lome IV against the Latin onslaught - are unimpressed by a proposal for a 14 per cent tariff to replace the quota system, even though the tariff revenue would be used to compensate the losers of banana exports. As a result, although the working papers of the Caribbean basin technical advisory group (set up last year to outline a regional integration strategy) identified the single European market as one of the key issues to be faced, the official communique from San Pedro Sula was silent on the issue. The isthmus and the islands have little complementarity in their economic structures - as reflected in the almost complete absence of trade or direct transport links between central America and the Caribbean at present. Nor is there complete harmony on economic policy. While both regions are attempting to revive integration processes that flagged in the eighties, the new central American scheme is both more advanced and more liberal than the Caricom equivalent. While external tariffs on the isthmus are to fall to a range of 5 to 20 per cent, Caricom is having difficulty persuading all its members to implement the new agreed maximum of 45 per cent.</p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Turkey signs Dollars 2.8bn F-16 deal with US TURKEY yesterday signed a Dollars 2.8bn fighter aircraft deal with the US, using finance from a special fund set up by the US and its Arab allies in the wake of the Gulf war. The deal under which Turkish Aerospace Industries and General Dynamics will jointly manufacture 80 F-16 fighters is the first major defence contract signed by the new Turkish government. Finance for the F-16 deal is to be provided from a Dollars 4bn Turkish Defence Fund, part of which is lodged with the Federal Reserve Bank in the US. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the Gulf Emirates have promised to contribute Dollars 3bn. The US is contributing around Dollars 500m to the fund - the sum approved by the US congress for foreign military sales to Turkey. In a bid to improve its ground to air defence systems, Turkey is expected to use the fund to buy Raytheon-made Patriot missile batteries, Turkey is already producing 160 F-16s under an earlier production agreement. In addition Turkey has secured US backing to manufacture 46 aircraft under a deal agreed between the US and Egypt.</p>

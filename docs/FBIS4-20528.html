			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Hayo Canter Cremers: "EMBL Finds Itself in </F> Turbulent Waters"]    [Text] The EMBL [European Molecular Biology Laboratory] is  facing difficult times. Indeed, it looks as if Spain, like  Italy, is going to leave the EMBL. Netherlands representatives  within the European Molecular Biology Organization [EMBO] fear  that this domino effect will affect basic research, because even  the German, French, and British are complaining.    Unlike in the Netherlands, in most countries the  contribution  to the EMBL is drawn from the local research budget. Together,  these contributions constitute an annual budget of approximately  70 million guilders. However, since the pressure from the  current economic recession in Europe causes compulsive  economizing, many countries want to see a greater return on  their considerable investments.    The funds are managed by the European Molecular Biology  Conference [EMBC] and the EMBL Council, which comprises  representatives from the various countries involved. The  representatives for the Netherlands are Professor Dr. Peter van  der Vliet (Physiological Chemistry, Utrecht University) and  Marga Vintges M.Sc. (Science Policy, Education and Science  Ministry).    Van der Vliet is not enthusiastic about the increasing  hesitation on the part of the various member states. "I find  their attitude rather short-sighted. In most countries, the  emphasis is shifting to short-term, application-oriented  research, but important new results are achieved on the basis of  long-term, basic research, such as that carried out at the EMBL.  Normally, the best researchers are needed for basic research,  and they cannot be selected on the basis of political decisions.  <H5>  No Money Available </H5>   The EMBL has been dogged by financial shortages for some  time  now. Frustration at the limited budget available for new  projects was the reason why in April of last year, Swedish  Professor Dr. Lennart Philipson, the man behind the eminence of  the EMBL, unexpectedly resigned. At his instigation, the  Council regularly agreed to take on new projects, but a number  of countries refused to make enough money available to carry  them out. Consequently, the projects had to be cancelled.    Philipson's successor, Greek Professor Dr. Fotis Kafatos, is  expected to be more successful, notably because he has better  contacts with the European Union [EU] officials who have a great  deal of money to distribute.    The attractiveness of the EMBO, the governing organization,  is also under threat, for it is facing growing competition from  similar programs initiated by the EU and by individual European  countries. In many cases, these programs offer more favorable  conditions. For instance, unlike the EMBO, the European Union  offers allowances for chemicals, and higher salaries.  <H5>  Quality Is the Watchword </H5>   The EMBO was set up in 1969, when one of its primary  objectives was to become the face of basic research on molecular  biology in Europe. It was also supposed to counterbalance U.S.  organizations in the same area.    Primarily thanks to political and diplomatic support from  Switzerland, the organization quickly received contributions  from many countries, including the Netherlands.    Quality is the watchword for all activities undertaken at  the  EMBO. With its 32.2 citations per publication, the EMBL in  Heidelberg ranks among the top five laboratories scoring the  highest impact figures in the world. The "EMBO JOURNAL" is one  of the most influential scientific journals. Its impact figure  of 12.4 means that of all journals in the molecular biology  sector it must bow only to CELL (which has an impact figure of  30.2). In addition, EMBO scholarships are recognized as a mark  of quality. Hence its researchers are welcomed with open arms  in most laboratories.    Furthermore, the research groups which are allied to the  organization, but accommodated in the European Synchotron  Radiation Facility in Grenoble and the Hamburg Synchotron  Laboratory, enjoy international recognition. The many small  workshops and laboratory courses that are organized thanks to  the financial support of the EMBO, satisfy a great need, and  contribute greatly to the good contacts maintained between  European researchers.</p>

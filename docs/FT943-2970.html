			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Management: Miner changes - The post-privatisation shake-up in the coal industry Kevin Duncalf, underground locomotive driver and loader at Hem Heath colliery, Staffordshire, recalls with frustration his employment at British Coal. 'For half the shift I was doing nothing. I used to die of boredom,' he says. Today his work keeps him fully occupied. 'I am doing three jobs each day, whereas previously I worked on just one,' he says. He is working at the same pit, but with a different employer - Coal Investments, a company which has taken over five former British Coal mines. Managers say Duncalf is working twice as hard as he used to. While not everyone at the pit has been able to double their productivity, every worker has made some progress, says Coal Investments. The company, in common with most bidders for mining assets, sees fundamental changes in working practices as essential to future success. The leasings by Coal Investments and others, at a total of nine mines, are seen as the prelude to full privatisation later this year, when the government will sell off British Coal's remaining 16 deep mines. From a peak of about 1m workers at the turn of the century, just 10,000 underground workers will remain in the industry. It is inevitable that those remaining miners will be asked to work more effectively and, in some cases, for less pay. Demarcation lines between workers will be eroded and the role of unions will change. Coal Investments' changes in working methods, therefore, may provide an indication of things to come. The company is by no means anti-union: it has submitted a joint bid with the Union of Democratic Mineworkers to buy two British Coal regions in the full privatisation. But it has not negotiated with unions over pay rates at its existing pits and has no plans to do so. Unions will still be allowed to represent their members, but John Warwick, company production director, argues that the need for unions is limited. 'The strength of unions comes from management abnegating its responsibility. If management is doing its job there is no need for unions,' he says. There are new attempts within the company to build a partnership. Miners are now on Christian-name terms with their bosses, and there is no segregation in the showers, as there used to be, between different ranks of workers. Improved communications are aimed at further reducing the perceived management-worker divide. Although there are no formalised team briefings, managers are expected to tell the men about share price, unit costs, production figures and development targets, and even the prices of raw materials. Mitch Lysek, who works on coal-face cutting machinery at Silverdale pit, also in Staffordshire, says: 'When I worked for British Coal, I had no idea what the price of materials was. Now I know how much each nut and bolt costs and how much steel is in stock.' With access to this information, managers argue that workers are less likely to waste materials. Says Lysek: 'If Coal Investments does not make money then nor do we. British Coal was different because it was a government concern.' The comments come from a man who is no fan of privatisation. But Lysek is learning to live with the new regime. Like locomotive driver Duncalf, boredom is now less of a problem. 'Because we have to be more flexible the day goes quicker,' says Lysek. Flexibility also makes it possible for Duncalf and a colleague to perform duties previously carried out by seven men (although the loads handled are smaller). In British Coal days, Duncalf did each of the three types of task, but was able to do just one on each shift. Now, with demarcation lines eroded he can do all three in a single shift and it is easier for workers to call on each other and supervisors for assistance. But in contrast to the experiences of Duncalf and Lysek are some workers who claim that their work has changed little. 'We were already working hard for British Coal. We could scarcely work harder,' says one miner. And some changes have yet to fulfil their potential. In the Silverdale pit, a group of three workers operates a tunnelling machine that previously occupied five men. Managers want them to increase tunnelling speed from 3m a shift to 4m. A few operators appear disgruntled that they are being asked to be more productive for less pay than they earned with British Coal and this could be a potential problem for Coal Investments. Indeed, miners' money is so far substantially less: Warwick says that some British Coal employees can take home more than Pounds 500 a week after overtime and bonus pay. At Coal Investments, which has rationalised 14 British Coal pay rates to four, the gross maximum for miners working a six-day week is about Pounds 282. The company expects to bridge the earnings gap through an employee share ownership plan, profit-related pay and, when full production starts next year, productivity bonuses. These promises of plenty appear to satisfy most employees who are, anyway, grateful for the chance to be working down a mine again after a spell outside the industry. Management-friendly comments are predictable at a young company enjoying a honeymoon with its workforce. The real test of the culture transformation claims will come if the company runs into production or marketing difficulties and has to disappoint its workers' expectations of high rewards.</p>

			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Peres in plea on Israeli settlements Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, yesterday gave the strongest hint so far that Israel might have to abandon certain settlements in the occupied territories as implementation of Palestinian self-rule draws near. Mr Peres' remarks, made on Israel Radio, will be welcomed by Palestinians who see settlements in the occupied territories as a thorn in the side of the peace process. But his statement will create a fierce backlash among Israeli settlers who fear the government eventually intends evacuating settlements from Palestinian lands. Mr Peres said it was time to question whether some settlements should be abandoned in the interests of making peace with Palestinians, although Israel would not be forced to evacuate settlers under the pressure of negotiations. 'What is the point of maintaining a settlement with 28 families that needs workers from Thailand, that needs an army platoon to guard them, needs to have their road guarded by patrols? Where is the logic? What is the point?' he said. Mr Peres was specifically referring to Netzarim, a tiny isolated settlement in the heart of the Gaza Strip. In off-the-record remarks other ministers in the government have said that Netzarim may have to be sacrificed. Under the September Israeli-Palestinian peace accord all 125,000 settlers living in the West Bank and Gaza are to remain in the occupied territories and come under Israeli law. Palestinians say the existence of settlements, particularly the 16 settlements housing 4,500 Israelis in Gaza, is a moral outrage and could prove to be a flashpoint of future violence undermining the peace process. Already the peace process has got bogged down over complicated security arrangements for the settlers in Gaza.</p>

He spoke  about the arrest of the Association of Malian Students and  Pupils secretary general, as well as the latest upsurge in  violence. Boubakar Toure has the details:    [Begin recording] [Toure] The minister first spoke on the  cabinet's adoption of a draft bill on methods of taxing public  contracts in the state budget. This measure was aimed at  avoiding double tax exemptions and curbing government spending.  The minister and the newsmen spoke at length on recent  developments in the school crisis, especially the confirmation  that the AEEM secretary general had been arrested, as well as  the violent incidents of 2 March. Minister Cheickna Kamissoko  was unequivocal about this. He condemned vandalism and stated  that no one was above the law. Zanarawa had to be brought to  justice.    [Kamissoko] Yehia Zarawana was indeed arrested yesterday  morning by the police. Just like the other students who had  been arrested before him, he will have to answer for acts that  he has publicly acknowledged and admitted to in a radio  broadcast. It is at his instigation and that of his association  that students, and others who were not even students -- this has  been proven by those who were judged initially -- set up  roadblocks and vandalized public and private buildings,  property, and health vehicles and [words indistinct]  Unfortunately, the same thing happened last year in the  suburbs. That was the result of an action that he masterminded  and claimed responsibility for. The situation is very clear:  When one accepts responsibility for a criminal act one has to  answer for it. In that sense, no one can be above the law.    [Toure] The minister also stressed that this could have a  spillover effect on highway banditry. He urged parents to  assume their responsibilities. Furthermore, he said the  government was open to dialogue and that schools would be  reopened as soon as the situation was favorable. When  questioned on the situation in the north following Saloum  Bilal's death, the minister conceded that tension was high in  the region, and that a commission of enquiry would be dispatched  to the area to throw more light on the matter.

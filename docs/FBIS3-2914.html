			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Bai Jianfeng (4101 0494 1496) and </F> XINHUA reporter Luo Yuwen (5012 3768 2429)]    [Text] Beijing, 13 Mar (XINHUA) -- People's Liberation  Army [PLA] deputies today continued to hold group discussions on  the government work report. Deputies Zhang Wannian, Yu Yongbo,  and Fu Quanyou separately took the floor. They stressed: All  comrades of the Army must further study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and  must make efforts to successfully carry out the Army's military,  political, and logistic work and to achieve new development in  reforming and building the Army in line with the general  requirement -- "political qualification, perfect mastery of  military skills, high discipline, excellent work style, and  effective logistic support" -- raised by Central Military  Commission [CMC] Chairman Jiang Zemin, and under the guidance of  Mao Zedong's military concept and Deng Xiaoping's concept of  army-building in the new period.    Deputy Zhang Wannian, chief of general staff of the PLA,  said: Premier Li Peng's "Government Work Report" sets a very  high premium on army-building. Our armed forces must  continuously enhance their consciousness of danger, national  defense, and modern warfare; they must keep a clear head at all  times; they must conscientiously prepare for danger in times of  peace; and they must always be alert. Army units must intensify  study and training; they must work hard to enhance their modern  warfare capabilities; they must vigorously train and bring on a  new type of military personnel able to meet the needs of and  take command in modern warfare; they must further strengthen  control of Army units; they must make efforts to explore ways to  lead troops under the new situation; and they must pay attention  to studying the new situation and solving new problems so as to  maintain a high degree of centralism, unity, and stability in  Army units.    Deputy Yu Yongbo, director of the General Political  Department of the PLA, said: We must actively respond to the  call issued by General Secretary Jiang Zemin, take a clear stand  in following the correct guidance of the media, and vigorously  strengthen the building of spiritual civilization in the Army.  He elaborated on how to follow the correct guidance of the  media. He stressed that efforts must be made this year to  successfully require Army units and especially cadres at and  above regimental level to study Volume 3 of the Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping, to energetically encourage standing  up for what is right, and to carry on widespread propaganda for  examples of advanced collectives and individuals that meet the  needs of and reflect the spirit of our times. He said: We must  treat the campaign to study Comrade Xu Honggang's activities as  the turning point; we must energetically publicize and advocate  the five types of revolutionary spirit initiated by Comrade Deng  Xiaoping and the 64-character pioneering spirit initiated by  General Secretary Jiang Zemin; we must carry forward the fine  traditions of our party and Army; and we must vigorously foster  and publicize more examples of advanced collectives and  individuals that typify our times to enable good standards of  conduct -- taking the interests of the whole into consideration,  practicing plain living and waging hard struggle, strictly  observing discipline, blazing new trails and forging ahead, and  dedicating oneself selflessly -- to take further shape  throughout the Army.    Deputy Fu Quanyou, director of the General Logistics  Department of the PLA, said: The development of a socialist  market economy will inevitably cause a series of new problems to  for Army logistic work and for economic work in the military  field. Challenges and opportunities exist at the same time, and  so do difficulties and hopes. It requires us to try to adapt  ourselves to the development of a socialist market economy, to  conscientiously "converge [jie gui 2234 6510]" with the market  economy, and to conduct our various logistical operations in  compliance with the dual requirements of the "battlefield" and  the "market." We must intensify reform of logistical work,  produce results from reform, and provide effective logistical  support. To successfully carry out reform, we must further  emancipate our minds and change our concepts. We must intensify  study and continuously enhance our ability to keep the progress  of reform well in hand. We must further carry forward fine  traditions and arduously persist in pioneering undertakings. As  the current material conditions for reform of the Army's  logistics are not very good, we must practice plain living, wage  hard struggle, and press forward despite difficulties. The main  tasks for reform of the Army's logistics for a certain period of  time to come are: Reforming the logistic support system to  enable it to pay equal attention to both military and civilian  production and to integrate the logistic support operations for  wartime with that for peacetime; reforming the acquisition and  stockpile of military material to guarantee that the needs of  army-building are met; reforming logistic management and  improving military efficiency; reforming military production and  management to better subsidizing army units in terms of  supplies; and reforming the supply standards and methods to  better meet the needs of Army units for their combat readiness,  training, and subsistence.</p>

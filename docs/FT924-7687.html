			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: Directors' Transactions THE largest transaction this week was the sale of 750,000 shares by Serge Crasnianski, a director of Photo-Me International. This sale takes his interest, as held through Imaging Systems International, to 11.25 million shares, just under 20 per cent of the share capital. Photo-Me's business of operating photographic booths has proved remarkably resilient to worldwide recession and consequently the shares have traded at a premium to the market. Raymond Parsons, life president of electronic component group, Bowthorpe, has sold 135,000 shares at 270p. That reduces his holding to just under 100,000 shares and is the largest straight sale by a director of Bowthorpe since 1990. Over the last year, the shares have outperformed by some 18 per cent. Shares in Alexander Proudfoot have been under pressure since May this year, when it became clear that the previous levels of profitability were not going to be maintained. Interim results in September revealed profits down by half and sentiment has since deteriorated further. The purchase of 30,000 shares by John Prosser, the recently-appointed chief executive, follows purchases of 10,000 and 5,000 shares by Christopher Mills and Sir Campbell Fraser during the summer. William Eberle has also bought 5,000 shares at 71p.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                         No of Company              Sector     Shares     Value    directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Admiral                Elec     22,180        77           1* Bespak                 Hlth      8,500        45           1 Bowthorpe              Elec    135,000       364           1 Britannic Assurance    InsL      1,400        14           1 Cadbury Schweppes      FdMa      4,000        19           1 Cornwell P'ker A NV    Misc     20,000        40           1* Glaxo                  Hlth    130,560     1,074           1* Lloyd Thompson         InsB    100,000       232           1 MacFarlane Gp Clans    Pack      5,000        10           1 Microvitec             Elec     50,000        13           1 Photo Me Intl          Misc    750,000     2,310           1 Reckitt &amp; Coleman      Hlth      3,975        25           1 Sherwood Computer      BuSe     80,000       197           4* Sleepy Kids             H&amp;L    100,000        12           2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Airflow Str Cm Prf     Motr     40,000        37           2 Babcock Intl           EngG     49,130        14           4 Castle Comm.

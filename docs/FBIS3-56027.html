Whether the situation will subside or tend to intensify will  depend to a considerable extent on the leaders of the national  republic and its old and new politicians, those who are in the  structures of administration today and those who will replace  them after the elections to the local organs of power: A  presidential election is due on 16 January, parliamentary  elections 27 March.    Our correspondent's interlocutor is Sergey Valentinovich  Khetagurov, chairman of the Republic of North Ossetia Council of  Ministers and a deputy to the Federation Council.    [Beldyugina] About the elections. You are taking part in  the election race, but at the same time it is well-known that  you are an opponent of the very institution of presidency in the  republic. How do you reconcile these two facts?    [Khetagurov] I cannot imagine a more inappropriate  occupation for an anxious republic preoccupied with quite  different concerns and problems than yet another political  campaign accompanied by the fueling of public passions,  struggles among different teams and groups, scandals,  intrigues...    In short, all this tends to split a society, which more than  ever before needs consolidation, a pooling of efforts to  stabilize the situation in the state of emergency zone and give  help to refugees and those who have suffered during the  conflict, and the restoration of a national economy badly  damaged by the war with our neighbors.    For example, 28 people have contested three Federal Assembly  seats! Eight candidates are now running for the presidency. I  do not think that any of the contenders for the presidency is  entirely suited to the role, and that includes myself. But in  the republic's present government and in my team there are many  people who are simply irreplaceable today. However, my defeat  will mean the inevitable resignation of the whole team.    Under the Republic of North Ossetia Constitution the  president is both head of the republic and chief executive.  There is no equivalent in any fundamental law.    [Beldyugina] I attended one of your election meetings with  the voters in the village of Olginskoye. For the most part  people were interested not in politics but in social problems --  the bad roads, communications, the lack of heat in people's  homes, and other problems.    [Khetagurov] That is the point. For the government the  social sphere is indeed the priority. The appalling  psychological tension can be defused by improving the  population's well-being and by combating unemployment and  poverty. Not only have we prevented the social sphere from  disintegrating but we have even made some real progress. North  Ossetia today has one of the highest per capita incomes. In the  North Caucasus at least we are in first place in that regard.  The slump in production in the republic has been halted and  overall production volumes are increasing.    [Beldyugina] Nevertheless, the tension in the state of  emergency region is high and could erupt. People seem to be  expecting the worst. The intention to return Ingush refugees to  four settlements in Prigorodnyy Rayon has caused a storm of  protests from the population. You also consider this step  hasty. Why?    [Khetagurov] Because you cannot reconcile by force people  who yesterday were enemies and who lost their near ones in  bloody battle. How can you make people live together when their  predominant feeling today is one of fear?    [Beldyugina] What is your relationship like with the  leadership of the interim administration of Ingushetia?    [Khetagurov] It is a normal, businesslike relationship. We  seek a path of mutual understanding and cooperation in the  solution of any question. The main thing is to avoid a head-on  confrontation and harm caused by intolerance or harsh and  ill-considered actions. But the military presence in the region  must be reduced. For three years the republic has been living  in a state of emergency. This is too long and has traumatized  people's psyche.    [Beldyugina] In that case who will ensure their security?    [Khetagurov] There are teams of internal troops and a border  regiment quartered in North Ossetia -- these forces are  sufficient to maintain law and order in the republic.    [Beldyugina] Nevertheless, people must return to their  homes. Especially those who were not caught up in the bloody  events of 1992. After all, the situation cannot be maintained.  Perhaps you know of another way out?    [Khetagurov] I am convinced that events cannot be forced.  This is a question of the security not just of the Ossetian  population but also of the Ingush. Furthermore, there is the  problem of preserving an already too fragile peace throughout  the North Caucasus and in southern Russia. Time is the best  healer. It is necessary to use popular diplomacy, the laws,  traditions, and the custom of reconciliation typical of the  mountain people. People must become reconciled with one another  -- neighbor with neighbor. Conciliation commissions have been  created in all our population centers.</p>

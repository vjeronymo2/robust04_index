			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Dr. 'Ali Akbar Velayati by </F> Zaki Shihab in Tehran; date not given]    [Text] [Shihab] Last week, you invited the foreign  ministers of the Islamic states to an extraordinary meeting to  discuss the implications of the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in  Hebron. What can the Islamic states' foreign ministers offer  other than a statement of condemnation and denunciation?    [Velayati] I have asked the chairman of the Islamic  Conference Organization [ICO] and the Pakistani foreign minister  to call for an extraordinary conference of the Islamic states'  foreign ministers. We are still working to convene this  meeting. I believe the Islamic nation must express its attitude  in this regard, and condemn what has happened in Hebron.    We are seeking a unified position. For what has happened to  the Palestinians in the occupied territories pains us all. We  must take deterrent, firm, and decisive positions that make  whoever entertains the notion of encroaching upon the Islamic  nation experience a great deal of hesitation before he embarks  on such encroachments.    For more than half a century, the Palestinian people have  continued to suffer from massacres at the hands of the Zionists,  not to mention the harsh treatment accorded to them. We must  learn from our Islamic history and support all Muslims who have  come under the pressure of their enemies.    [Shihab] What can you offer the victims of the massacre,  other than prayers?    [Velayati] There are various means of extending support. The  most important form of support is political support, as well as  the application of international pressure on the aggressor.  When we speak of such means of support, we do not exclude other  means of support.    [Shihab] Such as what?    [Velayati] I do not want to divulge the measures that I have  in mind, and what we, as Islamic states, can do to mitigate the  Palestinians' sufferings. Some of the measures we will take  will be confidential.    [Shihab] Iran has opposed the peace agreement the PLO and  Israel signed in Washington in September 1993. Why have you  opposed the agreement? Will you take a similar position if  Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan sign similar agreements with Israel?    [Velayati] Well, when we express such a position toward this  agreement, this means that we do not approve of a certain  policy. But, as you know, our opposition to such agreements does  not mean that we will have disputes with the countries to which  we are bound by strong ties, or that we will sever our ties with  them.    We maintain strong relations with Syria. We have  communicated to our Syrian friends in no uncertain terms that we  are opposed to the agreement or whatever has to do with making  peace with Israel.    We know Syria has its own thoughts on this particular issue  and it is playing a clear role in the anti-Zionist effort.  However, we realize Syria is coming under intense pressure not  only in regard to its position on the Israeli occupation of the  Golan Heights but in regard to south Lebanon as well.    If we understand Syria's position, this is not to say that  we  will support whatever agreement it signs with Israel. Syria has  its own clear, independent policy. The same goes for us.    [Shihab] How did Syria respond to your observations about a  possible agreement with Israel?    [Velayati] As I have already pointed out, we talked with our  Syrian brothers frankly. At the same time, we are all aware of  the support Syria has made available to the Palestinian cause in  all areas. Syria continues to extend support to the Palestinian  cause. You are aware that the 10 Palestinian factions opposed to  the peace agreement with Israel are still active in Damascus.    [Shihab] Iranian news media said that after the al-Asad-  Clinton summit, Syria would send an envoy to Tehran to brief you  on the outcome. Did they send one?    [Velayati] No one came to Tehran.    [Shihab] Has Syria tried to mediate between Iran and the  United States?    [Velayati] As I have said, Syria did not send any envoy to  brief us on the talks between al-Asad and Clinton.    [Shihab] Why?    [Velayati] You must ask the Syrian brothers. I must point  out, however, that there is no precedent for this. In the past  two decades, there have been meetings between President al-Asad  and former U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon.  Syria did not send an envoy to brief us on those talks.    [Shihab] We have been hearing for some time that President  al- Asad will visit Tehran. Will the visit take place soon?    [Velayati] This is likely. The Iranian president. Hashemi-  Rafsanjani, visited Damascus twice, but President al-Asad came  here only once.    [Shihab] This month, or next month?    [Velayati] We have not yet decided on the proper time for  this visit. Nonetheless, I believe it will be made in the near  future.    [Shihab] Do you believe the military action that Hizballah  and the Palestinian factions initiated from southern Lebanon  will continue if Israel agrees to withdraw from there, and signs  a peace agreement with the Lebanese Government?    [Velayati] I do not know, because the Palestinians and  Lebanese will have to decide this for themselves. We do not  want to force our own dictates on them. The Lebanese are  engaged in acts of self-defense and waging a jihad to liberate  their occupied territories. I do not know what will happen in  the future.    [Shihab] Security in the Gulf is a critical and thorny issue  for the countries of the region. How does Iran perceive its  role in the region? To what extent is it willing to cooperate  with its neighbors in this regard?    [Velayati] Safeguarding security in the Gulf region is a  critical issue for all countries of the region. This issue is  of strategic importance for all states, be they Iran, Iraq, or  the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] members. I believe the six  Gulf countries, namely, the six GCC members, may not, at  present, agree to cooperate with Iraq in this regard.  Nonetheless, we believe in the importance of this cooperation  to promote stability and security. If there is tension for  whatever reason, we all are dutybound to work to defuse tension  through understanding and dialogue.    [Shihab] Since you are speaking of defusing tension through  understanding, I would like to pose the following question to  you. Regarding your dispute with the United Arab Emirates [UAE]  over the islands of Abu Musa, Tunb al-Sughra, and Tunb al-Kubra,  you were reported to have said that there is a third party that  seeks to maintain tension in the region in general, and between  the UAE and Iran in particular. Can you name this party?    [Velayati] It is not a single party. Some seek to take  advantage of aggravated tension in the region in order to create  additional reasons and justifications for the presence of some  Western powers in the Gulf region. These parties are creating  problems and promoting tension among states.    [Shihab] Are you planning to visit Iraq soon, as some  reports  have said, in the aftermath of a recent visit to Tehran by a  senior Iraqi official?    [Velayati] This is contingent upon the success of the steps  undertaken to implement Security Council Resolution 598. The  most important things we expect in this regard is swapping  prisoners of war, redrawing the disputed border, which was the  scene of a devastating and wicked war, and various other  measures, as well.    The materialization of my visit to Baghdad is largely  contingent upon progress in resolving the issues I have just  mentioned. I hope Iraq will honor its commitments toward these  issues so we may take a new step toward the future.    [Shihab] What about your relations with Saudi Arabia and an  exchange of visits and envoys?    [Velayati] In the past, there were dark clouds in relations  between Saudi Arabia and Iran. However, if we look at the  course of these relations recently, we will find improvement in  these relations.    Our relations with Saudi Arabia are positive; we are looking  forward to developing and strengthening them in the future.    [Shihab] A senior Iranian official described the  establishment of a Kurdish state in northern Iraq as the  creation of a new Israel that is rejected by Iran. Why? Are  you worried about the strong cooperation between Western  countries and some major Kurdish parties in the region?    [Velayati] We fully believe in the importance of maintaining  the unity of Iraq -- territory and people -- and its  independence, regardless of who is running its affairs. Iran  believes the continuation of Iraq, with its present and  recognized borders, is important to the stability and security  of the region. If anyone tries to set up an independent state  in northern or southern Iraq this will be considered a threat to  Iran's security and we will face this with firmness.    [Shihab] What obstructs any improvement in your relations  with the Egyptian Government? What is your opinion about the  accusations that Iran supports some extremist Islamic movements  in Egypt?    [Velayati] Fortunately, the Egyptian interior minister  recently announced that there is no evidence of Iran's support  for the fundamentalist Islamic movements or of its interference  in Egypt's internal affairs. In the past, we were victims of  such accusations. We were the target of severe media campaigns  by the Egyptian papers. We, meanwhile, denied such accusations.  The conviction of the Egyptian political leadership that Iran  has not practiced any illegal activities in Egypt or interfered  in Egypt's internal affairs is an important sign regarding the  return of Egyptian- Iranian relations to normal.    [Shihab] Does this mean that we will see improvement in  bilateral relations very soon, if not an exchange of official  visits?    [Velayati] Yes, I believe this, because it has been proven  that we are innocent of all charges leveled against us.    [Shihab] When will the UAE foreign minister visit Tehran to  discuss the islands crisis, especially since a previously  scheduled visit was canceled?    [Velayati] I extended in the past, and now I am repeating,  an  open invitation to my UAE counterpart to visit Tehran at a time  he sees as appropriate. I said in the past that Iran is very  eager to resolve any misunderstanding with any of its neighbors,  especially the UAE, through understanding and dialogue.    [Shihab] You speak about the possibility of reaching a  solution, and on other occasions you extend Iran's sovereignty  over Gulf waters.    [Velayati] What the Iranian Islamic Consultative Assembly  (Majlis) did was to ratify a law approved by most countries.  The UAE adopted a similar decision. What you spoke about deals  with navigation rights, nothing more, nothing less. We will  continue to be eager to coexist peacefully with our neighbors.    [Shihab] Iran's relations with the West, and the United  States and Britain in particular, continue to be bad. What do  these countries want from you?    [Velayati] This question should be addressed to the United  States and other countries.    [Shihab] What do you want from the United States?    [Velayati] We want the United States to stop interfering in  our internal affairs. This is a basic issue. We want the  United States to stop besieging our economy, return our frozen  money, and provide us with spare parts for the weapons that we  brought from U.S. factories.    [Shihab] Do Iran and Turkey cooperate or compete to spread  their influence in the central Asian Islamic republics?    [Velayati] We and Turkey are members of ECO [Economic  Cooperation Organization] and the central Asian republics are  members of this organization. Therefore, it is natural that our  relations with Turkey are governed by cooperation in the  interest of our two countries and the central Asian Islamic  republics. In fact there are other things. Turkey may have  concerns that differ from ours.    [Shihab] What do you do in order to resolve the crisis in  Afghanistan and the rivalry taking place between the Mujahidin?    [Velayati] First of all, I want to say that we all pray for  the end of fighting and for putting an end to war, destruction,  and innocent victims. Secondly, we are doing our best in order  to bring the different viewpoints of the belligerent factions  closer together, because Afghanistan faced total destruction,  first at the hands of the defunct Communist regime, then by the  destructive war between brothers.    [Shihab] The Iranian capital was packed with foreign  visitors last week. In addition to the Chinese deputy prime  minister and foreign minister, Indian foreign minister, and  Russian deputy foreign minister and others were here.    [Velayati] And the envoy of [Afghan President] Rabbani.    [Shihab] At the meetings between these foreign visitors and  President Hashemi-Rafsanjani, the president presented the idea  of cooperation with their countries to form a regional force in  Asia that solves conflicts between the countries of the region.  Do you have information on what the president presented  concerning this idea?    [Velayati] We have begun practical steps to shape up ideas  that encourage the strong and leading Asian countries to  cooperate together in all fields. The first step is that the  strong and politically active countries work out a preliminary  concept on this cooperation, and later we will ask the other  countries to join this alliance or grouping.    I want to say that a leader of one of the central Asian  republics of the former Soviet Union was the one who presented  this idea to President Hashemi-Rafsanjani. President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani was convinced of this idea soon after it was  presented to him, and used the chance of the visits to Tehran by  foreign ministers of two important countries, China and India,  to reiterate his support for the idea. The idea received good  attention by the Indian and Chinese guests.    Iran previously expressed to Indian and Chinese officials  its  readiness for cooperation in order to implement these ideas  through forming special committees. These committees will  explain the concepts of each side regarding the working  structure of such grouping or alliance and the role which it  could play in the future to contribute to stability, progress,  and the prosperity of the Asian nations.    [Shihab] Observers have noticed a change in Iranian foreign  policy over the past three years, especially toward some  neighborly European countries. Does this mean that Iran has  gone back on the slogan of exporting the revolution and the  party which is not with Iran is against it?    [Velayati] The Iranian Government has benefited from its  previous experiments and began to follow a clear policy. We do  not deny that this took some time. Following the success of the  revolution, we were exposed to huge pressure from various sides.  Therefore, our policy was not 100-percent sound and successful.  Now that we have gained experience, we have begun to lay down  firm bases for our policy. Any observer can judge the  experiment of our revolution if we are compared with other  revolutions. Despite this, I can say that we have passed  through various stages: The first stage was represented by our  endeavor to reach stability; and the second stage was  represented by our endeavor in the fields of construction and  planning.</p>

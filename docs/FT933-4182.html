			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Bundesbank move triggers wave of rate cuts THE BUNDESBANK cut its internationally important discount and Lombard rates by half a percentage point each yesterday, prompting a wave of rate cuts in continental Europe. But the German central bank's decision to make only a slight cut in the 'repo' rate, at which it supplies funds to the banking sector through money market operations, to 6.7 per cent from 6.8 per cent, led financial markets and economists to view the monetary easing with caution. The Bundesbank reduced its discount rate to 6.25 per cent from 6.75 per cent, its first cut since July 1, and in effect dropped the floor for German money market rates by half a percentage point. The Lombard rate, at which the Bundesbank lends emergency funds to banks against collateral, was lowered to 7.25 per cent from the 7.75 per cent level set immediately before the late July crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism. The German move was followed by rate cuts in France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Austria. Other ERM central banks, though, appeared reluctant to treat the German move as a signal for sharp cuts in interest rates or for a decoupling of their currencies from the D-Mark in the ERM's wider 15 per cent fluctuation margins agreed last month. The Bank of France reduced the rate at which it lends five-to-10-day funds from 10 per cent to 7.75 per cent but left the more important intervention rate unchanged at 6.75 per cent. Belgium, while cutting its discount rate by half a point to 6.50 per cent, reduced its important central rate by only one quarter of a percentage point to 10.25 per cent. The Netherlands reduced its official rates by only a quarter of a percentage point. Financial markets reacted coolly to the news. Equities in Frankfurt were slightly lower at the end of official trading before declining further in after-hours dealings. The rate cuts left the D-Mark unscathed. The dollar fell sharply against the German currency, losing more than two pfennigs in London to close at DM1.597. It was little changed in New York. The Bundesbank said it had resumed its policy of gradually lowering interest rates because of recent evidence of a gradual slowdown of inflationary pressures in Germany. Another factor was the recent strength of the D-Mark, coupled with signs that money supply growth had not been as high as feared after the Bundesbank intervened in currency markets last month, the central bank said. German politicians welcomed the Bundesbank's move. Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, said it would support the recovery of economic growth in Germany and abroad. Although the cuts in Germany's two 'headline' rates were more than expected, verdicts among economists and industry were mixed. Mr Thomas Mayer, economist at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt, said: 'It combines a technical move with genuine easing of monetary policy.' The BDI, the Federation of German Industry, welcomed the rate reduction, but said it was too soon to talk of an 'all clear' for German industry. Some economists pointed out that the direct impact on German industry of yesterday's cut in short-term rates would be negligible because the bulk of German companies' borrowing was long-term, where rates had been at 30-year lows for some time. But Mr Jurgen Pfister, head of economic research at Commerzbank, said: 'The cut will have considerable symbolic effect as it proves the Bundesbank's determination to keep on reducing rates.' European monetary officials suggested that the Bundesbank had cut its rates yesterday to 'clear the decks' in good time before the retirement of Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the central bank's president, at the end of this month.

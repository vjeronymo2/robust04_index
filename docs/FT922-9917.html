			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / De Klerk picks ex-Gencor chief as finance minister MR F W DE KLERK, the South African president, last night reshuffled his cabinet, appointing Mr Derek Keys, the former chairman of Gencor, the South African mining and industrial conglomerate, as the new finance minister. Mr Keys, who was appointed minister of trade and industry and economic co-ordination earlier this year, will now take responsibility for finance as well. He replaces Mr Barend du Plessis who resigned 10 days ago because of exhaustion. Mr Keys will take up his post at a time when South Africa is faced with a difficult political transition from white rule to multi-racial democracy, with a multi-party interim government expected to assume power within months. His appointment will be welcomed by the business community, which credits him with a revolution in managerial attitudes at Gencor. Under his leadership, the company achieved a sharp improvement in profit performance, increased its stock market rating and gained a reputation as the best managed mining house in South Africa. As Gencor chairman, he was praised for his policy of decentralised management, involving maximum delegation of duties and responsibilities  - a policy which he may need to pursue in his new job, which covers a number of important economic portfolios. Mr De Klerk also announced the appointment of Mr Roelf Meyer, one of government's chief constitutional negotiators, as minister of constitutional development, to replace Mr Gerrit Viljoen. Mr Gene Louw is to take over from Mr Meyer as minister of defence.</p>

			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> SOVIETS PLAN REVOLUTION DAY FETE  </P> <P> The Communist Party leadership said today that annual Revolution Day  festivities will go ahead next month, raising the risk of another humiliation  on Moscow's Red Square for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  </P> <P> "Any attempts to deprive our multinational people of its main state celebration  is illegitimate and unfounded," the Communist Party's secretariat said in a  statement.  </P> <P> Radical politicians have called for the cancellation of civilian festivities  Nov. 7 in Moscow and have urged people to channel their efforts instead into  patching up the city ahead of the harsh winter. At last year's Revolution Day  parade, about 10,000 Muscovites organized an alternative demonstration during  which they called on the Communists to surrender their monopoly of power.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: SUPER BOWL XXIV;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS 55 DENVER BRONCOS 10;  </P> <P> ELWAY HACKS HIS WAY THROUGH IT  </P> <P> All his right arm was good for Sunday was to cover his mouth when coughing.  John Elway, least valuable player of Super Bowl XXIV, slipped the offending  limb into the sleeve of a leather bomber-pilot's jacket, took his wife by the  hand, then did the very thing he had so much difficulty doing during the  (cough) football game that mercifully ended more than an hour before. He  marched the length of the field.  </P> <P> From the losers' locker room on the Poydras Street side of the Louisiana  Superdome, the Elways re-entered the center ring of the cavernous arena and  crossed the entire playing field, making for the Girod Street exit,  side-stepping technicians and dangling cable. Stadium stragglers, never ones to  pass up a chance to ask an athlete for an autograph, rushed forward for the  signature of a flu-wracked, guilt-ridden, bronchial Bronco, whose team had just  been horsewhipped, 55-10.  </P> <P> "Sorry, John," one said.  </P> <P> Elway sighed, smiled, signed.  </P> <P> "Hey, John! John!" a young girl called down from the mezzanine.  </P> <P> Elway looked up, squinted into a bright light, waved to her.  </P> <P> And away he went into the tunnel, into the darkness, into the future, homeward  bound to his addresses in Aurora, Colo., and Palm Springs, hardly headed for  Disneyland. Off he went to his dwellings, to dwell on all that went haywire.  Home to wonder why he was tricked again rather than treated, to wonder whether  the city and population of Denver would ever again allow him to feel a mile  high.  </P> <P> "All I can do is the best I can," said Elway, who looked the worst of any of  the five quarterbacks who played football Sunday -- two San Francisco 49ers,  two Denver Broncos and Budway Joe, the animated beer bottle. "I'm just trying  to figure out how we can win one of these things."  </P> <P> Call him with suggestions. There is no toll-free number, not yet, but when  there is, you can bet it won't have Roman numerals in it. In three Super Bowls,  Elway-quarterbacked teams have scored 40 points. The other guys have scored  136. And at the bottom of this mine lies a big, big man, Big John.  </P> <P> "They didn't make the mistakes we did," Elway said of the victorious 49ers.  Hey, who did? Elway's game had more holes than Pete Fountain's clarinet. He was  10 for 26, got sacked four times, had two passes intercepted, fumbled twice.  The touchdown he scored was strictly peanuts. In fact, John Elway was strictly  peanuts; he was Charlie Brown, faked out by Lucy again.  </P> <P> Did he accept his fate gracefully? Yes, he did. Hacking incessantly but  insisting he felt fine, Elway talked about how awesome the 49ers looked, about  what a "well-oiled machine" they are, about how the Broncos lost to a better  football team and had to be satisfied that at least they hadn't lost due to a  lack of effort.  </P> <P> "It's disappointing," Elway said, smiling a smile that was all teeth and no  mirth. "Why do we always come in here and play so poorly?  </P> <P> "I feel sorry not only for myself and for the organization, but for the fans in  Denver and throughout the United States who have been behind us, who have  expected more from us. We've got to keep plugging away, try to get them one.  I'd still rather lose the Super Bowl than not be in the Super Bowl at all, but  when are we going to win one of these things?"  </P> <P> More to the point: Is John Elway the reason Denver's here or the reason Denver  loses?  </P> <P> Cough.  </P> <P> For the 49ers in New Orleans, it was big and it was easy. The only way they  could have won by more is if Jack Pardee had been their coach, in which case  the score would have been 95-10 before he pulled his starters. Elway's only  touchdown wouldn't have counted if an official hadn't overruled an end zone  interception by San Francisco's Bill Romanowski, charging him instead with pass  interference. Elway has a total of two touchdown passes in three Super Bowls.  </P> <P> He tried not to visibly react, bad play after bad play. After an interception  by Chet Brooks, with the damage already 34-3, Denver defensive back Steve  Atwater trudged back onto the field and did what any decent teammate does; he  patted his quarterback on the rump. Sympathy was running high by then. The  Broncos knew or suspected what Elway was feeling.  </P> <P> By the end, even the 49ers themselves were commiserating. Niner linebacker Matt  Millen helped the quarterback up, put a comforting hand on his shoulder and  said: "Hang in there."  </P> <P> "I'm trying," Elway said.  </P> <P> "You're going to take a lot of heat, but it isn't justified," Millen said.  </P> <P> Some of the heat was coming from the stands. Certain fans had seen enough. From  a section full of orange shirts, a section presumably occupied by Denver  faithful, a chant arose during the second half, a chant that took in vain the  name of a former punk musician, intended for the ears of Elway.  </P> <P> "Johnny Rotten! Johnny Rotten!" it went, cruelly.  </P> <P> "You know," San Francisco's overstuffed teddy bear Bubba Paris said, "it got to  a point in the game where, being a Christian and being a person that loves  people, I actually felt sorry for Denver."  </P> <P> The tricky part for John Elway was not feeling sorry for himself. Here was a  football player who has played in three Super Bowls, who knows somewhere in his  insides that 'tis better to have played and lost than never to have played at  all. Yet, all anyone could say to him -- all he could say to himself -- was how  horrible it was that he, like Fran Tarkenton of the Minnesota Vikings, has  quarterbacked three Super Bowl losers.  </P> <P> "At least Fran was in a couple of those Super Bowls," Elway said. "I've never  even been in one. We've been manhandled every time."  </P> <P> He coughed and said maybe next time, things would be different. The cough was  understandable. Sometimes, words get stuck in a guy's throat.  </P></p>

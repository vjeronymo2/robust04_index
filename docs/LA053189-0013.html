			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: TWO SPRINTERS SIGN TO ATTEND CS NORTHRIDGE  </P> <P> Sprinters Cela Taylor of Alameda Encinal High and Charlotte Vines of Santa  Barbara San Marcos High have signed letters of intent to attend Cal State  Northridge in the fall.  </P> <P> Taylor, winner of North Coast Section 2-A Division titles in the 200 and 400  meters, has personal bests of 24.99 seconds (24.0 wind-aided) in the former and  55.74 in the latter.  </P> <P> Vines has run 11.89 in the 100 and 25.75 in the 200. She placed second in the  100 and fourth in the 200 in the Southern Section 3-A Division championships.  </P> <P> John Crow resigned his position as Agoura High baseball coach last week after  the Chargers' Southern Section 2-A Division playoff loss to St. Bernard and  will concentrate on his duties as the school's athletic director.  </P> <P> Fred Williams, the former athletic director, has been named the school's  assistant principal.  </P> <P> Crow, 45, posted a 45-36-2 record and his teams qualified for the playoffs  three times in four years. He also led the Chargers to the Frontier League  title in 1986 and 1989.  </P> <P> "I had some real mixed feelings about this," Crow said. "I got the overall  feeling that the juniors would like to have me around for one more year."  </P> <P> For the last month of the '89 season, Crow divided his time between athletic  director and baseball coach before deciding to concentrate on the  administrative position. "I have to focus my attentions on one job," Crow said.  "I'd be doing half a job at each and that's not my way of doing things."  </P> <P> John Tomac, 21, of Chatsworth maintained his ninth-place standing Tuesday after  the second stage of the 13-day Milk Race through parts of England and Wales. He  leads all other American entrants.  </P> <P> Despite finishing 32nd in Tuesday's 122-mile stage, Tomac trails Keith Reynolds  of Great Britain by 21 seconds in the overall standings for the approximately  1,200-mile race.  </P> <P> Scott McKinley of Carmichael, Calif., entered the stage as the top American but  lost his sixth-place position after missing the decisive move with about 13  miles remaining. Reynolds, who led at the time by 1 minute, 35 seconds, had his  lead pared to a mere 14 seconds at the finish in Bristol, England.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV AND VIDEO  </P> <P> Let the Games Begin: In an effort to boost the presence of first-run  programming on its prime-time schedule during the rerun-laden summer, ABC said  Thursday that it will carry two game shows on Saturday nights, beginning June  16. At 8 p.m. will be a network version of "Jeopardy!" hosted by Alex Trebek,  followed at 8:30 by an adaptation of "Monopoly" that the producers previously  had been unable to sell in syndication.

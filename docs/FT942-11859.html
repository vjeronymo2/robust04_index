			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Friendly society woos life company Family Assurance friendly society plans to buy Templeton Life Assurance, part of the Templeton Marketing Group, for Pounds 1.75m. This is the first time a friendly society has tried to acquire a life assurance company and is a sign of the changing financial services marketplace. Family Assurance, based in Brighton, says it wishes to acquire Templeton Life for its pensions expertise. Templeton Life, which has Pounds 230m under management, markets and underwrites life assurance and pension policies. The acquisition on July 1 depends on Family Assurance members' agreement and approval by the Friendly Societies' Commission. Mr John Reeve, Family Assurance chief executive, said the acquisition would place the society in a stronger position in the personal-pensions market. He said: 'Our long-term aim is to be the country's most dominant provider of tax-exempt savings and this acquisition is an important step nearer that goal.' The acquisition would add 32,000 policyholders to Family Assurance's 500,000 members and would bring its assets under management to just under Pounds 1bn. This would place it close to the second-largest friendly society, Royal Liver Assurance, which has more than Pounds 1bn under management. Templeton Life arose from the de-mutualisation in 1990 of Time Assurance company, another friendly society. The company has found it hard to sell its products through independent financial advisers, its main sales outlet in an increasingly competitive market. Friendly societies grew from the co-operative movement, providing protection for workers against sickness and unemployment. Investment by individuals in societies' tax-free savings schemes is limited to Pounds 200 a year.</p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / International Company News: Enterprise and Lasmo prepare for final phase Enterprise Oil's Pounds 1.7bn hostile bid for fellow oil explorer Lasmo enters its final phase this week as both sides prepare their last presentations for institutional investors in the UK. Mr Graham Hearne, Enterprise chairman and Mr Joe Darby, Lasmo chief executive, spent much of last week making the rounds of US investors, who control more than 20 per cent of Lasmo. Enterprises's final all-paper offer closes at 1pm on Friday. Some institutions are known to have made up their mind about the bid. However, it is widely expected that big shareholders, the largest with more than 16 per cent of Lasmo shares and 5 per cent of Enterprise, will wait until Friday morning before declaring which side they will support. Speculation continued at the weekend that Enterprise would begin buying Lasmo shares this week if it is not confident that it can reach the 50 per cent target through straight acceptances. The company can buy up to 10 per cent of Lasmo shares in the market. It is believed that any such buying would include both US and UK shareholders if it materialised. See Lex</p>

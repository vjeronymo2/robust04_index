			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Four Lonrho directors set to go Four of Lonrho's oldest directors - the ones most closely identified with Mr Tiny Rowland - are on the verge of agreeing to resign before the end of the conglomerate's financial year. Their departure would leave Mr Dieter Bock, joint chief executive with Mr Rowland, in complete control. It may also herald the early departure of Mr Rowland from the group that he has dominated for the past three decades. The four directors discussing their terms of departure are understood to be Mr Rene Leclezio, chairman, and Mr Peter Youens, both in their 70s, and the two deputy chairmen, Mr Paul Spicer and Mr Robert Dunlop, who are in their mid-60s. All four are seen as Mr Rowland's strongest supporters on the Lonrho board. The normal retiring age of directors at most companies is 65. Mr Rowland, who is 76, last month threatened that any attempt by Mr Bock to get rid of the 'Lonrho pensioners' would lead to a 'fight over my dead body'. However, he recently appeared to soften his opposition, saying that any resignation would only be acceptable if it was at the behest of the director. He also stressed that he was now 'at one' with Mr Bock. Under Lonrho's articles of association, directors can only be dismissed with the unanimous agreement of the board. This effectively means it is almost impossible to fire anyone on the board. Mr Bock, the German financier with 18.8 per cent of the stock, has long been in favour of changing the articles to bring them into line with modern company practice. He recently received the support of Mr Rowland and the board to ask Morgan Grenfell, Lonrho's merchant bank adviser, to prepare a paper updating the articles. Some of the main changes expected to be recommended are the dismissal of a director by simple majority of the board instead of unanimous approval; a retirement age of 65; the re-election of all directors; and the maximum number of directors that can be appointed to the board. The proposed changes would then be put to Lonrho's annual meeting in March. The changes are understood to be among the main factors behind the decision of the four directors to enter into negotiations on the terms and conditions of their early departure. They are expected to agree soon that they will go during this financial year, which ends in September 1994. Some of the directors have not only been paid big salaries - up to Pounds 400,000 - but are already taking their pensions. Their payoffs are expected to be generous.</p>

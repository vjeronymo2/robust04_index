			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Smith &amp; Nephew Smith &amp; Nephew has grown used to revealing indifferent quarterly figures of late, so the mere 5 per cent rise in earnings yesterday was no surprise. But the decision to abandon quarterly reporting suggests the contrast with the days when it could show regular earnings growth of 20 per cent has been more painful than the market realised. While UK companies in general are shuffling gradually towards more disclosure, Smith is taking a retrograde and slightly worrying step. The company argues that in future it will be less restricted by regular closed periods and can thus be more forthcoming to its institutional investors. But in its good times, Smith's management offended investor etiquette by its penchant for secrecy. Its latest report and accounts further reduce the group's level of disclosure by lumping profits into two divisions where once there were four. Yesterday's bald statement by the chairman positively discouraged questions from outsiders. The impression is of a management suspicious of and uncomfortable with external scrutiny. Whatever one thinks of the gradual improvement in the group's businesses, its shares deserve to be treated with matching suspicion until such a worry is dispelled.</p>

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / People: Chisholm stays the course - Names in the News Out-bellowing the pugnacious former editor of The Sun newspaper takes practice. The harsh world of Australian commercial television is obviously not a bad place to start, writes Katharine Campbell. For that is the background of Sam Chisholm, the straight-talking chief executive of BSkyB, and the man to whom Kelvin MacKenzie reported for the seven short months he passed in the world of TV before he stormed out last week. A diminutive New Zealander, whose energy levels belie his 54 years, Chisholm has become one of the most trusted lieutenants of BSkyB's largest shareholder Rupert Murdoch. He is abrasive, he is cunning - and he shuns the press almost obsessively. Brought up in Auckland, Chisholm left school to work on the family farm. Via a spell peddling floor polish, he arrived, aged 25, at Australia's largest commercial TV station, Channel Nine. Initially selling air space, he rose to the top, and ran the network for 15 years. For the bulk of Chisholm's time, his master was Kerry Packer, whose father Sir Frank had founded the station in 1956. With a mix of heavily American-influenced sport, news, and games shows, the channel flourished under Chisholm's baton, so much so that in 1987 Packer was able to wring more than ADollars 1bn from Alan Bond for its sale. Just three years later, Packer was back at the helm, having paid the hard-pressed Bond a mere ADollars 200m. But Chisholm was by now too closely identified with high-rolling times at what had become known as the Bollinger channel. Shortly after the resale, a third Australian media mogul walked into Chisholm's path, and he accepted an offer from Murdoch to run Sky. Moving to London in the autumn of 1990, Chisholm was by November in charge of the merged BSkyB - a consortium in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake - and embarking on what at the time seemed the hopeless task of reversing the ailing fortunes of the satellite broadcaster. His perseverance was rewarded last December with a seat on the board of News Corporation, and responsibility for the company's broadcasting interests outside the US. With MacKenzie installed as managing director shortly thereafter, Chisholm had been expected to distance himself from the daily management issues in London. But while he spent a proportion of his time this year in Hong Kong with Murdoch's newly acquired Star TV, that shift had yet to take place.</p>

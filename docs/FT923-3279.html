			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Lloyd's agency is bought by rival RHM OUTHWAITE, the Lloyd's underwriting agency that agreed to a Pounds 116m settlement to its members in February after they sued it for negligence, came to the end of an era yesterday with the announcement of its sale to Barder and Marsh, another Lloyd's agency, Andrew Jack writes. An official said Mr Outhwaite's 'personal support in the market was not sufficient to sustain an independent on-going business'. The sale includes Lloyd's syndicates 317, 1047 and 1081 for the 1993 and later years of account, as well as the Outhwaite Members' Agency. The present chief executive will not move with the business. Mr Outhwaite will continue to administer the run-off of the existing underwriting years that have not yet been closed, which are 1982 and 1990 to 1992.</p>

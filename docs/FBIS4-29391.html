			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yosahiko Sakurai, Tokyo Securities Department </F> reporter: "Consolidating Licenses for Investment, Investment  Trust Fund Advisers"]    [Text] "A `cost barrier' exists in the Japanese investment  trust market," or "the barriers are too high," are criticisms  made by several major U.S. financial institutions as a result of  studies conducted on the feasibility of participating in  Japanese investment trust markets. There are no obvious  regulations which restrict the entry of foreign investment  advisory firms, but they say that the high costs associated with  entering the market impede their participation.    U.S. investment advisory firms operating in Japan have  compiled a confidential report entitled, "Outlook for  Deregulation of Investment Management Services in Japan." The  report suggests, "U.S. investment advisers licensed to provide  discretionary investment advisory services should be allowed to  expand into the management of pension funds, investment trusts,  and other assets which are amenable to management as  investments," specifically calling for a single license to cover  investment advisory functions, discretionary accounts  management, and investment trust management services.    Under the existing Japanese regulations, a U.S. investment  advisory firm wishing to engage in investment trust services  must apply for a separate investment trust license from the MOF  and operate the activity as a separate subsidiary. Once the firm  has been licensed, it must establish a separate office with  independent staffing, equipment and office space which doubles  its expenditures.    According to a U.S. investment advisory firm, "investment  advisory services and investment trust services are mutually  complementary," and the Japanese system of requiring separate  licenses can only be considered "excessive protection of the  domestic investment trust industry." They are especially  distressed about this because "U.S. investment advisory firms in  Japan are actually operating at a loss." Another reason the  U.S. side is taking a firm stand on this matter is that Japanese  investment advisory firms operating in the United States are  free to provide investment trust services.    The U.S. side has lost patience with the formidable Japanese  market barriers and has recently formed a government-private  sector task force to fortify its market-opening demands. A  typical example of such efforts is the "Investment Management  Subcommittee" of the ACCJ. The subcommittee maintains close  contact with the U.S. government by holding regularly scheduled  monthly meetings with financial authorities at the U.S. embassy  in Japan to discuss the closed nature of Japanese financial  markets.    Actually, among the informal requests made by the U.S.  Government in the area of investment trust deregulation, two  items 1) mutuality of investment advisory services and  investment trust services and 2) freedom for investment advisory  firms to manage all classes of pension fund assets, have been  discussed at the regularly scheduled meetings of the  subcommittee and the U.S. embassy. Mr. Donald J. Mulvihill [as  transliterated] of Goldman Sachs Asset Management Japan, who  serves as chairman of the subcommittee, stresses the need to  work as a "team" with the U.S. Government in saying, "Even if we  seek deregulation separately, the MOF lacks the willingness to  entertain our requests."    The Japanese have begun to act on the reform of investment  trust markets in response to U.S. demands. On 22 June [1994],  the Investment Trust Research Council, a private research unit  of the MOF Securities Bureau's director general, will complete  its work covering this area. U.S. investment advisory services  will focus on the conclusions of this research council which had  been studying the fundamental reform of investment trust  services.    Sources in the administrative office's of MOF reveal that  the  draft of the report to be issued by the Investment Trust  Research Council is expected to present a dual position for and  against the issue of mutuality of investment advisory and  investment trust management services. However, aside from U.S.  investment advisory firms, the domestic banking industry has  also stepped up its demand for mutuality in connection with turf  battles within that industry. The U.S. is gaining confidence  that the mutuality issue will be resolved in its favor in view  of the "many allies within Japan itself."    The domestic investment trust industry assumes a  conservative  position and officially opposes the mutuality issue saying,  "Problems will arise if investment advisory services provided to  large investors and investment trust services involving a large  number of investors are combined." However, the true sentiment  of the industry was expressed by a major investment trust  contracting firm's president when he said, "We will not oppose  the mutuality concept if entry into the pension fund markets is  approved."    The basic policy of the MOF concerning investment trust  reform as expressed by the Securities Bureau is, "We hope to  revise obsolete legislation." Precisely because of this position  of the MOF, the view that "mutuality" will be an easy concession  to U.S. demands as long as Japanese domestic industry sources do  not pose major resistance is gaining prominence.</p>

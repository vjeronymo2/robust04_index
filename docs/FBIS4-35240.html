			<p>BFN     [Text] (J.T.) -- His Royal Highness Crown Prince Hasan said  Tuesday [24 May] that although making peace in the Middle East  has been arduous and fraught with dangers, "we appear to be over  the worst" in the search for a negotiated and comprehensive  settlement.    But the Crown Prince warned that much remains to be done if  the Arab-Israeli conflict is to be resolved to the satisfaction  of all parties.    "We are past the point when symbolic gestures, televised  worldwide, carry currency," the Crown Prince said in a lecture  he delivered at the London-based Royal United Services Institute  for Defence Studies (RUSI), a professional body founded in 1831  and dedicated to the study, analysis and debate of issues  affecting defence and international security.    "We have arrived at the point when the substance of peace  must be negotiated in detail; when the foundations of a new  Middle Eastern order must be laid, block by block."    "In a world that is still seeking a new rationale and order  for itself after the end of the cold war, the search for peace  in the Middle East assumes great symbolic and practical  importance," the Crown Prince told the audience, which included  the Duke of Kent, patron of RUSI, as well as members and other  invited guests comprising politicians, government and military  officials, members of parliament, academicians and  representatives of the British, Arabic and international media  in London.    But "peace cannot be piecemeal," the Crown Prince said. "It  must be comprehensive, and it must be just, if it is to be  lasting. All must be given the chance, and the tools, to play  their part in building a new Middle Eastern order."    "Jordan signed a common agenda for peace talks with Israel  last year," the Crown prince said. "The common agenda  represents a significant achievement, but it is no more than a  first step on the road to peace. There is still much to be  achieved, and much to be negotiated, before the attainment of a  comprehensive peace. Jordan is prepared to enter a peace treaty  with Israel, once the issues listed in the agenda have been  fully discussed and settled to the satisfaction of all. We seek  to strike a balance between the need to address the agenda items  on the one hand and the need to implement interim agreements and  arrangements to sustain the momentum of peace on the other."    After the lecture, Prince Hasan responded to questions  related to Arab intelligentsia and the media, anti-Semitism,  racial discrimination and extremism.    Voicing his rejection of all forms of anti-Semitism and  extremism, the Prince called for solutions to humanitarian  issues through agreements by the followers of the three  monotheistic religions in a spirit of equality and co-existence.    Following is the full text of the lecture which was entitled  "Making Peace in the Middle East":    It is an honour and a pleasure to address the Royal United  Services Institute on the complex topic of "Making Peace in the  Middle East." Many of you are familiar with the study and  logistics of warfare as well as the politics of making peace. I  am in a position to assure you that the later is far more  difficult to achieve. It is simple to wage war but it is not so  easy to conclude a just and lasting peace. Our experience in  the Middle East has shown that making peace is constantly  fraught with hidden dangers. The search for peace in the region  has been arduous and at times intractable. I am pleased to  state that we appear to be over the worst.    I have come before you today to speak of Jordan's quest for  peace. I will speak of peace in the Middle East, for that is my  region and my history. But what I say of my region holds true  for other regions, other situations. The Middle East is  strategically located at the cross-roads of the world. In a  world that is still seeking a new rationale and order for itself  after the end of the cold war, the search for peace in the  Middle East assumes great symbolic and practical importance.  For if the peoples of my region can find the will and the  courage to live together, then surely no conflict is insoluble.    The events of the past year have opened the door to peace  in the Middle East. The mutual recognition of the Palestine  Liberation Organisation) PLO and Israel gave the region an  unprecedented opportunity to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict,  a conflict that has taken its toll on us all. The recent  implementation of their historic agreement over Gaza and Jericho  is another step in the right direction. But we must be under no  illusions about the difficulty of our task. Future war must be  made inconceivable, the wounds that have kept Arab and Israeli  apart must somehow be healed.    There is a tendency in the news media to focus on the most  recent and dramatic developments in discussing the Middle East.  For many of you, the massacre of Muslim worshipers that took  place in Hebron earlier this year may be yesterday's news. But  for those who live in the occupied territories, for those who  have for generations lived and died with this conflict, it is  still a matter of grave concern. It highlights the need, above  all, for individuals on the ground to participate in the process  of peace-making and confidence- building. Much remains to be  done if the conflict is to be resolved. We are past the point  when symbolic gestures, televised world-wide, carry currency.  We have arrived at the point when the substance of peace must  be negotiated in detail; when the foundations of a new Middle  Eastern order must be laid, block by block. Concepts for fresh  patterns of inter and intra-regional relationships must be  thought out, so that they can be put in place to the benefit of  all. This is not the stuff of headlines. But this is the stuff  of which true peace is made.    Jordan has demonstrated its commitment to this kind of  peace-making time and again over the years. Though we were not  directly involved with the outbreak of hostilities, from the  early days of the U.N. Gunnar Jarring mission in 1967 to the  Madrid Conference in 1991, Jordan's approach to making peace has  been clear and consistence. We were the first country of the  region to advocate a negotiated settlement to the conflict.  Jordan played an active role in formulating United Nations  Security Council Resolution 242, which calls for an end to the  conflict and the exchange of land for peace. Jordan has  consistently supported the U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338 as the  basis for peace in the Middle East. We promoted the genesis of  the Madrid peace process, and enabled the Palestinians to assume  their proper role, firstly by disengaging from the West Bank,  and then by providing an umbrella for Palestinian negotiators to  participate in the bilateral and multilateral negotiations.    Jordan signed a common agenda for peace talks with Israel  last year. The common agenda represents a significant  achievement, but it is no more than a first step on the road to  peace. There is still much to be achieved, and much to be  negotiated, before the attainment of a comprehensive peace.  Jordan is prepared to enter a peace treaty with Israel, once  the issues listed in the agenda have been fully discussed and  settled to the satisfaction of all. We seek to strike a balance  between the need to address the agenda items on the one hand,  and the need to implement interim agreements and arrangements to  sustain the momentum of peace on the other. Foremost among the  outstanding issues are the questions of boundaries, refugees,  security and water.    These issues are of the essence in the making of peace. We  feel that there is a desperate need for a mechanism to effect  the delineation and demarcation of our boundaries. It will be  extremely difficult to make arrangements in other fields before  the issues of borders and security are resolved. What sense can  it make to speak of Jordanian and Israeli interests and concerns  when neither "Jordan" nor "Israel" have been defined? The  question has direct relevance to the recent events in the  occupied territories and in Israel. Within the security  framework, the problem of Israeli settlements must be resolved.  Their questionable legality notwithstanding, the settlements  represent a time-bomb which may be primed whenever a group of  settlers, or any other organisations opposed to peace-making,  wish to derail the peace process. Peace cannot be made and  should not be made under such circumstances.    We have submitted several proposals to deal with such  issues, and stand ready to undertake project studies in these  fields. We believe that a Boundary Commission will help to  resolve the issue of boundaries, and we have put forward this  proposal as a concrete contribution to the architecture of a  lasting regional peace. On the issue of refugees, we are  negotiating within the parameters of international law.    Another issue that will demand considerable attention is the  final status of the holy city of Jerusalem. A city revered for  its shrines and its history by Muslims, Christians and Jews  alike must be the ultimate symbol of peace. It is our belief  that the religious significance of Jerusalem is such that its  status is a truly international concern. It cannot be settled  by Israelis and Palestinians alone, for the holy city should not  be subject to the exclusive political control of any state. In  determining the future of Jerusalem, Jordan believes that a  vital distinction needs to be made between religious and  political sovereignty. We have formulated detailed proposals to  effect such a distinction, for we believe that a proper  resolution to the Jerusalem question is essential in the search  for peace.    We have also implemented several substantial confidence  building measures. We have re-opened Jordanian bank branches in  the occupied territories, in order to assist in the development  of the Palestinian economy. To the same end, we have signed an  economic cooperation agreement with the Palestinians, and  participated in the training of Palestinian police officers. We  have established the Trilateral Working Group to look at issues  of interest to Jordan, the U.S. and Israel, and this group may  now be promoted to ministerial level. We are optimistic about  the prospects for a Middle East economic conference and for a  Jordan Rift Valley development concept, but are awaiting  positive developments in this field. We are, of course,  prepared to consider other mechanisms to build confidence  regionally.    While engaged in the substance of negotiation, Jordan has  been considering more long-term mechanisms to deal with the  legacies of the conflict in a reciprocal manner. We have  evolved a vision of a new regional order under-pinned by a  number of political and economic mechanisms that could help  render future conflict unthinkable.    Attention has been focused on practical measures to generate  a process for regional security and cooperation. The promotion  of sustainable modes of negotiation to resolve all outstanding  regional disputes is increasingly necessary when the ultimate  goal is a peaceful Middle East without barriers. An example  exists in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  (CSCE). While this organisation has faced its share of  criticism, particularly in dealing with conflicts such as that  in the former Yugoslavia, it has successfully articulated a code  of conduct for times of peace. This is precisely what the  Middle East requires. We in Jordan believe that this conceptual  framework can contribute to lasting peace in the region, and we  have accordingly long called for a Helsinki Process, a  conference on Security and Cooperation, for the Middle East  (CSCME).    It should be made clear that the CSC process is not  envisaged  as a substitute for the peace process, but as a natural  compliment to it, and one that can remain in place to the  benefit of all after the achievement of a negotiated peace. We  do not propose the wholesale adoption of a one-off blueprint,  but the adaptation of a flexible paradigm. We are entirely open  to alternatives, so long as they can provide us with what we  desperately need: neutral and low-key fora at which the common  and inter-connected challenges of security and cooperation can  be discussed in a global idiom.    Within the context of a regional security regime the size,  role and function of armed forces in the individual states of  the region are likely to undergo radical changes. The  transformation would be in favour of peace keeping. Jordan's  armed forces have led the way in this respect. Our personnel  are already serving in this capacity under the U.N. command as  far afield as Mozambique, Liberia and in former Yugoslavia.  More significantly, Israel's military superiority and the  organic bond established with the U.S. through the doubtful  syndrome of "arms for flexibility," or "hardware for software,"  which was devised by Henry Kissinger, would have to be  considered and reassessed under a regional security system.  Regional security must be so both in scope and substance. As  shared values and aims take root, the notion of favoritism will  become increasingly invidious and increasingly insupportable.    Clearly the region comprises a diverse collection of  peoples, who nevertheless share many historical experiences and  perspectives. The European Union has conceptually divided the  Middle East into three main areas: The Maghreb, the Mashreq and  Turkey. From Jordan's point of view, at the epicentre of the  region, the Middle East straddles and extends beyond the  frontiers of Europe and Asia. It is integrally tied to both  continents, with the Mediterranean serving as a link, rather  than a barrier. In the long term, the future of the Middle East  and that of Europe cannot be separated. In this ever more  inter-dependent world, the interests of our two regions are  increasingly at one. It would therefore be wise, in formulating  strategies for the future of the region, to consider the  European experience; for we in Jordan believe that the Middle  East can have no future unless it evolves a global vision,  backed up by subregional and regional instruments. The next step  would therefore be to consider which instruments would be  appropriate.    A free-trade zone across the Middle East, allowing for the  free movement of labour, goods, capital and services, would  represent a significant achievement to this end. Arrangements  for a Middle East Free Trade Agreement--a MEFTA along the lines  of EFTA or NAFTA-- would allow the region to play a more  creative role in the world economy. In aspiring to this goal,  it will be necessary to consider the freedom of movement of all  factors of production. In this context, a dialogue on the  rights of migrant labour must be a vital prerequisite; for the  existence of surplus labour in the north, and capital in the  south, immediately suggests a viable regional trade regime.    Of course, many outstanding issues must be resolved before  such a vision can be realised. Even under conditions of peace,  the disparity between the Israeli economy and those of the other  regional parties, particularly the core parties to the  Arab-Israeli conflict, demands appropriate measures to fashion a  balanced relationship in a graduated manner. The examples of  Spain and Portugal within the EU are worth considering in this  regard.    A GATT-EU approach may be the best way to deal with the  economic legacies of the conflict, and to put the region on a  viable, sustainable economic footing. Jordan believes that in  seeking to evolve a healthy trade and investment regime, the  experience of other countries--such as the Zone Franche  arrangements between Geneva and France--will be invaluable. The  European Commission has recently stressed the need for a common  regional vision as a basis for cooperation in the Middle East.  In a communication on this subject, it states:    "Partnership requires balanced economic development. If  cooperation is to succeed it is essential to reduce excessive  disparities in income levels between potential partners in the  region." It adds that:    "Cooperation should go in two directions: the pooling of  common capacities and the tackling of common  problems...implying, at some stage, freedom of movement for  goods, services, capital and labour."    It is clear, then, that international investment in  development projects which serve the region and its peoples is  the way forward. it is equally important that such projects be  founded upon sound concepts, and that they receive the support  of international financial institutions, governments and  multinational corporations alike. A basketing approach,  covering human cooperation, resource cooperation and security,  must be evolved. Peace requires an enduring structure that can  tackle the over-arching problems of the economies of the region:  disparities created by conflict, over-extended public sectors,  addiction to aid and oil revenues. An economic framework is  needed to deal with such problems.    Many other instruments could play a part in forging such a  framework. For example, regional bodies and charters are needed  to ensure equity in resources-related areas such as energy and  water; while incentives for local sustainable development  programmes can support policies that guarantee a future for all.  A regional debt sinking fund, and a bank for Middle East  reconstruction and development, will promote stable and open  financial practices, improving the chances for the region to  play a dynamic part in the world economy.    The concept of reconstruction is particularly vital. The  Arab-Israeli conflict has exacted a severe toll on the region.  With the promise of peace in the region, the international  community looks increasingly towards the occupied territories.  Jordan fully supports the effort to give the Palestinian people  the tools they need to realise their historic dreams. We will  do everything in our power to ensure the success of arrangements  for Palestinian interim self-government. But although the  Palestine question has always been the core of the Arab-Israeli  conflict, the entire region has suffered. Vast debt burdens  have been accumulated as a direct result of the conflict;  unimaginable demographic strains have been imposed on countries  with scarce resources. Peace, then, cannot be piecemeal. To  use those famous words, I put it to you that peace must be  comprehensive, and it must be just, if it is to be lasting. All  must be given the chance, and the tools, to play their part in  building a new Middle Eastern order.</p>

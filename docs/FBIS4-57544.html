			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] According to Teachers' College leaders, there  was 95 percent compliance with the national strike called for  today. The education minister acknowledged that there was a  massive mobilization of teachers, but asserted that the  government will not withdraw the education bill from Congress  that sparked off the conflict. [passage omitted]    Near midday, teachers organized themselves into four columns  at different points of the city to march together up to Diego de  Almagro Square. [passage omitted]    Some hours ago, Osvaldo Verdugo [Teachers' College Union  leader] showed satisfaction in releasing the final assessment of  the strike. Commenting on the total number of teachers who went  on strike today, both from municipal schools and from private  schools with government funding, he said:    [Begin Verdugo recording] We are talking about a nationwide  average of approximately 95 percent of Chilean teachers. [end  recording]    Verdugo stated categorically that the trade union he leads  will not draw up any new strategy until after the national  teachers' assembly to be held 25 May.    Given this state of affairs, at present, the solution to  this  conflict seems as elusive as the possibility of teachers and the  government talking the same language.</p>

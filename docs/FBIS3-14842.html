			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow February 26 TASS -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin has sent a letter to speaker of the Russian State Duma  Ivan Rybkin.    "I am very satisfied with the Duma intention to follow the  path of national reconciliation, civil peace and accord. I am  convinced this intention is sincere. This is what I call for in  my annual message that was passed over to you on February 24,  1994," says the document.    Recognizing and respecting constitutional powers of the  Duma,  including those related to the amnesty issues, Boris Yeltsin  noted that the formula used in the resolution is rather not an  amnesty but a pardon, which is a prerogative of the president.  He also thinks that the resolution did not fully develop the  practical side of the issue, insufficiently considered and  ensured political and social consequences of the decision.    "In this connection and aiming to consolidate the spirit of  constructive cooperation and accord, I suggest to:    1. Improve the resolution and bring it in full  correspondence with the Constitution and the Russian legislation.    2. Develop and adopt as a memorandum a system of criteria,  forms and mechanisms of responsibility of state institutions and  politicians for decisions whose consequences hamper our joint  policy towards national reconciliation, civil peace and accord.    I would be grateful if you consider it possible to do this  work together with presidential representatives," says the  letter.    Sources at the presidential press service told ITAR-TASS,  State Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin met presidential adviser Georgiy  Satarov today to discuss the implementation of measures  suggested by the Russian president in the letter to the Duma  speaker.</p>

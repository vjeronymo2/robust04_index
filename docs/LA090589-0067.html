			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PHYSICIANS' BIAS THWARTS AIDS PREVENTION  </P> <P> Because of recent major advances in AIDS prevention, physicians' involvement in  the epidemic is more critical than ever, yet it is not occurring. A major  barrier is prejudice. Reducing prejudice, or at least changing physician  behavior, is a challenge that the profession's leadership must take.  </P> <P> The physician's role in AIDS prevention today involves taking a sexual and  drug-use history from all patients and encouraging people with past or present  high-risk behavior to take the HIV antibody test. Those who test positive need  evaluation of their immune systems, and if impaired, will need AZT and possibly  other medications to prevent or delay disease. However, the initial step --  taking the patient's sexual and drug-use history -- is not being done. The  reason appears to be physician prejudice against homosexual/bisexual men and an  aversion to AIDS.  </P> <P> Physician bias against a wide range of patients has been known to the  profession's leadership for years and even documented, yet no major effort has  been made to change those attitudes. In a survey of physicians in Michigan and  Australia published in 1982, negative stereotypes were found about alcohol  abusers, unhygienic patients, angry patients, drug abusers, obese patients and  patients with minor mental disorders. The authors advised intervention during  medical school if the behaviors that flow from negative stereotypes are to be  changed. They did not address changing the behavior of physicians in private  practice.  </P> <P> A third-year medical student, Hannah Brooks, wrote in a medical honors society  journal in 1987, "Physicians also become angry with patients whose problems  they perceive (with or without justification) as being self-inflicted." This  is, of course, a major problem with AIDS, as well as other conditions.  </P> <P> Also published in 1987 was a study of medical students' attitudes toward AIDS  and homosexual patients. It showed that "medical students view AIDS patients in  a highly negative manner, as they do homosexual patients regardless of their  illness."  </P> <P> The authors said that developing ways to counter such attitudes "is a topic  that merits the attention of medical educators."  </P> <P> This year, the Assn. of American Medical Colleges recommended that faculty  members help medical students and residents understand and accept personal risk  in the practice of medicine, overcome their biases and prejudices and learn to  cope with the emotional demands of certain types of patient care. (They did not  indicate who would help change the attitudes of faculty members.)  </P> <P> Because physicians are people first, they have the same prejudices as any other  group; ours is a racist, sexist, ageist, homophobic society. We may not be able  to dramatically change that. But when biases threaten peoples' lives -- and  they do when physicians shun AIDS prevention -- then medical leaders must  address the issue. This has not yet happened.  </P> <P> Prejudice can cause harm, directly or indirectly; it influences what a  physician does or, just as important, does not do. Numerous medical  organizations have advised physicians that they have an obligation to AIDS  prevention that starts with including sexual behavior and drug use in taking a  patient's history. Yet in a poll reported at the fifth International AIDS  Conference this summer, less than 4% of the respondents had discussed sexual  behavior related to AIDS with their physicians; most said they wanted such a  discussion but were waiting for the physician to initiate it.  </P> <P> So how can this change? There are no easy answers. But first the medical  profession's leaders must acknowledge that there is a problem. While they have  little leverage over individual physicians, they can take realistic steps  toward improving the medical community's awareness and engaging its  cooperation.  </P> <P> For an example of what this can achieve, the experience of San Francisco in the  early 1980s is persuasive: Through a concerted educational program on the  hazards of AIDS, virtually all of the gay male community changed its concept of  acceptable sexual behavior.  </P> <P> Countless people would benefit if physicians would change the attitude they  have toward many diseases, so that, in the case of AIDS, for example, taking a  drug use and sexual history is as common as a blood-pressure check.  </P> <P> The Hippocratic Oath requires that physicians "exercise (their) art . . . for  the prevention of disease." People -- all people, not just those at risk for  AIDS -- have the right to expect that this oath is being observed for the sake  of public health -- the health of all.  </P></p>

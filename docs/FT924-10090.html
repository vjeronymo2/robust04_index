			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / International Company News: Winterthur optimistic on full-year result WINTERTHUR Insurance, Switzerland's third largest insurance company, said it was cautiously optimistic about its results for 1992, thanks to positive growth in direct insurance operations in its main markets and substantial gains on shares up to the end of October. Mr Peter Spaelti, chief executive, said at a press conference in Winterthur that premium growth in local currencies should be about 10 per cent compared with 14.2 per cent in 1991.

In 1991, Winterthur had a consolidated net profit of SFr262.9m (Dollars 190.7m).</p>

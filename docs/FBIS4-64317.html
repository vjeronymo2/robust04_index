			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Petros Evthimiou] </F>   [Text] A major shake-up of the cabinet in the immediate  future is unlikely, according to sources close to Prime Minister  Andreas Papandreou, who added that the prime minister's  intention was merely to fill two vacant posts--one at the  National Economy Ministry, left empty by the death of Yeoryios  Yennimatas on Monday [25 April], and a second at the Interior  Ministry following the expected reelection of the current  minister, Akis Tsokhatzopoulos, as the ruling party's secretary.    The sources said a broader reshuffle would not likely take  place until after the European Parliament elections in mid-June  and Greece hands over the rotating, six-month European Union  presidency to Germany. A reshuffle would be aimed at boosting  some aspects of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement's [PASOK]  policies which, while not considered failures, have not  proceeded at the requisite pace for PASOK's broad reform  programme.    But other analysts say new amendments to the party's charter  adopted at this month's PASOK congress which stipulate which  nine Executive Committee members may and which nine may not  simultaneously hold cabinet posts, could precipitate a reshuffle  before the June elections. They add that while this could in  some respects hamper the final month of the Greek EU presidency  it could on the other hand accelerate implementation of the  government's programmes.</p>

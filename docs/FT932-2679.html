			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'End of an era' in sugar market THE DEMISE of central buying agencies for raw sugar in the former Soviet Union and China has ended the era of large-scale bulk raw sugar prices, according to the June sugar market report from ED &amp; F. Man, the London trading house. This change in the nature of the market goes some way towards explaining why news of the smallest Cuban sugar harvest for 30 years - 4.2m tonnes - failed to boost world prices. 'In both China and Russia imports have, by and large, been decentralised. The resulting trend towards disparate purchases is not conducive to speculative hype,' says the report. In addition, changing trade policies and depreciating currencies in eastern Europe had left the market guessing about import quantities. Consumption was also difficult to estimate for a large majority of the developing countries with sensitive incomes. Man described the fall in the Cuban harvest from 7m tonnes last year as 'a major blow' to the country's sugar industry. While the extent of any recovery next year was difficult to gauge, the certainty of continuing economic problems and a potentially lower cane yield did not bode well.</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Tories still split over defence cuts THE GOVERNMENT faces continuing pressure from Tory back benchers over defence cuts, in spite of the Treasury's agreement to scale back the spending reductions planned for the next financial year. The settlement between the Treasury and the Ministry of Defence is thought to involve cuts of more than Pounds 1bn over three years, with the biggest impact on spending in 1996-97. The Pounds 23.75bn provision for defence expenditure next year is expected to be cut by 1 per cent or less after Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, succeeded in fighting off more drastic Treasury demands. Although the front-line strength of the armed forces appears to have been safeguarded, Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Conservative chairman of the all-party Commons defence committee, said yesterday that he would seek assurances that important equipment plans were not being sacrificed. He indicated that he would strongly oppose the cancellation of projects such as new ships to replace the two amphibious assault vessels used for Royal Marine landings. Some of the MPs also want the Treasury to allow new defence contracts to come through. On Monday, several Conservative MPs met Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to raise concerns about how the unified Budget might affect defence spending. The chancellor did not reveal details of the defence-sector budget at the meeting, but some of the MPs were concerned that he did not give long-term guarantees for any military sector. The Commons defence committee will be able to question Mr Rifkind about the MoD's plans on the morning after the November 30 Budget statement. Sir Nicholas said: 'We will have to look very closely at where the savings will come from.' He added that there was room for 'substantial' savings through reducing the number of civil servants in the MoD.</p>

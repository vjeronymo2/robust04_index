			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report US investment fund liquidation added to downward pressure in the GOLD market yesterday and the metal's price closed in London at Dollars 375.25 a troy ounce, down Dollars 3.95 on the day, wiping out what remained of Monday's rally. The price was still supported at Dollars 374 and then at Dollars 372, one dealer said, but it was highly unstable in an atmosphere of 'aftershock' following last week's major price 'correction'. At the London Metal Exchange a rally in the three months COPPER price met resistance above Dollars 1,900 a tonne and the price closed at Dollars 1,892.50, up Dollars 5 from the level reached in after hours trading on Tuesday. Dealers said the market continued to derive support from nearby technical tightness. At the London Commodity Exchange robusta COFFEE futures closed with losses of up to Dollars 19 a tonne but held up comparatively well in view of the steep decline in US prices, dealers said. Heavy speculative selling caused 'complete meltdown' with the New York September position 5.65 cents lower at 69.30 cents a lb in early trading, they said, but concern about short-term tightness limited losses in the London market.

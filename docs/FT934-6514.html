			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: Mexican textile group acquires Kayser-Roth Grupo Synkro, the leading Mexican leg-wear company, and its principal investors, have agreed to buy the US tights maker Kayser-Roth for Dollars 233m, making the new group the world's second largest producer of hosiery. The transaction is believed to be the third largest Mexican purchase of a US company, following Vitro's acquisition of Anchor Glass in 1989, and Mr Carlos Cabal Peniche's takeover of Del Monte Fresh Produce last year. It marks a drive by leading Mexican companies to expand abroad as they grow out of their own markets, and face increasingly intense global competition. The transaction, which would have gone ahead without the North American Free Trade Agreement, is expected to benefit from reduction of tariffs and increased flow of trade generated by the pact. Synkro is Latin America's leading hosiery company, with expected sales this year of about Dollars 200m. It has more than 50 per cent market share in Mexico, and about 10 per cent in Argentina, where it owns a manufacturer and distributor of tights. Mr Bernie Jacob, vice-president of Chase Manhattan, which advised on the transaction, said the company was looking for other acquisitions. Kayser-Roth has annual sales of about Dollars 400m and is owned by Collins &amp; Aikman Group. Synkro said they would keep the same management, and would not export jobs to Mexico, only Kayser-Roth's brand names.</p>

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Management (Health Check): Tackling the types who take stress to heart - Dr Michael McGannon looks at new research into coronary disease Since the 1960s, attempts have been made to define certain personality characteristics that make some people more prone to coronary heart disease than others. 'Type A' people, as opposed to their more laid-back 'Type B' counterparts, have been described as the sort of people who are always in a hurry, are inordinately impatient, aggressive or even hostile, speak in an explosive way, and are goal-oriented, competitive and driven. Over the years there has been no clear verdict on whether Type A personality can be categorised as an independent risk factor for heart disease. However, new research is shedding light on this complicated issue. Two characteristics of Type A behaviour which may well lead to heart disease, and which have also been linked to suppressed immune function and cancer deaths, have been isolated by US researchers. They are: hostility - antagonism as a form of severe competitiveness - and time urgency - 'never enough hours in a day'. These two traits are interrelated: to a person who has a sense of needing to compress more and more activity into a shrinking day, anyone or anything blocking that process will cause irritation and may provoke a hostile reaction. The human nervous system evolved during more primitive times when the main threats to survival were physical. When faced with stress, the body's systems, therefore, are geared to an appropriate physical response. The nervous, cardiovascular and hormonal systems prepare the body either for flight or a fight. For example, blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rates all rise, increasing oxygen demands by the heart; muscle tension increases in preparation for a flight to safety, or a fight; and sweating increases as a cooling mechanism. In a modern context, there is usually no physical resolution to this stress. Moreover, at the moment when the mind and body scream for simple things such as oxygen and water, modern managers inappropriately respond with cigarettes, which decrease the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, or immoderate alcohol, which can depress lucidity, raise blood pressure and force the body to lose precious water. A personal strategy for coping with stress should include: Broadening your definition of success to include self-preservation. This first step, already adopted by younger managers on the rise, is taken not just for your own career but also for your family and friends. Do not exchange precious years of your life, your marriage or your health for a perceived need for professional control. Ask yourself of every stressful situation: 'Is it really worth getting sick for?' Listening carefully to your body and mind. Start to decipher individual signs and symptoms, not as something to escape or anaesthetise, but as valuable warning of a potentially serious underlying problem. Watch for high blood pressure, chronic fatigue, nervous eating or drinking, sleeplessness, peptic ulcers, tension headaches, obesity and depression. Managing your time intelligently. Start by living in the real world and planning accordingly. Plan breaks into your daily agenda - even five minutes to take a breath of fresh air and re-evaluate - and make daily checklists. Finish what you have on your plate before loading more on. Planning some physical exercise in your daily life. Walk for 10 minutes after lunch and dinner. This will help periodically to decompress an otherwise chronically compressed cardiovascular system. If you need a structured exercise programme, consider joining a health club near your office. Not making your reaction to stress more dangerous to your life than the stress itself. There are healthy ways to detach yourself from the stresses that threaten your quality of life: for example, talking things over with your spouse, a health professional or a member of the clergy, deep breathing and yoga, meditation and prayer, going to see a film, humour, massage, delegating, taking a holiday, engaging in physical activity, decreasing the use of coffee and alcohol or going fishing.

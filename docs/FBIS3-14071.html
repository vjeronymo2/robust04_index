This will be added to a large  record containing scores and even hundreds of resolutions that  tell the history of the Palestine question, the most tragic  event in human history, in which right and injustice fiercely  conflict with each other. Right has nothing except shouts of  justice and legitimacy, while injustice has a sword and the  ability to kill and can create a river of blood and tears and a  lot of agony. The massacre that occurred at the holy  al-Ibrahimi Mosque is not the first and it will not be the last.    At last, the resolution, which consists of a preamble and  five clauses, was issued. During its lengthy and difficult  delivery, many things happened, foremost of which is the  continued killing of Palestinians, not only at the hands of the  settlers, but also at the hands of the Israeli Army forces  themselves. This added to the atmosphere of procrastination,  pressure, and threat the United States is exercising in its  capacity as the leader of the world and the major sponsor of the  peace process.    As a result, the United States refused to vote on two very  important clauses. The first clause is mentioned in the  preamble. It stipulates the need to provide protection for our  Palestinian people. The second clause stipulates Israeli  withdrawal from the territories Israel occupied in June 1979,  including Jerusalem.    O brothers, the refusal of the United States to vote on  these  two clauses has serious implications, foremost of which is the  U.S. retreat from its previous positions, decisions, and  assurances regarding the Palestine question and the core of the  conflict. It is a retreat from the issue of land, which is the  subject of the conflict and from the Palestinian people's  security that is the main element in this conflict.    Taking the Israeli viewpoint, it becomes clear that Israel  is trying to tell us: We slaughter you. We protect you. You  have no choice. As for the U.S. viewpoint, which is identical  to this, it is telling us: You have negotiations ahead of you.  Everything is decided at the negotiating table, even your life  itself.    This is the most heinous form of injustice. It is the  quarrelsomeness of the idiot force that leaves no room for  right. It is a flagrant injustice that tells us: See you at the  next massacre.    In this terrible context, the Palestine question, also known  as the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Middle East issue, will  continue to be watered with its own blood and fed from its great  pain, and to glow above and beneath ashes as a result of this  blatant injustice, overall despair, and this full bias in  accordance with which the United States moves to protect the  Israeli killer from the efforts he exerted in killing the  Palestinian victim. God is great, the earth was shaken, and the  heavens moved as a result of this grave injustice, the tyranny  of force, and the murder of peace on the land of peace.    However, brothers, we know injustice is the spark of every  revolution, the tyranny of force is the beginning of every  explosion, and the disdain of the blood of innocent people is  the curse no one will escape. And soon will the unjust  assailants know what vicissitudes their affairs will take.  [Koranic verse]    We go back to politics and say: Will UN Security Council  Resolution No. 904 be turned into tangible and concrete  measures? Will the settlers leave Hebron? Will the criminal  settlers be disarmed? Will the vanguards of the UN protection  force arrive in the Palestinian land? This is an urgent time  for these questions, especially since the U.S. Administration  did not approve the passing of the UN Security Council  resolution on the massacre until after it obtained assurances  from the Arab cordon states to resume the negotiations in April.  This requires a maximum degree of Arab awareness, caution, and  coordination, which we hope will be achieved during the meeting  the Arab cordon states will hold soon on the foreign ministers'  level.    Brothers, still, we should say that every Palestinian wound,  regardless of how painful it is, can be endured by our great  struggler people if this wound illuminates our nation's  conscience, and gives it a new incentive to rise above its  internal differences, wounds, and transient contradictions. We  wholeheartedly hope that all this will be achieved because the  alternative is the recurrence of the tragedy. The nation that  disdains its people's blood encourages others to disdain it. It  is a revolution until victory!</p>

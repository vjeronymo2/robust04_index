			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RELIGIOUS, CIVIC LEADERS RECALL MANNING;  </P> <P> 'SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAS LOST A . . . FRIEND'  </P> <P> Southern California religious and political leaders Friday remembered Cardinal  Timothy Manning as a man of quiet, persuasive spirituality who influenced those  he met with warmth.  </P> <P> Rabbi Alfred Wolf, director of the Skirball Institute of American Values and  rabbi emeritus of Wilshire Boulevard Temple, said:  </P> <P> "I mourn Cardinal Manning's death as a personal loss. The cardinal was a man of  great learning and of deep faith. His love of people transcended denominational  divisions. He encouraged the open dialogue between faith groups -- especially  between Catholics and Jews -- which has become the hallmark of Los Angeles  religious life. All of Southern California has lost a good friend."  </P> <P> "He's one of the most impressive people I've ever met," said James N. Loughran,  president of Loyola Marymount University. "Without being dynamic or  charismatic, he was just so impressive for his intelligence, his wisdom, his  deep understanding of the Gospel."  </P> <P> Loughran recalled the time Manning used a typically low-key approach in dealing  with complaints that had come to him about rock 'n' roll lyrics being played by  students on the campus radio station.  </P> <P> "Next time we were together, he said, 'What's going on the radio station?' He  understood what it is to run a college, and you're going to have those things,  and you're going to deal with them one way or another. He wasn't particularly  bothered by that."  </P> <P> Manning communicated the same warmth to secular society.  </P> <P> "He was a strong force for good government," county Supervisor Kenneth Hahn  said.  </P> <P> Hahn said he had conferred with Manning on secular matters during his years as  a supervisor and Los Angeles city councilman but also came to know him as a  personal friend.  </P> <P> "He visited me in the hospital when I was sick," Hahn said. "He introduced me  to Pope John Paul as a friend: 'Here's my friend Kenneth.' That said it all.  I'm so sorry to hear about his passing."  </P> <P> Former President Ronald Reagan eulogized Manning as a man who "enriched the  lives of thousands who are better because of his good work."  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley ordered flags at city buildings flown at half-staff in honor  of Manning.  </P> <P> "Cardinal Manning eased the turmoil and transition from pre- to post-Vatican  Council times for Catholics in the Los Angeles area," Bradley said. "He helped  them through a most difficult period, and for that he will be remembered."  </P></p>

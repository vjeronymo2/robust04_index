			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By YOMIURI SHIMBUN correspondent Masaichi Nosaka] </F>   [Text] Washington, 7 Jan -- Bowman Cutter, special  assistant to the U.S. President for economic affairs, granted an  exclusive interview to YOMIURI SHIMBUN on 6 June and commented  on the current situation of the Japan-U.S. comprehensive trade  talks, which are experiencing difficulties, saying: "We are  pessimistic about the Japan-U.S. summit talks, slated to be held  on 11 February, as to whether they will produce good results.  We cannot have a Japan-U.S. summit that is satisfactory to us  unless the Hosokawa administration works not only on the  political reform but also on the economic issues as well." It  is the first time for a senior White House official to explain  severe prospects of the summit talks, which will be held about  one month later.    Clearly denying the establishment of target figures in the  microeconomy, against which Japan is keeping guard at the  comprehensive trade talks, Cutter criticized Japan's negotiation  stance, saying: "There is no such thing as target figures. The  United States is asking for introduction of a standard which  will be used to evaluate (expansion of market access)."  Regarding reduction of Japan's trade surplus, on the other  hand, Cutter pointed out: "Japan should aim to reduce it to a  little less than 2 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP).  We do not understand why it does not disclose its guideline."  In this way, he explained his view that the Hosokawa  administration should voluntarily disclose its trade surplus  reduction plan. His comments indirectly explained his intention  to produce some results at the framework talks by striking an  agreement in the area of macro economy to find a way out of  discussions, which are coming to a deadlock in the area of macro  economy.    Regarding Japan's additional economic measures, Cutter said  that "income tax reduction is the only way." At the same time,  he doubted the effect of a package plan designed to reduce  income tax and increase the consumption tax rate at the same  time. He called for a large-scale tax reduction, saying that it  should be reduced at "a scale that is large enough to promote  economic growth."    On construction talks, he said: "There is a possibility of  imposing sanctions against Japan. However, it is not desirable  to do that." Regarding the issue of foreign semiconductor  makers' market share in Japan, which dropped to below 20  percent, Cutter criticized Japan which refuses to accept the  USTR's call for holding emergency consultative talks.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Foreign Ministry noted an article published  recently in [name indistinct] a Russian newspaper titled "Russia  Has Become a Testing Site for Exotic Spies." It contains a  reference to a statement made by Baturin, assistant to the  Russian president on national security, who doubted the ability  of our republic to control its borders properly with China. The  Foreign Ministry press service is obligated to inform relevant  parties that in accordance with the information given by  reliable sources, illegal attempts to cross the border are not  numerous. Transgressors are usually always detained. As far as  border control is concerned, a visa agreement on traveling  between Kazakhstan and China, which envisages the need for  exit-entry visas for trips by citizens of both Kazakhstan and  China, was concluded. Such conclusions on the ability of an  independent country to defend its borders should be based on  facts, the more so because the Republic's relevant services  exchange border information on a regular basis with the  leadership of the Russian border troops.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, June 28 (XINHUA) -- Taiwan investment in  east China's Zhejiang Province has entered a new era to form  group enterprises and go in for long-term investment.    Up to March this year, total investment in Zhejiang has  topped 3.3 billion U.S. dollars, including contracted investment  of 2.4 billion U.S. dollars from Taiwan.    First, the number of huge projects invested in is  increasing.  Among the 1,722 Taiwan investment projects, there are 34  projects with an investment of over 10 million U.S. dollars  each. Although the number is quite small, their invested funds  account for two-thirds of all Taiwan investment.    Second, the investment field has been enlarged. Taiwan first  invested in Zhejiang in such areas as beverage production,  restaurants and clothing. Now, Taiwan investments have expanded  to energy, transportation, petrochemicals, machinery, textiles  and construction materials. And more and more  technology-intensive and even high-tech industrial enterprises  are emerging.    Third, long-term investment is growing. Many Taiwan  businessman pay attention to intensive investment within  professions, coordination between professions and development of  series of products. The recently established Far-East Toy  Industrial City and Taiwan Machinery Industrial City are good  examples.    Zhejiang has advantages in attracting overseas investment. A  Taiwan investor said, "I chose to invest in Zhejiang for its  social stability and good basic infrastructure."</p>

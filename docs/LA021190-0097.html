			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORE THAN MUSIC  </P> <P> I enjoyed John G. Zawadzinski's article of Jan. 28 on Mieczyslaw Horszowski  (and attended his Jan. 31 recital at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion). However,  Mr. Zawadzinski incorrectly identifies the Juilliard School as the Juilliard  School of Music.  </P> <P> The school dropped "of Music" from the name when drama and dance divisions were  added and the school moved to Lincoln Center.  </P> <P> BETH SUSSMAN  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

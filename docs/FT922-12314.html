			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Russian congress bows to CIS reality THE Russian congress, the Communist-dominated parliament that last week refused to recognise the Soviet collapse, yesterday acknowledged establishment of the Commonwealth of Independent States, AP reports from Moscow. On a vote of 548-158 the Congress of People's Deputies adopted a resolution affirming Russia's membership in the commonwealth, which was created last December. The vote was a victory for President Boris Yeltsin, who has encountered stiff opposition from lawmakers hostile to his market reforms, his sweeping powers and his efforts to co-operate with other former Soviet republics within the new commonwealth. In a largely symbolic protest vote on Friday, the congress refused to recognise the Soviet collapse or accept responsibility for fulfilling arms control and other treaties signed by the former Soviet government. Yesterday the lawmakers reversed themselves, accepting the commonwealth as a 'new legal and political form of voluntary union among sovereign states'. The decision by the Russian parliament is unlikely, however, to defuse tensions with other former Soviet republics. President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine yesterday raised the stakes in a territorial dispute with Russia by warning that a proposed referendum on Crimean independence could lead to tragedy and bloodshed, Reuter reports from Kiev. 'A referendum is the tragic path towards a schism in the Crimea. And what that schism would bring, what misfortunes it would cause for the people of the peninsula and others besides, no one may dare to predict,' Mr Kravchuk said. 'I should like to utter a serious warning: if the political process continues to develop in that direction, then there can be no guarantee that events in Crimea will not lurch out of control and that human blood will not be spilled.' The Black Sea peninsula of Crimea was handed from Russia to Ukraine in 1954 as a gift to mark 300 years of union between the two Slav neighbours. Since the breakup of the union last year some Russian parliamentarians have questioned the legality of the transfer, raising Ukrainian fears that Moscow could try to claim the territory back. Russian foreign minister Andrei Kozyrev rebuked conservatives in the Russian parliament last Saturday for raising territorial claims against Ukraine, saying these could disrupt international arms agreements. But he said Russia would take a hard line on the Crimea and other issues if Ukraine tried to leave the CIS. The pro-independence Republican Movement of Crimea (RDK) has gathered a petition with more than 246,000 signatures in an attempt to force a referendum on breaking away from Ukraine. The parliament of Crimea, whose 2.5m people are mostly ethnic Russians, is due to meet on May 5 to debate the holding of the referendum. Ukraine's parliament is empowered to ban the plebiscite if it judges it to violate the country's constitution. President Kravchuk said separation from Ukraine would spell economic disaster and damage the living standards of Crimeans. He said Ukraine favoured development of a free economic zone in Crimea and had allocated more than 4bn roubles this year to address problems of energy and water supply, ethnic relations and 'social defence' of the poor and pensioners.</p>

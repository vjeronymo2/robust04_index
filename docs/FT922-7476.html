			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Observer: Solid odds Then again, while the Germans and French are even less daring than the Brits in picking central bankers, they haven't done too badly. Jacques de Larosiere, ex-boss of the IMF and now Governor of the Banque de France, is an old finance ministry hand as are his two predecessors, Michel Camdessus and Renaud de la Geniere. Similarly, there have been only five presidents of the Bundesbank and they have generally worked their way up through the system. The present incumbent Helmut Schlesinger is a central bank veteran whose 40 years' service began when the institution even had a different name. Likewise, Otmar Emminger had been vice-president throughout Karl Klasen's term. Hans Tietmeyer, who arrived in 1990 from the finance ministry, may eventually get the top job.

Even Karl Klasen, a Deutsche Bank veteran, had also done a stint as president of the Hamburg regional central bank.</p>

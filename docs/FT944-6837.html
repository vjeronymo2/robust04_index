			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Media Futures: . . . but drivers face bumpy ride - Study highlights first skirmish in a UK multimedia war Traffic is beginning to build on the European information superhighway. Some vehicles are still experimental. The Unom project (Users, Network Operators and Manufacturers), for example. has Matra Ericsson Telecom as prime contractor, and aims to bring banking advice and facilities to customers through self-service kiosks. It is funded by the EU's advanced telecommunications research programme. Others are run-in and carrying passengers. In Denmark, Homevision, now three years old, is distributing multimedia information - text together with video pictures - about residential properties for sale over its network. In the UK, Wigwam Information is providing a similar service and has five trial sites, including an estate agency owned by the TSB high street bank. The criminal element has not been slow to take advantage of these services, however. In Sweden, video footage of the interior of a house sent over the network was used to plan a burglary. These examples of current developments on the information superhighway are used by Analysys, a Cambridge-based telecommunications consultancy, to underline its conviction that multimedia is here to stay, driven by growing demand for information and entertainment and the declining cost of computers and communications. In a new report it warns that existing players are in for a bumpy ride. In particular, it sees British Telecommunications' announcement earlier this month of market trials of video-on-demand, home shopping and banking over its existing network as the first skirmish in a UK multimedia war. The spoils for the winner will be considerable. According to Analysys: 'For the incumbent telecoms operators, this changing environment represents an opportunity to establish leadership in the new generation of fixed telecoms services that will succeed basic telephony. 'Domination of broadband provision in the local loop will be the key; the first operator to reach the home or small/medium-sized enterprise with affordable broadband access will be in an unassailable position for many years to come.' Broadband refers to the network capacity needed to transmit voice, text and video interactively over telecommunications lines. The local loop is the connection between a telephone subscriber's home and the telephone exchange. In Britain, BT is forbidden from broadcasting entertainment over its network under government rules that will not be reviewed until 2001. This is to give the fledgling cable companies the opportunity to establish themselves in the market place. However, cable companies are allowed to offer voice telephone services, and Analysys says that in the short term these services offer lower risk than multimedia: 'Demand is well established and equipment to support them is readily available at low cost.' It goes on to warn, however: 'Cable TV operators should neither ignore the long-term potential of multimedia, nor delay so long that they lose their current advantage.' Choosing the critical point at which to enter the conflict and what resources to employ will remain difficult questions for the big players. Despite a sharp decline in the cost of technology, building a network to support multimedia services still requires substantial investment. 'Network operators will need to be confident that there is scope for adequate returns,' Analysys says, pointing out that in business it may be difficult to justify investment in multimedia services qualitatively. 'A recent trial of internal video-conferencing for a financial institution in London found that away-from-desk time could be reduced by 60 per cent. But real gains in productivity are difficult to isolate from other factors influencing performance,' says Analysys. Residential users, on the other hand, may be prepared to pay for a broad range of services through basic subscriptions and additional premium payments for special services. Analysys argues that these charges are unlikely to meet the cost of providing the service and that part of the income for the network operator or service provider will have to come from savings in overheads. A retailer, for example, could make substantial savings by cutting down on retail premises and warehousing. Electronic payment for goods could eliminate much of the administration costs of traditional payment systems. Advertising is another potential source of revenue, although it is by no means clear how it might operate on the information superhighway. Subscribers might pay a premium for accepting material without advertising or receive a discount for accepting it. Analysys says the advent of multimedia services will bring fundamental reforms in long-distance telecoms tariffs for both residential and business customers, pointing out that existing costs would put, for example, video-on-demand well beyond the pocket of the average subscriber. It will also have profound consequences for the regulation of telecoms services throughout Europe. 'There is a great deal of ambiguity in existing regulatory frameworks which must be resolved quickly if early growth is to be encouraged ..Europe must create a uniform environment across different member states if it is to realise the full potential of networked multimedia,' says Analysys. There will be no room, in other words, for drivers on the wrong side of the superhighway.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] 'Allamah Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah has stated  that at this stage we must not preoccupy ourselves with talking  about the state's responsibility regarding the Israeli Army's  kidnapping of al-Hajj Mustafa al-Dirani, but we must think  quietly about how to respond.    In his Friday sermon, which he delivered at Imam al-Rida  Mosque in B'ir al-'Abd [southern suburb of Beirut], Fadlallah  said: Our brother al-Hajj Mustafa al-Dirani was kidnapped on  the night of 'Id al-Adha. When we study this issue, we find it  is a victory for Israel over all the various forces on the  ground. There were political, security, and military gaps. We  have discovered something about this country as far as the  mentality of the government. This government does not respect  its people. This government is not prepared to forgo its  comfort and look after the citizen's interests. [passage omitted]    We must think quietly how to respond. You know that the  resistance's arm is long. The enemy foreign minister said that  Israel's arm is long. When Israel assassinated Sayyid 'Abbas  al- Musawi, the strugglers taught him that their arm reached  Israel in Argentina. The battle is as big as the world and as  long as the length of time. We will work with all  responsibility as Muslim strugglers all over the world.    Fadlallah said that Israel did not only kidnap al-Dirani, it  also kidnapped every Lebanese citizen. It kidnapped the state,  the government, and the people.</p>

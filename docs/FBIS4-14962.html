			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Ardayev: "Kazakhstani Peasant Could </F> Become Owner. Sovkhoz Director Becomes Kulak Right Away"]    [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty] -- Government documents aimed at  implementing radical reform in Kazakhstan's agriculture were  published in the Republic press in March. There are now  distinct prospects that private owners could finally emerge in  the agrarian sector.    The Cabinet of Ministers ratified the provisional statute on  the sale of state agricultural enterprises into the private  ownership of citizens (first phase). In accordance with this  statute, labor collective members and persons retired on pension  from a given enterprise and residing on its territory, as well  as social sphere employees, have the right to buy out 49 percent  of the redeemable part of the property subject to the property  shares assigned to each.    An "outside" buyer -- a citizen of the Republic of  Kazakhstan  having an agricultural education and a record of practical work  in agriculture of not less than five years -- can acquire 20  percent. He buys sovkhoz property at a closed commercial  tender, paying in installments with a mandatory initial payment  of not less than 31 percent of its cost. The remaining 31  percent of the state property is also transferred to the buyer,  but for temporary use for a period of not more than five years.  He can also receive for temporary use for a maximum of two  years the remaining unsold part of the agricultural enterprise's  state property.    The distribution of standard-size tracts of land (lots) is  carried out according to the same procedure as governs the  distribution of the property.    However, President N. Nazarbayev has issued a special edict  allocating 10 percent of the redeemable part of sovkhoz property  free of charge to a sovkhoz director who has worked in this post  for not less than 20 years. The director can acquire a further  10 percent for temporary use for a period of up to five years.  If the farm increases its efficiency and attains stable levels  of agricultural production and improves its socioeconomic  indicators, the director can acquire this share free of charge  over the following five years. Thus the sovkhoz director  becomes the biggest property owner: Only the remaining 80  percent of the redeemable part of the property will be  distributed between labor collective members and "outside"  buyers. Kolkhozes have been recommended to use this sovkhoz  method.    Therefore, property owners could emerge in the Kazakhstani  countryside in the near future, but, once again, not property  owners in the full sense -- no constitutionally enshrined  institution of private ownership of land exists in Kazakhstan to  this day. Land shares can be transferred to citizens only on  long-term leases for a period of up to 99 years, with the right  of inheritance.</p>

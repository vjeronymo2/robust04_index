			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HINTS FROM HELOISE: CHOCOLATE SYRUP IS GOOD TO THE VERY LAST DROP -- AND THAT'S  GOOD TOO  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Did you ever want that little bit of chocolate syrup that's at  the bottom of a squeeze bottle and won't come out? Don't fret, you can get  every drop.  </P> <P> Fill the bottle with milk and shake it. It mixes with the last bit of  chocolate. Then just pour it into a glass. You can add more milk if you don't  like it too dark.  </P> <P> There's usually enough chocolate left in the bottom to make two glasses of  milk.  </P> <P>  -- THERESA, Monticello, N.Y.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: While making pancakes for my family, I took a cake-decorating  tube and filled it up with pancake batter. I decorated each of the cooking  pancakes with names, pictures and faces, then flipped them.  </P> <P> It is amazing the simple things you can do with your children and have so much  fun to boot. My children and I had a most enjoyable breakfast.  </P> <P>  -- JOSEPH, Carlisle, Penn.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: A friend mentioned how much her family enjoys the different  varieties of winter squash. I didn't realize there was winter squash; I don't  know anything about it. Would you please tell me the different types and how to  select and store them.  </P> <P> Thanks, I can't wait to try some.  </P> <P>  -- MARY, Omaha, Neb.  </P> <P> DEAR MARY: There are several different types of squash and, oh, what wonderful  dishes they create.  </P> <P> The acorn squash is shaped like an acorn and, of course, that's how it gets its  name. It can be dark green or orange and green.  </P> <P> The buttercup squash is oval and is dark green with whitish stripes that run  down it.  </P> <P> The turban squash is a brightly colored fellow. It has rounded lumps on one  end.  </P> <P> The butternut squash is long and tubular in shape and is creamy brown in color.  </P> <P> The Hubbard squash is one of the largest squashes. It is bumpy all over and is  usually all different colors.  </P> <P> The spaghetti squash has a smooth yellow outside. It gets its name because of  the stringy texture. This is one of my favorites.  </P> <P> Most winter squash have hard rinds. When selecting one, be sure to check for  any soft spots on the rind. Of course, if there are any, look for another.  </P> <P> Winter squash may be kept for three to six months if stored in a cool, dry  place but don't refrigerate unless it has been cut.  </P> <P> This should just about cover all you need to know. Now all you need is a recipe  and a squash and you're ready to go.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I wear rubber gloves when I wash dishes and do other various  household chores. I didn't always have such an easy time taking them off,  though, so now before I put the gloves on, I sprinkle the inside with some  cornstarch. This makes taking the gloves off much easier.  </P> <P>  -- DEEDEE, El Paso, Tex.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I recently bought some skirt steak and wanted to marinate it to  make it tender. All of my marinade was gone and I didn't want to go to the  store, but I saw a bottle of Italian salad dressing and thought I would give it  a try.  </P> <P> I placed the meat in a shallow baking pan and poured the dressing over the  steak, covered the pan with aluminum foil and placed it in the refrigerator.  The next day I broiled the meat and it was simply delicious. My family liked it  better than my old marinade. So, from now on we will be using the dressing.  </P> <P>  -- SARAH, Phoenix  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I want to share my favorite baked potato topper. I mix two  tablespoons of sour cream, a spoonful of black olives, some grated onion and  some fresh chopped parsley. It is delicious.  </P> <P>  -- JENNY, Los Angeles  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: When I grate onions for a recipe, I simply put my hand in a  plastic bag and grate away. When I am through grating, I put the bag around the  onion, never touching it. Now my hands remain odor-free and, best of all, the  onion is ready for the refrigerator.  </P> <P>  -- SALLY, Tacoma, Wash.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I enjoy baking chocolate-chip cookies and my family enjoys eating  them.  </P> <P> When I first began baking the cookies I used one cup of the regular-size chips.  Now to cut down a few calories but still make the cookies the way my husband  likes them, I use one-half cup of the mini chips. I think I am the only one who  noticed any difference.  </P> <P>  -- JACKIE, Orange, Tex.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Here is my favorite hint. I found the regular spoon rests too  small for my use, so I purchased a corn holder dish. Mine is plastic but some  are ceramic as well.  </P> <P> It works great. I now have room for that larger spoon.  </P> <P>  -- JEANNE, Woodland Hills  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I just love your hints. I look forward to reading them every day.  They have really helped me a great deal, especially since I recently got  married.  </P> <P> I have a problem with my garbage disposal. A couple of hours after I have run  it, it starts to smell. I have tried to cut down on using it but that doesn't  seem to help the situation.  </P> <P> I would appreciate any suggestions you may have.  </P> <P>  -- LAURA, Austintown, Ohio  </P> <P> DEAR LAURA: First of all, congratulations on your marriage. Now let's get rid  of that smelly odor from your garbage disposal.  </P> <P> Make sure the garbage disposal switch is in the Off position, then remove the  rubber piece covering the opening of the sink drain if you can. You will  probably notice a buildup of gunk on the bottom side of the cover and this  could be the main source of the odor. Clean this well with hot soapy water and  replace it over the sink opening.  </P> <P> To freshen the inside of the garbage disposal, save fruit peels (such as orange  and lemon peels) and once a week deodorize the disposal by placing the peels  down it and letting it run with plenty of cold water.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: My mother shared the following hint with me when I was very  young, and I still remember and follow it today.  </P> <P> Food should never be stored under the sink area, not even potatoes or onions  because all of the cleaning products, chemicals or other items can leak or  spill on any of the stored food.  </P> <P> The pipes that are under the sink can leak on the food and could cause mold or  mildew to form. I think this is an important hint for all to know and remember.  </P> <P>  -- LESLIE, College Station, Tex.  </P> <P>  Send a time- or money-saving hint to Heloise, P.O. Box 795000, San Antonio,  Tex. 78279. Letters will not be answered personally, but the best hints  received will be used in the Hints From Heloise column.  </P> <P> </P></p>

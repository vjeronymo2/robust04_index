			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Holidaymakers buy dollars in advance Holidaymakers are buying dollars even though many of them do not intend to travel to the US until next year, Mr Ian Spight, director of Thomas Cook Financial Services, said yesterday. Mr Spight said many clearly did not believe they would see a two-dollar pound again for some time. Thomas Cook estimates the total UK market for currency and travellers' cheques will be Pounds 4.5bn this year compared with Pounds 4.1bn last year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 26 Apr (NA) -- It was officially  reported today that an "extremely dangerous ultra-right  extremist," who had been working in the Army until last year as  a civilian intelligence official, has been detained by Buenos  Aires police agents on an island in Tigre District. About 30 kg  of explosives, antitank rockets, 24 grenades, and arms of  various calibers and ammunition were also seized.    Police and court sources have indicated that the detainee,  officially identified as Alejandro Jorge Socksdorf, 35, is a  member of a "Painted Faces" group whose members had allegedly  been training "to rescue" former Colonel Mohamed Ali Seineldin,  sentenced to life imprisonment for heading a military uprising  on 3 December 1990.    The operation in which Socksdorf was detained was ordered by  San Isidro Federal Judge Roberto Marquevich. Buenos Aires  Islands Security Corps police participated in the raids on an  island near the Antequeda Creek, 400 meters from the Parana de  Las Palmas river confluence.    Inspector Juan Carlos Rebollo, the Buenos Aires Islands  Security Corps chief, said the detainee "is an extremely  dangerous person." Rebollo emphasized that the area where the  raids were carried out is reportedly "a training camp for  ultra-right extremists" because "a large number of spent  cartridges" were found in the area.    Rebollo explained: "In addition to the arms seized, we also  found targets and other items that lead us to believe that  people were trained there. A heliport was found at the far end  of the island."    Based on this, Rebollo emphasized that the 15-hectare island  might be "a training center," specially for former "Painted  Faces" military officers.    He indicated that extreme-right literature was also seized,  reinforcing the possibility that the detainee is part of an  extreme right group. [passage omitted]    The police seized 24 MK2 grenades, an unspecified quantity  of  9-mm pistols, at least 10 "Energan" antitank rockets which are  launched by FAL rifles, a large quantity of 7.62 and 12.70  caliber ammunition, and a "homemade firing stand" [preceding  word in English] for mobile targets.    Inspector Rebollo added that 10 rifle-launched rockets, one  FMK 2 grenade, three electric detonators, and 100 grams of  dynamite were also seized.    Buenos Aires Security Secretary Alberto Piotti noted that 46  pounds of TNT -- in 1-pound pieces -- rapid and safety fuses,  detonators, a 12.70 caliber shotgun [as received], an  unspecified quantity of dynamite, and a Browning pistol with  erased license numbers were also seized. [passage omitted]    In a brief communique signed by Colonel Eduardo Alfonso, the  Army Press Office chief, the Army General Staff indicated that  Socksdorf was a "civilian employee" in the Army until 1993 when  he was "fired" for undisclosed reasons.    Army sources reported that Socksdorf, who was a PCI  [Civilian  Intelligence Personnel] grade employee, participated in the  operations to recover the 3d Infantry Regiment of La Tablada  that was surrounded on 23 January 1989 by a group of For the  Fatherland Movement (MTP) militants.    Inspector Rebollo noted that when the raid began, Socksdorf  introduced himself as "an IN-11 grade Army member and many other  things which the judge (Marquevich) will have to determine if  they are true."    Police sources contacted by NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS stated that  the detainee "has significant military training" and so the  possibility that "he is a trainer of other members of the cell"  has not been ruled out.

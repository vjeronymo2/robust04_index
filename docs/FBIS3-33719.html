"We have clear-cut evidence about direct interference by  Uzbekistan in the Kabul fighting," presidential spokesman Abdol  Aziz Morad told AFP.    Morad said the former communist militia warlord, Uzbek  General Abdol Rashid Dostam, who launched a failed coup attempt  in the capital on New Year's Day, has received much military  support for the one-month long Kabul factional fighting.    He went so far as to say that representatives of Dostam met  with government officials in the Uzbek capital Tashkent in order  to help plan the coup attempt in Kabul.    "Many facilities, both military and economic, have been put  at Dostam's disposal by Uzbekistan," Morad said.    He accused Uzbekistan of not only supplying Dostam with  jets,  aircraft spare-parts and the construction of a military  airstrip, but also of launching air-raids over Kabul and other  targets from inside Uzbekistan itself.    Although Morad said it was not clear if the Uzbek  interference in Afghanistan originated from the highest official  level, he nevertheless demanded that a joint Afghan-Uzbek  commission be appointed to investigate the charges.    The rumble of anti-aircraft fire over the capital followed  three raids on Kabul by Dostam Jets before midday Sunday, with  bombs exploding at the foot of the strategic "television  mountain," which houses a lot of heavy artillery.    Meanwhile, fighting intensified Sunday in northern Baghlan  province, where a spokesman for Hekmatyar's Hezb faction said an  offensive by pro-Rabbani forces had been repulsed.    The coalition forces fire@ two long-range Luna missiles on  the presidential troops in the Nahrin district, while infantry  troops were also making advances towards the garrison, said Hezb  spokesman Qaribur Rehman Saeed in the bordering Pakistani city  of Peshawar.    He said one of the missiles, having a range of 80 to 90  kilometers (53 miles), landed in the military base built by the  former Soviet troops while the other landed in Nahrin's bazar.  Details of the losses were not available, he said.    Saeed, giving importance to the opening of the new front in  the north amid a slowdown in the Kabul fighting, said the  anti-Rabbani coalition's strategy appeared to be to engage  troops of the president's main commander, Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, in  his northern strongholds and ultimately reach Jabalus Siraj.    The highway town of Jabalus Siraj, located in the south of  Baghlan, is Mas'ud's last major base north of Kabul, he added.    He said Mas'ud had already brought troops to Kabul from his  northern bases, and his Nahrin commander, Abdol Haye, was facing  a shortage of manpower.    Morad was keen to note that pro-Rabbani jets, which fly out  of the Soviet-built Bagram airbase 50 kilometres (31 miles)  north of Kabul, are also active in the factional fighting.    Apart from the air raids, Kabul was largely spared the  punishment of bombardment Sunday, with merely a handful of  rockets exchanged and quiet frontlines; this unusual lull in  hostilities prompted some locals to speculate on the prospect of  a ceasefire.    Dostam's ally, Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, is  reported to be open to ceasefire negotiations if there was  international backing, but his rival Rabbani appears sceptical  of such moves.    "Neither the United Nations, the Organisation of Islamic  Conference, nor any other foreign country has raised any popular  and acceptable proposal to solve the Afghan crisis," Morad said.    Morad summarised by saying that the Dostam-Hekmatyar  alliance  has become weakened, was now on the defensive, and was looking  for political solutions to its military problems.</p>

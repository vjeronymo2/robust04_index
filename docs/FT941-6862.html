			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Can Europe Compete?: A crossroad of frustrations - Case Study: unemployment on the German-Polish border As pedestrians cross the iron bridge spanning the Oder between Germany and Poland, a one-legged Polish man brandishes a placard requesting D-Marks to help him purchase a prosthesis. Since German unification, the river has become a border not just between hard and soft currency areas, but between compartments of the European labour market. Poles and Germans are each having to adjust to the employment crisis. They are doing so in different ways. Before 1989-90, 600 Polish women were bused across every day for shift work in the big semiconductor plant in Frankfurt an der Oder on the western side. Previously an East German electronic showpiece, the plant once employed 7,100. Since the post-unity industrial downturn, the number has fallen to 400. And the buses have stopped coming. Officially, unemployment in the Frankfurt region is 16.3 per cent, although the true figure - taking account of temporary government work and training schemes - is more than 20 per cent. With employment scarce, a panoply of rules now keeps Polish workers away from east German jobs. 'The Poles are willing to work for much less money,' says Mrs Eva Novicka, proprietress of a travel agency in Slubice on the eastern side of the river. 'No German will work for less than DM10 per hour. They are too proud. Poles will accept jobs for DM7 to DM8.' High east German wages, leading to east German unit labour costs that are 80 per cent above west German levels, have lengthened local dole queues. None the less, the D-Mark attracts Poles across the bridge to seek work in the most unpropitious conditions. The current earnings gap is huge. This means Poles who carry out illegal casual jobs at less than half normal German wages still earn much more than they would in Poland. In the Slubice region, wages can be as low as DM150 to DM200 a month, says Mr Wilfried Grieger, an official at the Frankfurt employment office. This compares with DM1,500 to DM2,500 in Germany. Mr Grieger says the system of work permits for Polish workers rules out undercutting of official German wages. Also, Poles may work in Germany only if they fill vacancies for which no German or EU citizens apply. But it is an open secret that, on east German building sites, contractors pay casual Polish labourers as little as DM2 an hour, against a German rate of DM15. Officially, only 373 Polish workers now make the daily cross-border journey in the Frankfurt area. 'Since there is a black market, the real figure could be a lot higher. It is impossible to say how high,' says Mr Grieger. Frankfurt has long been a crossroad of trade routes. But now, it is more a crossroad of frustrated hopes. This is part three of a ten-part series.

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Kevin Maxwell complies with court directive MR KEVIN MAXWELL late last night complied with a court order in delivering a 40-page affidavit descri-bing his dealings with the Maxwell companies' pension funds. Mr Neil Cooper the provisional liquidator of Bishopsgate Investment Management, the trustee of the pension funds, spent last night scrutinising the document which describes Mr Maxwell's involve-ment with BIM and its assets. This morning Mr Cooper will begin to question Mr Maxwell in a private court hearing in an attempt to shed light on the dis-appearance of some Pounds 300m from BIM. The money was syphoned off to support the totter-ing private companies of the late Mr Robert Max-well, Mr Kevin Maxwell's father. The affidavit arrived at 9pm at Mr Cooper's offices at Robson Rhodes, the accountancy firm, although the court had ordered its deli-very by 'close of busi-ness'. Last week Mr Kevin Maxwell lost his appeal against the December judgment of Mr Justice Hoffmann that he must answer Robson Rhodes' questions about the operation of BIM. Mr Maxwell had been arguing that he had a common law right to remain silent to avoid self-incrimination, but this was rejected as it was ruled that the Insolvency Act, under which BIM brought its claim, abrogated this privilege. BIM was the manager and investment trustee of a common investment fund of about Pounds 700m established for the pension funds of many of the companies in the collapsed business em-pire of the late Mr Robert Maxwell.</p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Andalucia deals a blow to Gonzalez The Spanish Socialist party's first parliamentary defeat in the southern region of Andalucia threatens to complicate its efforts to maintain the delicate political alliance which keeps it in power at the national level. The Andalucian government headed by Mr Manuel Chaves has this week lost to the combined opposition forces in a series of motions on regional finances. Most seriously, the parliament has demanded that Mr Chaves withdraw his support from a budgetary system agreed last year, under which regional governments may control 15 per cent of the tax revenue raised in their territories. The agreement is a cornerstone of the pact between Mr Felipe Gonzalez in Madrid and the Catalan nationalists on whom the Socialists rely to achieve a working majority in the Madrid parliament. The opposition parties in Andalucia - conservatives, communists and regionalists - say the budgetary pact favours Catalonia as a rich region, at the expense of the principle of nationwide solidarity. Socialist politicians, however, see the parliamentary vote as a political manoeuvre designed to drive a wedge between the Gonzalez government and its Catalan allies. The move comes after failure of initial attempts to forge agreement between the Madrid government and the Catalan nationalists on next year's Spanish budget. Mr Chaves described the vote as 'a frivolous act'. He said there was no evidence that the 15 per cent system worked against Andalucia's interests and warned that by rejecting it the region stood to lose up to Pta17bn (Pounds 85m). The pact was approved last October by the regional parliament, where the Socialists then held an outright majority. The defeat shows up the Socialist party's vulnerability in Andalucia, which is also Mr Gonzalez's home region, following regional elections in June. Mr Chaves, a former labour minister under Mr Gonzalez, has been reinstated as regional president but with a minority in the 109-seat regional parliament. The decision to hold the Andalucian elections on the same day as the European elections on June 12 opened Mr Gonzalez to opposition charges that he was trying to influence the outcome of the European poll by stirring up his traditional support in the south. If that was indeed his calculation, it backfired badly. The punishment meted out to the Socialists in the European poll in the aftermath of corruption affairs involving former top officials was reflected in the outcome in Andalucia. The party also suffered as a result of recent factional infighting. The Socialists saw their 62 seats in the regional parliament in Seville cut to 45, while the conservative Popular party increased its presence from 26 to 41 and the communist-led United Left from 11 to 20. In the wake of the election Mr Chaves was unable to forge an alliance with the United Left, which refused to collaborate without a shift to more left-wing policies. Such policies would be anathema to the free-market orthodoxy which forms the basis of the understanding between Mr Gonzalez and the Catalan nationalists. Andalucia is the most populous of the 17 self-governing regions set up under Spain's 1978 post-Franco constitution, and is therefore crucial to the national political balance.</p>

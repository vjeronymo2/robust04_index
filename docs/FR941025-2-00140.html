It requires a branch office manager or registered options principal to approve and initial a discretionary order in index warrants on the day entered. Also, prior to commencement of trading, the Exchange would distribute a circular to its members calling attention to specific risks associated with warrants calling attention to specific risks associated with warrants on the Index if the Exchange is required to do so by Commission policy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

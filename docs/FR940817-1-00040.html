			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Use of Instructional Time by Aviation Maintenance Instructors to Satisfy Currency Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under current &sect;65.83, there are no provisions for allowing individuals involved in aviation maintenance instruction to use that experience for maintaining the currency required to exercise the privileges of their certificate and ratings. The FAA recognizes that the experience gained while providing aviation maintenance instruction or directly supervising other aviation maintenance instructors is commensurate with the experience obtained while directly performing aviation maintenance. The FAA already recognizes this experience in current &sect;65.91(c)(2). Within that section the phrase ``actively engaged'' includes instructors who are exercising the privileges of their certificate and ratings at an aviation maintenance school certificated under Part 147 of this chapter. Therefore, the FAA proposes to allow the use of instructional time also to satisfy currency requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed rule, a certificate holder would qualify to maintain currency by serving as an aviation maintenance instructor or by directly supervising other aviation maintenance instructors under his or her certificate or rating. The instruction concerned would have to be directly related to aviation maintenance and acceptable to the Administrator, so that the time an individual spends providing instruction or directly supervising other instructors is equivalent to the experience gained while performing aviation maintenance tasks. For example, instructional time provided at Part 147 aviation maintenance technician schools or under an approved air carrier maintenance training program would be acceptable and would meet the intent of the proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of currency requirements is to ensure that all aviation maintenance technicians are familiar with current maintenance practices and the applicable FAR. The aviation maintenance instructor must keep abreast of current maintenance practices in a wide variety of disciplines to provide the high quality instruction required. Aviation maintenance instructors perform a critical function in the aviation maintenance education process, and the FAA believes that the adoption of the proposed rule would recognize this importance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Establishment of Training Requirements for Certificated Aviation Maintenance Technicians Exercising the Privileges of their Certificates for Compensation or Hire <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under current Part 65, there are no specific provisions that require the training of certificated mechanics. Current regulations ensure that certificated aviation maintenance technicians supporting operations under Parts 121, 127, 135, and 145.2(a) are informed fully about procedures, techniques, and new equipment in use through participation in maintenance and preventive maintenance training programs. In an effort to ensure that all aviation maintenance technicians are informed of current maintenance practices in the rapidly changing aviation maintenance environment, the FAA proposes the adoption of refresher training, requalification training, and other training appropriate to the duties of the aviation maintenance technician, for aviation maintenance technicians who use their certificates for compensation or hire and do not participate in the maintenance and preventive maintenance training programs referenced above. This proposal would ensure that all aviation maintenance technicians who exercise the privileges of their certificates for compensation or hire and have the sole responsibility for ensuring the airworthiness of the equipment on which they perform maintenance meet training requirements similar to those currently in place for aviation maintenance technicians supporting operations under Parts 121, 127, 135, and 145.2(a). In addition, this proposal would also ensure that aviation maintenance technicians who support U.S. certificated repair stations that do not have maintenance and preventive maintenance training programs receive comparable training. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed rule, an aviation maintenance technician who meets the prescribed work experience requirements and wishes to exercise the privileges of the certificate or rating for compensation or hire would be required to complete refresher training or other training appropriate to the duties of an aviation maintenance technician. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An aviation maintenance technician refresher course, inspection authorization refresher course, or a series of such courses that are acceptable to the Administrator and consist of a total of not less than 16 hours of instruction within a 24-month period could be used to satisfy the refresher training requirement. The completion of an inspection authorization refresher course by an aviation maintenance technician who does not hold a current inspection authorization would also constitute completion of the mandatory aviation maintenance technician training requirement. Adoption of such a provision would increase the range of training options available to the aviation maintenance technician and would enhance the individual's understanding of the inspection authorization process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As an alternative to refresher training, an aviation maintenance technician wishing to exercise the privileges of the certificate and ratings for compensation or hire may complete other training appropriate to the duties of an aviation maintenance technician. This training may be broad based and would consist of a course or courses of instruction, acceptable to the Administrator, of not less than 16 hours within a 24-month period. Completion of courses dealing with general maintenance practices or regulations applicable to maintenance operations, for example, would satisfy the intent of this proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

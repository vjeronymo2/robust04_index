			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVERS AND SHAKERS  </P> <P> Men of influence in the NHL.  </P> <P> John Ziegler: As president of the NHL since 1977, he has brought the league  into a period of full rinks and generally full wallets for owners. Conservative  on expansion. Criticized for accepting TV contract with SportsChannel America,  which is available in fewer than half of the league's cities. Gives autonomy to  Brian O'Neill in disciplinary decisions, to Gil Stein in legal matters and to  Steve Ryan in marketing.  </P> <P> Bill Wirtz, chairman of board of governors: The governors make rule and policy  changes, and Wirtz is the second-most powerful man in the NHL as head of the  board and co-chairman of key committees. Has long-standing family influence:  his father, Arthur, and Arthur's partner Jim Norris for years owned teams and  operated arenas in four of the NHL's original six cities. Wirtz is Ziegler's  key adviser and has been in charge during Ziegler's absence.  </P> <P> Cliff Fletcher, Bill Pulford, Harry Sinden and Bill Torrey: The league's four  senior general managers are on most key committees, which report to the board  of governors. When they talk, their peers listen and usually go along.  Calgary's Fletcher enjoys additional clout as a member of Board of Governors;  Sinden, of the Boston Bruins, and Torrey, of the New York Islanders, are  alternate governors but have almost as much say. They know all the rules -- and  helped write many of them. Considered the league's top hockey minds. Pulford's  influence stems from longevity and connections as a former player.  </P> <P> Ronald Corey, Marcel Aubut: The head of the Montreal franchise is always a  leader in a league that still is strongly rooted in Canada, but Corey is also  respected as one of the game's best business minds. Aubut, of the Quebec  Nordiques, is innovative and able to implement his ideas in a league that  resists change. Reinstituting overtime was his pet project.  </P> <P> Jay Snider, Norm Green, Glen Sather: Snider, president and governor of the  Philadelphia Flyers, and his father, Ed, made the team a model expansion  operation after joining the NHL in 1967. Too outspoken for some hockey people,  but a staunch defender of the game. Sather has a power base as the general  manager, president and alternate governor of the Edmonton Oilers, who won four  Stanley Cups in the 1980s. Shrewd and knows rules -- and loopholes -- well.  Green, principal owner of the Calgary Flames, is considered progressive for  urging the acceptance of Soviet players and international play.  </P> <P> David Poile, Gerry Meehan: Both are general managers and power brokers of the  future. Poile, of the Washington Capitals, is chairman of the general managers'  committee and sends decisions up to the governors. Has power to appoint general  managers to various committees, and so can freeze people out or give meaningful  assignments. Meehan, a former player, paid his dues by getting a law degree and  serving as the Buffalo Sabres' assistant general manager before moving up.  Respected for his intelligence.  </P> <P> Bruce McNall, George and Gordon Gund, Richard Evans, John Pickett: Money talks,  so people listen to McNall, owner of the Kings, and the Gund brothers, who  owned the Cleveland Barons and are now trying to move the Minnesota North Stars  to Oakland. McNall, however, is looked down upon by some owners and general  managers as nouveau riche. Richard Evans, president and governor of the New  York Rangers, has power because a successful New York franchise is essential to  the NHL's well-being. Pickett is respected for having saved the Islanders from  near-bankruptcy in the 1970s and for his knowledge and quiet leadership in  shaping league financial policies.  </P></p>

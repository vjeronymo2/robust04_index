			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Summary" of comments by Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the </F> Liberal Democratic Party's Policy Research Council, in an  interview with ASAHI SHIMBUN; place and date not given]    [Text] The Japan-U.S. summit meeting was not one of those  at which playing with words could somehow do the trick. It is  problematic that the failure of the meeting to reach an  agreement on the framework talks is taken as the "independence  of the Japanese diplomacy." What is crucial in diplomatic  negotiations is to make efforts to see they do not break up. I  must say that the meeting was a failure.    It is not only Japan which is to blame. The United States  which wanted to narrow down all the negotiations to only one  thing -- setting of the numerical targets -- is responsible as  well. But Japan was only concerned with rejecting it, failing  to present an alternative to it.    Beginning with talks on textiles, many negotiations have  been  held between Japan and the United States. In a number of cases,  they came close to failing, but the negotiators were able to  avoid the worst and resolve differences because both parties  made efforts to reach agreements at the talks. In the  Japan-U.S. construction talks and the structural impediments  initiative talks in which I was personally involved, I persisted  with the position of saying "No" to the U.S. demands, but I  presented counterproposals as well.    This time that sort of efforts were not made at all. The  negotiations were entrusted to bureaucrats, and politicians did  not try to take responsibility. Now, the United States keeps on  criticizing the bureaucrats, but it is barking up the wrong  tree. The bureaucrats cannot go beyond the roles assigned them.    The United States' possible incitement of the high-yen value  or enforcement of sanctions in case of a failure of the summit  meeting has been anticipated. The trend of national bond and  stock prices in the United States is stable. So is the market  of the dollar against the mark. If the United States decides on  imposing sanctions, Japan has things to say, too. As far as the  cellular phone issue is concerned, it should be dealt with  pursuant to international rules.    I doubt if the Japanese Government can really talk about  "mature, adults' relationship" without feeling shame in its  conscience. Prime Minister Hosokawa may be thinking that way in  fact, but there are people within the government who are  concerned as much as we do. Many of the bureaucrats who  accompanied him on the visit to Washington returned home very  much disheartened. In that respect, Mr. Hosokawa is too  ignorant.    In the meeting of the seven major nations' (G-7) finance  ministers and central bank governors to be held soon, the  Japanese Government must seek the cooperation of other nations  to ensure that the exchange market better reflects Japan's  fundamental economic conditions. On the other hand, the  government must continue to make efforts to open up Japan's  markets. The Liberal Democratic Party can cooperate in that  regard, but if the government wants us to cooperate, it must  stop telling lies.    The government says it is easing rules on 1,591 items, but  the number is a simple sum of what the government offices cited.  Many of them are duplicated. I hope the government will stop  bragging about the numbers which are wrong.</p>

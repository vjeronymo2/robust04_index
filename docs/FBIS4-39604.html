			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Kudakayev report in the "Incident" column: </F> "Russian Fighter Aircraft Force Landed a U.S. Air Force Plane"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] On the evening of 7 June a  Pentagon spokesman stated that the chain of events connected  with the U.S. aircraft incident has not been accurately  recreated yet. U.S. Ambassador to Moscow Thomas Pickering  thanked the Russian side for "the tact and understanding" shown  during the plane incident.    Some time ago an Israeli private plane was forced to land  under similar circumstances. Some experts doubt that such  frequent incidents in the same area are accidental. Rather this  is a deliberate violation of the established procedures for  activating the air defense system in this region. Following the  disintegration of the Union system, Russia had to create new  border lines, in particular in the Caucasus, which have become a  subject of study by U.S. and NATO electronic surveillance  centers in Turkey. The presence of reconnaissance equipment  aboard the C-130 is not ruled out. According to flight  documents, there was a diplomatic cargo aboard the plane, and so  its inspection was unlikely.</p>

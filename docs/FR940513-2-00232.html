To extend the signal of public radio station KERA&hyph;FM, 90.1 MHz, in Dallas by constructing a new FM translator on 88.7 MHz, in Wichita Falls. Translator will bring first public radio signal to 68,696 residents. In addition, KERA&hyph;FM seeks Integrated Service Digital Network (ISDN) system equipment which will allow it direct access to the uplink in Austin. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> File No. 94192 PTB Alamo Public T/C Council, 501 Broadway, San Antonio, TX 78215.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Signed By: Ms. Joanne Winik, President and General Manager.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Funds Requested: $23,750.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Total Project Cost: $23,750.

The initial programming would originate largely from KLRN&hyph;TV but there would be a provision for local origination insertion. This would provide first public television service to approximately 38,600 residents. Project would conduct engineering surveys, research microwave tower locations and prepare the appropriate FCC applications for the new station. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> File No. 94195 PTN Texas Environmental Center, 1609 Virginia Avenue, Austin, TX 78704.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Signed By: Mr. Marshall Frech, Director.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Funds Requested: $73,340.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Total Project Cost: $155,340. A proposal to plan for the extension of an electronic environmental library project initiated by the Texas Environmental Center and Rice University, using high-speed phone lines and the internet in several schools providing students with the opportunity to monitor water quality of area rivers and to contribute data to a state assessment of area watersheds. The plan would consider the expansion of this network and the testing of teleconference lines so that water monitoring trainers could instruct students from remote sites, to standardize scientific procedures and ensure validity of the data collected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> File No. 94244 CRB University of Texas at Austin, P.O.

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Observer: Mischance Can it just be coincidence that 13 years of Tory rule is being marked by a series of political disasters beginning with the letter M - the 13th letter of the alphabet? The more superstitious of John Major's supporters may see this as the curse of his deposed predecessor, Margaret Thatcher. The roll call is impressive: Monetary policy, Maastricht, Miners, Matrix Churchill, Mellor's Mistress, even the chancellor - la Mont (of French extraction, of course). John Major, who was born in March, shouldn't be lulled into thinking that he'll be safe enough at the next European summit. It seems only fair to warn him that Edinburgh is in Midlothian.</p>

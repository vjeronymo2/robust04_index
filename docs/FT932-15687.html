			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Sun Alliance Another thumping loss from Sun Alliance shows just how unbalanced the UK's biggest insurer became during the 1980s. Its general insurance business was weighted too heavily towards the UK and exposure to mortgage indemnity was excessive. Yet the life assurance side is not big enough to offset the impact of recession. On the investments side, faith in equities and property paid off handsomely during years of asset price inflation. Thursday's property write-down is the penalty. The net asset value is now little more than half the Pounds 3bn peak reached in 1989. Balance is belatedly being restored. By surrendering market share on UK household insurance, Sun Alliance is reducing its exposure to freak storms and floods. The acquisition of Denmark's Hafnia last month raises the proportion of European premium income to 23 per cent - and adds weight to the life business. Disposing of the big stakes in Commercial Union and Chubb last year reduced exposure to equities in general and other insurers in particular. But there is no escaping the legacy of mortgage indemnity. The damage this year should be below the Pounds 180m underwriting loss sustained in 1992. But the rate of repossessions and the average cost per claim will only gradually decline. The main comfort is that the balance sheet looks strong enough to stand the strain. Even so, a solvency ratio of 50 per cent after the acquisition of Hafnia would have been 7 points lower were it not for sterling's devaluation. The position is not as robust as Sun Alliance would have the market believe.</p>

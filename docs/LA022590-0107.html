			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TALKING TURKEY  </P> <P> A comment and an observation:  </P> <P> The idea that enmity between believers in the religions of the Book is a cause  of Azerbaijani/Armenian fighting has the ring of probable truth.  </P> <P> But I think we must go much further back in time to tap that spring. Of course,  it is understandable that both East and West will use whatever sticks are  available. Kipling was on to something.  </P> <P> I smiled when I noticed that the camera had picked up the edge of your  paste-up, making the words "Azerbaijani attacks against Jews" look as though  underlined. At least in my copy.  </P> <P> WILLARD OLNEY  </P> <P> HESPERIA  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> PLAY EDUCATES FIELD WORKERS ABOUT RIGHTS, PESTICIDES  </P> <P> As the sun was setting on Campo Tres S's Labor Camp, the routine noise of field  workers lining up for dinner, watching television and washing clothes was  broken by the sound of laughter, music and applause.  </P> <P> The 200 men, most of them Mexican, who live in 65 green, barracks-like  buildings were not celebrating a birthday or a holiday.  </P> <P> The occasion was a visit from Teatro Nuestro, an Oregon-based theater troupe  that uses satire, music and drama to educate farm workers about their legal  rights and about the dangers of pesticides.  </P> <P> For many of the poor migrant workers, the play -- held on a makeshift stage  outdoors in the middle of a basketball court -- was the first time they had  experienced live theater.  </P> <P> Performed almost entirely in Spanish, the production mesmerized the men, many  of whom said later that they identified closely with the characters.  </P> <P> The play told of a poor Mexican family struggling to make a decent life in  America. It includes a maniacal Anglo boss who speaks in a goofy American  accent and ignores the harmful effects pesticides have on his workers. It talks  about the effects of machismo on a Latino woman and the power of a unified  political effort.  </P> <P> "The family scenes are the most serious because a lot of these men are far away  from home," said Armando Morales, who plays the Mexican folk hero Super Barrio.  </P> <P> For members of Teatro Nuestro and its accompanying band, Sandunga, playing in  such rustic settings is not unusual. The group, founded in 1986, tries to bring  its message to disenfranchised audiences, which the actors say are found mostly  in rural communities and labor camps.  </P> <P> Ernesto Ravetto, who portrays Don Tomas, the macho-yet-caring father, said the  group recently played in the mountains near San Diego, where about 300 field  workers lived in shacks made of sticks and cardboard.  </P> <P> The costumes are not lavish and the simple sets were built with 2-by-4s and  cloth. The group is sponsored by several foundations and such organizations as  the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the California  Rural Assistance League.  </P> <P> "It's theater for the people," Ravetto said.  </P> <P> He said the group had previously performed at an elementary school in Oxnard.  The actors decided to take the show to Campo Tres S's Labor Camp this year  after recent allegations that hundreds of Mexican workers had been held in  servitude at a flower ranch in Somis.  </P> <P> "We tell them they have rights, whether they have work papers or not," Morales  said.  </P> <P> As the band began to play, the field laborers -- most still dressed in work  clothes caked with mud from the fields -- stood against a nearby building,  cautious about the free show being offered to them.  </P> <P> However, by the time the first act began, more than 150 men had gathered close  to the stage, some sitting on the ground, others in folding chairs and a few  watching from the open windows and doors of their rooms.  </P> <P> According to the author, Cheyney Ryan, the play was drawn from the traditions  and experiences of poor Latino field workers living in America.  </P> <P> "Most of these people have never seen theater in their lives, so they believe  that Don Tomas is real," Ravetto said.  </P> <P> When Don Tomas tells his daughter, Maria (played by Estela Loera) that she is  not going to college but instead will marry the man of his choosing, many of  the men nod in support.  </P> <P> And when Don Tomas' wife, Consuelo (played by May O'Conner Morales), asks  rhetorically whether everyone is as crazy as her husband, a man in the audience  answers: "Un poco."  </P> <P> Later, a gray-haired man in the front row wipes at his eyes and shakes his head  when Don Tomas begins to read a heart-wrenching letter from his wife after he  is deported to Mexico.  </P> <P> The solemn mood of the play is broken by the Anglo patron (played by Cully  Fredricksen), a cigar-smoking, lanky boss whose wife serves him Kentucky Fried  Chicken for his birthday.  </P> <P> Ravetto said the play gives the men a rare opportunity to jeer at a character  who symbolizes the kind of bosses many have had.  </P> <P> In the final act, the Sanchez family unites to defeat the dreaded Pesticido --  a skull-faced harbinger of death -- with the encouragement of Super Barrio, who  tells Don Tomas: "The greatest force you have is the people united."  </P> <P> Pablo Ruis Rojas, a gardener who said he loved to hate Pesticido, said the play  taught him about the power of a united people.  </P> <P> Segundo Alvarez, a field worker who has lived in the camp for three years, said  the play hit close to home for him because he suffered eye irritations from  pesticides several years ago when he worked in the fields in the San Joaquin  Valley.  </P> <P> For Pablo Rivera, another field worker, the section in the play when Don Tomas  was taken from his family by La Migra reminded him how much he misses the  family he left behind in Mexico.  </P> <P> "It hurts a lot," he said.  </P></p>

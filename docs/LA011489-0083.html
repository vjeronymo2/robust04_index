			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TORRANCE BOWLING TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> SOUTHPAW BOHN EARNS NO. 1 SEEDING FOR TODAY'S FINALS  </P> <P> One thing is for sure, the competition will be hot in the pro bowling final of  the AC/Delco tournament at noon today.  </P> <P> When the TV lights go on at Gable House Bowl in Torrance for the national  telecast, "it'll be like a heat wave hitting," said Parker Bohn III.  </P> <P> Bohn, who averaged better than 222 for 42 games, finished as the qualifying  leader. So, it will be the lean left-hander from New Jersey seeded No. 1 in the  roll-off for the $27,000 first prize.  </P> <P> He'll wait in the wings for a single-game showdown to see which of the four  finalists, all right-handers, he'll meet for the championship.  </P> <P> Arizonan James A. Miller is the No. 2 bowler in the finals, with Randy Pedersen  of Santa Maria No. 3, Pennsylvanian Ron Palombi Jr. No. 4 and Oregonian  Marshall Holman No. 5.  </P> <P> Pedersen could break an 18-year-old jinx by earning his fourth PBA victory. A  Southern Californian hasn't won a title in this region since Gary Madison of  San Bernardino won at Anaheim in 1971.  </P> <P> Holman, one of pro bowling's all-time champions, made his big move Friday to  reach the finals. He was in 19th place starting the day.  </P> <P> This will be Bohn's fifth TV final, and he said the experience has him ready to  face the lights once again.  </P> <P> "It isn't so much the temperature that bothers a bowler in a TV final, but the  quick-drying affect of oil on the lanes," Bohn said. "It can drastically change  lane conditions in the middle of a match. So, it calls for quick adjustments on  delivery."  </P> <P> Brian Voss, the 1988 money champion, finished ninth, and Hall of Famer Mark  Roth was 19th.  </P></p>

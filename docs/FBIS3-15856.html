Many  nonindigenous inhabitants sincerely believed that this act was  in the mainstream of the democratic transformations which had  begun and candidly answered that they were in favor. But now  they have become convinced that they were simply misled. And on  the third anniversary of that memorable poll a mass protest  meeting was held on Riflemen's Square in central Riga, announced  as a memorial meeting for the defunct "Latvian democracy for  all." The triumphal all-Latvia poll laid the foundation not to  interethnic harmony but created a "Republic of South Africa in  the center of Europe" -- that was the leitmotiv of the speakers'  speeches.    Municipal elections will be held in Latvia soon. The Latvian  saeima has adopted a law whereby only citizens of the republic  can elect the municipal organs of power. Now the saeima intends  to deliver another blow to noncitizens: A draft law on the  status of the deputies of local organs of management of all  levels has been put on the plenary session's agenda in its  third, final, reading. At the initiative of the national  radicals it includes a clause compelling deputies to receive  voters and examine the applications and appeals of voters, that  is only of those who are Latvian citizens.    The Latvian league of stateless persons has notified the  republic's leaders and the ambassadors of foreign states that  depriving noncitizens of the right to resolve their delay  problems at elected municipal level and simply to be received is  a gross act of provocation which pushes hundreds of thousands of  outcasts to create their own alternative organs and  representative missions at municipal level.</p>

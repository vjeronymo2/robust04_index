			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Construction Contracts: Wastewater treatment plant in Macau A consortium led by WATER ENGINEERING (HK), part of the North West Water Group, has signed a Pounds 15m contract to design, build and operate a wastewater treatment plant in Macau, on the southern tip of China. Water Engineering and its Portuguese partners, Teixeira Duarte and Soares Da Costa overcame opposition from UK and French contractors with a compact and efficient process design. The plant, which will treat both domestic and industrial wastewater, wilt take two years to construct, followed by an operation contract of three years. The plant, sited in a densely populated area, will be virtually enclosed and screened from the public with access to parking facilities on top. Considerable attention has been given to noise abatement and odour control. Macau, a one-hour jetfoil trip from Hong Kong, is a Portuguese territory destined to revert to Chinese rule at the end of 1999.</p>

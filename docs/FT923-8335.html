			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y dispute focuses on New York towers THE WORLD Financial Centre in New York is emerging as the focus of Olympia &amp; York's efforts to keep its US buildings out of the bankruptcy protection which has engulfed the troubled developer's operations in Canada and the UK. Three disputes have surfaced between O&amp;Y and its creditors over loans relating to the 44-storey Tower B of the 7.6m sq ft World Financial Centre. Some of the lenders predict O&amp;Y has little chance of settling these disagreements without seeking court protection. Talks broke down last week with a group of eight banks led by Morgan Guaranty and Bank of Montreal which advanced Dollars 160m on security of a pledge of O&amp;Y's partnership interest in Towers A and B of the World Financial Centre, as well as four other buildings in New York and Los Angeles. The Morgan group has threatened legal action to seize rental income from these buildings in excess of amounts required for debt-service and maintenance payments. An O&amp;Y spokesman said yesterday, however, that the company views the threat merely as 'another step' in negotiations towards a debt restructuring. All payments on the Dollars 160m loan remain up to date. The Morgan dispute stems from O&amp;Y's failure to pay Dollars 62m in interest last March to a group of Japanese institutions led by Nomura Securities which hold the Dollars 800m first mortgage on Tower B. The World Financial Centre has a low vacancy rate and a strong cash flow, but O&amp;Y funnelled rental income from Tower B earlier this year to prop up its ailing Canadian operations. The Morgan group objects that O&amp;Y is compensating the mortgage holders by paying them excess cash flow from the building, in effect putting Dollars 62m of debt ahead of the Morgan security. It wants to prevent the same happening with the other five properties. O&amp;Y and the Nomura group have yet to reach a longer-term agreement on the missed payment. Separately, Morgan has threatened to auction an interest-rate swap, which is classified as an O&amp;Y asset, and forms part of the collateral for the Dollars 160m loan. The auction has been postponed several times while negotiations continue, but is now scheduled to take place on August 28. Debt payments on the other two World Financial Centre buildings in which O&amp;Y has a stake are understood to be up-to-date. The fourth building, Tower C, is owned by American Express.</p>

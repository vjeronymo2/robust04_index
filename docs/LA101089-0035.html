			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Police and security officers appeared in force at the Florida Capitol in  Tallahassee as the city braced itself for a special legislative session on  abortion and several large demonstrations. The Florida Legislature is scheduled  to convene this afternoon. Authorities have estimated between 15,000 and  100,000 protesters on both sides of the abortion issue will turn out for the  demonstrations. Security was also tight at the Governor's Mansion several  blocks north of the Capitol, where abortion rights advocates planned to picket  for an hour every night through Friday, when the special session is scheduled  to end. The special session has drawn national attention, because it is the  first to be called on the abortion issue since the U.S. Supreme Court's July 3  ruling on a Missouri law gave states the right to restrict abortion.  </P></p>

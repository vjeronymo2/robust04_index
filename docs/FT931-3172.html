			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): A chance to work out your own bill - Assessment half of them self-employed, the others taxpayers such as directors of companies - will from 1997 be able to calculate their own tax liabilities. If they opt for self assessment, they will make their own calculation, then send off a cheque to the Inland Revenue, based on how much they owe. The Revenue will not check all these returns, but if they do, they will charge penalties and interest on those that are found to be incorrect. This system will not affect the basic PAYE system for people who receive income from employment. But it will apply to all those who earn money in other ways, and currently fill in a Schedule D and investment income tax return. It will not affect people who claim repayment of tax on bank and building society interest. People who opt to have the Inland Revenue work out their tax bill, as at present, will have to submit their tax returns six months earlier than those who opt for self assessment. The Treasury has been talking about introducing this system for some time, and it has spent much of the past two years in consultations. The idea is one that is already in use in a number of other countries, particularly the United States. One big change, however, that became clear yesterday, will alter the basic tax system in order to make it simple enough for the new self assessment approach to be workable. There will be two big changes: All of a taxpayer's income will now be brought together on one tax form, whether it comes from employment, freelance earnings or investment. This means that a taxpayer will now only be dealing with one tax office. The 'prior-year' basis currently used for self-employed income will now be abolished, and all income will be taxed on a current year basis. This means that tax will be paid on income from self-employment in the year in which it is earned, rather than a year later, as at present. There will be transitional arrangements, which will leave some people as winners and some as losers. One year will drop out of the tax calculations, and whether you are a winner or a loser will depend on what sort of year falls out. One complaint that emerged from the consultation process was that the Inland Revenue was not proposing to allow enough time for taxpayers to prepare for the shift to the new system. As a result, the start date has been deferred by another year until April 1997. Further consultation is proposed with representative bodies and employers on the details of the new system.

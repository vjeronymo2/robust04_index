			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Mr Mandela takes stock President Nelson Mandela's honeymoon with the South African electorate finally came to an end over the weekend, when the African National Congress (ANC), gathered in Bloemfontein for its first conference since it won elections in April. It would have been understandable if the party used the event to dwell on its extraordinary achievement since its inaugural gathering in the same city over 80 years ago. Instead the party is subjecting itself to a brutally frank critique of its performance in office. This is as it should be, for to do otherwise would smack of complacency. As Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, the secretary general, put it in his official report to the delegates, the ANC is a liberation movement still struggling to come to terms with its success at the ballot box last April. The party is heavily indebted, riven by 'cliques, factions, tensions and squabbles', he said. It has failed to tackle continuing township instability, rising crime and high unemployment, and is faced by one overriding concern: the failure to meet black expectations. No one expected it to be easy, given Mr Mandela's dilemma. South Africa's stability, and its appeal to foreign investors, rests on the new government's capacity to maintain white confidence. To do so, Mr Mandela has chosen to act pragmatically  - but in the process he has lost black support, particularly among impatient black youth. There is no simple way out for Mr Mandela. If he is to deliver on the key issues  - jobs, housing, education, land reform  - he has to preside over a growing economy. To do this, he must bring with him a white community whose role in both business and the security forces is disproportionate to its numbers. And most difficult of all, he must turn a civil service moulded by apartheid into a loyal, efficient administration, without which the best conceived policies will fail. Complex problems There are other brakes on the government's capacity to deliver. It is learning to live with a constitution which decentralises power to nine provincial assemblies. Although the ANC controls seven of them, they are developing minds of their own, not susceptible to reform by diktat. Add to this the complexity of the problems to be addressed, whether the huge housing backlog, or the gross disparity in land ownership. Nor is Mr Mandela's task made easier by the nature of the ANC itself. It is a still a coalition, originally driven by a single overriding objective  - the end of white minority rule. Now that has been achieved, the cracks in the coalition are emerging, for it encompasses a very broad political spectrum, ranging from advocates of market-driven policies, through militant trade unionists to members of the influential South African Communist party. State patronage In the past, Africa's leaders were able to sustain comparable coalitions after independence by resorting to state patronage through nationalisation and jobs in government service. Mr Mandela, however, has taken office in a new Africa, where economic policies are constrained by structural adjustment programmes which reduce such patronage through policies that include privatisation, market driven exchange rates, and trade liberalisation. In the longer term, it might well be healthy for development and democracy in South Africa if there was a fundamental realignment in the country's politics, with the left of the ANC breaking away and standing on its own platform. First, however, the party must put its own house in order. It must become an organised and focused political party, instead of a liberation coalition. And for the current five-year parliamentary session at least, the ANC and its partners in the government of national unity must work together to provide the jobs and social services that will form the foundations of the new South Africa. The danger, as Mr Mandela warned at the weekend, is that the ANC might attempt to regain lost popularity on the basis of populist rhetoric. If the party heeds his warning, and imposes discipline on its feuding factions, Bloemfontein could mark the moment when the ANC came to grips with its new responsibility.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed GF: "PS and PSC Willing To Discuss Amnesty"] </F>   [Text] Brussels -- The PS [Socialist Party] and PSC [Social  Christian Party] are willing to have a discussion on amnesty.  Yesterday, the party executives of both French-speaking parties  unanimously approved a statement to that effect. The word  amnesty is not pronounced, but during a press conference after  the weekly meeting of the PS party executive, PS Chairman  Philippe Busquin used the word without any hesitation. This had  never happened before within the PS. The PSC is willing "to  examine the family consequences of the postwar measures case by  case."    The PS party executive subscribed to the words of Arthur  Haulot, "the conscience of the resistance to fascism." In an  appeal published in LE SOIR, Arthur Haulot stated he was no  longer opposed to a "case by case investigation of those who ask  for compassion," in a spirit of peace on the occasion of the  fiftieth anniversary of our Liberation. As a resistance  fighter, Haulot was arrested by the Gestapo in 1941, and  survived three and one-half years at the concentration camps of  Mauthausen and Dachau. By referring to the very old Haulot to  tone down its implacable position on amnesty, the PS secures  itself the best possible guarantee against protests by its rank  and file.    The PS statement says that "social consequences for the  relatives of the condemned people can be seriously examined case  by case." This sentence is very similar to that of the PSC text.    In the PS' and PSC's view, amnesty is rejected for  collaboration with the enemy, and only applies to the social and  family consequences of collaboration.    The PS also emphasizes that it continues to be committed to  "the democratic values." Busquin explained that after the  elections, the PS will not form any coalitions with  ultra-rightwing parties.</p>

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Halifax says house price rises stalled INCREASES in house prices stalled last month after rising during the summer, emphasising the fragile nature of the housing market recovery, Halifax, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, announced yesterday. Halifax said that average prices, although unchanged between September and October, were still 1.5 per cent higher than in the corresponding period last year. The society urged the government to do nothing in the Budget at the end of this month 'which might damage the confidence of potential house purchasers'. On Monday Nationwide building society announced that prices had risen by 1.5 per cent in October, resulting in a year-on-year increase of 1.7 per cent.</p>

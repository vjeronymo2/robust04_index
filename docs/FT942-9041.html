			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Asia offers 'ride' for western exporters Asia could form a powerful trade bloc against the European Union and members of the North American Free Trade Agreement if its goods were shunned by the two groups, Mr Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's prime minister, said last night. In a warning against protectionism, Mr Goh criticised western politicians and trade unionists who saw Asia's rapid economic expansion as a threat rather than an opportunity. He urged industrialised nations to 'ride on the growth of Asia' by exporting high-technology and high-quality goods. Opening a conference on Asian business in Singapore, Mr Goh said that to block Asia's emerging economies, especially China, from world markets would force them to turn inwards, stunt their growth, lead to 'a more aggressive and destabilising military posture', and threaten western assets in Asia. Even a less confrontational western stance, with the EU looking inward and Nafta looking only southward, would force Asian countries to trade increasingly between themselves, Mr Goh said. 'Asia has the capital,' he said. 'It saves more than the rest of the world. Its growth will be slowed, but it will not be stopped. An Asian trade bloc is not an option of choice. But it is a viable option.' Mr Goh joined the chorus of Asian leaders who have condemned western attempts to curb imports from low-wage countries by linking workers' rights to trade negotiations. Among his few words of comfort for the west was the assertion that emerging Asian economies were unlikely to run the sort of trade surpluses seen in Japan and Taiwan, because countries such as China and India were not suppressing consumer demand as Japan did in the early stages of development. By the end of the decade, he said, east Asia could have an annual current account deficit of Dollars 50bn.</p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (2): Harsher climate for financial services - In the past 20 years Guernsey has experienced dramatic change to its economic base / The economy GUERNSEY has made its living in various ways over the centuries. In the early 1800s, privateering flourished on the back of the Napoleonic wars. Some of the proceeds from this lucrative trade were used to build up St Peter Port, so that parts of the island's main town have a Georgian look to this day. In the late 1800s, there was brisk trade in dessert grapes. By the 1960s, the main economic activity was the export of tomatoes and flowers. Tourism was growing in importance. But over the past 20 years Guernsey has experienced a dramatic change to its economic base. On the one hand, horticulture has contracted because of rising costs and falling prices, to a level where it represents 6 per cent of gross national product today compared to 36 per cent in 1973. On the other hand, financial services have grown to represent 51 per cent of GNP in 1991, compared to 11 per cent in 1973. This arm of the economy is further enhanced by another 20 per cent from the 'rentier' sector which covers people whose main income is derived from investments such as deposit interest, dividends, property and trusts. The tourist sector has declined from 30 per cent of GNP in 1973 to 18 per cent in 1991. There is a also a small industrial sector contributing 6 per cent of GNP. Some 16 per cent of the employed population now works in the financial services industry with more than 300 employers. Approximately Pounds 32m in income tax contributions were paid by the sector in 1990 - or 43 per cent of the total. There has been 15.6 per cent growth in population since the early 1970s and gross national product at 1991 reflated prices has nearly doubled from Pounds 434m in 1973 to Pounds 840m in 1991. Financial services have also helped give Guernsey a self-supporting economy. Contrary to popular supposition, it receives no grants from the mainland. It has no external debt and it balances its budget each year. The budget figures for 1993 show that of total current income of Pounds 154m  -some 73 per cent of which is derived from income tax - Pounds 6.1m will be put aside for capital expenditure. The downside, if that is not too strong a word, of the growth is that by the late 1980s the economy showed signs of overheating. By 1988 there was nil unemployment. Foreign workers from Madeira were imported to work in horticulture and tourism as locals were drawn off into financial services. As local people started to receive good pay packets inflation crept up. It was 8 per cent in 1990 while it was only 5.6 per cent on the mainland. The pressures began to show up in housing. Although Guernsey has a two-tier housing system with houses set aside for locals, prices rose sharply and made it difficult for young people in particular to buy their own homes. In order to try to balance the economy a little, the States tried, through its budget, to subsidise horticulture for employment purposes. It arranged cheap loans and in some cases gave grants. Mr John Dickson, head of economics and statistics for the States, says: 'It was felt that we should try and draw off some the wealth being made in financial services and make sure that the rural economy survived.' But recession, especially in tourism, has seen the Guernsey economy come back in the past three years. Unemployment at 4 per cent is higher than it has been for 15 years and inflation, at 3.5 per cent, is roughly in line with that of Britain. There was little growth in the economy in 1991 and little is expected for 1992. For the future any attempt to encourage horticulture and industry will be quietly dropped, according to Mr Dickson, and market forces will be allowed to take their course. The emphasis will be on financial services, and trying to revive tourism. The going has got tougher. Mr John Roper, director-general of the Financial Services Commission, says: 'The climate is harder for financial services if for no other reason than interest rates in the UK, where much of the money is deposited, have dropped substantially.' He believes, however, that Guernsey is competitive and will continue to grow. Tourism has failed to pick up because of recession. The tourism 'spend' is put at Pounds 90m in 1992 compared with Pounds 120m in 1990. Mr Mike Brown, head of the country's civil service, says: 'We are optimistic. Financial services are not just one industry but many different ones. There are all kinds of new products we can involve ourselves in. I am sure the economy will pick up soon.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] An Israeli resident of the Qatif Bloc was stabbed  and slightly wounded this morning by a terrorist near the  Kissufim checkpoint in the Gaza Strip. He is currently being  evacuated to a hospital in Beersheba.    Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that the Israeli came to  the checkpoint to pick up workers. On his way back to the Qatif  Bloc, he was stabbed in the chest and shoulder by one of the  workers. The terrorist dropped the knife and fled. Other  workers called soldiers from the checkpoint who found the  wounded man in his car. The security forces have launched a  manhunt after the assailant.    In another incident, an Israeli citizen was injured in  Qalqilyah when his car was pelted with stones. He lost control  of the vehicle, which overturned. The man sustained moderate  injuries and was taken to a hospital in Kefar Sava.    The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] tightened the closure on the  territories this morning and increased security at its  checkpoints, especially in Samaria. Soldiers are conducting  very thorough inspections and hardly any Samaria Arabs are being  permitted to enter the Green Line.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "She Came and Went Away"] </F>   [Text] Many people did not believe that Robin Raphel would  visit India. Experts thought that apart from the normal  courtesy, Raphel would get nothing more from Indian officials.  They were also of the view that the majority of political  parties would display their wrath against her. As a matter of  fact, the reaction to her visit was quite different. Prime  Minister Narasimha Rao did not meet Raphel. There is a rumor  that Ms. Raphel is angry with the Indian Government for not  giving her the opportunity to meet with the prime minister  during her stay in New Delhi, despite several attempts to do so.  Rao's close aides are very conscious about not giving any  foreigner reason to criticize India's traditional hospitality.  Many of the prime minister's administrative staff and his  political colleagues held cordial meetings with Raphel. Tea and  dinner parties were arranged for Raphel, during which she held  talks with several prominent personalities. Home Minister  Chavan, who is a bitter critic of the Clinton administration's  Kashmir policy, talked with Robin Raphel for about an hour. An  Indian official of Raphel's rank would hardly get the  opportunity to meet officials in Washington equivalent to those  Raphel was able to meet in New Delhi. Despite this, the female  diplomat was accorded a very cordial reception in the Indian  capital.    What is the reason for this cordiality? Our weakness toward  the white-skinned people is perhaps the main reason behind this  attitude. It is also due to the enthusiasm of some of our  bureaucrats and ministers who want to get on the Americans' good  side. During her visit, both sides were especially cautious.  Raphel did not make any straightforward comments, which is quite  contrary to her nature. She was very careful about her  utterances and thoughtfully considered her words before making  any statements. This American lady emulated the style adopted by  diplomats in the past in dealing with such situations. For the  time being, Raphel has deviated from the style being followed by  the new and inexperienced officials of the Clinton  administration. Perhaps Raphel changed her approach because she  is the first pawn the U.S. President has sent to India. Mr.  Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary of state and the second  pawn, is due in India in the first week of April. It would be  foolish for New Delhi to seek consolation in the sweet words  Raphel uttered during her visit. It would be wrong to deduce  from Raphel's visit that there has been some change in the U.S.  administration's policy toward India centering on Kashmir and  the human rights issue. Similarly, it would also be wrong to  assume that the U.S. efforts to sell F-16's to Pakistan by  amending the Pressler Amendment have been stalled by this visit.    It may be mentioned that the Indian Government was also very  careful during Robin Raphel's visit, as it does not want to  offend the U.S. Government unnecessarily. New Delhi adopted  this posture keeping in mind Narasimha Rao's forthcoming visit  to Washington. India does not believe that a dramatic  improvement is possible in the relationship between Delhi and  Washington at present, nor does it believe it is possible for  the United States to overcome its weakness for Pakistan. For  these reasons, Stephen Solarz is not willing to become the U.S.  ambassador to India. An intelligent man like Solarz could not  fail to realize that he will become powerless once he arrives in  New Delhi. Although a marked improvement in political relations  between the two countries would be difficult, it is possible to  increase U.S. economic assistance to India. It is not difficult  to realize that this is needed. Despite his apparent  reluctance, Prime Minister Rao is eager to visit the United  States. Rao and his advisers are encouraged by the success of  his recent trip to Britain. They believe that India will be  able to secure a lot of facilities from the United States if Rao  is able to hold direct talks with President Clinton. It is  unwise to think that India will be able to get additional  benefits from the United States even if it does not respond to  the U.S. Government's nuclear program for South Asia. Definite  hints in this regard may be given during Strobe Talbott's visit.  It would be wrong to think that Robin Raphel left a lot behind  for India apart from her mouthful of laughter. It is necessary  to see and observe what she says in Pakistan after she leaves  India.</p>

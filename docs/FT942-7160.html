			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Markets Report: Dollar weakens again The dollar's recovery on the foreign exchanges proved shortlived yesterday as the US currency came under renewed pressure from a stronger D-Mark, writes Philip Gawith. The agreement on Tuesday to restart the US-Japan trade talks had bolstered the US currency, but weaker than expected April durable goods figures were the catalyst for a steady weakening of the dollar. The dollar finished in London at DM1.6447 against the D-Mark, from DM1.6478 on Tuesday and an intra-day high of DM1.6545. It was barely changed against the yen at Y104.455. Activity was generally fairly quiet until the dollar started to weaken in the European afternoon. Apart from generalised D-Mark strength, the features of Europe were the weaker lira, the Portuguese escudo coming under pressure again, and the firm Greek drachma. The futures markets were again very volatile, with most of the movement in eurosterling. Sterling had a steady day with the sterling index finishing at 80 from 79.9 as strength against the dollar offset weakness against the D-Mark. US April durable goods orders were only 0.1 per cent up in April, compared to market expectations in the 0.8 per cent to 1.5 per cent range. Although durable goods figures are not normally closely watched, the disappointment was sufficient to deflate whatever thin veneer of optimism had come to surround the dollar. Contributing to the dollar's difficulties was a general firming of sentiment towards the D-Mark. The catalyst for this was the fairly small fall of only three basis points in the German repo rate, to 5.20 per cent. Although widely expected, it appeared to confirm recent comments from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, suggesting that the pace of German monetary easing would slow. These sentiments were further strengthened by comments from two senior Bundesbank figures yesterday. Mr Otmar Issing was quoted in a German business daily saying that 'current money supply figures did not match a landscape of falling interest rates.' M3 grew at a seasonally adjusted, annualised rate of 15.8 per cent in April. Mr Reimut Jochimsen, a central council member, was also quoted expressing concern about differences between Bundesbank policies and government fiscal policy. Some analysts believe the D-Mark is being re-rated by the market as economists upgrade their forecasts of German growth. Yesterday the German currency had a mixed performance in Europe, finishing at FFr3.421 against the French franc from FFr3.422. The escudo returned to market attention yesterday with the Bank of Portugal forced to step in to support the currency when it fell below Es104 against the D-Mark. Dealers said a series of rumours about alleged crises were undermining sentiment, while the currency also seemed to be acting in sympathy with the weaker bond market. In Greece, by contrast, the drachma had a steady day despite the overnight downgrading of Greece's senior foreign currency debt by the rating agency Moody's. Ms Wendy Niffikeer, senior economist at IBJ International in London said she believed the worst was probably past for the Greek currency. 'If there was going to be a serious crisis, it would have happened by now,' she said. Last week many in the market were predicting a devalution. The short term aim of the Greek government, some analysts argue, is to try and support the drachma through the European elections, and until Greece hands over the presidency of the European Union. The lira was weak yesterday, closing at L969 against the D-Mark from L965. Analysts said this was probably a function of heightened political uncertainty following the announcement that Mr Umberto Bossi, the Northern League leader, would have to appear in court. The futures markets enjoyed another hectic day. Trade in the euromark futures was again heavy, with the December contract trading over 57,000 lots. Price movement, however, was fairly sedate after the recent gyrations, with the December contract closing unchanged at 94.77. Trade was fairly heavy in eurosterling too, with the December future trading nearly 34,000 lots, and closing fifteen basis points lower at 93.80. Analysts said it was difficult to make sense of the move, which appeared to flow from weakness at the longer end of the yield curve. A lot of the selling was technically driven as price falls triggered various chart points. The Bank of England provided Pounds 525m of late assistance to the UK money markets after predicting a Pounds 750m shortage. The Bank had earlier provided Pounds 76m liquidity to the market. Overnight rates moved between 4 7/8 per cent and 6 1/2 per cent. In the German money markets call money rates eased to 5.25/5.35 per cent from 5.30/5.40 per cent after the Bundesbank added a net DM7.5bn in its money market operations.</p>

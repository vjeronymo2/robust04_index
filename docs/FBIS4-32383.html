			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava June 21 (CTK) -- The Slovak Government  today supported a deputies' bill whereby political parties and  movements can "spend" up to 12 million crowns ($400,000) in the  autumn election campaign.    Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus said that, even if the bill  is  approved by parliament, "not all the financial means spent on  the election campaign could be registered." Filkus told CTK  that the law should enable control over political parties'  expenditures in the course of the election campaign and after it.    According to the law, publishers of the periodical press as  well as organisers of radio and television broadcasts and  advertising companies' management would be obliged to provide  the Finance Ministry and the Supreme Inspection Office with  information about the amount of financial means individual  political parties and coalition spent on the election campaign,  Filkus said, adding that value added tax was included in the sum  of 12 million crowns.    According to this year's financial management reports of  individual political parties, the post-communist Democratic Left  Party (SDL) with the 61.5 million crowns (some $2 million) worth  of property is the richest political party in Slovakia followed  by ex-premier Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia (HZDS) with almost 21 million crowns and the Slovak  National Party (SNS) with 8 million crowns.</p>

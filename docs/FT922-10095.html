			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Arts: Pop goes Covent Garden - Off the wall THERE IS just a chance that this week saw the end of one of the arts world's more depressing annual rituals - Jeremy Isaacs, general director of the Royal Opera House, explaining away yet another nasty deficit for Covent Garden. This does not necessarily mean that Isaacs has finally had enough of the constant bitching about the Garden and is returning to the more peaceful world of commercial television, but that there now seems to be the will on all sides for one final heave to settle Covent Garden's funding problems. Actually 1991-92 was not too bad for the Opera House - a shortfall of Pounds 1.6m on a turnover of around Pounds 45m, contributing to an accumulated deficit of Pounds 3.3m. Isaacs had been over optimistic in trying to solve the financial problem by raising seat prices during a recession. Lower attendances - 88 per cent capacity for opera, 82 per cent for ballet - accounted for Pounds 1m of the shortfall. The rest came from another of those niggling industrial disputes, this time involving the orchestra, which seem to have disappeared from the rest of British industry. The Arts Council has given Covent Garden four years to wipe away its deficit. It hopes to deliver Pounds 1m of it in 1992-93, mainly by cutting overheads and expenses and saving on production costs. Isaacs argues that he has raised income from box office and sponsorship to the practical limit, reducing Covent Garden's dependence on subsidy from almost 60 per cent of turnover to 38 per cent. Now he is placing the future of the Royal Opera House in the hands of consultants. Two such scrutinies are currently under way - one organised by the Arts Council and led by Lady Warnock, one commissioned by Covent Garden itself from Price Waterhouse. When these are completed at the end of the summer, some sort of deal should materialise. No doubt a few management flaws will be exposed; some savings, perhaps involving more redundancies, pinpointed. Covent Garden will wield the axe, and the Arts Council will promise more money - over a period. Of course, in arts subsidy terms it will seem like a great deal of money. The Royal Opera House already gets Pounds 17.8m a year, much to the fury of smaller arts companies. Finally divesting itself of the Birmingham Royal Ballet could make the sums seem more reasonable. But these days the final decision does not rest with the Arts Council. It will be the gift of David Mellor, the new Secretary for National Heritage, who is not known as a great lover of the Opera House. Fortunately an even more powerful figure, the Prime Minister, bolstered by his wife, believes that London must have a world ranking opera house. This should clinch the deal. In the meantime, financial stringency means that Covent Garden has produced an attractively popular programme for 1992-93: the Glyndebourne production of Porgy and Bess; the rarely seen Stiffelio by Verdi; and two cut price new production's, Handel's Alcina and La Damnation de Faust by Berlioz. The revivals have an obvious box office appeal and include Tosca, Fidelio, Otello and Madama Butterfly. There are also appearances by Pavarotti, Domingo and Carreras - who, despite nightly fees in excess of Pounds 12,000, perform wonderfully at the box office, which is where the big dramas of the season will take place. * Has there been a dramatic sea change in the fortunes of Sotheby's and Christie's, who fight tooth and nail for supremacy in the world antiques market? Until the mid 1950s Christie's was traditionally dominant. Then Peter Wilson drove Sotheby's to the fore and in the last decade the entrepreneurial skills of its new American boss Alf Taubman extended its lead. But in 1992 Christie's keeps on capturing the star lots and is certainly now the larger in the UK and Europe: it could end the season as the leading auction house in the world. In recently weeks it has sold a copy of Audubon's Birds of America for a record Pounds 2.3m; disposed of the Vung Tau cargo of sunken Chinese porcelain for Pounds 4m; brought in made a record Pounds 4.6m from the Compton sword collection; and sold a Canaletto to Andrew Lloyd Webber for Pounds 10.12m. It is now poised to do better in the sector that Sotheby's pioneered so prosperously - Impressionist and modern art. Can it really be just two years ago when a Van Gogh sold in New York for Dollars 82.5m? Since then it has been downhill all the way. Estimates on some the Impressionists and Modern pictures on offer this May in New York are up to 50 per cent lower than on comparable art in 1990, sometimes more. But at least the salerooms are prepared to risk offering important pictures. Here again Christie's has the edge, testing the market with a painting that provides a wonderful snapshot of current demand. Renoir's 'La Loge' is a smaller, less finished, version of the famous painting in the Courtauld. In 1989 its German owner paid Dollars 12.1m for it. It now carries an estimate of Dollars 6m-Dollars 8m - and the reputation of Impressionist art. Even more hangs on Braque's 'Atelier VIII', his great late painting, which has an estimate of up to Dollars 10m and will set the tone for 20th century art. It has a curious history. Braque sold it to the collector Douglas Cooper on the understanding that it should never leave France. In 1972 Cooper adopted a young American, Bill McCarty, and left him the bulk of his fortune. McCarty-Cooper lived off the bequest but has now died of AIDS and the Braque is to be sold off in New York. By Christie's, of course. * The Washington, nay the American, art establishment was rocked by the surprise resignation of the patrician Carter Brown from the directorship of the National Gallery of Art. Then came the shock news that the favoured successor, John Walsh of the Getty Museum at Malibu, had declined to take over. Rusty Powell of Los Angeles County Museum of Art will now be the new director. * Anyone seeking signs of the end of the recession should look no further than Brooks classic car auction on Thursday. Prices of classic cars have been in free fall since 1989. Now there are signs of a remarkable revival. A 1933 Alfa Romeo sold for Pounds 462,000 and a 1956 Jaguar D-Type for Pounds 429,000. Neither had a reserve: they just had to go, making the prices quite extraordinary. Even Ferraris were selling. Brooks is unusual among the car auctioneers in allowing prospective buyers to test drive some of the lots on offer. This seems to have converted potential buyers into keen bidders.</p>

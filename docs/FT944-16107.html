			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Property: Great expectations in Pretoria - South Africa's market is poised for growth With its immense natural resources and financial, professional and legal infrastructure, South Africa is well placed to attract the foreign investment needed to underpin President Nelson Mandela's ambitious programme of economic revitalisation. After three years of negligible growth, the economy is forecast to grow by 3.5 per cent this year; inflation has fallen to a 20-year low of 7 per cent, before recently nudging up to 8.2 per cent. Recent foreign corporate arrivals in South Africa include aircraft and car manufacturer Deutsche Aerospace, insurer Irish Life and Swedish consumer goods group Electrolux. There are great expectations of the tourism sector, with some observers forecasting 12-20 per cent expansion over the next few years. The number of tourists has increased sharply over the past three years but still amounts to only 650,000 a year (compared with Kenya's 4m a year). All this increased business activity will benefit the commercial property sector through additional demand for space. Ensuring an adequate supply of high-quality commercial and industrial accommodation is therefore an essential carrot with which to attract foreign companies. Public-sector office space is also likely to increase significantly under the government's development programme. Office demand in Johannesburg, the commercial hub, and Pretoria, the capital, will be markedly affected by government demand. The property market's fortunes have reflected those of the broader economy, bumping along the bottom of the cycle. By world standards property prices in South Africa are cheap. State-of-the-art offices are priced at Pounds 4.5-Pounds 6.3 per square metre (compared with central London rates of Pounds 31.5 per sq m); retail levels vary between Pounds 8-Pounds 19 per sq m and industrial property averages at about Pounds 1.8 per sq m Yields for office investments, at 10 per cent, are high by world standards - yields in Dublin are 7 per cent, Amsterdam 7 per cent, Jakarta 8.5 per cent and Chicago 8.5 per cent. Yields on industrials are between 11-12 per cent; regional shopping centres yield between 9-10.5 per cent and community and local shopping investments range between 10.5-12.5 per cent. Vacancy rates for offices in central business districts are high. The vacancy rate for grade A space - top of the market - in central Johannesburg is 16 per cent (10 per cent in 1990) and in Durban 24 per cent (15 per cent four years ago). In Johannesburg, demand for US-style suburban shopping malls is growing. In the suburb of Rosebank, for instance, which contains one of the city's busiest malls, rent at a typical grade A building is about Pounds 6.3 per sq m, while the vacancy is a low 2.5 per cent. Leases are usually for five or 10 years with an annual rent rise which last year averaged 12 per cent. Along with the rest of the economy, the property sector is showing early signs of recovery, a useful encouragement for foreigners contemplating investment. At a recent auction of property in Durban, for instance, a commercial property sold at 10 per cent more than the original reserve. Among local institutional investors, Sanlam, Liberty Life and Old Mutual - all insurers - are the most active. Old Mutual predicts that rentals will double over the next 4-5 years. Development activity is picking up too. Johannesburg Consolidated Investments, a diversified industrial and mining group, is developing a 225,000 sq m building in the suburb of Sandton for Alexander Forbes Consultants and Actuaries (part of Price Forbes insurance group). Although it is too soon to identify firm trends, the boldest investors could reap benefits by purchasing at this early stage. Many smaller investors, however, are likely to be deterred from making direct property investments because of the high capital requirements. Such potential property investors may therefore take advantage of the unusually high number of listed property unit trusts, a popular investment instrument. The trusts do not incur tax and distribute all their income to unit holders. The income, however, incurs tax with the level determined by the unit holder's individual tax status. The trusts offer a spread of risk by geography and type of property. An average trust will typically yield about 12.5 per cent income return and capital growth potential is considered promising. 'As about 90 per cent of the 14 listed property unit trusts are owned by institutions, this sector is unlikely to slide,' said Mr Les Weil, executive chairman of local property consultants J H Isaacs, and deputy president of the South African Chamber of Business. 'This therefore creates a solid investment vehicle for the smaller investors,' he added. The idea of South African property-owning organisations setting up joint ventures with foreign investors is also gaining currency. Whether joint ventures take off will depend, in large part, on political stability. President Mandela's pledges to deliver better housing, education, health and jobs will form a vital ingredient to long-term political and economic stability. The generally optimistic business outlook is reflected in the chart, which shows a rise in business confidence, particularly in the past 12 months. In the same vein, J H Isaacs forecasts real gross fixed investment to grow by 5-7 per cent this year and 12-15 per cent in 1995, a trend that augers well for the commercial property sector.

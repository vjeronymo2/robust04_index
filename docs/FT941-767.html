			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Councils bid for Careers Service Partnerships between local education authorities and Training and Enterprise Councils form the bulk of the 13 pathfinders for the new-look Careers Service. The new organisations have been formed in 13 English regions to take over the running of the service from local authorities. The outlets, launched by the Department of Employment yesterday, promise 'greater innovation' in helping to find young people a job. Bids to run services in other areas of England and Wales will be invited in May. The government hoped when it invited competitive bids for the service that private-sector training organisations might bid. However, in all but one case the pathfinder services will be a partnership between Tecs, which administer government-funded training programmes in England and Wales, and local authorities. The service in Bedfordshire is the only one not formally to involve its local Tec. Miss Ann Widdecombe, employment minister, denied yesterday that the new organisations were a 'repackaging' of the previous service. She said they were designed to be more responsive to the needs of young people and employers.</p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lloyds fails to please After reporting a 21 per cent rise in profits, Lloyds Bank saw its share price fall sharply as the market reacted sourly to the underlying factors. The high street bank's figures came in at Pounds 605m against Pounds 498m last time and a dividend of 7.5p. The consensus forecast was for a profit of around Pounds 610m and a dividend of 7.6p to 7.8p but the real concern was over underlying profits. Analyst Mr Martin Hughes of Credit Lyonnais Laing who maintains an unfavourable view of Lloyds said; 'This is the third half year of reporting that Lloyds have had nothing to say in terms of growth.' There was also disappointment that the bank did not say more over progress on the bid for the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society. A number of City analysts are understood to be preparing swingeing forecast downgrades for the full year and for 1995 and could lop 15 per cent off their estimates. The current year consensus of Pounds 1,340m this year is expected to come down to Pounds 1,100m while next year's forecasts are seen to be moving down from around Pounds 1,440m to about Pounds 1,200m. The share price was immediately marked lower to stave off a wall of selling. Although turnover reached 4.5m by the close dealers expected the move away from Lloyds to continue for some time. They said a number of investors were sitting on their holdings until the shares recovered slightly. The shares ended the day 18 lower at 544p with both Credit Lyonnais Laing and Smith New Court recommending a switch into Barclays. The latter which reports on August 9, saw its shares climb 9 to 554p.</p>

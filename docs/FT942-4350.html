			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Research funding to favour commercial use University research which is directly relevant to commerce and industry is to receive more funding, under government plans published yesterday. The quangos which control funding for universities - the higher education funding councils for England, Scotland and Wales and the Department of Education for Northern Ireland - said they wanted to address complaints by employers that funding was skewed towards basic or academic research. They also intend to implement proposals to improve technology foresight published in last year's white paper from the Office of Science and Technology. The new rules will be applied to the university research assessment exercise which starts in 1996. The judgments it then makes on the quality of research will determine research funding from 1997 onwards. Total government research funding for that year has not yet been decided but this year's budget from the Department for Education, for English universities alone, was Pounds 618m. Mr Bahram Bekhradnia, head of policy for the Higher Education Funding Council for England, said the council hoped to appoint industrialists to the panels which will judge the university departments. They would work jointly with the leading academics who currently control funding. Requirements that departments submit only published academic research will be dropped. Now patents, and the results of industrial research undertaken for companies, will be judged on the same basis. This means a university doing only industrial research could still attract a top allocation of research funding if the research is of high quality. However, Mr Bekhradnia stressed that the aim was only to 'redress the balance', after criticism that industrial research had been ignored. The funding councils will not attempt to force universities out of more abstract basic research. The English funding council has also stopped the requirement that departments should submit lists of all articles each researcher has published. This follows claims that this had led to a 'publish or perish' attitude, with lecturers publishing work which was incomplete, or trivial. The grading system has also been made more detailed, with seven quality grades instead of five. The Scottish funding council has the power to steer extra funds to specific subjects if they are important to the local economy. It is still discussing whether to do so.</p>

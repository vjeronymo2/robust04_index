			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BENGALS COACH ORDERED TO PAY SUBSTANTIAL FINE  </P> <P> Cincinnati Bengals Coach Sam Wyche was hit with a substantial fine by the NFL  today for his failure to allow reporters into the team's locker room after its  loss to Seattle on Sunday.  </P> <P> NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, in a letter to Wyche, said the fine was  assessed because Wyche went against league policy and said he wouldn't rule out  closing the locker room in the future.  </P> <P> The league's media policy states that team locker rooms are to be opened after  a brief waiting period, usually 5 to 7 minutes. But after Sunday's 24-17 loss  to the Seahawks, Wyche closed the locker room, saying he wanted to avoid having  coaches and players face questions about officiating calls contested by the  coach during the game.  </P> <P> The league declined to announce the amount of the fine.  </P> <P> "We're fortunate the public is extremely interested in our teams and in the  details of the game," said Joe Browne, the NFL's director of communications.  "Our fans have a right to know how the players and coaches feel about events  that occurred during our games."  </P> <P> A statement issued by the Pro Football Writers of America said: "We are happy  the league has reaffirmed how important it is for pro football to maintain an  open relationship with its link to the public."  </P></p>

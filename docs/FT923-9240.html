			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Observer: Expert advice If Britain's big banks can cut their dividends and replace chief executives who fail to perform, why can't the City's blue chip merchant banks? When it comes to dishing out expensive corporate advice, the merchant banks are in their element. But when it comes to running their own business their record is pretty unimpressive. Arbuthnot Latham has gone, Brown Shipley all but disappeared from sight the other day, and several other well known names haven't been heard of for some time. Over the past 30 years it is hard to find a sector of the FT-Actuaries indices that has performed worse than the so-called expert merchant banks. Today's interim results from the grand old house of Kleinwort Benson are unlikely to make happy reading. The company has paid an uncovered dividend for three out of the last four years, and BZW estimates that it will do the same this year. It should have cut its dividend before now, and if it was an industrial company its recent performance would argue for a change at the top. Why do customers take merchant bankers so seriously?</p>

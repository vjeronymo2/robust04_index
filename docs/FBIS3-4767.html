It will mark an important event in  relations between Vietnam and Singapore. Here is our overview:    It is the first Vietnam visit by the existing Singaporean  prime minister. It is in response to the Singaporean visit by  Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet in 1993. The visit comes  at a time when many changes are taking place in the region and  the world. ASEAN countries in particular have achieved positive  economic development and are promoting cooperation with  Indochinese countries, including Vietnam.    Singapore recently has emphasized relations with Vietnam as  an important policy. Mr. Lee Kwan Yew, the prestigious former  leader of Singapore, has twice visited Vietnam recently. He  said Singapore is ready to share with Vietnam experiences in  economic development and management. Indeed, Singapore is now  Vietnam's biggest trade partner. Two-way trade last year  reached $1.4 billion. Singapore ranks sixth among foreign  investors in Vietnam, with 64 investment projects capitalized at  more than $430 million. Up to now Vietnam and Singapore have  signed five agreements in important fields, including investment  encouragement and protection, a trade agreement, an airlines  agreement, a maritime agreement, and an agreement on  environmental control and conservation.    The coming official visit to Vietnam by Prime Minister Goh  Chok Tong will help boost relations to a higher level. Vietnam  highly values and respects its friendly and cooperative  relations with Singapore and firmly believes that the Vietnam  visit by Mr. Goh Chok Tong will be a success and an important  mark in relations between Vietnam and Singapore.</p>

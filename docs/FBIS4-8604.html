			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Excerpt] Cajnice, April 14 (TANJUG)--NATO aircraft flew  over Bosnian Serb positions between Gorazde and Cajnice in  eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina at 16:00 hours local time on  Thursday, TANJUG has learned from Bosnian Serb Army (VRS)  sources.    According to the same sources, there have be no reports  about  whether the aircraft undertook combat action in the area of the  two towns which are close to the border with the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia.    U.S. NATO aircraft on Sunday and Monday raided Bosnian Serb  positions around Gorazde, a U.N.-protected "safe area" which  should have been demilitarized last spring. Not only that  Gorazde has not been demilitarized, but it was used to mass over  10,000 Muslim troops and launch a strong offensive on Bosnian  Serb territory in late March. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Molson held back by weak beer market MOLSON Companies, the diversified Canadian brewer, suffered a 24 per cent setback in its latest quarterly earnings, largely as a result of a weak beer market, retaliatory duties on beer imposed by the US and the costs of converting to a new beer bottle. Net earnings fell to CDollars 25.3m (USDollars 20m), or 42 cents a share, in the three months to December 31, the third quarter of the company's fiscal year, from CDollars 33.4m, or 59 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues rose to CDollars 769.8m from CDollars 723.3m. The negative factors were partially offset by CDollars 4.9m in fees received from the North American ice hockey league, one of whose teams is owned by Molson. Nine-month earnings fell to CDollars 100.1m, or CDollars 1.68 a share, from CDollars A 110.4m, or CDollars 1.97 a share. The company said yesterday that the decline in earnings for the year as a whole was likely to be 10 to 12 per cent. Molson, whose non-brewing interests include cleaning services and a retail hardware chain in Canada, said that its businesses are still being hurt by the recession. Operating earnings of Molson Breweries, a joint venture with Foster's Brewing of Australia, fell to CDollars 135.3m from CDollars 143m. Total beer sales in Canada dipped by 3.6 per cent in the nine months to last December and Molson's market share slipped to 50.2 per cent from 51.9 per cent a year earlier. Its share rallied to 50.4 per cent in the latest quarter. Molson said its alliance with Miller Brewing of the US, announced last month, is expected to be finalised in early April. Under the deal, Miller will acquire 20 per cent of Molson Breweries from the existing partners. It will also gain marketing and distribution rights for Molson and Foster's brands in the US. Molson expects to receive about CDollars 180m for its part of the sale.</p>

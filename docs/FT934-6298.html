			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: Fujitsu takes control of HaL Fujitsu of Japan is to acquire HaL Computer Systems, a California company that is developing high performance open systems computers. Previously, Fujistu held a 44 per cent stake in the US company. HaL will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fujitsu and serve as the principal development centre for advanced 64-bit open systems hardware and for operating systems products for the Fujitsu group of companies. 'This agreement is good for Fujitsu and HaL's employees because HaL now assumes an expanded development responsibility with greater importance to Fujitsu's open systems strategy,' said Mr Scott Metcalf, president of HaL. Fujitsu also announced it had signed a contract with Dell Computer to market Dell's personal computers to corporate clients in Japan. Dell said the move was intended to broaden the company's reach in Japan, where it has a sales force of only 30 people. Under the agreement, PFU, a unit of Fujitsu, will also provide service and support for Dell computers in Japan. Mr Paul Allen, Microsoft co-founder, added to his high-technology portfolio by buying part of Virtual Vision, a company that makes what it calls 'personal viewing systems', Reuter reports from Washington.</p>

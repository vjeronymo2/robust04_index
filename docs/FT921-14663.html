			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Letter: Nothing bilious about Seville Reading Peter Bruce's bilious piece ('Revels for a state without a creed', January 3) on Spain's plans for its 1992 festivities while on a return flight from Seville, I found his comments on Seville and Andalucia difficult to understand. Unlike northern Spain, it indeed has little 'smokestack' industry, but this may be a strength. Instead, there has been expansion of high-margin agriculture in the countryside, and the service sector in the southern cities. The Expo 92 site in Seville will be re-used as a research and development park. Far from being a 'lethargic, sun-drenched tourist venue' of the 1950s cliche, Seville is a bustling and self-confident centre of economic activity. The problem, if anything, is one of excessive and unsustainable growth (a nice problem to have]). In the long run, with its combination of high-margin agriculture, wine, tourism and research and development, Andalucia could indeed emerge as the California of 21st century Europe.

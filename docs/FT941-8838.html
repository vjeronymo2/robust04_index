			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Copper price surge trimmed back at LME - Market report COPPER prices fluctuated widely at the London Metal Exchange yesterday, leaving traders in two minds about the market's next move. The three months quotation, which on Tuesday had dipped to Dollars 1,830 a tonne before finding firm support, extended the ensuing rally to Dollars 1,909 in the morning before falling back to Dollars 1,890.50 at the close, still up Dollars 46 on the day. Dealers said Chinese and Japanese buying had featured in the morning surge. 'If copper doesn't get through Dollars 1,900 then the whole complex could collapse again,' warned one analyst. ALUMINIUM followed the same pattern, the three months position closing Dollars 15 below its high but Dollars 27.50 up on the day at Dollars 1,280 a tonne, while the ZINC price closed Dollars 20 ahead at Dollars 955.50 a tonne, after touching Dollars 978.50.

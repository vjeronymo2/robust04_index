			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEATH AT THE CLINIC  </P> <P> A dedicated psychiatric social worker, Robbyn Panitch, has died a violent death  on the job at a Los Angeles County mental-health clinic in Santa Monica. She  knew the dangers of working among the damaged members of society, but she  continued to help -- as those in her profession feel called to do. For that  service and the horrible sacrifice that it has entailed, her family and friends  deserve the public's sympathy and respect.  </P> <P> Random killing is common today in many urban areas, including Los Angeles.  Murder can occur anywhere -- in a schoolyard, a Skid Row alley or a suburban  home. But the social worker died in a mental-health clinic, and that means  taking stock of the system to find some meaning deeper than the shock of the  moment.  </P> <P> The central problem is that the state of California has backed away from its  responsibilityto the mentally ill, one that neither it nor any state has  handled particularly well. For decades states met the responsibility by putting  the mentally ill in warehouses that they called hospitals. Community-based  clinics were supposed to be an improvement, but, because there is neither money  nor political leadership to support such programs, many of the mentally ill  rarely receive help. Many also wind up living on the streets.  </P> <P> It is the chronically mentally ill who need care most desperately. Some can  function without risking harm to others or to themselves if they receive  regular treatment. But they live in limbo, neither so gravely disabled that  they can be committed for more than a few days to state hospitals nor legally  entitled to care anywhere else.  </P> <P> The California Psychiatric Assn. is proposing legislation to make outpatient  treatment mandatory for people in this group who respond to treatment but who  lapse into old patterns of behavior unless they are in an organized, required  program.  </P> <P> For many people, though, even treatment that would come close to matching the  original concept of community-based care in clinics will always come too late  unless the state also provides a comprehensive, and costly, treatment and  counseling program. The best time to begin treatment is in early stages of  mental illness. But the people who need this early treatment, many of them  teenagers, are the very ones who will suffer if several local mental-health  clinics are closed because the state will not make the extra effort to come up  with the $18 million that it will take to keep them open. Their illnesses will  not necessarily get worse, to be sure, but the familiar, reassuring people who  have helped them in the past will not be there when they encounter their next  crisis.  </P> <P> Vastly expanded public support for county mental-health programs is required to  ease caseloads for therapists so that they can give the required attention to  all patients instead of spreading themselves too thin trying to provide at  least some help to all of them. No society can ever protect its every member  from harm, but more money might allow local clinics not only to expand their  ability to help but also to increase the security of those in charge of  helping.  </P> <P> The pressures on both the people treated by the mental-health system and those  who work in it are tightening. For both professional and patient, increased  public support can be a matter of life or death. Providing care for citizens  unable to defend themselves from the private demons that they encounter day by  day is a basic obligation of government. Since it has not been met, Sacramento  must change -- or face the demons of basic failure.  </P></p>

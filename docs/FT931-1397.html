			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Belgian franc under pressure THE BELGIAN franc stabilised inside the European exchange rate mechanism yesterday after Belgium's central bank raised its official interest rates in support of the currency, writes James Blitz. The franc came under pressure inside the ERM after the government was unable to reach agreement on tax rises which would reduce its budget deficit, and offered its resignation to the King. The offer of resignation, which was still being considered last night, raised concerns in the currency market because a reduction in Belgium's budget deficit is critical if the country is to meet the convergence criteria set out by the Maastricht treaty. At the start of trading, the Belgian currency moved to BFr20.65 against the D-Mark from a previous BFr20.59. Although the movement was not great, the central bank has the informal goal of not allowing its currency to fluctuate by more than 25 basis points against the D-Mark in the ERM grid. Yesterday morning's fall for the Belgian franc amounted to a drop of 10 basis points, pushing the franc below the D-Mark in the grid at one stage. The Belgian central bank countered the move by raising its emergency lending rate to 12 per cent from 9.75 per cent, and its central rate by 50 basis points to 8.50 per cent. By the close of trading, the franc was some 9 basis points above the D-Mark in the grid, closing at BFr20.62. Some analysts suggested yesterday that the Belgian franc's problems could resurface, creating a serious problem for the ERM. Mr Mark Austin, a treasury economist at Midland Global Markets in London, said that Belgium might be able to bring its budget deficit within the 3 per cent of GDP, as set out by the Maastricht treaty. But its government debt, currently at 120 per cent of GDP would have to be halved by 1997, and this would prove extremely difficult. However, Mr Mark Brett of Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London, said he was surprised at how easily the franc shrugged off the pressure. 'If the market was going to have another full-blown crisis, surely this was one of the issues that would have been grist to the mill,' he said. The D-Mark closed stronger against several currencies after the Bundesbank left the rate at which it offers short-term funds to commercial banks unchanged at 8.25 per cent. The German currency's strongest performance came against the Italian lira, closing in London at L978.1 from a previous L969.4. Sterling closed  1/2 a pfennig weaker against the D-Mark at DM2.4150, but the French franc closed a touch stronger at FFr3.401 from FFr3.404. The dollar remained below DM1.63 to the D-Mark for most of the day, despite strong durable goods figures for February. The US currency closed at DM1.6285 from a previous DM1.6315.</p>

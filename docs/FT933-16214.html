			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / UN pulls its weapons inspectors out of Iraq UNITED NATIONS weapons inspectors are to pull out of Baghdad today amid warnings from Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, that the latest stand-off might provoke another confrontation with Iraq. Mr Nikita Smidovich, the UN weapons inspectors' leader, said his team was leaving after unsuccessful attempts since June 4 to persuade the Iraqi authorities to install video cameras to monitor a pair of missile testing sites. In a television interview in Washington, Mr Christopher said Iraq's refusal was 'a very significant violation' of UN resolutions. He added: 'They've been through a long policy of what's been referred to as cheat and retreat. Maybe they will be in that situation again, but it's a bad sign that our inspectors are having to leave there not being able to proceed with the installation of the cameras.' The UN Security Council has adopted a resolution warning Iraq of 'serious consequences' if it fails to install the cameras at the Yam al-Azim and Al-Rafah sites, part of the UN's continuing mandate under Gulf war ceasefire resolutions to inspect and destroy Iraq's weapons. Iraq has said it would consider installing the cameras only after a broader discussion of arms control with the UN commission scheduled for next Monday. The renewed tension may cloud the atmosphere surrounding talks due to open in New York on Wednesday between UN legal experts and Iraqi oil ministry officials over a possible limited resumption of Iraqi oil sales. The talks will be the first for more than a year on a proposed UN exception to the post-Gulf war embargo on oil sales, permitting Iraq to sell up to Dollars 1.6bn worth of crude to pay for food, medicines and the cost of UN operations in Iraq. Last year Iraq refused the terms of the permitted exception to the embargo, which could put more than 500,000 barrels of oil a day into the crude market. It objected in particular to the requirement that UN officials oversee distribution of the food and medicines. In Baghdad the dispute over the weapons inspections is likely to raise apprehension about a further punitive western-led military strike on Iraq, following the recent US cruise missile attack on the country's intelligence headquarters. However, no post-Gulf war strike on Iraq has yet been prompted directly by any of the numerous confrontations between Baghdad and UN weapons inspectors. The January 17 missile attack on Baghdad factories linked to Iraq's nuclear programme was essentially a US-led initiative and followed rising tension in the 'no-fly' zone over southern Iraq, after Baghdad had installed anti-aircraft missiles.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Minister Shulamit Aloni has said that the Labor  party is disintegrating and the functioning of all its bodies  has been disrupted. Every wheeler-dealer wants to be a Knesset  member and there is unbridled competition between hawks and  doves, she said. Aloni cautioned that this disintegration might  lead to the collapse of the peace process and to a war in which  Egypt would also take part. According to her, Meretz must make  the government's basic guidelines more pronounced and make sure  that it abides by its commitments.    In response, Labor Secretary General Nisim Zvili told our  party affairs correspondent Shmu'el Tal that Meretz's peace is  not Labor's peace. He noted that Labor had been dealt a blow,  but is currently recovering and not disintegrating.</p>

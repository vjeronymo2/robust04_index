			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / France signals reversal of nuclear weapons doctrine FRANCE signalled a historic reversal of its national defence doctrine yesterday, offering for the first time to discuss its nuclear capability with its European Community partners as part of the development of a common defence policy. The offer departs from France's long-standing insistence that its nuclear weapons and nuclear doctrine could only be matters of French concern. The abandonment of this central tenet of French independence, a constant of defence policy since General de Gaulle founded the Fifth Republic 33 years ago, could break the national consensus on nuclear strategy which has largely protected France from anti-nuclear movements. It will provoke controversy among the conservative Gaullist party, and is likely to stir debate on the prospects of a European defence policy in the rest of the EC, particularly Britain - western Europe's other nuclear-armed state. Launching a debate on the treaties agreed at last month's Maastricht summit, which include a long-term commitment to the development of a European defence policy, President Francois Mitterrand said the debate over the defence of Europe would raise issues which had to be resolved, notably that of nuclear weapons. 'Only two countries in the Community have nuclear weapons,' he said. 'Is it possible to conceive a European doctrine? This will very quickly be the major question of a common defence policy.' President Mitterrand's question clearly implies that France at least would be prepared to discuss the possibility of such a European doctrine. He did not indicate what such a doctrine should consist of, but the inference is that the other members of the 12 would be invited to take part in the formulation of the doctrine which would in future govern French (and no doubt British) nuclear weapons. His proposal is quite different from the suggestion repeated yesterday by Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, that French nuclear weapons should one day be transferred to a 'very strong European political union'. On the contrary, President Mitterrand's proposal would appear to combine French national control with a European doctrine. President Mitterrand said the nuclear question needed to be tackled 'very quickly'. This is no doubt due to the civil war in Yugoslavia, and the political struggles between the nuclear-armed republics of the former Soviet Union. However, the nuclear issue may also be critical for unlocking Europe's internal defence debate. In the past, French practical insistence on a purely national nuclear policy has not only been poles apart from its rhetoric over the need for a European defence policy, but has also been a point of friction with Germany.</p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: News in Brief STAMP DUTY: Mr Francis Maude, financial secretary to the Treasury, dismissed as 'nonsensical' suggestions that the abolition until August 19 of stamp duty on properties valued up to Pounds 250,000 had failed to revive the housing market. Mr Maude, who moved the second reading of the Stamp Duty (Temporary Provisions) Bill, estimated that during the eight months moratorium some 90 per cent of private house purchases - some 600,000 transactions - would not bear stamp duty. Mr John Marek, (Lab, Wrexham) a shadow treasury spokesman, argued that the Bill would do nothing to help those who had bought homes during the housing market boom and now found themselves with mortgage loans which exceeded the value of their properties. ***** TV COVERAGE: The Liberal Democrats yesterday called for assurances from broadcasters that they would be given parity of coverage with the other two parties during the election. In a memorandum to the directors-general of the BBC and the ITA, Mr Des Wilson, the party's campaigns manager, also asked the broadcasters to consider the question of balance in pre-election campaigning more seriously. Party leader Mr Paddy Ashdown said yesterday that the Liberal Democrats would seek freedom-of-information legislation in the next parliament. ***** SPYCATCHER: The government said yesterday that its litigation in connection with former MI5 agent Mr Peter Wright's book Spycatcher had now cost it more than Pounds 2.2m, excluding contempt proceedings and officials' time. ***** SUNDAY TRADING: Sir Patrick Mayhew, attorney-general, yesterday described as 'unsatisfactory' the present situation on Sunday opening of stores, as he came under fresh pressure over his refusal to intervene to stop Sunday trading. Sir Patrick said he had received about 2,000 letters criticising his stance.</p>

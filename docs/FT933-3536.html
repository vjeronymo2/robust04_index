			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Belgian and Portuguese central banks reduce short-term interest rates The central banks of Belgium and Portugal slightly reduced their short-term interest rates yesterday, following the Bundesbank's cut in its internationally sensitive discount rate last week, writes James Blitz. However, the French authorities surprised some dealers by keeping their official rates unchanged. Belgium cut its end-of-day interest rate from 12.25 per cent to 12 per cent, having last week cut its discount rate by  1/2 a percentage point and its central rate by  1/4 of a percentage point. Portugal reduced its emergency lending rate from 12.375 per cent to 12.25 per cent. Both moves followed the  1/2 percentage point cut in the German discount rate to 6.25 per cent last week. They were accompanied by sharp appreciations of both currencies. The Belgian franc closed at BFr21.23 against the D-Mark from a previous BFr21.47 and the escudo at Es101.58 from Es102.38.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General Leonid Ivashov by Colonel </F> Nikolay Portnikov; place and date not given: "`We Are Bound by  Deep Historical Roots': The CIS Military Cooperation  Coordination Staff Has Its Own Plan of a Defensive Alliance  Different From NATO's"]    [Text] Lieutenant General Leonid Grigoryevich Ivashov  was born in 1943 in Kyrgyzia [Kyrgyzstan] to a worker's family.  After high school graduation, a military school officer  candidate, army service, and training at the M.V. Frunze  Military Academy. He worked for a long time in the USSR Ministry  of Defense central administrative offices and was head of its  Administrative Department. A candidate of historical sciences  and the author of scientific works. In May 1992 he was  unanimously elected secretary of the Council of Defense  Ministers of Commonwealth states.    [Plotnikov] Leonid Grigoryevich, in the opinion of certain  political scientists, military experts, and journalists, the  military cooperation of the Commonwealth states is at an  impasse. How far does this viewpoint correspond to reality?    [Ivashov] Despite the fact that there really are many  difficulties, I would not speak talk about an impasse situation.  Everyone has now recognized that no Commonwealth state will  create modern armed forces and a dependable system of national  military security by itself. Either a pooling of efforts in the  field of military organizational development or a lengthy period  of waiting for the level of economic development of our states  to permit the appropriation of sufficient funds for the needs of  the army are needed for this. But this period would, I  emphasize, be very long. In any event, even were the second path  to be taken, integration in the military-technical sphere would  be required.    A sober estimation of the situation that has been shaping up  has recently been nudging the military-political leadership of  the Commonwealth states in the direction of the need for greater  integration not only in the economic but in the military sphere  also. What, therefore, was unacceptable a year ago, when many  people did not even allow of the idea of the formation of some  new alliances and of the creation of real, not sham, joint armed  forces, is today being spoken of insistently by many defense  ministers, of Russia--General of the Army Pavel Sergeyevich  Grachev--included.    It should be observed that the creation both of the  defensive  alliance and its main component--the Joint Armed Forces--is a  lengthy process. Calculations have shown that it will take no  fewer than two or three years. A political decision of the heads  of state and the supreme legislative bodies, with recognition in  this unifying process of the lead role of Russia, is, naturally,  essential for this first and foremost. The latter by no means  signifies attempts at the infringement of the sovereignty of any  participant in the Commonwealth or a revival of imperial  ambitions. Whether some people like it or not, historically, on  account of many objective factors, it is Russia that has been  and will continue to be the pivot and a kind of connecting link  of a unified defense space on the territory of the former USSR.    [Plotnikov] And what factors, in your opinion, explain the  need for the reconstitution of the unified defense space?    [Ivashov] There are many such factors. But three main ones,  I  would say.    First, the troop groupings and all the defense systems (air  defense, ABM defenses, command and control and communications,  and others) were for decades created on the basis of the  interests of the military security of a unified territory. The  common system of operational-strategic planning, the provision  of the troops and naval forces with equipment, and specialist  training was structured in just the same way. The military  infrastructure developed on the basis of common interests. The  disruption of this intricate organism, connected by thousands of  threads, did considerable, if not to say immense, damage to the  military security of each state of the Commonwealth and has had  a serious effect on the combat readiness of all the national  armies without exception.    Second, the economic factor. The profound integration of the  republics in the sphere of military production developed and a  single research, development, testing, and engineering took  shape and functioned successfully over decades. More than 70  head enterprises of industry and research institutions of all  states of the Commonwealth and the Baltic countries worked on  the strategic nuclear force. No republic, except for Russia, has  its own military-industrial base capable of independently  manufacturing the final models of arms and military equipment.    And, third, the moral factor. For several centuries our  peoples lived in a unified country. Whether some people like it  or not, we are bound by deep historical roots. The majority of  us, therefore, cannot be reconciled to the appearance of borders  and the severance of family and friendly ties. Is it normal when  the dream of a young man from Kyrgyzia or Uzbekistan, say, to  join the Navy cannot come true? Many people are deprived of this  opportunity at this time. Did the state lose anything when  military service was performed by young men of different  nationalities? People's trust strengthened, mutual understanding  emerged.    The officer corps, initially of the Russian, then of the  Soviet, Army, was historically international. Representatives of  over 100 nationalities and national groups were serving as  regulars on 1 January 1992. Aside from the indigenous peoples of  the 15 Union republics, there were 1,600 Poles, 1,300 Germans,  560 Koreans, 440 Bulgarians, 250 Greeks, 50 Finns, and 25 Czechs  in officer, general, and admiral ranks. There were even  representatives of so ancient a people as the Assyrians.    [Plotnikov] Which states of the Commonwealth, aside from  Russia, are advocating the creation of a new defensive alliance?    [Ivashov] From day one this idea has been supported  consistently by Kazakhstan and President Nursultan Abishevich  Nazarbayev personally. The military-political leadership of  Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzia, Tajikistan, and Armenia advocate active  integration in the military sphere and the creation of joint  armed forces. There are similar sentiments in a number of other  states of the Commonwealth also.    [Plotnikov] Following the statement of the minister of  defense of Russia concerning the need for the creation of  Commonwealth joint armed forces, skeptical words were said in  some news media about the reconstitution of a new, Warsaw  Pact-type joint armed forces....    [Ivashov] All that was best in the Warsaw Pact needs to be  adopted, in respect to the creation of joint armed forces also.  The experience that was generated cannot be denied. For together  with the shortcomings there was much that was useful also. No  one intends to copy things in full. The military-political  situation in the world has changed, and enormous geopolitical  changes have occurred on the territory of the former USSR. The  Warsaw Pact was a European defensive community, and it was  opposed by a specific enemy in the shape of NATO. The present  community is to be a defensive alliance of Eurasian countries.  Its main thrust is not against some external enemy but primarily  the defense of the national interests of each participant and  the Commonwealth as a whole. Each state has national-state  interests, and any self-respecting country will unswervingly  defend them. In addition, the tasks of the alliance are to be  the stabilization of relations within the Commonwealth itself  and the elimination of the current focal points of tension.    [Plotnikov] Nonetheless, the creation of a defensive  alliance  and joint armed forces are things of the future. There is  currently the Military Cooperation Coordination Staff. Is such a  body necessary or not?    [Ivashov] Merely the fact that the representatives of nine  republics are working at the level of deputy chiefs of staff and  that the specialist positions are manned on a coalition basis  says a great deal. Were the states of the Commonwealth not  interested in this body, the leaders of our countries would not  at the last meeting have commissioned the elaboration of plans  to extend cooperation, in the military sphere included.    It is contemplated that the adoption of a concept of  collective security, which will be of a doctrinal character in  nature, will be one of the first measures of this plan. In other  words, this will be a kind of military doctrine of the  subscribers to the Tashkent Treaty.    The next document will be devoted to a refinement of the  principles of military cooperation. It is contemplated  instituting several levels of military cooperation. It will be  realized to a fuller extent within the framework of the Tashkent  Treaty. The first--a kind of allied relations level. The  second--the level of cooperation with states of the CIS that  have not signed the Tashkent Treaty. And the third  level--cooperation with states of the far abroad.    [Plotnikov] Are the Baltic countries displaying an interest  in interaction in the military sphere with states of the  Commonwealth?    [Ivashov] There have been no active steps as yet. But I am  sure that this process will begin sooner or later, for all that.  The last two years have shown that political populism is one  thing, real life, quite another. We republics of the former  Soviet Union need only ourselves and one another. The rest have  an interest in us of an entirely different sort. Politicians  should think about the future of their children and  grandchildren. What have we left them, how will they live in the  next millennium? Destroying things requires no great  intellect....    [Plotnikov] How is the Military Cooperation Coordination  Staff's interaction with other CIS structures shaping up?    [Ivashov] We maintain the closest contacts with the CIS  Executive Secretariat in Minsk. Its secretary, Ivan Mikhaylovich  Korotchenya, regularly takes part in sessions of the Defense  Ministers Council. Our representative, Major General Volkov,  works in Minsk on a permanent basis.    The staff has good working contacts with the  Interparliamentary Assembly and with the Foreign Ministers  Council. The most important military-political questions have  been discussed repeatedly at joint sessions of the Defense  Ministers Council and the Foreign Ministers Council,  incidentally.    [Plotnikov] You recently took part, as a member of a staff  delegation, in NATO's Military Committee. The question of the  possible affiliation of Commonwealth states to the Partnership  for Peace program was discussed, inter alia....    [Ivashov] I would like to mention first and foremost that  quite serious attention was paid to our delegation. The speeches  of the head of the delegation, Colonel General Samsonov, chief  of the CIS Military Cooperation Coordination Staff, attracted  great attention. We were convinced once again that mutual  cooperation is essential. Everyone benefits from this. As far as  the affiliation of Russia and the other states of the  Commonwealth to NATO's partnership program is concerned, too  much attention is being paid to this question, in my opinion. We  have other, more important problems, that have to be resolved.    Without rejecting the idea of the Partnership for Peace  program or the participation of the CIS states in this process,  it is necessary in principle to give the creation of our own,  Eurasian, system of collective security priority. Viktor  Nikolayevich Samsonov proposed a version of cooperation between  the two defensive alliances according to the 16+9 formula, which  had been formulated by the staff, coordinated at the last  session of the Defense Ministers Council, and initialed by eight  ministers. We believe that this would be more effective in the  interests of the maintenance of a stable military-political  atmosphere in the world and the defense of the national-state  interests of Russia and the other states of the Commonwealth.</p>

			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> * 'Governor Goofy' Replies: Newsweek called him "Minnesota's 'Governor Goofy,'  " but Gov. Rudy Perpich says Minnesotans won't be swayed by the newsweekly  article. On Tuesday, Perpich, a Democrat seeking reelection, dismissed the  article in the Jan. 22 issue as a political attack orchestrated by Republican  campaign consultant Roger Ailes, who was hired by Republican gubernatorial  candidate Doug Kelley. Kelley and Newsweek denied that Ailes had anything to do  with the article. As an example of Perpich's "iconoclasm," the magazine said  Perpich once ordered all the coffee urns in the Statehouse unplugged to save  energy.  </P> <P> * Special Delivery: Cupid has a new message for lovers this Valentine's Day  from Loveland, Colo. People around the world send their Valentines through the  Loveland post office to get a verse on the special postmark. Ted Thompson, 85,  has been coming up with verses since 1947. This year the verse is: "It might  just be a song bird,/Or perhaps some sparkling dew,/That brings fond  recollections,/And a timeless cupid too."  </P> <P> * Second Thoughts: CBS anchorman Dan Rather says he has "no alibis, no excuses"  for his one-time experiment with heroin. In the 1950s, Rather had a police  employee in Houston inject him with heroin so he would better understand the  drug for a story he was writing. Rather was in Baltimore Tuesday to address an  anti-drug assembly for seventh-graders.  </P> <P> * Video Search: When 4-year-old John Ross Cannon got a hug from Mickey Mouse at  Disney World last April, it was a special moment, one of the last his family  got to share with him before the child died of a brain tumor a month later. His  parents, Larry and Tammy Cannon, have pictures to remember the moment, but they  want something more. The Cannons are searching for several people with video  cameras who may have captured the hug on tape. "I know there were a number of  people there, shooting videos," Tammy Cannon said Tuesday in Charleston, S.C.  YEMI TOURE  </P></p>

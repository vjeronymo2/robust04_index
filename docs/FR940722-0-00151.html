Extensions of the temporary authorization for a period of 180 days each may also be granted, but the applicant bears a heavy burden to show that extraordinary circumstances warrant such an extension. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) In cases of emergency found by the Commission, involving danger to life or property or due to damage of equipment, or during a national emergency proclaimed by the president or declared by the Congress or during the continuance of any war in which the United States is engaged and when such action is necessary for the national defense or safety or otherwise in furtherance of the war effort, or in cases of emergency where the Commission finds that it would not be feasible to secure renewal applications from existing licensees or otherwise to follow normal licensing procedure, the Commission will grant radio station authorizations and station licenses, or modifications or renewals thereof, during the emergency found by the Commission or during the continuance of any such national emergency or war, as special temporary licenses, only for the period of emergency or war requiring such action, without the filing of formal applications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;24.826  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Receipt of application; Applications in the broadband Personal Communications Services filed on FCC Form 175 and other applications in the broadband Personal Communications Services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) All applications for the initial provision of broadband PCS must be submitted on FCC Forms 175 and 175&hyph;S.

FCC Form 401 (``Application for New or Modified Common Carrier Radio Station Under Part 22'') must be submitted by each winning bidder for each broadband PCS license for which application was made on FCC Form 175. In the event that mutual exclusivity does not exist between applicants for a broadband PCS license that have filed FCC Form 175, the sole applicant will be required to file FCC Form 401. The aforementioned Forms 175, 175&hyph;S, and 401 are subject to the provisions of 47 CFR Part 1, Subpart Q (``Competitive Bidding Proceedings'') and Subpart H of this Part. Blanket licenses are granted for each market frequency block. Applications for individual sites are not needed and will not be accepted.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  &sect;24.11. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Applications received for filing are given a file number.

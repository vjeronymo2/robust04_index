			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou clarified that  our country is ready for talks with Skopje, but remains firm on  the issue of the state's name. [passage omitted]    Asked whether Greece violates international law with the  measures against Skopje, government spokesman Evangelos  Venizelos said the Greek Government calmly and carefully  examined all aspects, both legal and political. On the goods  that are allowed to move from Thessaloniki port to and from  Skopje, Venizelos said the National Economy Ministry will issue  a circular with instructions based on the decisions made by the  government yesterday. The ministry will define the scope of the  customs authorities' authority. He said, however, that there is  a complete ban excluding only diplomatic, UN, and CSCE  delegations. [passage omitted]    Diplomatic correspondent Mirella Kalostipi reported a short  time ago that with the adoption of measures against Skopje, the  Greek Government aims to make this state realize its provocative  stance toward Greece. According to reliable information, the  measures may become even harsher if Skopje continues its  intransigence. The Greek side is convinced that the specific  measures do not violate either European or international law.    Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou today said that  Skopje should finally get reasonable. Asked whether the  measures were adopted at the wrong time, Papandreou said the  time was wrong for various countries to recognize Skopje.  Mentioning that there is a crisis in Athens-Skopje relations,  Papandreou said he hopes a solution is found through this  crisis. He added that the Greek Government believes the  measures will lead more directly and effectively to a solution  of the problem. [passage omitted]    Asked how much the measures against Skopje will affect the  crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the possible bombing, the  government spokesman said the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina and  NATO decisions have no connection with Skopje.</p>

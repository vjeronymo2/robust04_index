			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Italy's CD party refuses to let leader quit ITALY'S Christian Democrats yesterday unanimously rejected an offer to resign by Mr Mino Martinazzoli, the party leader. The resignation offer followed the party's poor performance in administrative elections this month. Mr Martinazzoli's attempt to stand down from his job, ostensibly in response to the electoral setback, also reflects his mounting frustration at the failure of senior party leaders to rally to his calls for reform and a stream of recent leaks to the press by party members opposed to change. A special party conference, expected on July 15-17, could be the last chance to stave off a split between reformists, who are demanding a change of name and strategy, and those opposed to radical change. The Christian Democrats have been linked to some of the worst excesses of the corruption scandals and top party figures who allegedly took kickbacks have refused to step down. The party lost control of a number of big Italian cities in the local elections and saw their support shrink in much of the country, including parts of the south where they had traditionally been the dominant political force. Earlier this year, Mr Mario Segni, one of the most popular politicians in the country who headed the referendum movement, left in frustration at the party's inability to promote reform from within.</p>

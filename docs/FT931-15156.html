			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Futures Exchanges Yesterday's agreement between the Paris and Frankfurt futures exchanges suggests there are still too many European markets chasing too little liquidity. Even without monetary union, the existence of more than 20 independent exchanges seems hard to justify. If the Ecu ever makes the grade as a common currency, instruments denominated in D-Marks or guilders will be an anachronism. By banding together last year, four of the smaller fry recognised as much. Unlike that alliance, a partnership of Europe's second and third largest exchanges could mount a credible challenge to Liffe. There is plenty of scope for disappointment. Matif and DTB have yet to thrash out much detail. If the Franco-German alliance ever reaches fruition, though, the exchanges will be trading the same contracts on a common screen-based system with compatible arrangements for clearing and the like. Since the success of any contract turns on its ability to attract liquidity, Liffe would then be hard pressed to maintain its enviable record of capturing market share. All the more so if other exchanges join up too. Having put the DTB's nose out of joint with the success of its German bond future - and won more than one head-to-head contest with the Matif - that route is hardly open to Liffe. Its international membership and faith in open-outcry trading have traditionally pulled the crowds. Splendid isolation may be more difficult to justify.</p>

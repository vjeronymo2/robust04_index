			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Protsenko under the "Changing of the </F> Cadres" rubric: "The Governors Have Dumped Their Curator"]    [Text] Having familiarized himself with Boris  Yeltsin's edict on the reorganization of the territorial affairs  department of the president's administration, the head of this  department, Nikolay Medvedev, took to his hospital bed. That is,  already the department's former head....    The reorganization of the department had long been in the  works, and that with the active leadership participation of  Medvedev himself. However, at the last moment, an additional  point appeared in the presidential edict approving the  structural and compositional changes to be made, directing  Sergey Filatov to engage in a search for a candidate to the post  of UDT [territorial affairs department] head. Department  officials were completely bewildered, for everyone knew that  Medvedev was the protege of that same Filatov.    Nikolay Pavlovich appeared in the president's administration  soon after the arrival there of Sergey Aleksandrovich, who even  during his work in parliament had had his eye on the energetic  and efficient chairman of the Soviet of Nationalities commission  on national-state structure and inter-nation relations. Filatov  was bothered neither by Medvedev's "classical"  cosmopolitan-party past nor by the fact that Medvedev had never  had the reputation of a "convinced Yeltsinite," but had in  parliament begun with cooperation with the Communists for  Democracy faction and had finished as a member of the Left  Center--Cooperation faction.    Medvedev's promotion to the post of deputy head of the  president's administration responsible for work with the  territories was actively opposed by the leaders of Democratic  Russia, who accused the promoted one of "insufficient  democratism in his convictions" and of besmirching connections  with the oppositionists. Nikolay Medvedev, for example, spoke  out actively against the democratic Mordovian [Mordvinian]  President Guslyannikov. Some even assert that Medvedev voted for  the impeachment of Boris Yeltsin.    Nevertheless, the appointment of Nikolay Pavlovich took  place--in spite of, or perhaps thanks to, his aloofness, as it  were, from the "president's team": Such a person, evidently,  would have an easier time finding a common language with the  heads of local administrations, far from all of whom were  "Yeltsin's people."    It soon became clear, however, that it was precisely with  the  regions that Medvedev could not find a common language. Almost  from the very beginning of his work, complaints rained down from  the localities on the administrative-command management style of  the new deputy head of the presidential administration.  Evidently, it was that same "cosmopolitan-party past" of  Medvedev's, to which Filatov did not pay attention, that made  itself felt. Nikolay Pavlovich often tried to build his  relations with the governors of the krays and oblasts of Russia  on a "departmental" or "directive" basis. Medvedev became  particularly active during the days of the September-October  opposition, sending out "to the localities" threatening  directives that warned about the "personal responsibility" of  people whose support was necessary to the president, but whom  Medvedev almost set against Yeltsin with his harshness and  peremptoriness.    Even less satisfied with Medvedev were the president's  representatives in the republics, krays, and oblasts. In the  words of several of them, the territorial affairs department  tried in every way to turn the representatives of the president  into "state informants," but at the slightest conflict with the  governors refused the president's representatives support.    All of this, apparently, served as a reason for Nikolay  Medvedev's current dismissal from the post that he held.  Although this dismissal also has its own logic: People of a  "command style" were in demand in the administration during the  period of tight territorial management, whereas now in the  relations with the governors' corps, a little more sugar and a  little less vinegar is needed--the times are not the same.    A successor to Nikolay Medvedev has not yet been found. But  apparat life in the president's administration is not standing  still: According to the latest information, by directive of  Sergey Filatov, a new section is being created within the  territorial affairs department, as whose head has been appointed  Doku Zavgayev--former first secretary of the Checheno-Ingushetia  Oblast Party Committee of the CPSU, who was divested of power by  Khasbulatov for his support of the August putsch. A cadre, as  they say, of proven worth.</p>

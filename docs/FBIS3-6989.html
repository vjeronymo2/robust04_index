			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor by </F> unidentified NHK reporter at his office in Washington on 21  March; from "NHK News" Program; Kantor's comments are in English  -- recorded]    [Text] In an interview with an NHK reporter on 21 March,  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor stressed that the  resumption of Japan-U.S. framework talks would be possible  depending on the package of measures the Japanese Government  planned to map out in late March to open its markets.    [Begin Kantor recording] We hope that it is aggressive and  bold, in that there will be a good enough package to restart  talks under the framework. What I want to talk about is Japan's  having a bold package of market-opening items that will help us  reengage this process. [end recording]    In this way, Mr. Kantor stressed that the resumption of  Japan-U.S. framework talks is possible depending on the package  of measures the Japanese Government plans to map out in late  March to open its markets.    [Begin Kantor recording] I think it should not escape our  attention that the Japanese market is the most closed market of  any developed country in the world. [end recording]    Mr. Kantor's remarks emphasized that the United States will  continue to use sanctions as a weapon to press Japan to open its  market. The U.S. Trade Representative plans to release an  annual report on foreign trade barriers in late March which  could be used as evidence in the decision to invoke the Super  301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act against Japan's  foreign trade barriers.    Commenting on the release of the report, Mr. Kantor said the  United States wants to speedily resolve procurement by the  Japanese Government and the automobile sector. In the interview  he suggested that the two sectors might be singled out in the  report as examples of closed Japanese markets in the report.</p>

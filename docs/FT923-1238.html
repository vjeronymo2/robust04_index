			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Leading Article: A time for leadership UNSURPRISINGLY, in the light of the events of the past eight days, the prime minister has lost much of his authority. His credibility is near to zero. He put his shirt on Britain's permanent adherence to a particular parity with the D-Mark, and lost. He staked his good name on steadfast adherence to the Maastricht treaty, and saw his stake swept away. He gambled on a carefully nurtured friendship with the German chancellor, and was disillusioned. Now it is asked of Mr John Major that he rise above these disappointments. It is a great deal to expect of any individual. The debate in the House of Commons this afternoon is ostensibly about the future of Britain and Europe, but there is a possibility that it will degenerate into a slanging match about the fitness for office of the prime minister and his party. Labour will have to show self-restraint if it is not to initiate such a contest. It is, however, open to Mr Major to set the tone for a serious assessment at a time of genuine national concern. To achieve this, he must indicate that he is no longer befuddled by the hour-to-hour tactics that have characterised so much of what the government has done over the past week. What is not required is a rehearsal of the by now familiar catalogue of explanations and excuses for the devaluation of the pound. It would be particularly destructive to add to the heaped-up pile of doubts about the position of Britain within any exchange rate mechanism, however strengthened, or any version of the Maastricht treaty, however revised. A U-turn switching the Conservative party away from being the 'party of Europe' towards the narrow nationalism that so ill-fitted Labour before 1983 would be a humiliation for the Tories and a disaster for Britain. Much will depend upon nuance. The existing Maastricht treaty has no future, but the process of amending it can be either constructive or destructive. Britain should be a friendly participant in the discussions among the 12. It is one thing to wait a few weeks for the Danes to declare their hand; it is quite another to indicate that Britain will not attempt to ratify Maastricht-as-amended until a second Danish referendum has come back with a positive vote. It makes sense to link the ERM and Maastricht, but it is perfidious to suggest that assent to the latter can only follow the elimination of the 'fault lines' in the former. Much more will depend upon tone. 'Overall,' Mr Major might say, as he did on September 7, 'the treaty is good for Britain and good for Europe.' He could add that 'what lies at the heart of the community . . . is the notion that by binding together the nations of Europe in a common economic framework it would be possible to build an inextricable network of shared interests that would render war between former enemies impossible.' This would be better than chants about the franc's current difficulties. It would challenge Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, to live up to his solidly pro-European stance. It would not create hostages to fortune against the day when Britain once again participates wholeheartedly in European affairs. Such a speech would begin the process of rehabilitation of the prime minister. Anything less would not.</p>

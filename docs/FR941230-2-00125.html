			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Therefore, it is critical to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  &bull;Offer parents the tools they need to nurture their children effectively, through parent training classes and home visitation programs, including parents of offenders and juvenile offenders who are teen parents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  &bull;Enable children to enter kindergarten ready for school with a chance to succeed, through programs such as Head Start and HIPPY.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  &bull;Keep students in school, where they can acquire the tools to become self-sufficient through truancy and dropout prevention and intervention programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  &bull;Given youth a positive alternative to being out on the street and the violence this encourages through after-school activities and conflict resolution programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  &bull;Provide youth with positive role models through mentoring programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Early intervention programs, based on a proper assessment, should be available the first time a juvenile commits an offense. A variety of innovative early intervention programs for first-time, nonviolent offenders have been implemented successfully. They include neighborhood resource teams, informal probation, peer mediation, community service, victim awareness programs, restitution, day treatment, alternative education, and outpatient alcohol and drug abuse treatment. These types of programs need to be replicated across America.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  We also need to ensure that sanctions are available for more serious offenders and for offenders who have failed to benefit from the early intervention described above. Such sanctions include drug testing, weekend detention, intensive supervision for probationers, inpatient drug and alcohol abuse treatment, electronic monitoring, community-based residential programs, and boot camps.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Secure facilities are needed for serious, violent, and chronic offenders who require a structured treatment environment or who threaten community safety. If a review of the nature of the offense, the offender's amenability to treatment, and the offenders' record indicate that the juvenile justice system cannot provide appropriate services and adequately protect the community, the prosecution of such offenders in the criminal courts may be required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Finally, aftercare, or ``community care,'' must be more than an afterthought. Such services must be an integral aspect of all dispositions involving residential placement and include the active involvement of the child's family. It makes little sense to intervene in a significant way in children's lives only to send those children back into the same environment without a support system for the family and child. OJJDP's intensive aftercare program is developing the programmatic policy and underpinnings for enhancing our efforts in this vital area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  As a result of research and evaluation, we can now point to a variety of program models that can reduce delinquency and youth violence. We should base program development on this research and, whenever possible, evaluate funded programs to measure their impact. We also need to provide information, technical assistance, and training on the most promising programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Protecting our communities and protecting our children: this two-part strategy lies at the heart of OJJDP's leadership of the Nation's efforts to prevent and combat delinquency and of the programs proposed in this plan. Community-based, collaborative efforts that involve comprehensive strategies aimed at reducing delinquency and youth violence will be critical to our success. Federal departments whose programs affect youth must work in an interdisciplinary manner, adopting this approach. With the tools provided by the Crime Act_including enhanced community-oriented policing, delinquency prevention programs, and new correctional programs and facilities_we have an opportunity to build prevention and intervention strategies that can be implemented to reduce juvenile delinquency and violence across America.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> OJJDP's Comprehensive Response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Attorney General, Justice Department policy officials, and OJJDP have called for an unprecedented national commitment of public and private resources, and commitment to reversing recent trends in juvenile violence and juvenile victimization in our Nation. OJJDP's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comprehensive Strategy for Serious, Violent, and Chronic Juvenile Offenders <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is the centerpiece of this call for action. It outlines two principle components: prevention and intervention.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Prevention is the most cost-effective means of dealing with delinquency. The prevention component of the strategy calls for establishing community-based planning teams with broad participation. Collaborative efforts must be made between the juvenile justice system and other service systems, including mental health, health, child welfare, and education. Effective delinquency prevention programs are based on a risk-focused approach in which communities systematically assess their delinquency problem in relation to known risk factors and implement programs to counteract them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

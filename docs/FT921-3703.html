			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Japan agrees limited increase to cartel fine JAPAN's ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) have agreed that the maximum fine for violators of anti-monopoly laws should be raised from Y5m (Pounds 22,000) to Y100m, far below the Y300m earlier proposed by the FTC, writes Robert Thomson. Senior politicians told the commission that they would not approve the introduction of legislation containing penalties of above Y100m, as Japanese companies had complained to the ruling party that the FTC's proposal was excessive. The US had demanded that Japan revise the schedule of fines for violators and increase the staff at the commission - which has been condemned by corporate Japan for being too vigorous in its pursuit of offenders. In reaching the Y100m figure, Japanese officials attempted to balance their responsibilities to politically influential companies and to the US, which has complained that cartels are common in Japan, making foreign market access difficult. It is expected that the legislation will be presented to parliament later this month.</p>

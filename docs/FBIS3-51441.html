During the meeting attempts will be made to find solutions  to  the public order problems that have occurred during the past  weeks in the border region. These problems include the death of  several Ecuadoran soldiers, which are believed to have been  caused by the Simon Bolivar National Guerrilla Coordinating  Board [CNGSB].    Colombian Army Commander General Hernan Jose Guzman pointed  out that during this meeting, which will be held behind closed  doors, they will attempt to establish the accuracy of reports  circulating in Colombia. These reports are related to Ecuadoran  Army units arresting several Colombian peasants on Colombian  territory and accusing them of being guerrilla members.    Likewise, the meeting is intended to "formulate plans  against  guerrilla and criminal activities in the border region between  both countries," Gen. Guzman emphasized. The officer also  pointed out that the meeting constitutes part of the agreements  signed several weeks ago by both countries' defense ministers.</p>

Many more were injured in the explosion on November 26  that completely destroyed the factory's main workshop, causing  damage estimated at 2.5 million yuan (300,000 dollars), the  newspaper said. Among the dead were four officers from the  northwest Lanzhou military region who were visiting the factory.  The shock waves from the blast hit a further 22 employees in  another workshop some 100 meters (yards) away, killing three.    A top-level investigation into the incident was launched by  the ministries of public security and national defence, and the  leadership of the Guangzhou military zone which includes Hunan  province, the report said. Initial enquiries have blamed the  explosion on a young worker, Tan Zhixin, who had been censured  by factory officials for gambling and had a request to join the  unit's driving pool turned down.    On November 26, Tan reportedly told his friends over lunch  in  a restaurant that he had to eat and drink well because he  intended to blow up the workshop and kill himself in the  process. Later that afternoon, Tan entered the workshop with a  number of detonators which he used to set off the explosion, the  newspaper said.</p>

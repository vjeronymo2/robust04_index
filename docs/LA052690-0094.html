			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> GM Shareholders OK Pension Plan: The provision to boost executive pensions  nearly doubles the annual retirement pay of outgoing Chairman Roger B. Smith to  about $1.1 million. Pensions for executives versus hourly workers will likely  be a hot topic when negotiations between GM and the United Auto Workers union  open in July, just a few weeks before Smith retires July 31. Also at the  four-hour annual meeting, Smith said GM would begin building cars in an East  German joint venture in October, becoming the first U.S. auto maker to make  vehicles in Eastern Europe.  </P></p>

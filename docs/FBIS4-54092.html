			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] A central report meeting is going to be held  here in the Cultural Palace of the People, marking the 55th  anniversary of the victory in the Musan District Battle which  was personally organized and commanded by the great leader  Comrade Kim Il-song. [passage omitted]    Seated on the rostrum were Pak Song-chol, member of the  Political Bureau of the Workers Party of Korea [WPK] Central  Committee and vice president; Choe Kwang, member of the  Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee and chief of  General Staff of the Korean People's Army; candidate members of  the Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee; secretaries  of the party Central Committee; vice premiers of the State  Administration Council; responsible functionaries of party,  government, administrative, economic, and working people's  organizations; and anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters.  [applause]    Paek Hak-yon, permanent vice chairman of the Pyongyang  Municipal People's Committee, presides over the meeting.  [passage omitted]    [Begin Paek speech] [passage omitted] Kang Sok-sung, member  of the WPK Central Committee and director of the Party History  Institute, will deliver a report. [applause] [passage omitted]    [Begin Kang speech] [passage omitted] Our party and the  government of the Republic have made every effort to achieve the  fatherland's reunification based on the principle of national  independence in conformity with all the people's desire and the  demand of the times.    However, our generous [aryang innun] proposals for the  fatherland's reunification and all the people's aspiration for  the reunification have not been realized because of the U.S. and  South Korean authorities' splittist line and war maneuver.    The U.S. imperialists are adhering to the military adventure  to crush [apsalhagi wihan kunsajok mohom] our socialist cause,  stirring up the anti-Republic pressure commotion in the  international arena over our nuclear problem.    Obsessed with war frenzy [chonjaeng kwangjunge hwanjangi  toen], the Kim Yong-sam group is going to resume the Team Spirit  nuclear war exercise by bringing U.S. nuclear war equipment such  as Patriot missiles into South Korea, mentioning strong-arm  countermeasure against us in collusion with outside forces. It  is also openly promoting [kochwi] a war mood for northward  invasion while talking about assuming a prompt dashing-in  posture in the event of an emergency [yusasi chukkak torip  taese].    The U.S. imperialists and their followers are frantically  running wild to isolate and suffocate our Republic and to crush  [apsal] our socialism over the nuclear issue. Any pressure or  threat, however, cannot work with us. They cannot resolve the  issue by adhering to such a method, and this only drives the  situation towards catastrophe [sataerul pagugero molgogalsu  issumnida].    The United States and the South Korean authorities should  behave discreetly, facing all facts squarely. [passage omitted]</p>

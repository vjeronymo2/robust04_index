			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Books: Feminist mauling of the power of myth - A deconstruction of fairy-tales FROM THE BEAST TO THE BLONDE by Marina Warner Chatto and Windus Pounds 20, 480 pages Of all art forms, the fairy-tale is the most reliable barometer of a society's cultural priorities. It is the oldest popular literature we know, and responses to it have always spoken loudly for their times. In the 18th century - the Age of Reason - fairy-tales were banned from the nursery as dangerously imaginative. With the Victorians, their innocent heroines were sentimentalised - Dickens said perfect bliss would be to marry Little Red Riding Hood. In the 1930s, the Nazis billed the Grimm Brothers' stories as pure Aryan volk tales, advertisements for the German heritage. Marina Warner, one of the best-known cultural commentators of the 1990s, has brought the politically correct cliches and intellectual fripperies of contemporary mediaspeak to bear on fairy-tales. The book confirms what the Reith lectures earlier this year suggested: that Warner is not a serious thinker in search of the truth but a propagandist for a brand of popular, feminist prejudice. She uses the trappings of scholarly reference and literary allusion to deliver familiar ideas which neither challenge nor illuminate the received wisdoms of our age. From the Beast to the Blonde says that fairy-tales offer a misogynist view of female characters. This misogyny can be traced to the 'particular web of tensions in which women were enmeshed' when the stories were first recorded, but it is now outdated and we should develop alternative readings. Warner shows convincingly how features of fairy-tales that we take for granted are rooted in specific historical periods. Mothers are absent because they often died in childbirth: Cinderella, in sackcloth and ashes, is a child mourning her mother. Stepmothers are present because widowers generally remarried: 80 per cent did so within a year in 17th- and 18th-century France, when the early literary versions of Cinderella and other tales were written by courtly authors like Charles Perrault. Arranged marriages, dynastic feuds, dowries - all were part of the daily fabric from which the tales emerged, and explain why evil stepmothers and cruel stepsisters play vital roles. Warner presents her case as a quarrel with a second - and by no means a contradictory - interpretation of these characters: as archetypes who tell us less about history than about the human psyche. Bruno Bettelheim, in his seminal book The Uses of Enchantment (1976), crystallised this psycho-analytical view, showing brilliantly how the tales confront unconscious dilemmas and help resolve them through fantasy - sibling rivalry in Cinderella, mother/daughter friction in Sleeping Beauty, fear of abandonment in Hansel and Gretel. Bettelheim spoke up for the evil stepmother, arguing that she licensed children's fantasies of hatred by preserving the idea of the good real mother, and that when she is offset by a fairy godmother, as in Cinderella, a child can work through his sense of a parent as both benign and threatening. For Warner, 'this archetypal approach leeches history out of fairy-tale . . . Bettelheim's theory has contributed to the continuing absence of good mothers from fairy-tales in all kinds of media, and to a dangerous degree which itself mirrors current prejudices and reinforces them'. Evil stepmothers, ogresses, ugly sisters have become 'hallowed, inevitable symbols, while figures like the Beast bridegroom have been granted ever more positive status . . . the danger of women has become more and more part of the story, and correspondingly, the danger of men has receded'. To want fairy-tales without stepmothers and ogresses is to want Hamlet without the prince. Characters from great literature are both archetypal and historically specific, to deny one or the other is to make a nonsense of how art develops out of the particular to show the universal. Jane Austen's characters, for example, are unimaginable outside their calm 18th-century houses, yet they survive in our imagination because they go so far beyond them in their timeless human experiences. There are other flaws in Warner's attempt to talk away the power of myth. Her evidence for misogyny is ridiculously weighted. The handful of bad women she fixes on can easily be matched by a cast of male horrors - Bluebeard, Rumpelstiltskin, ogres and giants, the child murderer in Babes in the Wood. More seriously, her argument that outmoded stereotypes still shape the tales conflicts crucially with the central piece of criticism in the book, the deconstruction of Beauty and the Beast. Warner examines how recent versions  -Angela Carter's retellings, the Disney film - reflect two shifts in modern sensibility. One is the revolution in attitudes to animals, now romanticised rather than feared as in medieval Europe, when bears roamed the woods on the outskirts of town. In the film, the cuddly Beast resembles the American buffalo and 'represents the lost innocence of the plains before man came to plunder'. The second is sexual liberation. Where once the Beast had to be tamed, now he answers Beauty's desire for wild sexuality. The Disney film was made not only for Me-generation kids - the first song is 'I want much more than they've got planned' - but for mums raised on Gloria Steinem and the ecology movement. It indicates the extent to which feminist thought now governs popular culture, and it reduces to absurdity Warner's conspiracy theory that 'as individual women's voices have become absorbed into the corporate body of male-dominated decision-makers', fairy-tales have become the province of misogynist tellers. From the Beast to the Blonde joins the fray of one of the great intellectual battles this century: feminism versus psycho-analysis. But, unlike Warner's previous subject - the Virgin Mary, Joan of Arc - Goldi-locks and Jack and the Beanstalk do not fit easily into the grooves of sexual politics. As a result, the book carries a tone of carping insecurity and complaint which sits oddly with both the subject of fairy-tales and with Warner's intelligence and scholarly ability. Both Bettelheim and Iona and Peter Opie, the other great modern writers on the tales, echo in their criticism the upbeat optimistic mood of fairy-tales themselves. The Uses of Enchantment ends with an account of family happiness: 'This is one of the manifold truths revealed by fairy-tales, which can guide our lives; it is a truth as valid today as it was once upon a time.' By contrast, Warner concludes on a note as weak as Bettelheim's is strong: 'It is time for wishful thinking to have its due.' It is the difference between a critic who was wise enough to stand outside his times and write what he believed in, and one who is pandering to popular prejudices.</p>

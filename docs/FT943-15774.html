			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / International Company News: Bunnings valued well above suitor's offer Bunnings, the Western Australian forest products, manufacturing and merchandising group facing a bid of more than ADollars 535m (USDollars 390.5m) from Wesfarmers, said yesterday Price Waterhouse, called in as an independent adviser, had valued its shares at between ADollars 12.52 and ADollars 13.61. This is much higher than the ADollars 10.40-a-share cash alternative being offered by the bidder, which already holds a 48.1 per cent interest in its target. Bunnings said its advisers had put the value of Wesfarmers' paper alternative at between ADollars 9.96 and ADollars 10.46 a share, and again urged shareholders to reject the current terms. 'The conclusions of the independent expert support the committee's opinion that the current offer price is inadequate,' Bunnings said. Lawyers for Rank Commercial, the New Zealand-based company bidding around ADollars 500m for Australia's Foodland Associated, told a court yesterday Rank would drop the offer if the injunction sought by the Trade Practices Commission was granted. Rank plans to sell Foodland's Australian assets on to Coles Myers if successful with the bid. The TPC, Australia's competition watchdog, has sought the injunction because of concerns over Coles' potential grip on the grocery market. Shares in Dominion Mining fell 3 Australian cents, to 44 cents, yesterday, after the smaller Gold Mines of Australia said it was abandoning its takeover bid for the group.</p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOOKS: TURNING UP AGAIN;  </P> <P> THE 'GIDGET'-STYLE FLIP IS BACK -- BUT NOW IT'S TAILORED FOR THE EXECUTIVE SET  </P> <P> ADVERTISING executives project that American women are heading into a period of  "neo-traditionalism," a return to time-honored attitudes, values and styles.  The trend is giving rise to hairdos that are classic, feminine and  non-threatening, looks reminiscent of the pre-women's-movement '50s and '60s.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most evocative do is the flip. Yes, the sugar-sweet style with  turned-up ends is back. The original, usually featuring a back-combed crown,  clip-on bows and lots of spray, was worn by Sandra Dee in "Gidget," Doris Day  and Jacqueline Kennedy. The 1989 version is softer, more tailored and worn  closer to the head than its pouffed predecessor.  </P> <P> Both flips developed because women and their stylists were bored. Thirty years  ago, women were tired of the rounded, teased bubble. So savvy hairdressers like  Manhattan's Kenneth, who designed Kennedy's style, urged their clients to let  their hair grow past chin length so that the ends could be flipped, creating a  style that was slightly elongated, yet full at the crown, sides and back.  </P> <P> Today, the smooth, turned-under bob -- or "power cut," as it has come to be  known -- looks tired. Once again, stylists are asking their clients to gain a  bit of length and to experiment with upturned ends.  </P> <P> But few hairdressers are pulling out rollers and clips for the new version.  Instead, it is created with a precise cut and a blow dryer. As Alex Doyle of  the Doyle Wilson salon on Melrose Avenue explains: "A graduated edge -- rather  than a straight blunt cut -- allows the hair to flip. Then, by holding the  dryer underneath the ends, the hair naturally turns up."  </P> <P> Hair stylist Blase, who flips hair at the Char Salon in Beverly Hills,  acknowledges that for some women a flat crown isn't flattering, but he still  discourages back-combing. Blase cuts height into the style by creating tufts at  the crown. He finishes the look with eyebrow-length bangs.  </P> <P> The flip started showing up in fashion magazines last month. Susan Dey of "L.A.  Law" flipped the ends of her bob when she appeared on "Late Night With David  Letterman" recently, and Candice Bergen was spotted in Beverly Hills with  turned-up ends. Marilyn Quayle, wife of Vice President Dan Quayle, also wears a  flip, but she has been criticized for sporting an outdated version. Instead of  being flat and gently bent upwards, hers is pouffed, reminiscent of the old  Kennedy style.  </P> <P> Doyle, who created the flip shown in Redken International's latest national ad,  says that the style is particularly important now because it creates a  triangular line, a shape that is reflected in spring fashion silhouettes.  </P> <P> "This is a very American trend," adds Blase, who represented Redken at a recent  international hair-styling competition in Dusseldorf, Germany. "European movie  stars like Gina Lollobrigida and Brigitte Bardot copied Jackie Kennedy's look  and turned it into an international trend. Now it's new again, but the first  baby boomers can take out their old high school snapshots and see how they  looked in bubble-style flips."  </P> <P> Hair: Eusebio / Doyle Wilson Salon; makeup: Edward Sanchez / Doyle Wilson  Salon; model: Carmen / Elite  </P></p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: Thyssen slides into the red THYSSEN, the German steel and engineering group, has made a pre-tax loss of DM515m (Dollars 317.3m) for the six months ended March, against a DM376m profit a year ago. Turnover for the period was 9 per cent lower at DM16.44bn. The sharp fall reflects a 19 per cent sales drop in the group's core steel business. Production of crude steel last year fell by 22 per cent at Thyssen plants. Other divisions were slightly less worse off. Sales of manufacturing and investment goods, produced by Thyssen Industrie, fell by 1 per cent. The results mostly reflect the downturn in the motor industry, the company said. Thyssen said prospects for the rest of the year were bleak, with most of Europe in recession. First half profits at Preussag, the industrial group, fell 50 per cent, but this was still a satisfactory result considering market conditions, the steel and engineering group said, writes Christopher Parkes from Frankfurt. Net earnings of DM115m, for the six months to the end of March, compared with DM229m, had been hit by the international steel crisis, it added.</p>

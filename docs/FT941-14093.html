			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: Japanese rivals join forces to make flash memory chips Hitachi and Mitsubishi Electric are linking to produce flash memory chips, in an unusual alliance between two Japanese competitors. The two companies will co-develop 16-megabit flash memory - an advanced silicon chip which 'remembers' what has been written on it without the need for constant electronic refreshment - using technology developed by each company. Because they are smaller and use less power than hard-disk drives, flash chips are expected to replace them eventually, particularly in portable computers. The alliance between Hitachi and Mitsubishi underscores the high cost of setting up semiconductor manufacturing facilities, and the enormous resources needed to be a leading producer in the market. The partnership 'involves a sharing of resources in the areas of research and development as well as production, and as such is an undertaking of great significance to the future progress and development of each company', said Mr Tsugio Makimoto, executive managing director at Hitachi. However, at the same time it demonstrates the extent to which Japanese companies have suffered under the economic downturn and the fall in asset prices. A few years ago, financing the construction of a semiconductor facility, estimated at about Dollars 1bn, may not have been such a difficult decision for either company, says Mr Barry Dargan, industry analyst at SG Warburg. SGS-Thomson Microelectronics, the Franco-Italian semiconductor group which has an alliance with Mitsubishi in flash memories, is also expected to join the Japanese partnership. Its involvement could bring the alliance a valuable route into the European market. However, the flash memory market is currently dominated by Intel, of the US, followed by Toshiba. Meanwhile, prices have failed to fall as quickly as expected. Consequently, flash has been slow to replace disk drives, Mr Dargan says. While demand for flash chips has continued to be strong, prices will need to come down further. The chips are expected to grow into a Dollars 8bn market by 2000.</p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Analysts strike at ICI A SAVAGE downgrade and sell recommendation on ICI shares by Hoare Govett, joint broker to the blue chip chemical group, sent the stock tumbling and had other brokers reaching for their red pens. The company appeared to have hinted at a poor third quarter's trading. BZW, ICI's other broker, and Goldman Sachs revised forecasts down to Pounds 660m, and James Capel to Pounds 650m. Other houses are expected to follow suit today. The downgrades raised questions over whether ICI would maintain its dividend, which on Hoare's figures would barely be covered. Hoare cut its 1992 profit forecast by 21 per cent to Pounds 620m - with 1993's forecast reduced from Pounds 1bn to Pounds 875m. It also moved from a hold to an overvalued stance, and analyst Mr Martin Evans believes that the shares are some 10 per cent overvalued. Yesterday's fall left the shares down 63 at 1145p. ICI was believed to have told analysts that third quarter trading had been 'bleak', with European bulk chemicals business particularly badly hit and US trading not helped by weakness in the dollar. Drug stocks ease Pharmaceutical stocks remained under pressure as US buyers continued to respond to 'take profits' advice amid worries about a Democratic party win in the US presidential elections. Not even positive trading news for two stocks could reverse the downward trend. Glaxo, still suffering from its comparison with US drugs group Merck, revealed good news for one of its leading products in France, but closed 24 off at 746p. Wellcome, which received US approval for one of its second line products, retreated 41 to 909p. The company was also endorsed by Merrill Lynch yesterday as 'the best UK drug stock', despite a small downgrading by the US-owned broker. Taking a different tack yesterday, Mr Andy Porter, drugs specialist at Nikko, advised clients to take advantage of a 'classic UK buying opportunity' in the drugs sector. Mr Porter argued that the current US selling is prompted by currency worries and that the US political concerns are already in the price. He said that when the currency situation stabilised, UK drug stocks would need to be upgraded by around 10 per cent. Cable &amp; Wireless (C &amp; W) remained in the firing line as worries about increased competition in international traffic were followed by a report that talks aimed at forging a link between C &amp; W and US West, the US telecoms group, had been terminated. C &amp; W shares have been very active this year as the market has reacted to reports of imminent links with either AT&amp;T or US West. Analysts said the market had overreacted. 'The merest hint of a shift in strategy by C &amp; W will get the shares on the move; what the market needs to remember is that C &amp; W is a strong, well-managed global company with a rapidly expanding earnings profile.' C &amp; W shares opened sharply lower at 555p but quickly rallied to close only 9 off at 573p after turnover of 3.2m. Utilities responded to a series of recent brokers circulars suggesting that the water and electricity sectors had been oversold since the withdrawal from the ERM, a move that triggered an upsurge in interest-rate sensitive and cyclical stocks. London Electricity rose 7 to 390p, while Wessex outperformed the water sector, closing 20 higher at 510p. Very large turnover in Guinness followed French group LVMH (Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton) increasing its stake in the drinks company to 24 per as part of a complex cross-share agreement between the two. Yesterday's share purchase was caused by the take-up by Guinness in June of a batch of conversion shares which reduced LVMH's holding slightly below the agreed level. SG Warburg bought 11m Guinness shares at 555p for the French group in a move which had been anticipated for some weeks and had helped to maintain Guinness's share price. It is thought the French group was waiting for some stability in the currency markets before making its purchase. Guinness shares closed at 540p, off 12. Turnover reached 26m. Banks shares stumbled after recently outperforming the market, upset both by press comment suggesting the sector had been overbought and also by hints of profit downgrades. TSB, still burdened by market worries over the performance of its Hill Samuel merchant bank, drifted back 4 to 132p although turnover was an unremarkable 2.2m. Barclays drifted off 12 to 362p and Lloyds 14 to 452p. HSBC fell 55 to 406p on 6.2m. Currency factors helped to lift Unilever, as dealers reported fund managers switching out of the Dutch NV and into the UK plc on a belief that that funds would benefit from faster earnings growth in sterling. The food group was also benefiting from talk in some quarters that it was relatively cheap. The shares rose 13 to 1062p. Among brewery stocks, Grand Met slipped 26 to 423p after a large line of stock overhung the market and BZW downgraded the group; just before the close a block of 2m shares changed hands at 423p. In a weak stores sector, Boots suffered along with the other drugs stocks, the shares retreating 14 to 483p. Kingfisher lost 20 to 515p as fears of a price war in the DIY business reappeared and the chairman was reported to have warned that prices may have to rise in the whole group as a result of sterling devaluation. Ladbroke also fell on DIY worries, the shares down 13 1/2 at 160 1/2 p. Pentos declined 6 to 77 after SG Warburg was said to have crossed a block of 6.2m shares at 75p. Turnover reached 12.7m. Kenwood Appliances, the electrical goods manufacturer, slumped 42 to 245p. Albert E Sharp, the stockbroker, visited the group and was said to have joined other broking houses in shifting its current year profits forecast to below Pounds 10m. Holders of British Aerospace continued to sell the stock at every opportunity in the wake of last week's disappointing figures. The shares fell a further 9 to 116p in heavy trade of 5.9m. The company has invited analysts to a presentation this morning for what one observer called 'an attempt to steady nerves'. Suggestions that BAe could receive a bid offer from cash rich GEC, 3 up at 248p, continued to circulate. Shares in motor components group T and N were heavily traded and volume rose to 11m, mainly due to one trade of 5.9m. Part of that block continued to overhang the market and the shares gave up 5 to 147p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (59).

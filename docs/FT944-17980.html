			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (10): Tough restrictions in the UK - Cross-border leasing / A classic cross-border leasing deal involves an exporter selling equipment to a leasing company, which, in turn, structures a leasing arrangement with the foreign customer The wide range of financial and other support mechanisms in place for UK exporters has one demonstrable absentee - the availability of mainstream crossborder leasing services to fund and facilitate the sale of, particularly, capital goods equipment. This has been the case since the early 1980s when tough legislation, aimed at curbing abuses resulting in tax revenue losses, killed off conventional cross-border leasing of UK exports by establishing rules which made the practice unattractive to leasing companies. However, attempts to change the law relating to cross-border leasing are continuing; the main lobbying body is the London-based Finance and Leasing Association (FLA) which groups together a range of finance houses, including representatives from UK clearing and merchant banks. Additionally, despite the current prohibitive UK tax regime, some leasing company executives maintain that exporters should not ignore the leasing option. In certain circumstances it may be viable, depending on a range of factors such as the value of the equipment and whether repeat orders are involved. Also, some asset finance companies may be prepared to assist UK exporters by operating through foreign subsidiaries where they can access more favourable tax regimes. Cross-border leases can vary: operating leases generate income from the assets involved; full-payout leases are aimed at the leasing company receiving back the value of product, plus a target profit, during the life of the lease - with the lessee purchasing the equipment thereafter (or continuing the arrangement at a more or less nominal fee). 'Such leases have not featured much in the UK exporter's lexicon of trade finance terminology for a long time,' says Barry Sutton of London-based lease structuring experts New Boston Partners, which are partly owned by the Bank of Tokyo. The fundamental unattractiveness of UK cross-border leasing operations to leasing companies lies in the fact that only 10 per cent Writing Down Allowances (WDAs) are available - and there are considerable restrictions on how and where these apply. This means that a leasing company, when allowed, can only write off 10 per cent of the cost of purchasing equipment annually. This compares with 25 per cent on domestic UK leases and a range of more favourable tax regimes in most of UK exporters' competitor countries, particularly in Europe. UK exporters lack a leasing option, unlike their counterparts in most other countries in Europe, says Mr Sutton. Where available, lease-based exporting can be attractive with the leasing company, providing the exporter with secure funds up-front, thus removing payment worries and possible concerns, such as the cost and administration of export credit agency insurance. According to the FLA, in 1981 - the year before current tax treatment was introduced - FLA members wrote new leases for foreign customers amounting to around Pounds 600m and provided a significant source of support for UK exports, especially in the capital equipment sector. At today's prices, the 1981 figure would exceed Pounds 1bn with, according to FLA estimates, the value of leases involving UK exports probably amounting to around Pounds 700m. However, the continued absence of such funding for export sales reflects concern within the Inland Revenue that a relaxation of the tax law relating to cross-border leasing could re-generate a spate of export leasing-based tax abuses triggering significant loss of revenue. A common abuse involved foreign companies claiming capital allowances for purchases of non-UK origin equipment. There seems little prospect that the 10 per cent WDAs will be raised in the near future, but, according to Mr Andy Thompson, secretary of the FLA, some liberalisation of the conditions which allow leases to qualify for WDAs may eventually emerge. Currently, for example, qualifying leases cannot be written for longer than 13 years and payments must be evenly spread. The FLA would like to see longer qualifying lease terms and greater payments flexibility. In addition to the FLA, the British Exporters Association (Bexa), a lobby group which brings together both bankers and manufacturers, says it is unhappy that cross-border leasing remains effectively unavailable to exporters. The association is especially concerned that, in some situations, foreign companies against which UK exporters are bidding may gain competitive advantage by having the lease finance option available to back sales. 'We are closely monitoring the situation, possibly with a view to taking it up with government,' says Bexa chairman Mr Keith Johnson. Bexa has strongly lobbied government in recent years in a bid to improve the level of government support for exporters. It played a key role, for example, in pressing the government to boost export credit insurance facilities. 'We are interested in hearing from any British exporters who feel they are losing out by not having the export lease finance option available,' says Mr Johnson. Meanwhile, regardless of future legal developments, exporters exploring a range of funding options may find a leasing company which could be prepared to handle lease based exports. NatWest Leasing and Asset Finance is amongst a cluster of finance houses prepared, in certain circumstances, to handle 'big ticket' business of around Pounds 10m or more involving such exports as aircraft, railway rolling stock and large plant - a key attraction being the level of financial flows involved.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        OECD EXPORT CREDIT RATES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Minimum interest rates for                         officially supported                           export credits (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Currency                                     Sep 15-      Aug 15-                                              Oct 14       Sep 14  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australian dollar                             9.80         8.94 Austrian schilling                            7.88         7.70 Belgian franc                                 9.32         8.96 Canadian Dollars (to 5 years)                 9.11         9.55 Canadian Dollars (5 to 8.5 yrs)               9.49         9.80 Canadian Dollars (over 8.5 yrs)               9.72        10.04 Danish krone                                  8.80         8.10 Dutch guilder (to 5 yrs)                      7.80         7.35 Dutch guilder (5 to 8.5 yrs)                  8.10         7.70 Dutch guilder (over 8.5 yrs)                  8.10         7.70 Ecu                                           8.34         8.17 Finnish markka                               10.70        10.50 French franc                                  8.40         8.09 German mark                                   7.77         7.47 Irish punt                                    8.37         9.17 Italian lira                                 11.11        10.29 Japanese yen                                  4.50         4.50 New Zealand dollar                            9.21         8.93 Norwegian krone                               8.94         8.16 Spanish peseta                               11.41        11.24 Swedish krona                                11.82        11.23 Swiss franc                                   6.37         6.16 UK pound                                      9.53         9.28 US dollar (to 5 yrs)                          7.50         7.48 US dollar (5 to 8.5 yrs)                      7.88         7.91 US dollar (over 8.5 yrs)                      8.06         8.12  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- These rates are published monthly, normally around the middle of each month.

			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> IRVINE;  </P> <P> SCHOOL DISTRICT WON'T BUILD IN TUSTIN AREA  </P> <P> The Irvine Unified School District board of trustees has abandoned a  controversial plan to build a new high school within Tustin Unified School  District's boundaries, choosing instead a northern Irvine site that had been  considered previously, district officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> "The fact that Tustin was very opposed to the plan . . . caused us to consider  choosing an alternate site," said Corinne Riave, facilities planning  coordinator for the Irvine district.  </P> <P> Board members voted unanimously against the 40-acre Tustin site at the  intersection of Culver Drive and Irvine Boulevard, Riave said, explaining that  Tustin Unified's opposition would have delayed plans, thereby jeopardizing  Irvine's chances of obtaining state funding for construction of the new school.  </P> <P> The new site, one of four Irvine locations rejected by the school district in  January because of community opposition, is at the northwest corner of Yale  Avenue and the proposed Portola Parkway.  </P> <P> To secure a $25-million bid for state funds, Riave said the school district  plans to purchase the site and make arrangements with the Irvine Co., which  owns the land, to exchange it if it later is found inappropriate by residents  or the school board.  </P> <P> If all goes well, construction of the school, which will cost an estimated $50  million, should begin between 1992 and 1994 and serve about 2,000 students.  </P> <P> Maurice Ross, superintendent of Tustin Unified School District, who had  complained that an Irvine school would attract his district's students and  interfere with his district's future plans for a new high school about 2 miles  away, said he was pleased that the problem had been resolved at this level.  </P> <P> "I think it is in the best interest of everyone involved," Ross said.  </P></p>

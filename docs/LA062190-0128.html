			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> NAME GAME: Sometimes you just can't win. . . . Customers of Lincoln National  Bank in Encino confused it with infamous Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of Irvine.  </P> <P> Even the institutions' owners had similar names: John Keating at Lincoln  National, Charles Keating at Lincoln Savings. . . . So Lincoln National  announced it would change its name to California United Bank. A simple  solution? Not exactly. Now it's being sued by United California Savings Bank of  Santa Ana, which won a temporary order this week forbidding the name change.  James S. Granelli and Leslie Earnest  </P></p>

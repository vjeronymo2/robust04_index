			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / EC backs radical farm reform: Deep cuts in price support expected to boost Uruguay Round talks THE European Community last night agreed on the most radical overhaul of the Common Agricultural Policy in its 30-year history. It followed up with a challenge to the US to match the Community's deep cuts in farm price support and to join in trying to reach a conclusion of the Uruguay Round world trade talks. The EC agreement, greeted as historic by nearly all Community farm ministers, should lead to the end of food mountains in Europe, lower retail food prices and give EC farmers more stable incomes and a sharper competitive edge. Accord was reached in the face of continued resistance from Italy over its milk quota. Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, said: 'We have charted a different course after 30 years.' Mr Louis Mermaz, French agriculture minister, hailed the accord as 'a fundamental change from traditional (EC) agriculture towards a competitive model, with, of course, compensation for our farmers'. Mr John Gummer, UK farm minister, called it 'a major breakthrough which will bring the Community into line with the rest of the world'. Mr MacSharry's blueprint for reform, unanimously opposed when it was unveiled 18 months ago, finally won acceptance this week after four days and three nights of negotiations. Italy, although in agreement with the reform, held out until last night for retrospective validation for part of its illicit excess milk production. Italy, entitled to produce 9m tonnes of milk by the EC, in fact produces 11.5m tonnes. By dawn yesterday, however, Mr MacSharry had assembled a clear majority, partly by offering a range of concessions. The Portuguese presidency of the EC put the package through under the weighted majority voting system. Mr Arlindo Cunha, Portugal's farm minister, said: 'We took our political courage in our hands.' Mr Giovanni Goria, Italy's farm minister, said Rome would take the dispute to June's Lisbon summit of EC heads of government. At the centre of the package is a 29 per cent cut in cereals prices over three years, which should lead to cheaper feeds for livestock, enabling a 15 per cent cut in beef price supports, and a 5 per cent cut in the butter price. Sheep and beef will now be subject to quotas like milk. The cuts are designed to move EC agriculture towards world prices. Farmers are fully compensated for them directly, but big farmers have to take 15 per cent of their land out of production to get these payments. The cuts should eliminate export subsidies almost entirely by 1996-97. This, and the EC's new ability to guarantee restraints on production, should give momentum to the Uruguay Round negotiations between the US and EC, due next week. Mr MacSharry said: 'We can say, with our chests out and our heads held high, and with pride, that you (the US) match what we have done, and then we can get progress.' A spokesman for the US trade representative said: 'We are hopeful that reform would bring the EC's internal prices closer to world prices, and promote greater and fairer competition in EC and world markets. Also, we hope that the (CAP) agreement would allow the EC greater flexibility in the multilateral agricultural reform effort under way in the Uruguay Round.' Early today New Zealand, a member of the Cairns Group of agricultural exporting nations which has been critical of the EC, gave a cautious welcome to the agreement. . Mr Philip Burdon, trade minister, said: 'It's a good sign, but it's not a black and white picture.' Mr MacSharry insisted that the US should now accept the EC's demands that its direct compensation payments to farmers be allowed under General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) rules for subsidies which do not increase production and therefore distort trade.

			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Portugal (7): State asset sales face snags - Clouds over the government's future privatisation programme IF EVENTS go according to plan, the weight of state-owned companies in the Portuguese economy will cut by half during the current term of Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the prime minister. According to the 1993 budget, their contribution towards gross domestic product should be no higher than 8.5 per cent by the time the general election is due in 1995, compared to 16.2 per cent this year. Other declared aims of the government's privatisation programme are to boost capital markets and to strengthen domestic entrepreneurial groups, preparing them for the impact of the single market. Although the privatisation programme has been a success so far - at least in financial terms - analysts warn that the future could be less rosy. From spring 1989, when it began, to the end of last year, the total or partial sale of 25 companies yielded Es676bn (Pounds 2.96bn). In 1993, the finance ministry expects privatisation revenue of Es225bn, 20 per cent of which will be channelled back into remaining state-owned companies. Investors are critical that little else is known about the government's privatis- ation plans. There is no official timetable, which the government says depends on the state of the markets, and finance min- istry officials are customarily tight-lipped about future privatisation plans in general. In 1992, the government concluded the reprivatisation of the insurance sector. This year, it is expected to sell its remaining assets in banks, with the exception of the large Caixa Geral de Depositos and Banco Fomento de Exterior groups, which will remain under state control. Portugal's private financial groups are still busy establishing themselves and one of their main objectives is to increase in size. This has ensured that most privatis- ations in the financial sector have been a success. With the possible exception of Banco Pinto e Sotto Mayor, which faces grave financial problems, forthcoming sales in this sector should go smoothly. The same cannot be said of the state- owned industrial sector where many companies are seriously ailing. This has been seen in unprecedented difficulties in selling off cement, steel and petrochemical companies. This year's programme started on the wrong foot when the government failed to find a buyer for the cement companies Secil and Cimentos de Maceira and Pataias. It set a minimum price of Es59bn for its 80 per cent share in the two companies. Only Portuguese-controlled groups were allowed to participate. But the two domestic groups originally interested in the deal backed out, complaining that the price was too high. The government is now expected to open up the process to foreign groups in a second attempt. After apparently missing the right time to sell the Siderurgia Nacional steelworks, the government now faces the unpleasant prospect of having to pay to sell this loss-making giant. Analysts said it was clear from the start that SN could survive only as part of an international group. However, the one group that has come up with an offer, the French-Spanish Usinor-Sacilor joint venture, is reported to be interested only if the government takes over SN's liabilities, estimated at Es60bn. Portugal's largest enterprise, the oil company Petrogal, is proving to be another complex and arduous case. The Portuguese media has suggested that the government is considering declaring the sale of the first 25 per cent of the company null and void because of a dispute with the purchasers, the consortium Petrocontrol. Petrocontrol - a group comprising domestic investors and Total of France - is refusing to share the costs of a badly-needed Es40bn capital increase, arguing that when it bought the 25 per cent share last year it had no way of foreseeing the extent of losses Petrogal would make in 1992. One need not envy Mr Jose Manuel Elias da Costa, secretary of state for finance, who is responsible for the privatisation programme, his task. In addition to the international recession, which has reduced the value of companies, he has to contend with a constantly depressed domestic capital market and with the increasing apathy of investors aware that the best companies have already been sold. In addition, margins between fixed minimum share prices and the highest bids have been practically non-existent. In several cases the government has been accused of presenting the companies it is putting up for sale in too favourable a light. Share prices have often fallen following a privatisation, making small investors wary. Domestic business groups complain of a lack of consideration for their restricted financial potential compared to the power of foreign investors. They claim that if the government were really interested in creating strong domestic groups, it would not make raising as much capital as possible from privatisations its first priority. It has been suggested that one way of achieving this would be to privatise more companies through direct negotiations or tenders instead of stock exchange auctions, the method used in most privatisations to date. The government has indicated there will be fewer auctions in future, particularly in the industrial sector. However, officials are caught in a double bind as they have been criticised just as strongly for imposing tight restrictions on foreign participation as a means of protecting domestic interests. The arguments here are that there is simply not enough money in Portugal to guarantee the successful sale of all public companies and that the government is distorting the market by imposing such limits. These restrictions and the practice of revitalising state-owned companies with public money prior to their sale have also provoked a complaint from the European Commission. Mr Elias da Costa sought to justify the limits on foreign participation in talks with Commission officials in Brussels earlier this month. He argued that only Portuguese assets were nationalised after the fall of the Portuguese dictatorship in 1974 and that the decision to give priority to domestic capital was a way of compensating for this 'injustice'. While the Commission apparently remains sceptical, Mr Elias da Costa is confident that the matter can be resolved without a lawsuit against Portugal in the European Court of Justice. He says the Commission's reservations will not interrupt or slow down Portugal's process of privatisation. Companies that may be privatised at least partially this year include: Banco Portugues do Atlantico; third phase; Banco Totta e Acores, remaining 14.5 per cent; Banco Pinto e Sotto Mayor; Petrogal, second phase; Secil and Cimentos de Maceira e Pataias; Siderurgia Nacional; Gas de Portugal; Estaleiros Navais de Viana do Castelo, shipyard; Portucel: paper, pulp; Four bus companies belonging to Rodoviaria Nacional; Part of the water distribution network.</p>

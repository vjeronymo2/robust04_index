			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Erik Bjorn Moller: "United Nations Will Not </F> Hesitate To Strike"]    [Text] Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen fully  backs the decision to bomb Serb positions near the Bosnian town  of Gorazde.    "In the light of the information made available, it is clear  that it was the correct decision and the Serbs should not be  surprised. The UN Security Council has decided that the United  Nations may ask for air support -- and this is what has  happened. The UN forces in the region have felt themselves hard  pressed and have therefore asked for air support," the Danish  foreign minister said.    He stressed that the Serbs are the aggressors who are  forcing  their way into an area which the United Nations has already  described as a safe area. The Danish foreign minister also said  that the Serb aggression has come at a surprising point in time  when "there was a hope that more peaceful developments were  underway. And then suddenly the Serbs launch this massive  attack on one of the safe areas."    A spokeswoman for UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali  said yesterday evening that the general secretary had not  hesitated to use force in the defense of the Muslim enclave of  Gorazde. Nor will he hesitate to do so again, spokeswoman  Therese Gastaut said.</p>

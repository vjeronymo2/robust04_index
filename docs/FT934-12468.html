			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Survey of Technology in the Office (14): Small is beautiful  -Almost one in five of all personal computers sold last year was a portable  -and the trend is accelerating / Portable Computing IN the early days of portable computing, strong arms and a large dose of determination were required. Machines were heavy, cumbersome and generally slow and unexciting. But, since then, silicon integration and other technological developments have enabled portable computer-makers to pack real processing power into ever smaller and less costly packages. Although portable computing is little more than a decade old it has changed dramatically in recent years. The 'clam-shell' notebook computer has become the de facto standard for portable computing and the fastest growing segment of the world computer market. Almost one in every five PCs sold last year was a portable and the trend is accelerating. Dataquest, the market research organisation, estimates that worldwide notebook computer shipments, led by manufacturers such as Toshiba, Apple, NEC and Compaq, more than doubled last year to 4.35m units. By 1997, Dataquest expects portables and the new generation of personal digital assistants (PDAs) to account for more than 45 per cent of unit sales. Although portable machines still command a price premium over their desktop counterparts fierce competition is eroding the difference and providing consumers with an ever widening choice. Almost every serious PC manufacture and most of the 'clone' makers now supplies at least one range of notebook computers - many have high and low-end ranges - and as a consequence prices have been falling rapidly. Today, many models boast high resolution colour displays, large 120Mb-plus hard disks for data storage, integrated trackerballs for mouse-style pointing under Microsoft Windows and at least one PCMIA card slot to connect peripherals like modems for data communications. While machines based on Intel's 386 processor are still dominate the market a growing number of new machines are based on the more powerful 486 processor. Low-power chips, like Intel's SL range, together with advances in screen and battery technology have enabled designers to build machines with brighter displays and longer battery lives while new lightweight components have enabled manufacturers to deliver most if not all the functionality of desktop systems in much smaller boxes. Generally notebook computers are used in addition to desktop machines, and sometimes as replacements. That means most corporate users want machines which offer similar facilities to desktops and are able to run the same software. However, despite significant advances in screen technology, few portables can compete with the displays found on most desktops. One increasingly popular solution to this issue is the 'docking station' which enables the portable to take advantage of facilities like full size screens and keyboards and to connect to an office local area network which then provides access to databases and peripherals like printers. Several large manufacturers now produce docking systems including Compaq and Apple whose Duo system combines a lightweight 4.2 lb notebook computer for use on the road with a docking station which turns the machine into a sophisticated desktop, linked into the office network. For many users, notebook computers are now an important element in the 'mobile office' although most studies show that portable computers are only rarely used while actually travelling. Equipped with a fax-modem and perhaps a portable printer they can be used to send and retrieve data, electronic mail and facsimiles from a hotel room or local office. Some manufacturers have begun to design in specific features for the travelling businessman. For example, Cannon's BN22 BJ incorporate a bubblejet printer; meanwhile, Toshiba has recently launched the T6600C which includes a CD-Rom drive, stereo speakers, detachable keyboard and other facilities to make multimedia presentations while travelling. At 13 lbs, it is heavy in comparison with today's notebooks, but actually weighs less than Toshiba's top of the range laptops of just a few years ago. Other innovative machines to appear on the market recently have included modular designed systems from Elonex, the North London-based computer group, Japan's NEC, Acer with the Acernote 750c and Italy's Olivetti with the recently launched Philos. Manufacturers argue that these modular designs enable customer to keep up with future technologies and provide users sharing machines with additional flexibility. Most new portables feature integrated tracker-balls introduced by Apple which has had achieved considerable success with its PowerBook systems which were among the first notebooks with an integrated trackerball - a feature which is increasingly common. Apple sold over 500,000 PowerBooks, worth more than Dollars 1bn last year. Another innovation in portable computing over the past couple of years has been the arrival of pen-based 'notepad' systems which are now available from a growing number of notebook manufacturers. To date, pen-based systems, including smaller handheld devices, have mostly been used for niche applications, for example by insurance assessors and engineers completing customised forms on site, warehousemen checking stock or for data collection. Often these machines are linked by radio data communications back to head office so that data can be transferred to and from the main database. Some manufacturers have sought to combine the benefits of pen systems with the attractions of the conventional keyboard. For example the Grid Convertible, now supplied by AST alongside its new ranges of high and budget-priced note-book systems has both keyboard and penpad. Most recently, Compaq has launched the Concerto, a high performance notebook with a detachable screen which doubles as a pen pad and costs around Pounds 2,000. For some business users, size and weight will be the main criterion when choosing a portable. For them, the sub-notebook category of devices pioneered by Olivetti with the Quaderno, now in its second generation, and Hewlett Packard with the Omnibook could prove attractive. Significantly, Hewlett Packard has acknowledged that most notebook users also have access to a desktop PC so the Omnibook is designed to be used in conjunction with a PC rather than as a replacement. However, despite initial high hopes, the sub-notebook market has so far failed to live up to expectations. Mr Jeff Goldberg, European industry analyst with Dataquest in London, believes this is because to date they have generally been overpriced and viewed as similar too, but more costly than, electronic organisers. Mr Goldberg is equally dubious about the short-term market potential for PDAs, arguing that the first machines from manufacturers like Apple, Casio and Sharp are generally too expensive and do not offer many advantages over cheaper handheld computers and pen-operated electronic organisers. Even when prices fall, most analysts question whether PDA's will sell in sufficient volumes to generate significant revenues for their manufacturers. Nevertheless, machines like the innovative Apple Newton MessagePad could still represent a significant development in portable computing. In particular, the next generation of PDAs are likely to feature much more sophisticated telecom facilities - highlighting one important trend - the move towards integrating portable computing and telecoms. Combining the processing power of the latest generation of chips with the rapid development of digital telecoms like Mercury's One-2-One in the UK, GSM services throughout Europe or perhaps satellite-based systems, could turn PDA's in to important business tools with a real role in the office of the future.</p>

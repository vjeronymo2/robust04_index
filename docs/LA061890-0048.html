			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: U.S. CUP TEAM CAN AT LEAST ESCAPE CELLAR  </P> <P> The United States might not be the worst team in the World Cup. The United Arab  Emirates is edging the United States in the Cup's first tiebreaker for last  place -- the margin of goals scored.  </P> <P> The United States has scored once and given up six goals, a differential of  minus-five. The United Arab Emirates has scored once but given up seven goals,  a minus-six.  </P> <P> Each has one more game to play Thursday -- the United States against Austria  and the United Arab Emirates against Yugoslavia.  </P> <P> The United Arab Emirates has a national population of 1.4 million. The United  States population is 250 million.  </P> <P> Trivia time: When was the last time the United States won an Olympic gold medal  in men's basketball outside of North America?  </P> <P> Sweet revenge: Earl Strom, who is slipping into retirement after 33 years of  officiating pro basketball, told this to Phil Jackman of the Baltimore Evening  Sun: "Know what I'm going to do next season? Go to games and boo the referees."  </P> <P> Very L.A.: Jockey Karen Rogers, in the Belmont winner's circle with Dame de  Soleil for her first victory since being injured in a racing mishap last  September, had this to say:  </P> <P> "I want to thank (trainer) Red Terrill; my agent, Dominick Delvecchio; and my  therapist, Lenny Framson -- he put me back together."  </P> <P> Would-you-believe-it Dept: Since 1983, USC has won the same number of Pacific  10 Conference basketball championships as UCLA -- one.  </P> <P> Strike a pose: The vogue for the 1990 World Cup is black thigh-huggers that  peep out from under the shorts in the manner of tennis star Andre Agassi.  </P> <P> Manufacturers say the aim of the shorts -- similar to those worn by cyclists --  is to support the thighs and keep the legs cool when hot and warm when cold.  </P> <P> Questionably vogue: Goalkeepers, who tend to favor longer padded shorts to  cushion the impact of dives, wear huge gloves these days with a variety of  surfaces to suit the conditions.  </P> <P> In 1934, most keepers would merely spit on their bare hands and hope for the  best.  </P> <P> Why not?: Despite being a highly touted college quarterback, Notre Dame's Tony  Rice was not drafted this year by the NFL. Apparently the feeling among scouts  was that his arm isn't strong enough.  </P> <P> Instead, Rice was picked in the 50th round of the June draft by the Angels as a  catcher.  </P> <P> Rice has never played baseball, either at Notre Dame or at Woodruff High in  South Carolina, where, besides football, he lettered in basketball and track.  </P> <P> And on the day he was drafted by the Angels, Rice signed a two-year contract  with the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: 1964 at Toyko.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Gary Ward, Oklahoma State baseball coach, after his team finished  second to Georgia in the College World Series: "I've been blessed. You don't  have to feel sorry for me. I may still get a raise." MARYANN HUDSON  </P></p>

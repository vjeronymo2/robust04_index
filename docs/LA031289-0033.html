			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW BOOKS: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE NEEDLEPOINT  </P> <P> STAFFORD WHITEAKER (Ballantine Books; 1988)  </P> <P> WHITEAKER WAXES eloquent, with plenty of pastoral illustrations, about the joys  of life and flora in rural England. The needlepoint designs have only the most  cursory instructions; for needle-pointers who know how to set up a canvas and  aren't intimidated by choosing their own colors, this could be a cherished  book: lovely florals, neat repeats, bright borders. More photographs of  finished work would have been welcomed in the place of those bucolic scenes and  Whiteaker's rather unnecessary gardening information. ($24.95) Judith Sims  </P></p>

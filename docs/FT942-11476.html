			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: Strong improvement at Seita Seita, the French tobacco group which is on the government's privatisation list, yesterday announced net profits for last year of FFr585m (Dollars 99.1m), a sharp improvement over the FFr447m recorded in 1992. The group, which has a monopoly on the manufacture of cigarettes in France and produces Gauloises and Gitanes cigarettes, said the result was achieved in spite of increased sales competition. It forecast continued improvement for the current year. Sales last year rose by 2 per cent to FFr14.14bn, with FFr796m coming from exports. According to Seita, its financial position remains strong, with net cash of about FFr3bn and cash-flow last year of FFr794m, compared with FFr567m in 1992. The French government has not indicated the timing of Seita's privatisation, but it is considered unlikely to take place this year. Seita said yesterday that it was prepared for a sale but the timing would depend on the government's budgetary requirements and the condition of the stock market. The likely valuation is between FFr7bn and FFr9bn. The prospect of privatisation has already drawn interest from international tobacco groups. BAT Industries of the UK confirmed yesterday that it had had discussions with the French group, involving a possible stake of around 10 per cent as a means of cementing a trading partnership.</p>

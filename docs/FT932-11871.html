			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: UAL registers deficit of Dollars 138m in first quarter UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, one of the big three US carriers, yesterday reported a loss of Dollars 138m for the first quarter of 1993, compared with an underlying deficit of Dollars 108m in the same period of 1992. United also said it had agreed with Airbus, the aircraft manufacturer, to slow its delivery schedule for A-320 aircraft and to retire other aircraft on an accelerated basis as the A-320s enter the fleet. Both the first-quarter losses were stuck before accounting-related changes and extraordinary items; after these items the 1993 loss stands at Dollars 157m, against a Dollars 648m deficit in the previous year. But at the operating level the airline said that there was a small improvement, with the loss narrowing from Dollars 168m to Dollars 121m. Total revenues improved by 12.1 per cent to Dollars 3.33bn, while operating expenses increased only 10 per cent to Dollars 3.45bn. Mr Stephen Wolf, UAL's chairman, said the group's cost reduction programme had helped the comparisons, but added: 'We continued to move forward with plans to reduce further our costs by making structural changes to the company.' UAL shares took the news badly, falling Dollars 4 7/8 to close at Dollars 140 5/8 . As for the Airbus deliveries, UAL said 14 of the 29 A-320s scheduled to be delivered in 1995 and 1996 would be rescheduled for the 1997-1998 period. However, the 21 aircraft due to be delivered in 1993 and 1994 would be taken as planned. The aircraft which are due to retired on an accelerated basis include McDonnell Douglas DC-10s, Boeing 747s, and Boeing 727s. The group's results virtually end the airline industry's reporting season - in which results have been mixed. A couple of carriers - like American Airlines and USAir - generally pleased the market, giving it grounds for believing that profitability may be in sight. However, results from UAL and Delta have painted a less encouraging picture.</p>

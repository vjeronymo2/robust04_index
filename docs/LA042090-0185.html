			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SURPRISE ENTRY UPS DERBY FIELD TO 12 HORSES  </P> <P> With the unexpected entry of College Green, the field for Saturday's Grade III  $300,000 California Derby at Golden Gate Fields grew to 12 Thursday.  </P> <P> Brian Sweeney, the co-owner and trainer of College Green, said he had entered  the Kentucky-bred colt in the La Puente Stakes (a 1 1/8-mile race run Wednesday  at Santa Anita) but removed him from the field when they took the race off  grass.  </P> <P> "I decided to scratch and send him to the California Derby," Sweeney said.  "He's been training well, and so we'll take a chance."  </P> <P> College Green is expected to be a long shot in the Cal Derby, also run over 1  1/8 miles.  </P> <P> The draw was made Thursday morning with the horses (listed along with jockeys  and weights) in post position order:  </P> <P> Cape Ludtke (Jack Kaenel, 115), Due To The King (Ron Warren, 112), College  Green (Ron Hansen, 112), Heaven Again (Cory Nakatani, 122), Stalwart Charger  (Roberto Gonzalez, 115), Robyn Dancer (Gary Baze, 117), Tsu's Dawning (Robbie  Davis, 117), Forty Niner Days (Eddie Delahoussaye, 112), Tight Spot (Corey  Black 115), Music Prospector (Frank Olivares, 117), Flying Reb (Kent  Desormeaux, 115) and Farma Way (Ray Sibille, 115).  </P></p>

The Foreign and Justice Ministries have been studying the  possibility of giving changes to the amendment bill so that  human rights are not an issue, but they now seem to be leaning  toward withdrawing the amendment bill altogether owing to  difficulties of setting up practical standards for deciding  crimes to be governed.    Foreign Ministry officials said Tuesday that lawmakers of  the  ruling and opposition parties persistently opposed revising the  passport law during the last regular session.    The lawmakers argued, they said, that if the government  imposes administrative action, depriving citizens of valid  passports just because they are under suspicion of having  violated law, it could very well infringe upon individual rights.    If the government, ignoring the diversity of crimes  involved,  applies the law uniformly and nullifies the passport of every  Korean who faces indictment at home, it would not only be fair  to all but also produce many Koreans indefinitely staying in  foreign countries illegally.    One senior ministry official said the government is studying  the possibility of applying the law on those who committed grave  crimes and economic crimes, which could receive prison terms of  three years or more. But even this idea ran into difficulties,  he said.    "As a result, the bill has been scrapped in all practical  points of view," he said.    Had the bill been adopted, a number of Korean citizens who  are currently staying abroad to escape prosecution could have  become illegal aliens in the countries where they live.    These include Kim Chong-hi, a former senior presidential  secretary for foreign and national security affairs living in  the United States who is under suspicion of receiving bribes in  connection with the Yulgok military buildup program, and former  Rep. Yi Won-cho, who is staying in Japan to escape investigation  of questionable financial dealings.</p>

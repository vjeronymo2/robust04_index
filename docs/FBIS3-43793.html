He was a victim of the rising tension in  Brazzaville. Gilbert David Moutakela has the details:    [Begin recording] The situation deteriorated suddenly this  afternoon in Brazzaville after the kidnapping of a presidential  security officer. Lt. Jonathan Mabiela was kidnapped and  executed by private opposition militiamen. Elements of the  presidential guard, feeling that their pride was hurt, decided  to avenge their colleague. Before they could attack, the  directorate of the presidential security sent an ultimatum to  the prime minister, mediators of the republic, and Bernard  Kolelas. In a message announced on national radio, the  presidential security directorate demanded the liberation of Lt.  Mabiela. The ultimatum from the presidential security expired  this evening at 1800, but the body of the dead lieutenant is  nowhere to be found. All elements of the presidential security  on leave were called urgently back to their units, and tough  measures are expected.    It must be noted that the places where the action will be  focused essentially are in the southern part of Brazzaville --  Bacongo and Makele-Kele, where violence has continued despite  many calls for calm by political leaders and the Congolese Armed  Forces.    It must be recalled that since the beginning of the  Congolese  crisis in July 1993, several officers of the Congolese Armed  Forces, including a major and a colonel, have been kidnapped.  Those who were not killed were released after being subjected  to untold hardships. [end recording]    [Brazzaville Radio Nationale Congolaise Network in French at  1830 on 16 January opens its regular newscast with the following  communique issued and read and signed by the director of the  presidential security service: "Elements of the presidential  security have read an ultimatum in which they demanded the body  of their colleague from Bernard Kolelas and his group. As  director of presidential security, I declare that these soldiers  have no business losing their calm, because the president of the  Republic held talks this morning with the national mediators,  who are the only people authorized to settle any disputes and  conflicts between individuals and groups of individuals in the  country. I would like to reassure the people of Brazzaville  that suitable organs to ensure peace and national harmony have  begun work since this morning on the orders of both the  president of the Republic and the prime minister. I would  therefore like to stress that the ultimatum read earlier is null  and void because no authority conceived nor approved it  previously."]</p>

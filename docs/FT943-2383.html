			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Progress among the plagues: The new administration in Honduras Mr Guillermo Molina, the Honduran planning minister, says: 'It's something like the seven plagues of Egypt.' The country is undergoing a crippling energy crisis, water shortages, a drought that has devastated grain production, and a spreading cholera epidemic. Energy is rationed between six and 14 hours a day, and the blackouts have set off a crime wave. Industrial production has contracted, investment is stagnant, foreign reserves have dried up, and economists are predicting negative growth this year. If all that is not bad enough, the government wants to raise taxes to cut a growing budget deficit, and to release finance from the International Monetary Fund and the other international financial institutions. Its proposal will be put to Congress, which will be returning to work today after the independence day break. The proposed measures are aimed to reduce the fiscal deficit from 11.6 per cent to 7.5 per cent of GDP. They include a 1 per cent capital tax, a widening of the scope of value-added tax, a tax on luxury goods, and a 10 per cent tax on interest from bank deposits. The tax increases are required before Honduras can sign a letter of intent with the IMF. That will open the possibility of Dollars 700m (Pounds 451m) in debt relief from Paris Club sovereign creditors, and allow the disbursement of up to Dollars 300m this year in loans from Washington-based financial institutions, which have been held up. The measures have elicited widespread initial opposition from unions and professional organisations, which say these will further harm the 80 per cent of Hondurans in poverty. Also, the measures lack the support of a majority in congress, although business has made a late rally in the government's favour. Success in congress may depend on the government's ability to make clear that prospects for the country are far more dismal if the package is not passed. Officials say the government will be unable to meet its foreign debt commitments and would be declared ineligible for loans from the institutions on which it is heavily dependent. 'The central government does not have the necessary resources to meet its obligations,' said President Carlos Roberto Reina in a televised address last week, when he attacked his predecessor, Mr Rafael Callejas, for mortgaging the country's future. Officials of the ruling Liberal party have complained that the economic crisis is a legacy from the previous government, which abandoned fiscal discipline in an attempt to get re-elected, ran up the deficit and artificially held down prices in the months before the election last November. Sharp price increases this year will push up inflation to about 36 per cent, from 12 per cent in 1993, say economists. Mr Reina has found it difficult to sell what is effectively another structural adjustment plan when Hondurans have fresh memory of a harsh economic programme introduced by the last government. He not only lacks the support of the opposition National party in congress, which sees the package as a vote-loser, but must persuade a sector of his own party which has little appetite for a widely unpopular measure. If the economy slides further and social tensions rise, Mr Reina risks a reversal of the successes of his government so far, say observers. 'The story on civil-military relations and human rights is exceptionally good,' said a senior western diplomat. 'It would be a tragedy for Honduras if support from the international community were to fall away.' Mr Reina has delivered on his promise to abolish forced military recruitment by pushing through a bill in May, despite ferocious opposition from the powerful military who have acted with almost total autonomy. It awaits ratification in the next session of congress, from January. He went over the heads of the armed forces to appoint his own candidate to head Hondutel, the national telephone company, which is run by the military, and has said he wishes to privatise it. His government has also overseen the establishment of a new investigative arm of the police which will be under the control of a new civilian public prosecutor, after the disbandment of the DNI, a notorious, military-run police force accused of numerous violations by human rights groups.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kiril Vulchev] </F>   [Text] Sofia, April 21 (BTA) -- Macedonian President Kiro  Gligorov will pay an official visit here on April 25 and 26 at  the invitation of Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev, the press  office of the Bulgarian Presidency announced. This will be the  first official visit of the Macedonian President to Bulgaria.  Mr. Gligorov has visited Bulgaria twice -- on a one-day working  visit in August 1992 and privately in October 1992 in connection  with the premiere of a play by a Macedonian playwright here.  Dr. Zhelev visited the Republic of Macedonia [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] unofficially in  February 1993 to attend the presentation of his book "Fascism"  published in Macedonia.    Bulgaria was the first country in the world to recognize the  Republic of Macedonia in January 1992, four months after this  former Yugoslav republic proclaimed its independence. The  decision to recognize Macedonia was taken by the government of  the anticommunist coalition of the Union of Democratic Forces  with prime minister Filip Dimitrov. President Zhelev supported  this decision.    In June 1993 a Bulgarian premier -- Prof. Lyuben Berov,  visited Macedonia for the first time. In November 1993  Macedonian Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski opened a  Macedonian Consulate General in Sofia. In December 1993 the  diplomatic relations between Bulgaria and Macedonia were  upgraded to embassy level.    The recognition of the Republic of Macedonia by the  Bulgarian  Government marked the beginning of an intensive development of  trade and economic relations. In 1991 commercial exchange  between Bulgaria and Macedonia amounted to U.S.$50 million while  in 1993 it was already U.S.$300 million of which almost U.S.$230  million-worth Bulgarian export and over U.S.$60 million-worth  import from Macedonia. Double taxation was abolished in June  1993. The Bulgarian Government has granted two commodity  credits to Macedonia -- for U.S.$20 million in August 1993, and  in March 1994. An agreement was signed in December 1993  regulating cooperation between the Bulgarian and Macedonian  Agricultural Ministries. A direct telecommunications link was  established between Sofia and Skopje in 1993. Prior to that the  two capitals were linked through Serbia. A 110-KV power conduit  between Bulgaria and Macedonia was completed this March. This  is the second link between the Bulgarian and the Macedonian  power generation systems. The oil refinery in Burgas  (southeastern Bulgaria) is the main foreign trading partner of  the only Macedonian company authorized to import fuels --  Makpetrol. Almost 50 Bulgarian companies attended the first  Macedonian- Bulgarian fair in Skopje in late 1993.    Following Resolution 787 of the UN Security Council for  tightening the sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro,  Macedonian Prime Minister Jovan Andonov said during his visit  here in November 1992 that "Bulgaria is the Republic of  Macedonia's last open gate to the world." Consultations have  started on the construction of a railway between Bulgaria and  Macedonia as part of the East-West Trans-Balkan Railway from the  Adriatic to the Black Sea. There is no direct railway between  Bulgaria and Macedonia, which are linked by three motorways.  The issue of traffic arteries became particularly topical after  the embargo imposed by Greece on Macedonia this February and the  closing of the Greek port of Thessaloniki for Macedonian goods.  Macedonia transferred its import and export to the Bulgarian  Black Sea port of Burgas. In March 1994 the Macedonian  Government confirmed the prime importance of the construction of  a railway between Macedonia and Bulgaria for Macedonia's  economic development and its guaranteed transport communications  with the world.    In November 1993 the transport ministers of Bulgaria and  Macedonia signed the first agreement for road toll-free freight  and passenger transport. The ministers agreed that Bulgaria and  Macedonia should jointly insist before the UN Sanctions  Committee on a single transport corridor through Serbia.  Bulgaria and Macedonia will ask the International Civil  Aviation Organization (ICAO) to recognize the  Tirana-Skopje-Sofia route a transit air corridor. The first air  service between Skopje and Sofia dates back to May 1992. After  the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia closed its air space to  Macedonian airlines, Skopje Airport redirected all Macedonian  aircraft through Bulgarian air space.    Bulgarian tourists rank first among foreign tourists in  Macedonia, according to Georgi Danevski, secretary of the  Macedonian Tourist Union. An agreement on cooperation in the  field of culture is being drafted, proceeding from the accords  reached during the visit of Bulgarian Culture Minister Ivaylo  Znepolski to Macedonia last February. Early this month the  Bulgarian and Macedonian education ministers failed to sign an  agreement on cooperation because of the last-minute demand of  the Macedonian side for the agreement to say that it has been  drafted "in the Macedonian and the Bulgarian languages."  Bulgarian Education Minister Marko Todorov insisted on the  original wording "in the official languages of the two  countries."</p>

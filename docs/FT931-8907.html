			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Hanson rises to Pounds 236m on disposal and currency movements PRE-TAX profits at Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, rose in its first quarter from Pounds 226m to Pounds 236m. However, the figure was boosted by a Pounds 20m disposal profit and currency movements, and underlying profits fell 10 per cent. The biggest surprise in the figures, covering the three months to December 31, was an increase in the tax rate from 17.7 per cent to 27.5 per cent. As a result, earnings per share in the quarter fell 10.3 per cent to 3.5p. That, and a downbeat statement from Lord Hanson, chairman, took 4p off the shares to 250p. A rise in the tax rate from the unusually low level of 15.3 per cent for 1991-92 had been expected. But the company had said in December the rate would probably be 26 to 27 per cent. Yesterday analysts revised estimates for the tax rate up to around 28 per cent for the current financial year, as well as shading back pre-tax profit forecasts. Mr Martin Taylor, vice-chairman, said the higher tax charge was 'almost entirely down to additional advance corporation tax'. Last year the group moved to quarterly dividends, and as only two payments were made in the year instead of four, there was a one-off benefit in reduced ACT. That is now being reversed. Analysts surmised that the higher than expected tax rate meant UK profits were weaker than budgeted, giving less mainstream corporation tax against which ACT can be offset. The quarterly dividend is also slightly higher at 2.85p compared with 2.75p a year ago, though the same as the last quarterly dividend announced in December. Turnover rose 10.2 per cent to Pounds 2.3bn. Pre-tax profits included a Pounds 20m profit on the sale of Weber Aircraft, for Dollars 75m (then Pounds 49.5m), announced in October. Excluding these, profits would have been Pounds 216m. Had the previous year's pre-tax profit been translated at the end-December exchange rate it would have been Pounds 240m. Hanson now uses FRS 3. Profits in the comparable quarter included Pounds 11m from businesses since sold. On the acquisition side there was a full three-month contribution from Beazer, which was bought on December 4, 1991. The extra two months had little effect at the pre-tax level. Lex, Page 18; Details, Page 20</p>

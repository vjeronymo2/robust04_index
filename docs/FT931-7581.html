			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / India plans new reforms for economy THE Indian government yesterday committed itself to further economic reform, including cuts in the government deficit and subsidies, closure of unviable state-owned enterprises and further exchange-rate liberalisation. Tax and customs duty rationalisation and overhaul of the financial system are also on the agenda, under the annual economic survey presented to parliament yesterday, in advance of Saturday's annual budget, when specific measures will be announced. The report spells out problems the government faces, such as the cost of social security for workers dismissed from loss-making enterprises, and the need to invest in education and infrastructure. Wide-ranging reforms Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, launched in mid-1991 were beginning to yield results, the report says. It forecasts 4 per cent economic growth for the year to March 1993, up from a revised 1.2 per cent for the previous year. Wholesale price inflation is seen at under 10 per cent, down from 13.6 per cent. Agricultural output is expected to rise 5 per cent, because of good rains last summer. But industrial output is growing by less than previously expected, at a likely 4-4.5 per cent. The report says India still has difficulties with its balance of payments, with exports growing slower than expected due to declining trade with former Soviet bloc countries. In dollar terms, exports have risen 3.4 per cent in the eight months to December 1992, though exports to countries outside the former Soviet bloc climbed 11.4 per cent. Even this is short of the government's 15-20 per cent export growth target. Current-account deficit should be cut from a likely 2.8 per cent of GDP in 1992-1993 to under 1 per cent in 1995-1996. The report acknowledges the inter-religious violence after destruction of the Ayodhya mosque on December 6 hit output, exports and tourism, but does not estimate the losses. Last year's Bombay securities market scandal also hit confidence. The scandal highlighted the need for comprehensive financial reform, including banking reform. A key proposal is for cutting the proportion of cheap bank loans to the government, a rule which cramps commercial banking. 'The policy initiatives introduced after June 1991 have been seen to work. This gives us confidence we can overcome the constraints on our economy, assuring a more prosperous future.' Mr Sudhakarrao Naik, chief minister of Maharashtra State which includes Bombay, the city which bore the brunt of the recent inter-religious unrest, has resigned. Mr Naik, a leading member of the ruling Congress (I) party, was ordered to go by Mr Rao after being heavily criticised for his handling of the riots which left more than 600 dead in Bombay. The atmosphere in Delhi remains tense, due to a clash between the government and the Bharatiya Janata party, the right-wing Hindu party whose supporters sacked the Ayodhya mosque. The clash came over the BJP's plans for a rally in the capital tomorrow. The BJP intends to defy a government ban on the event.</p>

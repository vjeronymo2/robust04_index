At  this meeting, Vice Governor Zhang Shiying requested all  localities to focus their efforts on improving teachers' working  conditions, standard of living, as well as political and  professional quality, on strengthening their contingent, and on  protecting their legitimate rights and interests in the course  of implementing the Teachers Law.    He pointed out: A prominent problem at present is the  arrears of wages for secondary and primary school teachers since  the end of last year. From Teachers' Day to the end of  November, the arrears of wages for secondary and primary school  teachers throughout the province totaled 108 million yuan,  involving almost 200,000 teachers in more than 80 cities,  counties, and prefectures, causing big difficulties to these  teachers' lives and serious influence to educational work,  particularly rural compulsory education. All localities should  take this problem into serious account, party and government  leaders at all levels should pay personal attention to it, and  the relevant departments should closely coordinate with each  other. All kinds of necessary measures should be taken and  different channels should be used to pay these wages before the  implementation of the Teachers Law, so that these teachers can  spend the New Year happily. At the same time, measures should  be taken to prevent the recurrence of the same problem. If  arrears of wages for teachers occur after the Teachers Law comes  into force on 1 January 1994, the relevant leaders will be held  responsible for this according to law.    Zhang Shiying also set requirements for supervising  implementation of the Teachers Law.</p>

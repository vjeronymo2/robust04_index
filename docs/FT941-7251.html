			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: A competitive culture is promoted A British Gas manager recently recalled the reaction of his elderly father in the north of England upon being told that his son was being posted to the company's exploration and production operations in Tunisia. 'What, you're going to Africa with the Gas Board?' the incredulous old man asked. That public sector and decidedly domestic image of British Gas has been difficult to shake off in the eight years since privatisation, despite glossy advertising campaigns extolling the company's growing international role, with operations in dozens of countries. Most British Gas customers, including the millions of 'Sids' who bought the company's shares at its privatisation in 1986, probably still see the company more as a dividend-paying public service than as a multinational energy company. Unfortunately for senior management so too do many British Gas workers and middle-ranking managers. The internal resistance to changes brought on by increasing competition were highlighted last year when independent gas trading companies complained to Ofgas, the industry regulator, that the company was failing to provide timely information on the sale of their gas sent through British Gas pipelines. It was later determined that inadequate information technology systems were partly to blame for the lengthy delays. But it was also clear that some employees saw little reason to help competitors, even if they were customers as well. Long-serving employees were steeped in a tradition summed up by one veteran manager as 'British Gas knows best,' an inheritance from the days of Sir Dennis Rooke, a former chairman. Introducing a competitive culture among the remaining employees is a priority for the company's senior executives. The announcement last December of the end of British Gas's regional structure in favour of five new national businesses was a big step forward, according to analysts. It meant that powerful regional heads would lose their ability to block reforms proposed by Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive, and Mr Philip Rogerson, finance director. Ms Clare Spottiswoode, director general of Ofgas, says the senior managers have 'genuinely embraced competition,' if for no other reason than they want to reduce the role of the regulator.</p>

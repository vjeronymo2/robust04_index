			<p>BFN     [Text] The government will allow foreign banks operating  in the nation to reduce the amount of money they are required to  loan to small- and medium-sized companies, a top official of the  Ministry of Finance said yesterday.    Currently, foreign banks are required to lend 35 percent of  an increase in their total lending to small- and medium-sized  companies.    Assistant Minister of Finance Sin Myong-ho said the  government will allow them to allocate 10 percent of the loan  increase for the purchase of bonds related to small- and  medium-sized companies in the primary market.    This action taken by the government will have the effect of  reducing the ratio to 25 percent, Sin said at the Korea-U.S.  Business Conference which ended yesterday.    Referring to the North Korean nuclear issue, he said, it has  had no serious effect on the South Korean economy.    "Our economy has now attained a mature phase of development  which will allow us to sustain our economic policies without  real effect from the present nuclear issue," he said.    He said South Korea's total foreign exchange holdings, which  stand at #37 billion at the moment, are equivalent to the value  of four months of current foreign exchange transactions.    Should the South and North Korean confrontation over the  nuclear issue be prolonged, however, South Korea would find it  difficult to secure funds in foreign money and capital markets.    The Ministry of Finance's internal report said Korea would  have to pay higher rates of interest on its loans from abroad if  the nuclear issue is not resolved at an early date.    The report said the ministry will encourage domestic  corporations and financial institutions to issue depositary  certificates to secure funds abroad instead of bonds whose  yields may fluctuate.    Yields of the bonds issued by Korea corporations and  financial institutions have recently climbed by one-sixteenth to  one-eighth of a percentage point, the report said.    In the face of rising interest rates, the report said, some  domestic banks have delayed their plans to borrow money from  abroad.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- Vols. 1 and 2 of Part 1  "The Anti-Japanese Revolution" of the great leader President Kim  Il-song's reminiscences "With the Century" were published in one  book by the social science publishing house of China in April.    A picture of President Kim Il-song standing on a lakeside is  printed on the front cover of the book.    Carried on the front and back covers of the book are the  propositions of President Kim Il-song "Revolutionaries, believe  in the people and rely on them at all times and you shall always  emerge victorious; if you are forsaken by them, you will always  fail. Let this be your maxim in your life and struggle" and  "The destiny of a nation can be saved only through the unity and  struggle of all the forces that love their country and treasure  their nation."</p>

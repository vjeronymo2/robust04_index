			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] At today's hearing of the trial of the  last Albanian communist president, Ramiz Alia, and nine top  party and state officials of the communist regime, the court  heard their defense counsels' summing up and the final  statements by the defendants. Reporter Marash Mirashi was  present in court for Albanian Television:    [Mirashi] [20-second audio outage] and gave his own  explanations. After affirming the innocence of Manush Myftiu,  he asked the court to reach its verdict, just as Prosecutor Fana  had, in his summing up, in calling for a five-year suspended  sentence.    Riza Icka, defense counsel for Adil Carcani, said  practically  the same thing.    Kleanthi Koci, defending former President Alia,  characterized  Alia's trial as unconstitutional and called for his total  acquittal.    Meanwhile, Ilir Selenica, defense counsel for Rita Marko,  called for a not-guilty verdict for his client. He stressed  that the summing up had presented a malicious view of Marko.  The prosecutor had demanded a 10-year prison sentence for  Marko, while on almost the same charges, a five-year suspended  sentence had been demanded for Carcani and Myftiu. In his final  statement, the defendant Marko said essentially the same.    Analysts consider such cases as clear contradictions.    Roland Permeti, defense counsel for Simon Stefani, asked the  court to find his client not guilty, based on the arguments that  he had presented to the court.    A six-year sentence for Hekuran Isai would be very harsh,  his  attorney Selenica said. The charges against him are built on  exaggerated statements that do not hold water.    Arben Vane, defense counsel for Aranit Cela, said that it  was  impossible for a lawyer such as Cela to have committed deeds  that ran contrary to the law. He requested that a not-guilty  verdict be passed for this defendant.    Attorneys Luan Behri, Arqile Lole, and Vladimir Bineri also  requested not-guilty verdicts for defendants Zylyftar Ramizi,  Rrapi Mino, and Veiz Haderi.    Chairman of the Court Celiku then asked to hear the final  statements of the defendants.    The last communist president, Alia, stressed that the  charges  were a result of state pressure. He then converted his final  statement into a political speech, similar to those of 1990-91,  but this time without any applause from his devotees.    Defendant Simon Stefani submitted his final statement in  writing to the court. Then the other defendants, Isai, Ramizi,  Mino, Cela, and Haderi, spoke, all demanding to be acquitted.    At the end, the court withdrew to consider the verdict,  which  will be announced at the next hearing at 1700 [1500 GMT] on  Tuesday 28 June.</p>

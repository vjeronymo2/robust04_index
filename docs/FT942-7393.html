			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Camelot plans November start for UK lottery Camelot, winners of the licence to run the UK national lottery - the first for more than 150 years - will today push ahead with plans to launch the multi-billion-pound project in early November. The consortium, whose members include Cadbury Schweppes, the food and drinks group, and De La Rue, the bank note printer, forecast total sales of Pounds 32bn during the seven years of the licence and payments of Pounds 9bn to good causes such as charity and the arts. Camelot beat seven other groups to win the licence, including the bookmakers' favourite, the UK Lottery Foundation, put together by Mr Richard Branson and Lord Young, a former cabinet minister. Unlike the other bidders Mr Branson, the Virgin chairman, was planning to give all profits to charity and good causes. Mr Peter Davis, national lottery director-general, who made the decision to award the licence, said yesterday: 'Camelot was clearly the all-round best applicant. I have no doubt about that. They were strong in every department.' The decision clearly angered Mr Branson, who said last night he would ask Mr Davis for an explanation of his decision. 'We feel that he has not taken into account at all the market research that shows that more people will buy more tickets if they know all the profits will go to good causes,' Mr Branson said. The Branson bid predicted total sales of Pounds 37bn over the licence period with a contribution of Pounds 10.5bn to the government's good causes, which apart from the arts and charities also include the national heritage, a new millennium fund and sports. In addition Mr Branson believed a further Pounds 600m would have been raised for other charities of his choosing. Although the national lottery office did not draw up a formal shortlist, Camelot was hardest pressed by Lotco, a consortium put together by the Rank Organisation. Mr Branson came next as a serious candidate, and the other main contender was a consortium put together by Tattersalls, the Australian lottery operator, and NM Rothschild. The Branson bid and the promise to give all the profits away meant that many of the other bidders had to reduce their profit levels. It is believed the Camelot profit levels are well under 1 per cent of sales and probably around 0.6 per cent. Apart from Cadbury and De La Rue, Camelot includes Racal Electronics; the computer group ICL; and G-Tech, a US group involved in 62 lotteries around the world. The partners each have 22.5 per cent of the venture, apart from ICL with 10 per cent. The lottery tickets will be sold in a wide range of retail outlets, including post offices. The selection of weekly jackpots, which could be between Pounds 3m and Pounds 5m, will be broadcast live, probably on the BBC. Often jackpots will be shared between two winners so that dozens of millionaires will be created in the UK every year. The government has decided that if no one picks the correct six numbers out of 49 the jackpot can be rolled over but only for a maximum of three times, ruling out the possibility of Pounds 100m lottery prizes on the American scale. Camelot will be having talks with Mr Davis to see whether a Pounds 15m cap should be put on the top prize. Winning ticket, Page 25 Carlton advances 33% to Pounds 73m, Page 31</p>

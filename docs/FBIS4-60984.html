			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vitaliy Gordenko] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 2 May (ITAR-TASS) -- According to the  preliminary results produced by the commission investigating  yesterday's report about the Uzbek plane in Khorog airport, it  was not seized by armed Tajik opposition forces. An ITAR-TASS  correspondent was told over the phone today by sources in well-  informed government circles in the Republic that the special  commission has established that the plane was on a scheduled  flight for the joint peace-keeping forces and was carrying  humanitarian aid.    The same source said the commission established that,  contrary to the reports coming in, the plane was not seized and  there were no armed people from the Tajik opposition at the  airport. The same source said that, because of Khorog's  location and the situation in the region, all planes coming into  the airport are regarded from the standpoint of security. As  for the AN-26 plane which was apparently seized, it left Khorog  at 1627 and no problems were registered. Two other planes in  addition to the AN-26 landed at Khorog airport from Dushanbe on  that day.    Tajik Foreign Minister Rashid Olimov told an ITAR-TASS  correspondent in a telephone interview that an official  statement would be made tomorrow about the results of the  investigation into this episode.</p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / UK Company News: C&amp;W signals priorities with China partnership Yesterday's breakthrough by Cable and Wireless into China may mark a turning point in the strategy of the UK telecommunications group. Although the precise terms of the Dollars 300m (Pounds 190m) agreement to develop telecoms networks in partnership with China's ministry of posts and telecommunications remain to be finalised, C&amp;W left no room for doubt that Asia would be its prime investment focus for the next decade. C&amp;W has operations across the world, but Hongkong Telecom - of which C&amp;W owns 57.5 per cent - has long been the jewel in its crown. Last year Asia accounted for nearly half of the company's Pounds 4.7bn turnover, and Hong Kong alone for 64 per cent of its operating profit. By contrast, in the highly competitive UK market, C&amp;W's turnover (through its Mercury subsidiary) was three quarters that in Hong Kong, yet its operating profit was less than a third as great. Mr James Ross, C&amp;W's chief executive, said: 'When you ask what differentiates us from others you always come back to Asia; and now that we have this tangible evidence of the opportunities in China, it will clearly be a priority.' The 'first call' on resources 'will tend to be Asia'. The Chinese deal represents about two thirds of Hongkong Telecoms's total capital investment last year. Spread over three years, it represents about a 25 per cent annual increase, and more could be in store. 'The arrangement with the MPT (Chinese telecoms ministry) is very fluid, and further opportunities could well be available, even at this stage,' said Mr Ross. Mr Andrew Harrington, Asian telecoms analyst with Salomon Brothers in Hong Kong, said the deal 'strengthens Hongkong Telecom's premier position in China, and is bound to make China C&amp;W's most important new sphere of activity for the foreseeable future.' However, C&amp;W said yesterday it had no intention of withdrawing from other regions. Last week the Bouygues consortium, in which C&amp;W has a 20 per cent stake, won the licence to build France's third mobile phone network, with plans to invest about FFr11.7bn (Pounds 1.4bn) over 10 years. C&amp;W is investing heavily in its mobile venture in the UK, and has a stake in a German mobile phone operator which may enter the fixed-wire sector as European telecoms are opened to further competition. C&amp;W intends to expand in the Caribbean and US. Balancing commitments and opportunities is thus a critical challenge for C&amp;W. It is not only a question of balance between regions but also within regions. 'Even in Asia, we are not putting all our eggs into the Chinese basket,' Mr Ross stressed, pointing to C&amp;W's operations in Australia and its ambitions in Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. Mr Ross believes the group could comfortably increase expenditure by between Pounds 500m and Pounds 1bn a year, given its low gearing. But that could be swallowed up in China alone if the state monopoly dam has truly burst. See World Trade and Lex</p>

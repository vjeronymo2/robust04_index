Despite the fact that following the Japan-U.S. textile  negotiations in the 1970's, Japan has been in constant friction  with the United States, economic relations between the two  countries on the private-sector level have been steadily  promoted.    According to the latest survey of the Japan External Trade  Organization, the number of factories operated by  Japanese-affiliated companies in the United States has reached  1,700, seven times than in the first survey in 1981. The survey  shows that approximately 400,000 persons are hired by  Japanese-affiliated companies and that those companies'  activities to contribute to local welfare are brisk. The report  also says that, as of December last year, 780 joint projects  have been confirmed in the area of joint development, technical  cooperation, and joint venture.    Companies' cooperation with local community through their  daily economic activities and mutual understanding between  employees and the management through social activities are very  important to maintain good relations between Japan and the  United States.    However, there are other tasks for the private sector to  carry out.    Underlying the current Japan-U.S. economic friction is  Japan's huge trade surplus and closed nature of its markets in  various fields.    In its demand calling for Japan's market opening and  deregulations, the United States has pointed out that there are  various obstacles to rectifying trade frictions--such as  construction firms' bid-rigging practice and regulations of  large retail stores, insurance, and transportation business.    It can be said that industrial circles concerned have  enjoyed  prosperity under an "umbrella" of such regulations. They need  to make voluntary efforts to correct the current situation.    In promoting purchase of foreign-made automobiles and  autoparts, which is one of the immediate issues to be solved,  the auto industry has started making voluntary efforts.    Major auto dealers affiliated with Nissan Motor are getting  ready to deal in Ford-made automobiles while Toyota-affiliated  dealers plan to start selling compact cars made by General  Motors (GM) from 1996. Each of the major automobile companies  is working out its own plan to purchase foreign-made auto parts,  including U.S.-made parts.    In response to such voluntary efforts of the automobile  industry, a top U.S. official in charge of trade recently called  on the Japanese Government to guarantee voluntary targets the  auto industry will set in its plan. On the other hand, it has  been reported that welcoming the private sector's voluntary  efforts, the Japanese Government, which is scheduled to announce  its market-opening measures late this month, is considering  including the automobile industry's voluntary plan in its  market-opening measures as the pillar of the measures. However,  such reactions by the two governments have resulted in the  automobile industry's criticism.    We think that such moves by the two governments will put  cold  water on the private sector's voluntary efforts to rectify trade  friction and run counter to the principle of free trade and  deregulations. We believe that what the two governments have to  do is to create an environment in which other business sectors  can take voluntary actions, rather than intervening in the auto  industry's voluntary plan.    In addition, leaders of the business circle are assigned an  important role. Although business leaders from Japan and the  United States hold an annual meeting, it has been reported that  there is a rapidly growing move among the members for changing  the nature of the meeting -- from a place for exchanging  opinions to opportunities to take positive actions to remove  friction.    Some of the Japanese and American members of the meeting are  said to have their own personal connections with persons who are  concerned with policymaking. In this sense, we hope that  business leaders, by taking advantage of a network of their  personal contacts, will actively contribute to improving  Japan-U.S. economic relations.</p>

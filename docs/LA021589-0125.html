			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BACA: A POET EMERGES FROM PRISON OF HIS PAST  </P> <P> As success stories go, it's a grisly one.  </P> <P> By his own account, Jimmy Santiago Baca's parents divorced and abandoned him to  a grandparent when he was 2. Later, his mother was murdered by her second  husband and his father died of alcoholism.  </P> <P> By 5, the young mestizo (half Chicano/half "detribalized Apache") was abandoned  again, left at a New Mexico orphanage where he stayed until he was 11, running  away the night before he was to be transferred to Boy's Town.  </P> <P> He swiftly became a teen-age street urchin, alcoholic, drug addict and  wanderer. At age 20, convicted of drug possession with intent to sell, he wound  up, he said, doing 6 1/2 years (for incorrigibility, on a five-year sentence)  in one of Arizona's toughest maximum security prisons. Because he consistently  got into fights with his cellmates, he spent four of those years in isolation,  in "a dungeon," with, Baca claims, no sunshine save for a single hour once each  week.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Taught Himself to Read  </P> <P> But in the darkness, Baca was reborn. He taught himself to read and write,  shouting to inmates, for instance, when he became dazzled by the difference  between nouns and verbs, "Hey Flaco! Do you know what you are? Do you know,  brother, that you are a noun???!!!' "  </P> <P> "He found his inner light and he worked by it," said Will Inman, the former  publisher of New Kauri poetry magazine, who began encouraging and visiting Baca  while he was still in prison.  </P> <P> Last year, for his fifth book of poems, "Martin &amp; Meditations on the South  Valley," Baca won the prestigious American Book Award. And suddenly, the inmate  who called himself "healing earthquake" is indeed shaking up the literary  world.  </P> <P> Baca -- whose semi-autobiographical work is noted for its intense, primal  imagery and poignant lyricism -- is now in demand for poetry readings  throughout the world (one of which is scheduled at the Los Angeles Theatre  Center on April 17).  </P> <P> PBS is preparing a documentary on his life. And he's being courted by famous  literary agents.  </P> <P> Numerous universities have offered him teaching jobs, all of which he said he's  turned down, preferring to stay close to his beloved Albuquerque barrio with  his wife, Beatrice, a therapist about to begin doctoral studies, and their two  young sons, Antonio and Gabriel.  </P> <P> But a major West Coast university (Baca said he can't name it as the award  hasn't yet been officially announced) will lure him to its campus next fall for  a monthlong guest lectureship.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Never Attended School  </P> <P> The poet, who never attended school in his life and received his high school  diploma by taking the GED exam, is not even sure what will be required of him,  but he knows the job pays extremely well. "I don't know what you do," he  wondered aloud during a recent visit to Los Angeles. "You just stand there and  make money."  </P> <P> He had come here to talk with directors at the Los Angeles Theatre Center about  the possibility of having one of his plays produced.  </P> <P> "I think I'm going to do a play for these people," he said, sitting in one of  the center's offices, smoking a cigarette. "We'll see if they can meet my  criteria."  </P> <P> Though the words were direct and tinged with challenge, Baca is hardly the  tough homeboy you might expect from hearing his life story. At 37, he looks  healthy and fit, the scars from his prison life invisible to the naked eye.  </P> <P> More handsome than his photographs, he is dressed colorfully this day, in a  raspberry cotton shirt, blue pants and blue and white Mexican wool vest. But  even more striking is his manner. Baca radiates a gentleness, serenity, and  lack of anger.  </P> <P> "You really don't have time to be angry," he explained. "If you compare a life  to daytime photography, my life has been more like nighttime photography. My  life as a background has had darkness; the only way to survive the darkness is  to have my soul flash. I'm too busy trying to capture the aspects of myself in  the dark."  </P> <P> By discovering language and capturing himself through it, Baca claimed, he  totally transformed his life:  </P> <P> ". . . (In prison), I saw all these Chicanos going out to the fields and being  treated like animals. I was tired of being treated like an animal. I wanted to  learn how to read and to write and to understand. . . . I wanted to know how to  function in this world. Why was I so ignorant and deprived?  </P> <P> "The only way of transcending was through language and understanding. Had I not  found the language, I would have been a guerrilla in the mountains. It was  language that saved my (posterior). I really didn't know who I was before I was  in prison."  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Perceptions  </P> <P> While there, at Arizona State Prison in Florence, Baca said he began to work on  new perceptions, "birthing a way out through the poetry. I began to decompose  the walls. I saw the walls were not the enemy. The enemy was myself."  </P> <P> But why did the enemy repeatedly choose punishment rather than perform the  required prison work? Even now, Baca sees his refusal to work as a creative,  positive act.  </P> <P> He maintains that he never committed the crime for which he was convicted. He  had gone to visit a friend, he said, and wound up in the midst of a shoot-out  in which an FBI agent was wounded.  </P> <P> "We just got caught in a situation we should never have been in," he said. "I  got caught in a net. . . ."  </P> <P> But he gives himself credit for being "that one Chicano who said, 'This  (treatment) is legally and morally wrong. I do not want to lift this arm to  work.' That's a creative act. My whole life has been based on creating my own  code of right and wrong."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Bitter Today  </P> <P> Though he suffered as a result, Baca does not appear embittered. He speaks  evenly of the fact that his incorrigibility resulted in the warden standing in  his cell and tearing up his poems. (Baca responded by throwing a chair at him.)  In addition, Baca said he received electric shock treatments in what he calls  an attempt to coerce him into uniformity.  </P> <P> To a degree, they worked. "I forgot how to pronounce my own name," he recalled.  </P> <P> But as a child, he had been trained by curanderas (Mexican folk healers) in  herbalogy and folk religion. And he had learned to expect, even treasure, such  suffering. "At a very young age, I became a young Chicano with a sense of  destiny," Baca said. "I had the idea I was intended for an incredible amount of  suffering. I was taught that suffering would be our gift and we had to build  from it and not let it destroy us."  </P> <P> And so slowly, patiently, Baca endured, writing to retain his sanity. When he  had composed a few poems, an inmate friend suggested he send them to Mother  Jones magazine.  </P> <P> "I took a wild chance and sent Mother Jones three poems. I didn't know how to  put the stamp on the envelope and address it. A couple of weeks later, I got  $300 (for the three poems) in the mail."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Help From Famous Poet  </P> <P> Denise Levertov, who describes Baca as "an extraordinarily gifted poet," was  the magazine's poetry editor at the time. An internationally known poet and  professor of English at Stanford University, she began corresponding with him,  ran his work in Mother Jones and found him a publisher for his first book,  "Immigrants in Our Own Land" (Louisiana State University Press).  </P> <P> Levertov wrote the introduction for "Martin &amp; Meditations on the South  Valley" and in it she describes "Martin," the first of the book's two long  poems, as "a Hero Tale, an archetypal journey."  </P> <P> Asked how Baca's work has evolved, she replied: "When he was writing in prison,  he had a sketchy idea of punctuation and sometimes his usage was incorrect, but  it didn't take him very long to get past that stage."  </P> <P> There was always the possibility, she admitted, that "he was someone with one  theme and that once he was free, he wouldn't continue. But that's obviously not  the case. He's a naturally gifted poet. . . ."  </P> <P> Levertov also noted that "Martin" was published by New Directions, "a very,  very fine publisher that's published most of the major poets over this  century."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Now He Has Attention  </P> <P> Gary Soto, one of the world's best-known Chicano poets and an associate  professor of English at UC Berkeley, has similarly followed Baca's work for  more than a decade and suspects that publication by such a respected publisher  helped bring the world to Baca's doorstep.  </P> <P> "Jimmy's always been a strong writer, he just never got the attention," Soto  observed. "It's very pure, innocent, but not naive writing. He's writing about  his life. . . . He's never been a careerist like so many other poets, with one  eye on the publishing world and one eye on his subject. Jimmy has both eyes on  his subject."  </P> <P> Even though Soto was familiar with Baca's work, he was somewhat shocked when  the two met at the American Bookseller's Assn. meeting last year in Anaheim.  </P> <P> "He was in cutoff pants," Soto remembered. "Everyone else was dressed up and  suave. He didn't look like the cholo, the tough guy who comes up in his poems.  He just looked like a guy happy to be there. . . . He has such character about  him. It's very genuine. . . . When I read his poems, I think, 'This is what  literature is about.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> Appreciates Advice  </P> <P> While Baca clearly appreciates such comments, especially from distinguished  friends in high places, he does not appear to need them.  </P> <P> "I have been hailed by some of the most severe critics in the country. It  doesn't mean anything," he insisted. "I just try to stay within the rules of  the earth, within the boundaries of dignity. I don't do anything for money. . .  . I live on a day-to-day basis. . . . In prison. I didn't know if I was going  to be alive from day to day."  </P> <P> At the moment, daily existence involves considerable traveling. For the last  three and a half months, Baca's been on tour, reading his poems at universities  and major poetry centers, with as many side trips to reform schools and his  farm in Albuquerque as he can squeeze in along the way.  </P> <P> According to Manazar Gamboa, a Santa Monica poet who works with incarcerated  youths throughout Los Angeles County, Baca visited three centers for juvenile  offenders in the Los Angeles area during another recent visit here.  </P> <P> "They received him really well, especially at San Fernando Juvenile Hall,"  Gamboa said. "Compared to other places, it's pretty hard-core there. Some of  the kids are facing very hard time. Without preaching, he stressed the value of  learning. And when he finished his discussion with the kids, one of them said:  'Can we have one of your books?' He wrote in it and dedicated it to them and  gave it to them. I could see he was really moved on an emotional level."  </P> <P> But whatever his schedule, he said he finds time to write on a daily basis.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Roamed 10 Years  </P> <P> It wasn't always so. After he left prison, he gave up writing and roamed the  country for about 10 years. "I never fully accepted the fact that I was a  writer until a year and a half ago (with the publication of 'Martin')," he  said. "As many times as I chose the gift, I chose the curse. The trouble with  scoffing at human life with indifference is that it's terribly numbing."  </P> <P> Even today, it appears Baca writes to stay fully alive.  </P> <P> "My work is the only thing I've ever had that I could hold onto. . . . I have  to deal with changing diapers, washing dishes, changing doorknobs. I don't  believe this (excrement) about 'I'm an artist, give me a little cottage at the  beach and I'll write,' " he said. "It all comes down to my act of sitting down  in my little room and writing what's in my heart."  </P> <P> Lately, that's been novels. Though a new book of poems is due out this fall,  "The Black Mesa Poems," Baca more recently completed the first novel in a  trilogy about his life. "In the Way of the Sun" covers his early orphanage  years, and once again, he offers an unexpected view.  </P> <P> "It was an incredible paradise of sorts," he said of his orphanage experience.  "For a child who's isolated and only hears the sound of horses and cows and  church bells ringing, it was an incredibly exhilarating playground. . . . Can  you imagine the shoe room, with 70,000 pairs of shoes and you find one that  fits and then try to find its mate?"  </P> <P> Suddenly, Jimmy Santiago Baca was a kid again, back in his marble shooting  days, bartering Fizzies for marbles and marbles for firecrackers and  firecrackers for chocolate. He remembered how he and his friends plotted ways  to steal the glass eye of a man who visited the orphanage. They wanted to use  the guy's eye to win an upcoming marble tournament.  </P> <P> As Baca's dark eyes widened, he flashed to the simple, childhood logic behind  the quest for the glass eye: "We thought it could see!"  </P></p>

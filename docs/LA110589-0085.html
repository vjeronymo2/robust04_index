			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW YORK;  </P> <P> 10 TEEN-AGERS HELD IN PIN-JAB ATTACKS  </P> <P> Ten girls arrested for allegedly jabbing 39 women in a series of attacks on the  streets of Manhattan's Upper West Side told police the unprovoked strikes were  staged "for fun." The girls, all black high school students aged 13 to 15, face  charges of juvenile delinquency. Most of the victims were white women between  the ages of 14 and 55, police said. Some victims had expressed concern that the  weapons used in the attacks were hypodermic needles contaminated with the AIDS  virus. But officials said the suspects told police they had pricked the women  with ordinary pins.  </P></p>

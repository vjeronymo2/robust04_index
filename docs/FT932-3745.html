			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Hog wild in Milwaukee: Bikers are celebrating more than a 90th birthday at Harley-Davidson It will be Hog Heaven. About 60,000 leather-clad motor cyclists will rumble into the US city of Milwaukee today to celebrate one of the greatest icons of American popular culture - the Harley-Davidson motorcycle. It is 90 years since the first crude Harley was assembled in the Davidson family's Milwaukee backyard, and to mark the occasion convoys of bikers have spent the past week riding their Harleys - which enthusiasts call 'hogs' - to the city from every corner of North America. Today they will party. By the shore of Lake Michigan they will eat, drink and rock to the sounds of ZZ Top, a band whose members ride customised Harleys known as Hogzillas. Some of the aficionados will get married, taking their vows in a riot of gleaming chrome and buffed leather on the front steps of that holy of holies, the red brick Harley-Davidson headquarters building. The brides, naturally, will wear black. But this is much more than a birthday party. It will also celebrate the revival of a company which 10 years ago seemed to be at death's door, another example of an industry killed by competition from Japan. Instead, Harley has beaten back rivals such as Honda, Kawasaki and Suzuki, and its share of the US market for big bikes (over 850ccs) has risen to about 60 per cent from a nadir of 23 per cent in 1983, even though the overall market has dropped substantially during the decade. Harley is starting to focus more on international sales, where it sees big growth potential, since it has only 10 to 15 per cent of the market outside America. However, its machines are so popular in the US - despite often having a much higher price tag than Japanese rivals - that the company cannot keep pace with demand, even though it has more than doubled annual output over the past six years to about 80,000 cycles. The bikes have to be painstakingly rationed out among dealers, with only 30 per cent reserved for the export market. The turnaround is a case study in how western companies can take on the Japanese and win, helped by a degree of protectionism, attention to quality, employee involvement and, in Harley's case, clever marketing. For the company is selling far more than a humble means of transport. It is marketing a lifestyle - what executives refer to as 'the Harley experience'. This blends images of macho, rebellious US individuality and personal freedom - a Harley rider alone on the open road, somewhere in the vastness of America - with down-to-earth group social events organised by the company. The Harley motto - 'Live to ride, ride to live ' - has an irresistible appeal to many people trapped in humdrum jobs. Ageing baby boomers find solace in the suggestion that a Harley engine contains the elixir of youth. 'A Harley-Davidson is ageless and timeless,' runs one advertisement. 'On it, you cannot grow old.' All this has helped the company broaden the appeal of its products beyond the industry's traditional young, male, blue-collar customers to professionals, the middle-aged, and women. The average US owner, according to the company's market research, is 38, married, with a household income of Dollars 43,000 a year. Some 20 per cent of buyers are women. Harley maintains that Hell's Angels, one of the company's most visible customer groups, make up only 1 per cent of the total. None of this recent marketing success would have been possible without the particular mystique which has long surrounded Harley, making it seem the serious biker's bike. This is partly to do with Harley's styling - raw, yet glamorous - and partly with its V-twin engine, which gives out a distinctive thump likened by some to the beat of the heart. The image has been powerfully reinforced by Hollywood. Peter Fonda rode a modified Harley in the classic 1960s road movie, Easy Rider. Arnold Schwarzenegger mounted a Harley Fat Boy in Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Still, the brand name was little help at the start of the 1980s, when Harley's market share skidded because of quality problems. Its engines were technologically primitive and tended to leak oil, while an attempt to expand production rapidly meant half the machines coming off its assembly line had missing parts. In 1983, the loss-making business was sold by the then owner, the conglomerate AMF, to its management, and many observers predicted early bankruptcy. However, the new team radically changed the way it made bikes, imitating Japanese methods of quality control. Says Mr Jeffrey Bleustein, who heads the motorcycle operations: 'It took us a while before we realised they (the Japanese) were just better managers than we were.' Harley also developed a more sophisticated engine, got government help (in the form of tariffs on Japanese imports, lifted in 1987) and, in 1986, eased its heavy debt burden with a public flotation. Despite the surge in demand for its products, the company has been careful to expand production gradually. Stung by poor quality once, it does not want a repeat performance. Unlike many consumer product companies, Harley concentrates most of its marketing expenditure on customers after they have bought its machines. The idea is to hook them for life on 'the Harley experience', buying more and more expensive bikes when they trade their old ones in. The price range runs from around Dollars 4,800 (Pounds 3,100) to more than Dollars 16,000. Central to this was the formation of the Harley Owners' Group - Hog for short - a club restricted to Harley buyers, which organises rallies and charity fund-raisers. It not only promotes a sense of exclusivity and purpose among owners, but also gives the company valuable feedback on fashion trends among bikers, who like to customise their machines with individual flourishes. 'The motorcycles are the canvas, the parts and accessories are the paint; that's where everyone can express their individuality,' says Mr Jerry Wilke, marketing chief. A central figure at the rallies is Harley's head of design, Mr William Davidson, known as 'Willie G', a grandson of one the company's founders. He has been responsible for many of the company's most important model innovations, such as the 1971 Super Glide with its extended front forks, and the 1977 Low Rider, with its seat close to the ground. Many bikers think he embodies the soul of the company. With his thick beard, dark glasses and fringed leather jacket he looks the part. Fans often ask him to carve his name with a screwdriver in the metal of their machines. However, Harley's top executives are all keen bikers and are leading each of the 90th anniversary convoys across country towards Milwaukee, raising money for charity as they go. It is hard to get closer to the customer than that. Another important marketing initiative has been to encourage Harley dealers to transform their outlets from grimy workshops into attractive retail outlets, selling not only bikes but a broad range of Harley brand accessories, clothes and momentos, made by or licensed from the company. Women can buy black Harley bathing suits, with the company name studded across the front. All this has transformed Harley's profits. It made Dollars 53.8m last year on turnover of Dollars 1.1bn. Debt on the balance sheet is now negligible. Next month it will mark a milestone on its return to financial health by paying its first dividend since flotation. The recent record, however, is not flawless. The company also owns Holiday Rambler, which makes Recreational Vehicles - caravan-like trucks in which Americans cruise around the continent. Holiday Rambler makes little money (it lost Dollars 13m in 1991) and Wall Street would like Harley to sell the business. Industry observers are also a little edgy about the company's plan to expand motorcycle production by 25 per cent by 1996 to 100,000 a year. Harley insists that it will do so in a way which retains the quality of its bikes and service, but the analysts note that it suffered hiccups recently with a new paint plant. Some also ask whether Harley's popularity, as well as a small upturn in the US motorbike market in the past two years, could be a fad. But Mr Richard Teerlink, the chief executive, although concerned about the company growing arrogant, says confidently: 'This is a fad that has been going on for a long time - 90 years.'</p>

			<p>POLITICIANS,  PARTY PREFERENCES      Summary:  Newspapers in the Former Yugoslav Republic of     Macedonia have published the results of opinion polls,     indicating the relative popularity of politicians,     political parties, and attitudes toward the political system.      The 22-23 January edition of the Skopje newspaper VECER in  Macedonian published on pages 6-7 the results of an opinion poll  conducted by the "BriMa" agency in November 1993. According to  VECER, 1,036 respondents were classified by age and residence, but  the paper did not explain the methodology or give the margin of  error.  For the purpose of comparison, the paper cited the results  of an unidentified poll made in May 1993. The approval/disapproval  ratings, in percent, for ten Macedonian politicians were:                                              November 1993    May 1993   Kiro Gligorov, President of the Republic      76/15           78/13   Vasil Tupurkovski, former Macedonian          50/36           43/37     official in Federal Yugoslavia   Ljubomir Frckovski, Interior Minister         50/42           42/43   Stojan Andov, Parliamentary Chairman          48/41           48/39   Branko Crvenkovski, Prime Minister            46/41           44/38   Vlado Popovski, Defense Minister              41/41           36/37   Stevo Crvenkovski, Foreign Minister           40/43   No Data Given   Petar Gosev, Democratic Party leader          34/53           40/42   Todor Petrov, Independent parliamentarian     32/53   No Data Given   Nikola Popovski, Social Democratic            29/46           32/42     Party parliamentarian      VECER noted that President Gligorov's very high approval rating  of 90 percent among those over age 65 fell off to a still high 70  percent among respondents between 18 and 24.  Residents of Skopje  ranked the politicians in a slightly different order from the  ranking given by the whole sample: Gligorov, Tupurkovski, Frckovski,  Andov, Gosev, Branko Crvenkovski, Vlado Popovski, Petrov, Nikola  Popovski, and Stevo Crvenkovski.      The results of a series of opinion polls conducted by the Agency  for Public Opinion Research and published "exclusively" by the  Skopje weekly PULS newspaper, confirmed Gligorov's substantial lead  in popularity among political figures.  According to the 31 December  1993 issue of PULS (pages 16-18), the agency gathered the data by  means of telephone interviews with 300 residents in the Republic of  Macedonia during 20-24 December. PULS also provided data from  surveys made in March, June, and September for comparison.  Some of  the following percentages are approximate values that were derived  from the graph published by the paper:                            March       June      September    December   Kiro Gligorov             87          82.33      89.33           89  Stevo Crvenkovski         54          65         49              63  Stojan Andov              61          62         60              61  Branko Crvenkovski        56          60         54  53.5  Ljubomir Frckovski        35          45         48              50  Petar Gosev               50          31         52  49.53  Jovan Andonov,   Deputy Prime Minister    39          39         50              37  Vlado Popovski            18          25         36              35  Kiro Popovski, Deputy   Chairman, Parliament     26          27         33              32  Ante Popovski, leader of   MAAK (Movement for All-   Macedonian Action)       29          32         32  indistinct  Jane Miljovski, Minister   without Portfolio        --          23         31              24  Vladimir Golubovski   VMRO-DP (Internal   Macedonian Revolutionary   Organization-Democratic   Party) leader            --          30         25              23  Nevzat Halili   Party for Democratic   Prosperity official      38.33       38         18              18   Lj upco Georgievski  VMRO-DPMNE (Internal  Macedonian Revolutionary  Organization-Democratic  Party for Macedonian  National Unity)  official                  18          10         16              17  Dosta Dimovska  VMRO-DPMNE  official                  --          11         17              16      On pages 6 and 7 of its 15-16 January issue, VECER also published  the results of a November 1993 survey on party preferences.  "BriMa," working with the Gallup organization, interviewed 1,036  people.      Question: "If elections were held today, for which party would  you vote?" (all numbers are percentages)   SDSM (Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia)  22.8  VMRO-DPMNE                                      11.2  Democratic Party (DP, led by Petar Gosev)        6.3  Socialist Party                                  3.3  Liberal Party (LP)                               3.2  Workers Party                                    2.9  PCERM (Party for the Full Emancipation of      Romanies in Macedonia)                       1.8  Democratic Party of Turks in Macedonia           0.8  MAAK                                             0.3  Another party                                    4.0  Undecided                                       18.6  Would not vote                                   6.6      VECER noted that some parties fared better in certain cities than  their overall scores indicate.  For example, the DP was about twice  as popular in Skopje as elsewhere, getting 12.1 percent in the  capital; the VMRO-DPMNE was more popular in Bitola, getting 15.7  percent, than in the remainder of the country; and the LP in the  Bregalnica area got the support of 10.6 percent, substantially  higher than the 3.2 percent support it received overall.      Question: "Do you have confidence in the following parties?" (all  numbers are percentages)                 Yes           No       Do Not Know   SDSM           28           51          21  VMRO-DPMNE     15           72          14  LP             19           59          22  PDP-NDP*       20           73           7   *Party for Democratic Prosperity-People's Democratic Party      The poll clearly indicated that Macedonians have little  confidence in any of the parties currently active in the country.  Respondents were also asked whether it would be good for the country  to have elections sooner than scheduled; 62 percent agreed, 20  percent disagreed, and 18 percent did not know. These findings were  correlated with party preferences, producing the following results:  Of those who would vote for the SDSM, 54 percent wanted elections  soon, while 34 percent were against early elections. However, 80  percent of VMRO-DPMNE supporters favored elections soon, as did 79  percent of LP supporters and 71 percent of DP supporters. While 80  percent of those surveyed thought that a person should vote (14  percent did not agree), only 40 percent thought that it was very  important which party won the elections and 27 percent thought it  was somewhat significant.

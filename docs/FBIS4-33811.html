			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 10 Jun (AFP) -- Evans Paul, the  mayor-elect of Port-au-Prince, today called for the resignation  of General Raoul Cedras, commander in chief of the Haitian Armed  Forces, to prevent implementation of new economic sanctions  announced by President Bill Clinton.    Paul asserted that "the Governors Island Agreement continues  to be the foundation for a solution to prevent new, very harsh  and painful sanctions, which hurt all Haitians." He added that  "it is vital for Gen. Cedras to recognize the need to respect  his commitments."    Clinton announced a ban on commercial flights to begin on 25  June and a ban on banking operations with Haiti. He also  ordered the return of most of the U.S. citizens residing on the  island.    Frantz Robert Monde, president of the Chamber of Deputies  (close to the socialists), condemned the sanctions President  Clinton implemented. He charged that it was a "racist,  irrational, and an unprecedented decision."    Appalled, Monde asked: "Tell me which U.S. citizen can live  on $50 a month." He was referring to the maximum amount  Haitians living in the United States are authorized to send to  their relatives in Haiti.    "I insist. The international community's strategy tends to  punish those who voted for Jean Bertrand Aristide (the exiled  president), who are the poorest," he said.</p>

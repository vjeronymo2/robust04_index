			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Letter: Electoral hurdle not designed to exclude extremist parties Sir, It is rather misleading of John Willman and Andrew Adonis to suggest in their otherwise admirable guide to electoral systems ('Ballot box conundrum', February 3) that 5-per-cent hurdles, as in Germany, and similar entrance barriers under proportional representation are primarily designed to exclude extremist parties. There is no relationship between the size of a party and its place in the ideological spectrum. A minor party can be centrist (as in Italy or Denmark) and an extremist party can be large. The purpose of such barriers is solely to reduce the number of parties in a parliament. No 5-per-cent clause would have kept the National Socialists out of the parliaments of the Weimar Republic. But it might have helped to stabilise parliamentary government and thereby made extremist parties less attractive. Peter Pulzer, All Souls College, Oxford OX1 4AL</p>

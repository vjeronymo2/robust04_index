			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Today's decision by the Pan-Africanist Congress,  PAC, of South Africa, to suspend its armed struggle has been  widely welcomed by both the South African Government and the ANC  [African National Congress]. The PAC's armed wing, the Azanian  People's Liberation Front, APLA, is against the negotiated  package of reforms, and attacks police officers and  predominantly white venues in its fight against white rule. The  PAC's decision follows widespread condemnation of its violent  tactics from within and outside South Africa, including  Tanzania, which on Tuesday [11 January] barred APLA from  launching attacks from its territory. On the line to  Johannesburg, Audrey Brown asked Thobile Gola, deputy secretary  general of the PAC, why they have decided to suspend the armed  struggle now.    [Begin recording] [Gola] Now that the Electoral Act was  promulgated this week, we had to prepare ourselves for  elections, and it is not feasible that you shoot this side and  you campaign for elections this side. For the sake of peace and  free and fair elections we wanted the PAC to be cleared of all  forms of hostilities or so-called violence, so that they will  remove all excuses that will deny the PAC an opportunity to  participate freely in the elections.    [Brown] Could the adverse [word indistinct] are recent, and  I  say to you: The question of the PAC pursuing negotiations on the  ending of hostilities started as far back as 1990. So, we are  not really influenced by any recent bad publicity or attacks on  white people. The PAC has all along been working toward a mutual  ending of all hostilities by all the parties in conflict -- that  is, the regime and APLA in this case. But, that has not worked  out. But now we are facing elections. It is our own decision  to participate, and therefore we decided today to declare what  we call a unilateral moratorium on armed struggle.    [Brown] So, does that mean that in your negotiations with  the  government you did not obtain mutual cessation of hostilities,  as you call it?    [Gola] It has not been formally agreed. The negotiations  with the regime will continue. We shall pursue those  negotiations to reach a formal mutual cessation and get all that  we need from them -- the amnesty for all those people who are in  prison and all those who are still in exile, and, of course,  talk about what to do with the armed formations in the country.  That agenda still stands and the regime was been dillydallying  all the time when we demanded these meetings.    [Brown] But doesn't this weaken your position, the fact that  you suspended your armed struggle now, because it seems like  your main trump card against them was that you could launch  attacks against them?    [Gola] No, our position is not weakened at all. The first  thing you must understand is that by declaring ourselves ready  to go to elections, we needed a climate of peace in the country.  We feel that we are not weakened. Actually, we are  strengthening our position by taking that direction.    [Brown] But it is possible to see that in another light. It  is possible to see it in the sense that the PAC is coming under  growing pressure and it is losing support by pursuing an armed  struggle and that is why you had to declare your suspension now?    [Gola] I am not sure about losing support. I do not know  from whom are we losing support. We are pursuing a program  here, and a decision was taken by the highest organ of the PAC  to prepare for elections.    [Brown] Is there a sense of sadness in the PAC or amongst  people that the armed struggle has been given up, because it  seems like it was, you know, one of the things that the  organization prided itself in, in that it was fighting back, it  was fighting the South African Government?    [Gola] I have not received any report to say some people  feel  bad about it or feel sad, and therefore I am not worried about  whatever fears you might have. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Russia to retaliate over dead soldiers RUSSIAN Defence Minister Pavel Grachev warned yesterday, on a hastily arranged visit to the Tajik capital of Dushanbe, that Russia would retaliate against the Afghan mujahideen and Tajik opposition fighters who killed 25 Russian servicemen in a clash on the Tajik-Afghan border earlier this week. Describing the fighting as 'an undeclared war against Russia', Gen Grachev said that he could not allow it 'to pass without retaliation'. The increasingly bitter struggle in Tajikistan is just one of many hot-spots in the former Soviet republics which skirt Russia's borders in which ethnic Russians and Russian soldiers are becoming em-broiled. In addition to the conflicts in Central Asia and the Caucasus in the west, Russia risks becoming entangled in Estonia, where ethnic Russians in the north-eastern city of Narva yesterday held a referendum on greater local autonomy. Further south, tensions were high yesterday in the Ukrainian port of Sevastopol, which the Russian parliament claimed last week as a Russian city. In response to a planned attempt by Russian members of parliament to elect a rival city government, Ukraine beefed up its military presence in the port. Anti-Russian demonstrations were held throughout the republic.</p>

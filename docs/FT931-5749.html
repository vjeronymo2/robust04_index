			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Access to Equity: Coming to grips with City language LANGUAGE USED in the debate on smaller company development can sometimes be more confusing than enlightening. The following glossary aims to describe the key elements regularly referred to, yet seldom explained. Business Angels: In the US, wealthy private individuals are keen investors in small businesses. Attempts have been made to create similar networks in the UK, though their impact has been limited. Angels are long-term investors, they do not charge the high fees of professional venture capitalists, and they often have business experience to help out their investee companies Business Expansion Scheme: Created to allow investors to buy shares in small unquoted companies and receive tax relief. The scheme will close at the end of the year. Competent Authority: Determines listing rules with which companies must comply to join the Official List. The Financial Services Act decrees that the UK has only one authority overseeing the Official List and that is the London Stock Exchange. Part five of the FSA (still being drafted) is expected to entitle the Secretary of State to empower bodies other than the Stock Exchange to authorise listings. Delta Notice Board: Displays prices for companies traded under Rule 535.2 Development Capitalists: Generally fund management buy-outs and buy-ins. Originally intended to be one step up from venture/seed capitalists. Liquidity: The depth of the market in a company's shares. The market in a smaller company's shares is often less liquid due to various factors: market capitalisation, the number of shares issued and the narrow spread of ownership. Listing Rules: Established by the Stock Exchange and comprising a somewhat complicated regime of initial and on-going standards to which listed companies must comply. The Exchange's ability to act is restricted by EC directives. London Stock Exchange: Has three different roles - (a) the competent authority for listing in the UK and regulates the so-called primary market for distribution of new issues; (b) operates and regulates a secondary market for buying and selling shares; (c) a clearing house for the settlement of trades in UK equities. Marketmakers: Obliged to display firm bid or offer prices on Seaq and deal at those prices using their own capital. The size of the spread between the best bid and offer price on Seaq can deter investing in less liquid securities. Investors should note that, when dealing in reasonable amounts of stock, the quoted price is only a basis for negotiation. Nasdaq: The North American market operated by the National Association of Securities Dealers, was once dedicated to smaller companies but many grew large. Developed out of the OTC market, and now the third largest equity market in the world. Official List: Securities that have been admitted to the market by the Stock Exchange. The vast majority of the 2,200 or so companies on the list are valued at less than Pounds 50m. Over the counter market: Once referred to trading of shares in unlisted securities. In the early 1980s a pseudo-market was operated by Harvard Securities among others. It satisfied demand from those investors seeking high growth and prepared to take risks. The UK no longer has an OTC market, but the term is often used to refer to the Nasdaq market which has an OTC tier. Recognised investment exchange: A market, such as Nasdaq or Liffe, for the buying and selling of securities. Must have a rule book that ensures fair play and can be enforced. The LSE has not been granted, but in effect enjoys, a monopoly in UK equity trading. Seaq: The Stock Exchange's main dealing system for the USM and fully listed companies. It displays bid and offer prices provided by competing marketmakers who are obliged to quote prices throughout the day. Introduced in 1986, it is increasingly seen as a less than ideal method of trading in small companies. Seats: Stock Exchange Alternative Trading System. Provides company information, customer limit orders and, in some cases, a single marketmaker providing a continuous two-way price on a single dealing screen. It is widely regarded as more in tune with smaller company trading. It is not a separate market and trades USM and Official List securities. Shells: Small companies with few assets which can provide an attractive route to the stock market via a reverse takeover by a private company. Small businesses: Privately-owned, often family-owned, where the owners and the managers are one and the same. The Companies Act defines them as companies with two of the following three characteristics - turnover up to Pounds 2.8m, a balance sheet total of up to Pounds 1.4m, and up to 50 employees. Small companies: Not to be confused with small businesses. Generally defined as companies valued at less than Pounds 150m; some leading institutional investors would pitch the threshold at Pounds 250m. Roughly speaking, 80 per cent of listed compnaies are categorised as small. Third Market: For companies that failed to meet the USM requirements. Low regulatory requirements and the questionable activities of some sponsors undermined its image. It was closed in 1989. Unlisted Securities Market: Operated by the Stock Exchange for securities which do not meet the requirements of the Official List. A primary market regime distinguished by less onerous intial and on-going listing requirements. Trading of USM securities is no different than in listed securities. The USM captured the entrepreneurial spirit of the 1980s boom period and attracted 850 companies. While most are small, some have been capitalised at more than Pounds 1bn. Venture Capital: Few venture capitalists are nowadays willing to provide seed capital for start-ups. Venture capitalists need suitable exit routes to realise their investments and thus are concerned about proposals to close the USM. The 535.2 market: Stock Exchange Rule 535.2 allows member firms to seek special dispensation to deal in the shares of companies not on the Official List or the USM. These stocks are normally dealt on a matched bargain basis, and include household names such as Weetabix.</p>

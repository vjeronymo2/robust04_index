			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhang Dacheng] </F>   [Text] Baghdad, June 24 (XINHUA) -- A team of UN arms  experts have sealed Iraq's medium-range missiles in an effort to  prevent them from being modified into long-range missiles that  are banned by the UN resolution ending the 1991 Gulf war.    Mark Silver, an American ballistic missile expert and head  of  the 30-member team, told reporters today that they have  accomplished all the task to put tags on the operational  missiles for the non-modification purpose.    "These missiles are very dangerous because they are in a  capability that are ready to launch," silver said upon his  departure for New York.    Along with the chemical, biological and nuclear weapons,  Iraq's long-range missiles had been destroyed by the end of  March 1992 in accordance with UN resolutions, but Iraq is  allowed to possess and produce medium- and short-range missiles  (less than 150 kilometers) for self-defense.    A missile reportedly exploded last year while under test at  an Iraqi site, damaging the surrounding UN monitoring video  cameras which are remotely controlled by UN experts in downtown  Baghdad.    The missiles experts also paid a total of seven inspections  to Iraqi missile sites and facilities during their 15-day  mission, but they found no violation of the cease-fire terms,  Silver said.    He praised his Iraqi counterparts' cooperation during his  mission, saying, "The Iraqis did what we were asking them to do."    Silver and his men are expected to come back to Iraq  periodically to inspect and verify the tags on the missiles as  part of the UN plan for long-term monitoring of Iraq's  weapons-related industries which was accepted by Iraq last  November.    "Among taggings, cameras and other surveillance means, the  best way is human eye," Silver said. "They cannot beat the  human eye."    Iraqi compliance with destruction of its nuclear, biological  and chemical weapons and long-range missiles and monitoring of  its weapons programs is a prerequisite to lifting the UN oil  embargo though the United States has been seeking to add other  conditions.</p>

			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Observer: Sign of times Europe's nuclear engineers and scientists could have been happier in the timing of their hunt for a new symbol to generate public confidence in the peaceful uses of their technology. The search coincides with a second international post mortem, being staged in Paris, on the Chernobyl disaster. What the Swiss-based European Nuclear Society is seeking is a replacement for the care-worn emblem of electrons whirling round a nucleus, used by the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency as well as numerous other organisations. Ironically, the atom depicted is usually lithium - a metal with nuclear uses confined to weapons. Also listed for scrapping, it appears, is the morbid jargon nuclear scientists once found wryly amusing, instances being criticality, decay, casket and scram. Sometimes such jokes have backfired. China syndrome, for instance, was born when a scientist suggested a reactor-core meltdown in the US midwest might burn right through the earth and emerge in China. The phrase was borrowed for the title of a scare film which - when journalists sent to cover the Three Mile Island emergency were faced with an information blackout - inspired some alarmingly speculative reports. While the society is open to ideas for a replacement emblem from all sources, it already has a suggestion from Soviet nuclear scientists: a symbol in which the whirling electrons trace a dove.</p>

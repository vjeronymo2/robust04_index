			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: Strong third quarter helps Lufthansa reduce deficit AGGRESSIVE cost-cutting helped Lufthansa return to profit in the third quarter, the state-controlled German airline said yesterday . It said in the three months ended September it made a parent company pre-tax profit of DM145m (Dollars 85.8m). This cut the loss for the first nine months to DM76m, sharply down from the DM262m deficit in the same period last year. Lufthansa forecast it would meet its target of halving operating losses by the end of the year, despite the usual seasonal weakness of the final quarter. For the whole of last year, the parent company lost DM297m. The airline's objective is to reduce this loss to around DM150m for the year as a whole. Lufthansa said the return to profit in the third quarter was due to rationalisation rather than any revival in the crisis-stricken airline industry. Operating expenditure for the first nine months fell 4.5 per cent, while personnel costs dropped 9 per cent. In total, the number of group employees was down by 5,500, or 11 per cent, in the period from mid-1992 to the end of September this year. This was against the backdrop of continuing price erosion in the industry. Prices for passenger flights had dropped by 8 per cent per kilometre over the last year, and by 2 per cent for freight. The passenger total rose 3.5 per cent to 25.8m in the nine months, and cargo volume rose 1.6 per cent to 790,000 tonnes. However, pressure on prices meant the group's turnover slipped 0.8 per cent to DM11.9bn. The impact of the fall in revenue was offset by the combination of cost-cutting and a substantial increase in capacity utilisation, with the overall load factor climbing by 4.4 per cent to 69 per cent. This led to better operating results, Lufthansa said. Separately yesterday, Mr Hemjo Klein, a member of the Lufthansa board, said the airline would increase prices for internal German flights by DM20 to DM40 per ticket from the beginning of next year. Addressing a travel agents' conference in Tunisia, he said prices within Europe were likely to be increased by between 2 and 10 per cent.</p>

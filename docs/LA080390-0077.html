			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST IMPRESSIONS: CONTROVERSIAL ART BUT A CLASSIC STEAK  </P> <P> Above the entrance to Venice's North Beach Bar &amp; Grill, artist Jonathan  Borofsky's 30-foot-tall unshaven ballerina clown balances en pointe, its right  leg slowly swaying back and forth. It is controversial art, and now, with the  opening of the restaurant it announces, it may be Los Angeles' oddest maitre  d'.  </P> <P> Inside the North Beach, a waterfall made of rusted steel anchors the dining  room. Displayed like art objects throughout the restaurant are several classic  Bauer bowls, arranged by size like a family portrait from Baby Bauer to Papa  Bauer. Between the clown outside and decor within, you might get the feeling  that you're in for a trendy, multi-ethnic meal.  </P> <P> Then you get the menu: Beefsteak tomato and red onion salad, Caesar salad, New  York steak, rib eye steak, shrimp cocktail too. The North Beach Bar &amp; Grill  turns out to be a classic steakhouse at heart.  </P> <P> There are non-steaky things -- oysters on the half-shell, chicken roasted with  rosemary and garlic, pork chops with applesauce (made at the restaurant and  thick with pieces of apple), linguine with clams -- but nothing jarring or  controversial.  </P> <P> There's even good service -- the kind you'd expect from an old-fashioned  steakhouse. No clowning around.  </P> <P> North Beach Bar and Grill, 111 Rose Ave., Venice. (213) 399-3900. LAURIE OCHOA  </P></p>

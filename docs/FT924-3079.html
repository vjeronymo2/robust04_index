			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Global Custody (10): Stronger commitment - Profile of Swiss Bank Corporation TWO years ago, the FT published a debate between two senior executives of Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC) on whether the bank was wise to continue to develop its global custody business. Today, the argument rages on, both within SBC and throughout the banking community, but SBC's commitment to global custody seems, if anything, stronger than it was two years ago. 'We are fully committed,' says Mr Ernst Balsiger, executive vice-president of SBC in Zurich, but he also predicts a big shake-out in the sector in the next few years as excessive competition leads to a margin squeeze. SBC's involvement in global custody is interesting in at least two respects. In the first place, the bank is still trying to carve out a strong independent role for itself in this increasingly competitive business, while the two other big Swiss banks, Union Bank of Switzerland and Credit Suisse, appear to be more cautious. Second, it is running the business in London, not in Switzerland. But, first, some qualifications and clarifications. All the Swiss banks have been carrying out global custody, in the strict sense of the term, for decades. Indeed, it would probably be fair to say they were pioneers in global custody, for it was their wealthy private clients from around the world who were among the first to accept the idea of a mix of securities from various countries in their portfolios. Similarly, the big Swiss banks all carry out global custody for their Swiss and, to varying degrees, foreign institutional customers in Switzerland, and they act as sub-custodians in Switzerland for global custodians based in other countries. Where SBC differs is in aggressively marketing a global custody service based in London to investment institutions and banks around the world. 'All our institutional clients, even Swiss ones, are directed there,' Mr Balsiger says. The strategic decision to proceed this way was taken three years ago, with the idea being to build on the unusually strong sub-custodian business SBC had built in London over several years. According to Mr Alan Taylor, director of global custody in London, the bank provides this service for nearly 150 non-British banks. The bank is typically discreet about the size of its London business - 'not quite as substantial as that of the UK clearing banks,' says Mr Taylor. 'We rank as one of the best, but it is not our goal to be the biggest,' adds Mr Balsiger. And the business has 'broken even', he adds. The group has developed an electronic system to support its custody operation so that clients can request information at SBC offices throughout the world. Mr Taylor dismisses the widespread view that global custody will become a commodity business, thus squeezing out all but the largest players. 'When we are asked to compete for an account these days, we often get a 20-page questionnaire to fill out. That is not a characteristic of commodity businesses.' He says there remain many differences in the service features provided by global custodians. SBC, with a staff of 50 in its London operation, emphasises staff training so that client requests can be dealt with intelligently. The bank assigns a single officer to each client, who visits the client regularly, talks his language and tries to respond to his needs. Meanwhile, in Switzerland, SBC is pursuing a dual strategy on custodial services. It is a member of Intersettle, the organisation being set up by many Swiss banks to provide settlement and custody services on foreign transactions. Intersettle is expected to take over much, if not all, of their Swiss-based global custody business for institutions. But it is also maintaining a strong custodial capability as part of its total service package for private clients. 'There we have an advantage because our private clients will never try to become members of international clearing organisations,' says Mr Balsiger.</p>

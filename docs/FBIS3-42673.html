			<p>Language: <F P=105> Kazakh </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article in two installments by Seydakhmet Quttyqadam: "What </F> Are the Politicians Going To Do for Us?"]  <H5>  [23 Oct p 2] </H5>   [Text] It would be difficult for any observant, thinking  person witnessing the flow of specific political events in  Kazakhstan to be an optimist. Such a person would be forced to  observe clearly the difficulty of extricating ourselves from a  crisis which embraces every area of the life of our young  nation. Those with power in their hands, instead of struggling  heroically against the dangerous problems hanging over our  heads, stick their heads in the creeping sand dunes and give  themselves to sweet political dreams, thereby resembling amorous  prairie hens seeking to comfort each other. They are like some  seer prophesying in advance that there must be disaster. It is  no wonder that the very worst projections become reality these  days.    However, it is still not easy to agree with the statement  that there are no energies being expended on well-thought-out  and creative efforts, capable of depriving us of the [vain]  hopes we are so fond of due to peculiarities of human nature,  and of turning back the dangerous flow of events in our society.  These efforts should be aimed at ordinary people with the intent  of removing them from indolence and awakening them from the  present state which saps strength and ardor.    One of the fires of hope, glowing in the hearts of the  people, is the fact that there is no doubt about the activism of  the political structures. They should be capable of taking upon  their own shoulders responsibility for the fate of a nation,  which has lost its potential for happiness, and for the fate of  a worn out people. Only those who are not endeavoring to take  power into their hands solely for the sake of power will achieve  victory. All of this is going on under very complex  circumstances. There is unprecedented economic crisis. The  people are becoming impoverished. General social dejection and  desperation is growing. The government is incapable of ruling  the country. There is a cold wind of a bloody future civil war  in Russia. There is the unabashed arrogance in that country's  relations with us. Separatist notions are on the rise in some  regions. Relations are tense to a considerable degree among  representatives of executive and legislative authority. Also...  the season for new elections to parliament is here.    Before reviewing the shape of politics in the Republic, it  would seem proper to explain our terminology. Indeed, according  to the "traditional" explanation, there are revolutionaries on  the left, reformists, i.e., centrists, and conservatives on the  right. However, under our present conditions these definitions  do not in fact correspond to the real state of affairs. (Since  it would take a great deal of time to prove this I will let it  go.) We should define the terms as follows: the "leftists" are  those supporting an emphasis on returning to their political  heritage of only a short time ago; the "rightists" support  nationalist movements and traditions; the "centrists" support  reforms and a consensus of the entire people. The fact is that  we should forget this division as a given. However, lacking such  a set division, we should remember that it will be extremely  difficult to classify political movements.    Thus we divide all the political structures in Kazakhstan  into the following groupings:    1) socialists, i.e., the Socialist Party (QSP [Qazaqstan  Sotsialistik Partiya]), the Social Democratic Party (QSDP  [Qazaqstan Sotsial-Demokratiyalyq Partiya]), the Communist Party  (QKP [Qazaqstan Kommunistik Partiya]), and neocommunist  organizations, i.e., the local Branch of the All-Union Communist  Party (BK[b]P), the Communist Union (in Qaraghandy City), and  others;    2) centrists, i.e., the Kazakhstan People's Unity Union  (QKhBO [Qazaqstan Khalyq Birligi Odaghy]), the People's Congress  (QKhK [Qazaqstan Khalyq Kongresi]), the Democratic Progress  Party (QDPP [Qazaqstan Demokratiyalyq Progress Partiyasy]), the  recently formed Party for the Development of Rights (QQDP  [Qazaqstan Quqyqtyq Damu Partiyasy]), and others;    3) rightists, i.e., the National Democratic Party, the  Civil "Azat" Movement, the Republican Party (QRP [Qazaqstan  Respubliqalyq Partiya]), the "Alash" National Liberation Party  (secret movement), the Kazachestvo Movement, and others;    4) among the social and environmental movements there are  mixed groups formed by the Almaty Workers Movement, the Farmers'  Party, and the "Tabighat [Nature]" Party for Justice and the  Flourishing of the Environment.    There is no doubt that other structures, centers such as the  Independent Labor Union Center, the Federation of Labor Unions,  trade unions belonging to individual independent sector  industries, and national and cultural centers and societies have  a certain degree of influence on the political atmosphere of the  republic.    Four parties and movements merit special mention due to  their  particular weight today among varied parties, movements, and  sects. They are: the Kazakhstan Socialist Party, the Kazakhstan  Peoples Congress, the Kazakhstan People's Unity Union, and the  Civil "Azat" Movement.    Let us now look at the kind of potentialities each of them  has.    I. Kazakhstan Socialist Party    The Kazakhstan Socialist Party is the party of persons,  weary  of taking responsibility for crimes committed by others on their  shoulders. The last congress of the Communist Party and the  First Congress of the Socialist Party took place in September of  1991. Since that time it has been forced to do a great deal of  searching in order to find its political way in new  circumstances. Thereby, the party strives to maintain a  social-reformist direction and to be true to the socialist  heritage. In the end, this party has made known that it supports  democracy, a market economy, the independence of Kazakhstan, and  social protection of the people. At the same time the party has  made known that it is not against the closest possible  integration within the framework of the CIS, even the  establishment of confederative relations and the formation of  structures that are extra-national.    The total number of Socialists (according to information  from  the Ministry of Justice dated 17 July, 1993) is 47,240 persons,  and there were 1,586 primary party organizations as of December,  1992.    The party has a special apparatus formed from a very fine  organizational structure, and officials experienced in activism.    However, since Nursultan Nazarbayev publicly announced his  support for the Kazakhstan People's Unity Union, there has been  much uncertainty among the ranks of members, among which are  activist members. There has been observed a trend among them to  pass over to the party of the president.    Hitherto, the Kazakhstan Socialist Party has supported the  policies of the government. However, now the criticism of the  government has begun to grow gradually. They have said that it  is carrying out its regular policies poorly, that it does not  understand reform models correctly, and that it is growing apart  from the people. This party did not take part in the "round  table" held in the capital. The reason, as the party made clear,  is that a "round table" is a poor way for creating solidarity  among the parties. However, the real reason was the cool  relationships among the leading figures of the party.    At present this party is distancing itself from its former  policies, and has begun to seek new slogans and new methods of  work. However, when these efforts expose socialist ideology  itself, they are no easy thing. The first issue of the newspaper  RESPUBLIKA has appeared. Set forth there, on the eve of the  election campaign, are party tactics and a draft of the basic  platform of the Socialist Party. The success of the party will  now depend to a considerable degree on how they are able to put  these tactics into practice.    It would seem that the attitude of the chairman of the  Kazakhstan Socialist Party, Anwar Alimzhanov, favoring, more or  less, the need to closely follow the party line and to hold the  reins as tight as possible in a time of consolidation, is not  entirely suited to these times. For that reason, criticism of  him has intensified even from among those closest to him.    At present it is difficult to say exactly what the fate of  the party will be, and how much success it will gain in the  struggle to elect deputies. However, if we remember the social  circumstances of a people in a very difficult state and the  strengthening of the longing for the past socialist way of life,  this party cannot be disregarded. Under certain circumstances it  would not be surprising if its influence increased radically. At  present the Kazakhstan Socialist Party needs a powerful and bold  leader who will be able to mobilize the ranks of the party  closely around him, and who will know how to unify all the  leftist movements. If this need is met, the party could become a  very powerful political force.    II. The Kazakhstan People's Unity Union    The Kazakhstan People's Unity Union appeared on the Republic  political scene after the proclamation of the Announcement of  the 34 on 5 February, 1993. Those individuals, stirring things  up at various levels, have in general begun to become members.  For that reason the opponents of this party have referred to it  as a "nomenclatura" party or a "government party." The party's  abbreviated name, QXBO, is understood as "Kazakhstan Union of  Rich Members of the Nomenclatura."    However, the organizers of the Union have begun to show that  those who say this are not correct. This is because the persons  signing the Announcement of the 34 were representatives of the  broad ranks of the Kazakh intelligentsia, and there are many  young representatives among them. Likewise, we think the fact  that Serik Abdirakhmanov, chosen chairman of the Political  Kenges of the Union, has begun criticism of the establishment  will make possible the repulse of whatever the pronouncement [of  criticism] we lay on.    The Union has a policy line of centrist character. However,  the members of the People's Congress Party claim that the ideas  of the Union were stolen from them. It is difficult to say now  how just this accusation against the party is. However, it  cannot be denied that the platforms of the two parties have a  certain similarity. At the same time it must be admitted that,  in general terms, the centrist views of the party are different  in their universality. On top of that it is a known fact that  Nursultan Nazarbayev has for some time given his blessing to the  ideas of the Union.    This gave Nazarbayev the opportunity to have his own  political philosophies carried out in the hands of S.  Abdirakhmanov without the latter making any reference to  himself. In fact Abdirakhmanov had become the owner of a  powerful political organization that has relied on the  employment of higher political groups. A large fund called  "Yelim-ay" has been established and the mass media, according to  instructions sent down from above, widely propagandized the  Union he headed.    However, the Kazakhstan People's Unity Union has been unable  to be a purely mass or an authoritative organization. It does  not know how to use its potentialities efficiently. For that  reason, a resolution has been enacted on the eve of the  parliamentary elections regarding a change in party leadership.  Vice-Premier Qwanysh Sultanov, a well-known politician, was  chosen in place of Abdirakhmanov. At the same time, a great  event took place in the history of the Union. Nursultan  Nazarbayev, who had hitherto stood as an experienced wise man  between the Kazakhstan People's Congress and the Union, not  turning "to the right or to the left," now moved somewhat to the  right, and made the decision to make known the conditions under  which he would become the public leader of the party.    These two events would have shaken things up in other  parties  or movements. Some made known the criticism that "we have gotten  the president interested by scaring his side." They began to  scold Nursultan Nazarbayev for having missed the paternal truth  offered to all their political children. Dashing cold water on  the subject was the question to Qwanysh Sultanov: "how is it  proper to combine an appointment in the government with a party  office?" The debate: "is the Union a party or is it not a party"  again gained ground.    However, it is clear to any person with vision that such a  change had to take place sooner or later. This is because it is  well known that Nursultan Nazarbayev could not continue to  remain his own man indefinitely. He is the kind of man, in fact,  needed by a party. At the same time, he now needs a party  faithfully devoted to himself. Likewise, he needs a powerful  political party to defend his interests against the  establishments. There is a great deal of dispute about the  Kazakhstan People's Unity Union, but it is a political union  with more than 70,000 persons in its ranks, and it has branches  in almost every oblast of the republic. We should not worry so  much about the identity of the party. For this above all results  will be important.    In connection with the appearance of a new party chief and a  new party official leader, the role played by the Union in  republic political life has changed considerably, something  which is in any case well known. Qwanysh Sultanov is full of  energy; he is intelligent and competent, shrewd, and a  politician who is painstaking in what he does. He knows well the  rules of the political events taking place within the scope of  the republic and the secrets of responsible internal politics.    There was a reason why he was chosen Union party chief. If  we  bear in mind the well-known disputes about his election among  the higher political leaders, and especially among the branches  of government power, we understand that the confidence placed in  him is extremely great. At present Qwanysh Sultanov is  completely involved in party work, and is devoting his efforts  to establishing very good order there quickly and, to  reestablishing in the shortest possible time the Kazakhstan  People's Unity Union as a resourceful and clearly-defined party  in contrast to its present careless state. However, in  connection with his own political biography, Sultanov has a  reputation for shrewdness and strives to "measure seven times  and cut once." He is not going to recreate the ship of the  party, and he is not going to change the party command all that  greatly. He, fundamentally, will work with the material he has  in hand. For that reason he is striving as quickly as possible  to gain control of all vacancies under the influence of the  organizational nomenklatura in his administration. However, it  will not be so easy to exert a positive influence in other  areas. Nonetheless, under circumstances where the Union plays  the role of party No. 1, he will be able to increase hopes  through his own influence.    There are experienced units of people playing an activist  role in the ranks of the party. At present it has a sufficient  number of powerful leaders. However, there is a need for clever  people who have the oratory skilld to bring the broad masses of  the people to the side of the party quickly, who communicate,  and who have gained special [public] exposure.    III. Kazakhstan People's Congress    The Kazakhstan People's Congress Party, which thinks of  itself as a centrist, liberal-democratic party, is, more or  less, the most active party among all the other political  parties at present. It has taken upon itself the role of  opposition and of criticism of the government. We know that its  goals are the establishment of a democratic society and a  unitary state based on law.    The Kazakhstan People's Congress thinks of itself as a  narcissistic party of the elder intelligentsia. For that reason  its platform is directed at the creative intellectual community  and professional groups. Due to the reputation of the party's  leader, Olzhas Suleymenov, and the party's newspaper NARODNYY  KONGRESS (very high quality, published in the Kazakh and Russian  languages), its influence has been increased considerably.    According to the ideas of the leaders of the party, the  party  now has nearly 30,000 members. In addition to this, those  controlling the "Nevada-Semey" Movement carry out the orders of  the party exactly.    The Kazakhstan People's Congress Party also has many  problems. The largest problem is how to keep in the party  Komsomolist and national groups, once the second largest part of  the party's membership, after the departure from its ranks of  those supporting Mukhtar Shakhanov. Within party ranks there  have been, sometimes quite openly, continual squabbles about  questions of party tactics and strategy, regarding questions on  confederation with Russia, and methods of administration of the  party apparatus.    However, the group in control of the party is aware of its  deficiencies. There was very open discussion of this in the  Kazakhstan People's Congress Party Plenum which took place this  year at the beginning of October. There was discussion about the  weakness of the party's administration, the slack connection  between the party administration and the oblast organizations of  the party, and the need to draw women and young people broadly  into the party...    It is well known that the "round table" of political  movements was organized under the leadership of the Kazakhstan  People's Congress Party. For that meeting the party organ strove  to carry out the role of conciliator and of advisor. It was  observed that it was not unpleasant for the Kazakhstan People's  Congress Party to play that leading role. Thus, the party strove  to exercise its influence. However such efforts will not always  be lucky. This is because it is a fact that each of the parties  participating in the "round table" has its own narrow interests.    Then the party has overcome the deficiencies obvious to its  own eyes, when it has been able to mobilize its own members to  obligatory hard labor, when it has discovered how to place the  interests of society above the greed of individuals, it is  possible that the Kazakhstan People's Congress Party will  achieve considerable power, and will become the No. 2 party.    The party has powerful leaders, and there are quite a number  of party stalwarts well known to the people. A research center  with its own special character is operating and is capable of  playing an important role in the formation of party strategy and  tactics. However, the work of the party apparatus is  insufficiently experienced.    Bearing in mind the great role played by party leader Olzhas  Suleymenov in the party, it would be proper to discuss him  separately. In addition, just now various things are being said  about him.    It is difficult to find anyone who doubts that Olzhas  Suleymenov has made a major contribution to Kazakh culture.  However, when we come to his political work, opinions are at  odds with one another. Some people think of him as a pure  prophet who has set forth the single correct path leading his  people to happiness. Others believe that he has sold out  national interests to save his own hide. It is not easy here to  make clear which view is the correct one. This is because the  issue is not only in terms of the political meaning of these  questions, but also in terms of their psychological meaning.  Olzhas Suleymenov, thanks to his powerful gifts, has gotten used  to being measured by all-Union standards and Kazakhstan is too  small an arena for him. For that reason he needs the expanses of  Eurasia. In this regard his desire is right for himself. Each  must find his own way. God forbid, but, if our culture remains  in isolation, those making the laws in the area of cultural  tradition will be a monotonous color of gray, and will be feeble  spirits compelling and casting down all things which do not  accord with their narrow interests. The sun of Kazakh culture  will sink. However, looked at from another perspective, it is  well known that contemporary authors such as Thomas Mann,  Bernard Shaw, (and I have not forgotten than ethnically he was  Irish), Albert Camus, William Golding, Gabriel Garcia Marquez,  Julio Cortazar, and others raised themselves from a purely  ethnic basis to a world orbit. For that reason political  boundaries must set no barriers to the free exchange of culture.    In any case, we cannot exonerate most of the opponents of O.  Suleymenov. They have even gone so far as to use very crude  vocabulary. However, Suleymenov does not lag behind them in this  regard. That is to say, he paints all of those he does not agree  with in uniform black. Did he not say: "To be sure there are  among them (his opponents, the author) some honorable men. True  patriots are encountered, but are they all, every one of them,  stupid?" This weakens his argument completely.    The lack of amiability under just such circumstances is a  scrooge sinking into our social soul, and is a restraint for  democracy, and a huge, well-established barrier along the road  to our desired happiness.  <H5>  [27 Oct p 2] </H5>   [Text] "Azat"    In June of 1992 Mikhail Yesenaliyev, former leader of the  Civil "Azat" Movement, made a considerable effort to turn the  various currents of the national-democratic movement into a  single, common channel, and to unify them into a single huge  force. However, nothing came from his efforts. Moreover, at the  time that M. Yesenaliyev realized that his suggestion and effort  were not going to be supported, he gave up hope of being able to  mobilize the potentialities of this movement, and he gradually  laid down foundations separate from the movement. This was a  categoric, resolute, and principled step. With the departure of  M. Yesenaliyev, internal arguments, disputes, and slander openly  gained ground within the nationalist camp.    However, during October of the same year, after the  departure  of M. Yesenaliyev, somehow the Civil "Azat" Movement, the  Kazakhstan Republican Party, and the Kazakhstan  National-Democratic "Zheltoqsan" Party were successful in their  effort to achieve unity. However, the effort has not  accomplished anything. There are a number of reasons for this.  In fact, there was a lack of unanimity in strategy and tactics  for action and in the means for carrying on a political  struggle. Views on state structure, democracy, and internal  party democracy were varied. This by and large happened in  connection with the individual self-interests of the chiefs of  each of the parties.    After this congress called for unity, the young leaders made  Kamal Ormantay chairman of the United "Azat" Party in place of  the candidature of S. Aqatay, chairman of the Kazakhstan  Republic Party. They got excited and blamed Aqatay for trying to  cast the blame on them for the self-interest of the aims  advanced. S. Aqatay, who was unable to gain election to the  united party administration, was forced to walk out of the  congress. Shortly after that he called his own congress. At  present he has announced that only the decisions of this  congress have legal force. At the same time, as often happens in  politics, he was unable to attain his initial goals. Two years  have now passed since then and "Azat," as of October of this  year, is divided into three parts: the Kazakhstan Civil "Azat"  Movement, the People's Democratic Party, and the Kazakhstan  Republican Party, headed separately by Khasen Qozha-Akmet, Kamal  Ormantay, and by Sabetqazy Aqatay. Looking at the present  situation, there is nothing that will put a halt to their  bickering. It is difficult to foresee in advance how it will end.    The group has its own newspaper called AZAT. All in all, the  paper carries out its own independent politics. However, it  cannot be hidden that it is in sympathy with the young leaders.  There is no doubt that they argue with one another and that  there is a principled disagreement which they will not be able  to reconcile. At the same time, it is also not difficult to  understand that behind their heated words lie their individual  self-interests.    All in all, the national democratic movement wishes to  criticize the policies being carried out by the Nazarbayev  government in many areas including giving up nuclear weapons,  its cadre policy, government policy towards Russia (in this case  they are showing no sympathy for the idea suggested by Olzhas  Suleymenov of confederation with Russia), allowing the living  standards of the Kazakhs to decline, allowing the state of the  Kazakh language to remain in an inadequate state up to the  present. However, at present there is still no tested body of  socio-economic-political policies offered by the movement  capable of getting Kazakhstan out of its present crisis.    If the "Azat" national-democratic movement, having overcome  its internal conflicts, finds a powerful leader capable of  putting every thing together, and if they draw up a unified,  tried and true platform, and if they renew the slogans which are  the order of the day, and if they are able to draw intellectuals  over to their side, it would then be possible for them to  achieve considerable success.    Structures Which May Turn Into Parties    We have investigated the possibilities of only the very  large  parties and movements. However, whatever the state of these  other political structures, it is uncertain, given present  conditions, that they will be able to compete with the parties  mentioned above. It is possible that in this area only the labor  movement is special in any way. In truth there are many parties,  but they have no real potentiality.    It would be no surprise if a "Slavic Party" were to emerge  through combining the interethnic "Yedinstvo" Movement, the  "Lad" Slavic Movement, and separatist movements in the north and  east of the Republic. If this were to happen such a party would  have considerable political power, and there would be the need  to take it into consideration.    There is not a little talk about the possibility of  professional groups forming a party.    As the election campaign gets nearer, it is well known that  political activity will strengthen, that each party will examine  more or less completely its specific possibilities, and that all  will endeavor to take whatever actions they need to strengthen  their ranks. A confused struggle will be waged openly by the  parties to draw over to their side figures with strong  organizational powers, orators, the communicators, talented  crafters of words, and activist citizens who are widely known.  Under such conditions, the success of a party will depend upon  many factors. As we have noted, factors such as the capacity of  the party command to act in complete unity, the resourcefulness  of party leaders, finances, access to the mass media, above all  the television channels, the ability to select good candidates  for parliament, a good election platform, the power to influence  in all regions, proper determination of the real point of view  of the president and the psychological state of the electorate,  and, based upon this, the ability of party propaganda to strike  the right note play a very great role.    At present it is difficult to foresee what parties will gain  seats in the new parliament. A great deal is connected with the  conditions under which the elections will take place, what kind  of election laws there will be, and how the law is observed. In  this connection, it is altogether possible that the elections  will be carried out ahead of schedule in connection with certain  tactical circumstances. One thing is very clear: if the  elections are carried out according to a proportional  [representation] system, the paucity of parties will find its  clear expression. Under such conditions, it would be no surprise  if 10 percent of the body of deputies were to be comprised of  representatives of newly rich. This is because they are making  every intentional preparation for the impending elections. (We  are not taking into account here those who will end up somewhere  after the elections.) Close to 10 percent of the deputies may be  comprised of strugglers to protect local interests, and five  percent may be comprised of independents and of representatives  of small parties. All of these categories will account for about  one-fourth of all the deputies. The remaining three-fourths,  more or less, will be divided among the four great parties.  However, if prior to the elections parliamentary parties appear  which are not included among the four, it is possible that the  division might be between five parties. Without doubt the  Kazakhstan People's Unity Union will receive the largest vote.  However, it is doubtful if it will achieve an absolute majority.  For that reason it will have to seek coalition partners for  itself from the onset. A wing of the Kazakhstan People's  Congress will be in second place, more or less, in terms of  numbers of deputies. (If this is so, under conditions whereby  the Kazakhstan People's Unity Union and the Kazakhstan People's  Congress maintain their alliance, they will have an absolute  majority). However, the Socialists, and the "Azat" people (under  conditions whereby they continue to unify their efforts) will be  in third and fourth place. It is possible that after the new  elections a certain portion of the deputies will look to various  interests. That is to say, they will be for a time members of a  given party, but at the same time it is possible that they will  defend regional interests or that they will develop an interest  in some industry or even in the wealth of financial capital and  will go over to these causes. (However, if the majority system  for the elections undergoes considerable change in time, and the  small parties are not able to send their representatives to  parliament, then it may happen that the body of deputies will be  comprised of only the four large parties). Thus, when the new  parliament takes office, it is clear that many factions will be  represented there. New relationships based upon principle will  be established among them, and the power of such factions will  depend not only upon the number of deputies elected supporting  them, but, at the same time, upon the prestige and skill of the  individual deputies.    Whether or not the task of the new parliament will be to  form  a Cabinet of Ministers capable of bringing our nation our of  anarchy and the confusion of rampant crisis, only time will tell.    From the Editor    We are in a new era for the development of social thought  and  views in the Republic. The task assigned in this era to  political parties and movements, to other social organizations  and associations striving to be involved intimately in social  life and livelihood, is a heavy one. It is clear in particular  that the weight of the these tasks is becoming considerably  heavier in the present time of "a narrow road and a slippery  street," when the Kazakhstan state is wracking its brain looking  for a way out of the pressing difficulties of a complex time and  of the quagmire of economic crisis.    It is the duty of us all to shape the school constituted by  a  free, highly sophisticated political parliament which will  operate on a new kind of parliamentary model. It will be the  political parliament of a free Kazakhstan, which has raised the  flag of independence, gained membership in the United Nations  Organization, ratified a constitution, and joined the ranks of  civilized nations. The methods which we have hitherto expressed,  the very great test of our established form of government will  produce an outcome in half a year at the time of the elections  to the Supreme Kenges of the Republic of Kazakhstan. In whose  hands will the reins of political leadership be in the new,  specialized parliament? Also, what political parties will carry  the burden of the trust of the people and its heritage, and how  and in what ways will they be raised to the level of an honored  foundation for tomorrow. Who will pay tomorrow's debts? And how  will they be paid? The citizens of Kazakhstan, raised to a new  level of social development, cannot remain apart from questions  concerning the fate of such a nation. This is because the fate  of our sovereign people is in the balance. In this circumstance,  we think that the pledge which the people will give to the  political parties, and the tasks of the times begin with today.    It is to be expected that this article offered to readers  could have said too much in some places and too little in  others. It is not easy to share the latest views on a rich  political arena of such broad scope. Large and small events in  the backs and forths of our history and the various difficult  times which we have suffered show that these views are right.  The editors have no intention of supporting any party or any  known stalwart. Likewise, it has no intention of offending any  party or stalwart. Our greatest goal, growing out of the  interests of the people, is to touch briefly on the inner  preparation and potentialities of the political forces  exhausting us all on the eve of a projecting "national event."</p>

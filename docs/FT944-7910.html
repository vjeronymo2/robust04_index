			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Institutions hold back as Wall Street falters - Market Report There were no real surprises around the City of London's trading rooms at the lacklustre performance by UK equities at the start of a week which traditionally sees US interest down to a minimum ahead of the annual Thanksgiving Day holiday, scheduled for Thursday. And the big institutions were said to be remaining on the sidelines, trying to assess the mood of the stock market ahead of the Budget, due a week from today. At the close of a very quiet trading session the FT-SE 100 Index was 10.0 lower at 3,121.0. The second-liners were equally becalmed, with the FT-SE Mid 250 Index settling 6.1 off at 3,569.5. The gilt-edged sector did its best to bolster the equity market, but early firmness in longer dated issues was quietly eroded in a similarly subdued session and failed to provide much support for share prices. Dealers refused to adopt a bearish attitude to the market, however. 'Today was not too discouraging,' said one leading trader. 'We have gone easier on very small volume and the selling pressure has been minimal. The undertone remains solid and there are no scare stories about the Budget doing the rounds.' Some traders expressed surprise at London's refusal to respond to a firm opening on Wall Street and a good performance by European stock and bond markets throughout the session. And a better showing by the US currency should have bolstered the big dollar earners. Share prices were always struggling, with marketmakers, conscious of Wall Street's rather fragile performance last Friday, unwilling to run bull positions at the start of the week. Early deals were mostly on the sell side and the FT-SE 100 fell away to the day's low point, down 14.3 at 3,116.7, within an hour of the opening. There was some unease in the market with news that the UK's non-EU trade deficit came in slightly worse than expected, but analysts said the news played little part in the day's performance. Activity was down to a trickle over the lunchtime period, and gradually picked up in the early afternoon. It was partly stimulated by the higher opening on Wall Street but later petered out as the US market began to falter. Turnover, which has improved strongly over the past couple of weeks, proved a major disappointment yesterday, reaching a dismal 487.4m shares. The lack of institutional interest was plainly evident as non-Footsie stocks accounted for 67 per cent of the day's total. Dealers are hoping that trading picks up as the week wears on; the value of customer business in the market last Friday was Pounds 1.28bn, continuing the recent run of strong institutional activity. 'It was a typical Monday in the market,' said the head of marketmaking at one of London's leading securities houses. 'Low volume, despite good performances from gilts, bunds and bonds.' He added that London needed Wall Street to hold last night. The drugs sector provided the FT-SE 100 with its best performers. Glaxo and Wellcome sped ahead following the Glasgow Aids conference at which it was disclosed that a cocktail of Glaxo's 3TC compound and Wellcome's AZT drug produced the best results in clinical trials. Allied Domecq, on the other hand, suffered from yet more downgrades in front of Thursday's interim figures. Hanson moved ahead as a big line of stock overhanging the market was cleared. Oil shares gave ground early in the day, but made good progress towards the close as it became clear that the market expects the Opec meeting in Bali to agreee a rollover of the current 24.5m barrels a day output ceiling for 12 months. Crude oil prices were up around 40 cents yesterday, and above the important Dollars 17 a barrel level.</p>

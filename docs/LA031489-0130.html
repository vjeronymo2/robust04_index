			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NBC ORDERED TO TURN OVER JACKSON TAPE  </P> <P> A judge Monday ordered NBC to allow the copying of an uncensored videotape in  which Long Beach Police Officer Mark Dickey is seen allegedly pushing the head  of police activist Don Jackson through a plate-glass window.  </P> <P> The Long Beach city prosecutor's office had requested the tape as it prepares  for Jackson's trial on a misdemeanor charge of interfering with a police  officer and resisting arrest. It is scheduled to begin Wednesday.  </P> <P> The tape would be the same version of the Jan. 14 incident, shot both from a  hidden camera inside Jackson's car and from an NBC van. The entire tape has  aired locally and portions have been seen on national television.  </P> <P> However, Long Beach Municipal Court Judge Gary Hahn ordered that the network  make available a version complete with obscenities that Dickey shouted to  Jackson and without a voice-over description of events by a news commentator.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> * Roots: For the first time since his family fled the Nazis in 1933, Sen. Rudy  Boschwitz (D-Minn.) will return to Germany next spring to look for his East  Berlin birthplace. Boschwitz, who was 2 years old when his Jewish family left  Germany, knows the address of his home but doesn't remember the structure.  "When he was sitting watching television pictures from Berlin and East Germany  . . . he felt the real urge to go back" for the first time, said press aide Tim  Droogsma.  </P> <P> * Party time: Kendall Truitt, a gunner's mate involved in the Navy  investigation of the deadly turret explosion aboard the USS Iowa this year, and  his wife, Carol, were to be in New York today for Penthouse magazine's party  for its Pet of the Year, Stephanie Page. Truitt gave Penthouse an exclusive  interview about the disaster and his friend Clayton Hartwig, who was killed in  the blast. The Navy blames Hartwig for the disaster. Another guest will be Paul  Janszen, who blew the whistle on Pete Rose's gambling.  </P> <P> * Critical: Dith Pran, the journalist whose suffering in his native Cambodia  was portrayed in the movie "The Killing Fields," says the United States is  condoning a group "worse than Hitler" -- the Khmer Rouge. Americans should not  believe they will change if returned to power in Cambodia, he told college  students in Galloway Township, N.J., adding, "The Khmer Rouge (were) worse than  Hitler because they kill their own people and they destroy their own culture."  </P> <P> * Honored: James K. Batten, chairman of Knight-Ridder Inc., has won the William  Allen White Foundation Award for Journalistic Merit. The award is given  annually to the journalist who most closely mirrors White in "service to  profession and country." Batten, 53, directs an international news operation  that publishes 29 daily newspapers.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] This week's meeting of Asia Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) finance ministers will not be a forum for  negotiating trade and services liberalisation, Finance Minister  Tharin Nimmanhemin said yesterday.    Speaking before his departure for the talks in Honolulu, Mr  Tharin described the meeting as "no big deal" for Thailand. The  discussions will only cover general assessments of the economic  climate, he said.    US Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who will host the  talks,  has said they will be informal and that the Americans would  remain flexible on the agenda.    Negotiations on opening financial markets will be left for  the concluding ministerial meeting of the Uruguay Round of world  trade talks in Marrakesh, Morroco next month, said Mr Tharin.    There will be no talks on trading, services and double  taxation. The discussions will cover situations of the world  economy such as economic growth, capital flow and development of  capital markets in the APEC countries, said Mr Tharin.    He added that officials from the Ministry of Finance had  been  assigned to present a study on the effects of capital flows in  the country's development.    Bank of Thailand and Stock Exchange Commission officials  will  attend the meeting to provide additional information. The APEC  discussions will take only one day, commented Mr Tharin.    Mr Tharin said ASEAN Finance Ministers will arrange a  meeting  among themselves prior to presenting their positions and data  one day before the full meeting takes place.    Thailand is the host for this meeting. This does not mean,  he added, that Thailand will present itself as the core for the  ASEAN countries in the APEC meeting.    Regarding the recent trade conflict between the US and  Japan.  Mr Tharin said the conflict did not directly involve APEC  members.    He believes the US will not involve APEC member countries in  its dispute with Japan. Their effort to enforce the Japanese to  open their markets will not affect Thai products in the US  market as Thailand has already adopted free trade policies.    Therefore, the US has no reason to pressure Thailand to open  its market for US products, commented Mr Tharin.    "Thailand has opened its markets for US products such as  software and computer chips. Thus, I believe the US will have  sufficient reason not to enlarge the trade war. Also US  officials have assured the participants that this matter will be  precluded from discussion," said Mr Tharin.</p>

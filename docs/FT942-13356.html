			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Kravchuk election doubt:  European News Digest President Leonid Kravchuk will not run for re-election unless elections are postponed and a law is adopted clarifying the division of parliamentary and presidential powers, a top Kravchuk aide said yesterday. 'Kravchuk has not and will not submit his candidature for re-election unless the constitutional mess in Ukraine is sorted out,' said Mr Yaroslav Mendus, the president's deputy adviser on internal affairs. 'Without a clear division of parliamentary and presidential powers, we could see a repeat on the streets of Kiev of what happened in Moscow in October,' said Mr Mendus, referring to the bloody clash in the Russian capital when both president and parliament claimed supreme authority. A decision not to run would put in question the nuclear disarmament pact Mr Kravchuk signed in February with the US and Russia. Other likely presidential candidates have stated their opposition to the accord.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 22 KYODO -- Transport Minister Shigeru  Ito criticized the Trade Ministry Tuesday [22 March] for taking  a different approach on the import procedures of automobiles  that are often criticized by other countries as a nontariff  trade barrier.    The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is simply  making "noise" and trying to "lighten its load," Ito said at a  regular press meeting. He was reacting to recent moves by the  Trade Ministry calling for relaxation of automotive import  procedures.    Japan sets detailed and stringent standards on car  mechanisms, especially concerning emissions and safety, and  requires inspection of every unit. Approvals called "type  certificates" are issued for volume imports of individual models.    The Transport Ministry, which is responsible for enforcing  the procedures, assumes the attitude that accusations by Japan's  trade partners that the system constitutes a trade barrier  derive from a lack of information.    As part of an effort to ease such criticism, the ministry  sent officials to Detroit earlier this month to explain their  position and provide information.    The Trade Ministry, however, has criticized the system  itself  as having problems, such as a long time required to get through  the entire import process.</p>

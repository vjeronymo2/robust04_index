			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Post Office watchdog urges speed up on reform THE Post Office Users' National Council, the industry's official watchdog, yesterday accused the government of backtracking over its plans to reform the Post Office. Before the last election the government's Citizen's Charter contained proposals to establish mandatory service standards and introduce more competition by reducing the Post Office's monopoly on letters costing less than Pounds 1. The Queen's Speech in May contained no reference to proposals for the Post Office and Mr Tom Corrigan, Pounc chairman, says in the council's report: 'For the second time in barely six months the possibility of legally-backed reforms had been shelved.' Mr Corrigan argues that there should be no loss of momentum in putting Charter principles for better service into practice. In particular he does not want to see any stepping back from making the achievement of delivery performance standards mandatory. The Department of Trade and Industry yesterday said it remained committed to reforming the Post Office. It added that while it hopes to bring forward legislation in the next Parliament this would depend on whether other issues took priority. Mr Corrigan wants the government to end the uncertainty surrounding its proposals to reduce the letter monopoly and on the creation of a new postal services regulator. The users council is concerned at the closure of 200, mainly rural, Post Offices in the past year and called for better consultation with local people. Mr Corrigan says: 'We recognise there must be commercial realism but that must be balanced with social needs.' The Post Office said the views of local people were always taken into account before an office was closed. The users council also argues that increases in letter delivery prices last September, up 2p for first class to 24p and 1p for second class to 18p, should have been deferred for months because of the Royal Mail's Pounds 266m pre-tax profits for the year to March 29. Prices have been frozen until the end of the year but Mr Corrigan, says it is 'unreasonable' that users had to pay more to finance the 'under-achievement' of Parcelforce, the PO's parcels arm. This made a loss of Pounds 24m, before tax and exceptional items, compared with a Pounds 75m loss in 1990-91.</p>

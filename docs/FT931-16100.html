			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Limited effect from interest rate moves YESTERDAY's interest rate changes had a limited effect on bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT closed before the Bundesbank announced a further repo rate cut of 15 basis points. The later-closing DAX and bond futures markets responded with a slight fall. Turnover rose from DM3.4bn to DM3.9bn. The DAX index fell 13.88 to 1,542.50. A swingeing 1993 earnings downgrade for Daimler-Benz by James Capel caused the motor and aerospace group to drop DM8 to DM536.50. Some analysts said that this downgrade, and the prospect of more to come, had made investors nervous. Furthermore, the market was trading on a 1993 p/e of 17-18, representing a premium to bonds and to foreign equity markets when German corporate prospects indicated a discount. Siemens fell DM8.80 to DM585.20 and, like Daimler, fell further in London in the afternoon. Siemens is due to hold a news conference next Thursday. PARIS fell as the Bundesbank's decision not to lower its leading interest rates prompted dealers to close their long positions. The CAC-40 index fell 15.16 to 1,844.47 in turnover of FFr2.5bn. Eurotunnel went against the trend, adding FFr1.65 or 5.7 per cent to FFr30.55 in the day's heaviest volume of 1.7m shares. Dealers said that Eurotunnel's relatively high yield and its recent fall below FFr30 had attracted attention. There were also hopes that the stock could benefit from some good news this year, when the tunnel should open and an agreement with TML could be announced. AMSTERDAM gained support in late trading from the Dutch central bank's cut in three key interest rates from today. The CBS Tendency index closed 0.2 higher at 97.6. DSM, seeking up to 1,000 redundancies, shed 50 cents to Fl 75.60 while Akzo slipped 70 cents to Fl 138.70 on the prospect of lower 1993 first-half earnings. CSM, the food manufacturer, was up Fl 1.80 or 1.7 per cent at Fl 106.40 on a rise in the 1992 dividend to Fl 2.45 from Fl 2.25 and a two-for-one share split. MILAN was initially driven higher by Fiat, which jumped on the publication of a favourable press report; it lost momentum in midsession, and was pushed up at the end by Generali. The Comit index rose 1.73 to 455.45 in turnover estimated at L230bn after Tuesday's L199bn. The market was closed on Wednesday. Fiat added L200 or 4.8 per cent to L4,330 on a report in the financial daily, Il Sole 24 Ore, that both Fiat's car division and its overall industrial activities showed an operating profit in 1992. The report came as a surprise to some analysts. Ifi rose L491 or 5.8 per cent to L8,990. Generali gave the market a late boost by shooting up to L30,100 in late trading, after having been fixed L315 higher at L29,720. SME gained L95 to L5,845 as Iri shareholders approved plans for splitting up the food group and selling off parts. ZURICH dropped by more than 2 per cent, the SMI index closing 45.1 lower at 2,079.4 on what London dealers described as 'long overdue' profit-taking. Pharmaceuticals fell first after falls in their US counterparts overnight, Ciba-Geigy losing SFr19 to SFr650. The financial sector, already destabilised by the CS Holding bid for Swiss Volksbank, followed on disappointment with the Bundesbank's interest rate decision, and on the realisation that a half-point discount rate cut by the Swiss National Bank merely brought long term rates into line with shorts. CS Holding and SBC dropped by SFr45 to SFr1,935 and by SFr8 to SFr318 respectively, while Zurich Insurance ended SFr80 lower at SFr2,010. MADRID saw Cubiertas fall Pta340 or 8.4 per cent to Pta3,695 after the UK construction group, Lilley, in which it has a 21 per cent stake, was put into receivership. The general index lost 0.41 to 220.12. STOCKHOLM turned lower after the steady gains earlier in the week. The Affarsvarlden general index fell 7.5 to 944.0 in heavy turnover of SKr1.01bn after SKr494m on Tuesday. Trading was dominated by Astra and Ericsson. Astra A fell SKr18 to SKr747 and Ericsson B by SKr10 to SKr186. Volvo bucked the trend, rising SKr2 to SKr375 on renewed speculation that its French partner, Renault, plans to take over the Swedish group. HELSINKI climbed for the third day on the abolition of restrictions on foreign ownership of Finnish shares and reformed capital income taxation. The Hex index rose 34.3, or 3.9 per cent to 921.9, up 11.2 per cent on the week so far. OSLO dipped on profit-taking after Wednesday's cut in key interest rates, the all-share index losing 2.90 to 392.03.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- January 7                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open        10.30        11.00        12.00  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1083.90      1084.31      1084.23      1083.95 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1172.97      1174.37      1173.87      1172.38  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00        14.00        15.00        Close  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1083.73      1085.60      1082.76      1081.92 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1171.85      1176.02      1173.45      1171.90  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                          Jan   6   Jan 5     Jan 4    Dec 31    Dec 30  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1091.68   1090.07   1083.42   1083.35   1084.02 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1179.18   1180.16   1174.71   1169.11   1166.76  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1086.09; 200 - 1179.04 Low/day: 100 - 1081.87  200 - 1170.54.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Demirel presidency leaves vacuum MR Suleyman Demirel yesterday won election as Turkey's ninth president, after failing to get the two-thirds majority he needed in the first two rounds of voting last week. His election, however, pitches the country into political uncertainty during the selection of his successor in the post of prime minister. Mr Demirel, 68, was formally sworn in last night for a seven-year term. He won 244 votes, a straight majority, in the third ballot of the 450-member Grand National Assembly. Deputy prime minister Erdal Inonu takes over as caretaker premier while Mr Demirel's True Path party (DYP) decides on a successor. Mr Demirel leaves a coalition government without strong leadership during a difficult period. Economic reforms are stalled, the government is at a watershed in the Kurdish rebellion, and the country is over-extended on several foreign policy fronts from the Balkans to the Caucasus and north Iraq. Moreover, the search for a new leader could put considerable strain on the coalition between the DYP and Mr Inonu's junior partner Social Democratic Populists (SHP), whose cohabitation has become difficult. With a special DYP leadership congress due within 45 days, four names have emerged: house speaker Husamettin Cindoruk, economics minister Mrs Tansu Ciller, interior minister Mr Ismet Sezgin and state minister Mr Cavit Caglar, widely seen as Mr Demirel's own choice. The choice of party leader and therefore premier will determine the extent to which Mr Demirel continues to influence policy. Under the 1982 constitution, the presidency is a largely ceremonial position. Mr Demirel attacked the late president Turgut Ozal for using his office for partisan purposes. Mr Demirel is adamant he will be a 'constitutional' president. But all the candidates except Mr Cindoruk won their political spurs through Mr Demirel's patronage. For this reason alone, Mr Demirel is expected to exert considerable influence over policy. His accession marks the pinnacle of a career spanning 30 years in which he has been prime minister seven times, twice ousted by the military. It required a national referendum - passed by the narrowest of majorities - for him to be allowed to return to active politics after the last coup in 1980. Eye of a storm, Page 12</p>

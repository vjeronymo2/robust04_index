			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Japanese urged to open markets BRITAIN yesterday called on Japan to hasten moves to allow more foreign competition in its financial markets, the most difficult to penetrate among the world's leading economies, according to a British official. A team of officials from the UK, led by Sir Nigel Wicks, the second permanent secretary at the Treasury in charge of international affairs, concentrated on persuading the Japanese to open the insurance, pension fund management and government bond markets particularly. Sir Nigel praised the progress made in the last year to deregulate interest rates and the authorities' commitment to continue with liberalisation in the face of the severe downturn in the financial sector. However, he added: 'It is surprising when we see the sophistication of the economy, the strength and size of the financial houses in both banking and securities that they take such a long time to liberalise. 'Of all the G7 economies, no financial market is so difficult for foreign finance houses to penetrate as Japan's,' Sir Nigel said. There were encouraging signs that the Japanese government was planning gradually to open up the insurance market to competition. But Sir Nigel said his Japanese counterparts had been unable to justify their unwillingness to open further the government bond market and pension fund management. About 60 per cent of Japanese government bonds are auctioned, with the rest sold through a tender system, closed to foreign finance houses. The British team called for all government bonds to be sold by auction.</p>

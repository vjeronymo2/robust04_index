			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By UKRINFORM correspondent Viktor Chamara for TASS] </F>   [Text] Kiev April 11 TASS -- The results of the elections  in Ukraine, whose second round was held in 350 constituencies  last Sunday, remain to be specified. It is already clear,  however, that the elections did take place, and as a result of  them a new Ukrainian parliament was elected. It will replace  the previous one contrary to the opinion of many politicians and  sociologists, who forecast the apathy of the electorate and,  consequently, the failure of elections.    On Sunday the elections were recognised as valid in 324  constituencies. According to preliminary information, which was  available on April 11 in the morning, 222 legislators, elected  during the second round, will be added to 90, elected during the  first one. Many of the newly elected deputies were members of  the previous parliament; specifically, its speaker Ivan  Plyushch, chairman of the Ukrainian Socialist Party Aleksandr  Moroz, ex-prime minister Leonid Kuchma, chairman of Ukrainian  RUKH Vyacheslav Chornovil, ex-vice speaker Vladimir Grinev,  acting prime minister Yefim Zvyagilskiy, first deputy chairman  of the Supreme Soviet Vasiliy Durdinets and ex-prime minister  Vitaliy Masol. The majority, however, are newcomers.    The results of the elections and the make-up of the new  parliament are sure to be analysed by specialists. It is  obvious, however, that it will have a large group of  professional economists and lawyers, who can quickly analyse  complex situations and find optimal solutions.</p>

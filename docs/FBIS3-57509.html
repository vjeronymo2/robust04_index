"The main section of the book deals with the president's  comprehension of the 1991 events when Yeltsin assumed office.  The author sets out his point of view on the political  processes evolving in Russia since then, and shares with future  readers his keen feeling for the country's future", Ilyushin  said.    The book which has about 500 pages has no working title yet.  "No one has read the book so far," Ilyushin said, adding that he  does not know who helped the president prepare the manuscript  for publication.    Asked whether people in Russia will be able to read the  president's reminiscences, the aide answered in the affirmative.</p>

			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Israel to free most Palestinian prisoners ISRAEL'S foreign minister Mr Shimon Peres said yesterday he expected most of the 11,000 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons would be released, agencies report. PLO officials have said their release would help build Palestinian support for the peace accord. Most of the prisoners are accused of taking part in the six-year uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 'I think the large majority (of prisoners) will be released since circumstances have changed, the reasons for their detention and arrest have vanished or changed. Our position also needs a change,' Mr Peres said on army radio. The intention to release prisoners was confirmed by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. He told Israel radio: 'We certainly will come to the freeing of prisoners. Not just one here and there, but big numbers.' The next round of Middle East peace talks has been delayed after Syria threatened to stay away, an Israeli official said yesterday. Syria, which reacted coolly to last month's Israel-PLO peace deal, has complained the Palestinians are not co-ordinating moves with Arab states and Israel is preoccupied with the Palestinian issue.</p>

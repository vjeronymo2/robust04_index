			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Finance and The Family (The Election and You): The challenge to buy-backs - David Ross on some of the pitfalls involved with BES schemes WITH THE approach of the new tax year, not to mention the general election, BES schemes are being aggressively marketed by many sponsors. 'Buy-back' schemes are the most popular but they are under challenge from companies which plan to invest in residential property acquired from distressed sellers, company receivers or lenders who have repossessed houses. The financial press has rightly warned of the risks this strategy involves, but to investors the presence of such risks implies the possibility of attractive returns. Some potential pitfalls are obvious - for example the uncertain outlook for the property market, and the fact that such properties must by law be let out on the basis of assured tenancies, thus providing security of tenure to the occupier. There has been little comment on an area of great uncertainty, and possibly of greatest risk to the potential investor - the possible conflict of interest between investors and the managers of the company. Such conflicts may not be uncommon. Most investors will want to liquidate their holdings within five or six years, hopefully securing a useful return on their money in the process. But this might not suit the managers, whose objective may be less clear cut. They might want to use the BES as a source of capital for a company which they envisage continuing for many years. If so, then the first question for the investor to ask is how he gets his money back. If it is proposed that this should be achieved by a sale or flotation of the company, then he should be aware that this is only likely to be achieved at a substantial discount to the value of the underlying assets. Many quoted residential property companies are priced at discounts of around 50 per cent to the estimated value of the assets. That disincentive is hefty enough, but in fact it understates the problem, because the asset value is itself below the value at which the underlying properties could be sold if vacant possession could be obtained. This discrepancy between valuation and achievable cash proceeds, makes it desirable that the remuneration of the management should be linked to the cash eventually returned to the investors, and not to a professional estimate of the value of underlying properties. The ideal solution would be to let the properties to tenants who could be expected to quit before the date when investors want to liquidate their assets. In that case the properties could be sold with vacant possession - in other words, at the best available market price. Failing that, the return to the investor will suffer from the discount that prospective purchasers will demand on negotiating for a property with a sitting tenant. Once tenants realise that the management company has an interest in their vacating the property at a particular date, they may seek compensation for doing so. In that case, the full vacant possession price will not be achieved, and the investor's return will again be eroded, though not by so much as would be the case if the tenant remained in situ. Even if the remuneration of managers were treated in the way proposed, there are still potential problems. Most schemes define this remuneration in terms of the return achieved in excess of a predetermined target. If this target looks unlikely to be met, then there is an obvious disincentive to the managers. There are then three main choices: the managers may continue to manage in a lacklustre fashion, concentrating their efforts on better opportunities elsewhere; they may simply resign; or they may seek to renegotiate the terms of their contract. None of these alternatives is likely to work to the investor's advantage, and the third is likely to erode their eventual return, either directly or indirectly. Even if none of these dangers materialise, a further conflict of interest may arise if the managers offer to buy out the investors: in such circumstances they may not be best motivated to find attractive offers for the assets from possible alternative buyers] One way to avoid, or at least minimise, the impact of such conflicts would be the appointment of strong-minded and independent directors charged with protecting the interest of investors. Regrettably, only a small minority of companies has adopted this approach. Ultimately, the major safeguard is the desire of sponsor companies to retain an unsullied reputation among investors and investment professionals. Some sponsors, controlled by larger insurance companies or investment advisers, may have a stronger incentive in this direction than others. Many such organisations have concentrated their attention on 'buy-back' schemes, which are safer and less controversial. This is unfortunate, because of the depressed state of the housing market.</p>

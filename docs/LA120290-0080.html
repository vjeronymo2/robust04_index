			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN, NOT REFUGEE  </P> <P> I take exception to the headline on Kenneth Turan's article, "Where America  Came From -- A Newly Restored Ellis Island Reminds Visitors That We Are All  Refugees," Nov. 18.  </P> <P> America didn't "come from" Ellis Island. It was already discovered, founded,  created and built by the time of Eastern and Southern European immigration.  Colonists are not refugees, but allowed the later "refugees" to come to our  nation as cheap, docile labor for the industrial giants of the times. I am not  a refugee, but an American. This is my land that my forebears helped build.  </P> <P> JOHN L. RITTER  </P> <P> Redondo Beach  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Xhemail Rexhepi: "Autonomy Legalizes the </F> Slavery of the Albanians"]    [Text] The Albanian political scene, especially in Kosova,  has been very lively recently. The recent visits of Dr. Ibrahim  Rugova, president of the republic of Kosova, to Britain, France,  and Italy, with their successful talks with high-level  government officials of these countries, and especially his  subsequent talk with U.S. President Bill Clinton, have  contributed to this. It is worth mentioning here the first  steps toward solving the question of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the  Croat-Serb conflict in Croatia, as well as the forecasts by  various international mediators that the problem of Kosova will  soon be put on the agenda within the framework of solving the  crisis in the former Yugoslavia.  <H5>  We Will Not Be Forgiven Recklessness </H5>   Besides the schedule forecast for solving the crisis in the  area of the former Yugoslavia, there have also been statements  by various diplomats that the problem of Kosova "must be solved  by extensive political autonomy," or that "The autonomy of 1974  must be restored," and that "Serbia's jurisdiction over Kosova  is not contested." There have also been statements by different  parliamentarians, congressmen, senators, and publicists, who  emphasize that "The crisis in the former Yugoslavia cannot be  solved if the independent status of Kosova is not accepted.  Only an independent and sovereign Kosova is a guarantee of  peace and security in this area and even in the entire region."    Nevertheless, the first kinds of statement rather than the  second make a greater impression in the media darkness of  Kosova, in those two or three weeklies and the single daily that  are rarely sure of appearing on their appointed days. This is  understandable, if for no other reason than the fact that we are  sensitive to being offered solutions to the Kosova problem with  a "sort of autonomy," when it is well known that the population  of Kosova long ago clearly declared their political will for an  independent and sovereign Kosova.    However, what does not seem reasonable to us are the  contrived explanations of the different kinds of autonomy and  the many speculations over whether Serbia will be ready to agree  to them or not. It seems that they prompted the leader of one  recently formed party to announce that "Any solution that averts  a conflict must be accepted!" When we consider all these  extrapolations devised in cafe corners and especially in the  commentaries of the Belgrade press, we realize that these  matters call for great care, especially on the part of those who  speak on behalf of the parties they belong to, but also those  who in one way or another appear on the political stage and  create public opinion in Kosova and beyond.    In the final analysis, now is least of all a time to forgive  mistakes and political recklessness. We must also learn from  our turbulent, splendid, and tragic history, when we lost the  fruits of liberation struggles on the negotiating tables in  London or Paris, and especially in Belgrade and at Brioni.  <H5>  Autonomy Is Not a Solution </H5>   It follows that it is not out of place, whenever recipes for  a Kosova solution involving some kind of autonomy are offered,  to demonstrate with facts and evidence to those responsible for  such recipes that the problem of Kosova and its Albanians cannot  be solved in this way. On the contrary, such a status merely  legalizes their further slavery.    The Albanians in Kosova have now tried every kind of  autonomy, in the time of the Ottoman Empire, and under  Yugoslavia and Serbia. It is enough to mention the four kinds  of autonomy that Kosova and the Albanians have experienced as  part of Serbia and Yugoslavia in the last 50 years. As is well  known, the autonomy of 1945, which was produced to suit the  police and military regime of the Serbian and Yugoslav UdBA  [State Security Administration], turned Kosova into a large  concentration camp for the majority of Albanians, who for four  years on end had fought alongside the allies against fascism,  with the aim of exercising the right to self-determination and  deciding their own destiny.    However, the right of self-determination was not achieved,  and the Serbian regime shot thousands of Albanians as  "counterrevolutionaries, Balists, and anti-Yugoslavs," and  maltreated, imprisoned, and interned hundreds and thousands of  others in all the Yugoslav prisons. They were accused of being  kulaks for failing to hand in their grain and meat surpluses  (when their children were dying of hunger), for not paying the  state levy ("zajm") [Serbo-Croatian word used], or for not  unveiling their women, while the acme of violence was reached in  the infamous weapons-collection campaign. The archives of the  Yugoslav UdBA itself, as published after the Brioni plenum  [1966], reveal that during this campaign alone more than 30,000  Albanians in Kosovo were beaten and bestially maltreated, almost  100 were murdered, and hundreds and thousands of others were  turned into life-long invalids.    Thus, in the first phase of autonomy, Kosova and the  Albanians were allotted the status of slaves, which directly  paved the way for their forced emigration to the steppes of  Anatolia. The second phase of Kosova's autonomy did not prevent  this unprecedented exodus. On the contrary, all possible means  of state violence encouraged it, until about 250,000 Albanians  from Kosova had emigrated to Turkey by 1966. At this time, as  is well known, the Rankovic [interior minister in the 1950s and  1960s] line lost the battle for power and domination in the  hierarchy of the Yugoslav rulers. The Titoite line claimed to  be against the "strong hand" of Yugoslav unitarism and embarked  on a kind of reform and decentralization of power.    In the course of this reform, Kosova and Vojvodina won a new  status of political autonomy, being accepted as constitutive  elements and federal units, albeit within the composition of  Serbia. This was the autonomy of 1974, under which Kosova and  the Albanians indeed achieved important turning points in their  educational, cultural, and economic development. However, even  with this constitution, the Albanians did not achieve their  historic goal of the right to self-determination, or even  equality with the other peoples in the Yugoslav federation,  although they were numerically the third-largest people in the  former Yugoslavia. The fact that Serbia suspended this very  same constitution while the federal Yugoslav state was still  operating and did so without any opposition from the other  federal units best shows what kind of basis it was for "the  security and equality of Kosova and the Albanians."  <H5>  Half-Baked Solutions -- Open Conflict </H5>   In fact, it was precisely under the 1974 Constitution that  the Albanians' disgust and discontent expressed in the spring of  1981 were branded as counterrevolutionary, with the most serious  labels and epithets being attached to the Albanians. By 1987,  the police had maltreated about 650,000 Albanians or one  Albanian in three in Kosova, besides imprisoning hundreds and  thousands of others. By 1990, about 150 Albanians, mainly young  people and including even children, had been killed. The  Serbian regime has continued its violence against the Albanians  under the autonomy guaranteed to "Kosovo-Methohija" four years  ago. Under it, 12,000 Albanians have now been dismissed from  their work; all the secondary schools and colleges; and even  some elementary schools have been closed to Albanians; all the  Albanian-language media, including Prishtina Radio-Television  and the sole Albanian-language daily RILINDJA, and all the  cultural and academic institutions have been closed, including  most recently the Kosova Academy of Arts and Sciences and the  Albanological Institute. By the same logic, and on the basis of  the autonomy of "Kosova-Metohija," hundreds and thousands of  Albanians are daily beaten, plundered, and maltreated, and  hundreds are detained in prisons, while the "blessings" of the  last four years have forced 300,000 Albanians to emigrate from  Kosova and to seek their salvation in various European countries.    Because of all this bitter experience with autonomy within  Serbia and Yugoslavia, the possibility that they might remain  under the jurisdiction of Serbia with "some kind of extensive  political autonomy" makes the Albanians' flesh creep. It is  precisely for this reason that all the legitimate institutions  of Kosova and virtually all the Albanian political parties  rightly refuse all bargaining involving such solutions for  Kosova.    In the final analysis, they are also bound by the political  will of the population of Kosova expressed in the referendum of  September 1991 and the multiparty and presidential elections of  May 1992. The Albanians' restrained behavior so far and their  declaration that the question of Kosova must be solved in a  democratic way, through dialogue and peaceful means, are also  strong arguments for the Albanian side not to accept any  half-baked solutions, but only the settlement that the political  will of the people demands -- a sovereign and independent  Kosova. Any other solution leaves open the door for a conflict  even greater than that seen so far, something the Albanians have  never wanted.</p>

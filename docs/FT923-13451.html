			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Making a move London Zoo, which is faced with closure, might be the final destination for the British pavilion at Seville's Expo 92 (pictured above). This is the latest scheme for bringing the highly admired structure back to the UK when the world fair closes in Spain in the autumn. Professor Paul Cook, president of the British Science and Technology Trust, said yesterday that he was working with UK companies to raise the Pounds 20m needed to reconstruct the steel and glass pavilion in Regent's Park as a showcase for British companies' developments in environmental technology. The pavilion - which was designed by Nicholas Grimshaw &amp; Partners - features a wall of water developed by the sculptor William Tye. Lord Palumbo, the chairman of the Arts Council, has already proposed that it should be rebuilt beside the Design Museum near London's Tower Bridge as a gallery of British design.</p>

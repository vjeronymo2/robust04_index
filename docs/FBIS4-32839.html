			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Noel Irias] </F>   [Text] Fernando Cardenal, a member of the Sandinist  Assembly, said yesterday that "imposing an editorial line on  BARRICADA would be a serious setback to the FSLN [Sandinist  National Liberation Front] and the country's democratization  process."    Cardenal said the newspaper's editorial line offered broad  opportunities for debate among Sandinists before the Congress,  and "everyone who wanted to express his views was able to do so."    "BARRICADA reported the debate in a serious, broad, and  ethical way. Its work was serious and responsible," Cardenal  stressed.    According to former Education Minister Cardenal, divisions  result when there is no opportunity for debate. "As long as  there is debate, there is less of a chance of divisions," he  commented.    "I think BARRICADA gained prestige because of its  credibility. Ambassadors and foreign personalities have told me  that BARRICADA is the most serious, responsible, and trustworthy  newspaper in the country.    Cardenal, who stressed that he was speaking as a Sandinist,  not as a member of any group or tendency, noted that no group  should fall to the temptation to impose its authority on other  members.    "Authority is not imposed by force. Ideas are imposed by the  force of their truth and conviction," he said.    Jose Gonzalez, FSLN political secretary in Matagalpa and  member of the Sandinist Assembly, stressed that the mandate  received at the FSLN Congress was unity and that his party  cannot "afford to change cadres with great experience as if they  could be discarded."    "In the case of BARRICADA, it is not a matter of going back  and making it what it used to be during the revolutionary  government, when it was an appendage of the DAP [Agitation and  Propaganda Department], DOR [Department of Organization and  Masses], and DEP [Department for Propaganda and Political  Education]. Anyone who thinks that way is mistaken. We must  open more opportunities for all sectors so they can express  their views," Gonzalez said.    He added: "We know that newspapers must compete for readers  and publicity. A media that speaks only for the FSLN is not  feasible. BARRICADA must express the people's feelings. It  should be objective and maintain a balance. It should reflect  the criteria of workers, the private sector, the government, and  grass roots organizations."    On possible changes in BARRICADA's editorial line, Gonzalez  said it should be discussed at the Sandinist Assembly but that  the discussion should be frank, sincere, and two-way.  <H5>  Seeking Balance </H5>   Deputy Natan Sevilla said that BARRICADA, as a newspaper  organically linked to the FSLN, "should transcend the daily  pulse of debates, where there are occasional attacks from one  side or the other."    "If one of the FSLN's objectives is preparing for the 1996  elections, BARRICADA can contribute significantly toward placing  the Sandinist overall political interests in the forefront and  leave less opportunity for quarrels," he said.    "That is why some people criticize BARRICADA, saying that it  favors one side over the other. We must balance opinions,"  Sevilla said.</p>

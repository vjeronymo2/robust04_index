			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / World Bond Markets: New York There will be an element of nervousness in the bond market tomorrow, as the Federal Open Market Committee meets to discuss policy. Although further tightening is on the cards, few expect the Fed to move only a month after its last unexpectedly sharp increase. But as pessimists point out, there is still no indication of final demand in the economy slowing down. Therefore, the longer the Fed leaves it, the more likely it is that the next rise will be another big one. The main economic news this week starts tomorrow with the release of October's trade figures. Wednesday brings the first projections from corporations of their capital expenditure next year, along with actual spending in this year's third quarter. On Thursday comes the final figure for third-quarter GDP growth (presumed to remain close to the preliminary figure of 3.9 per cent) and the implicit price deflator, which should be close to 2 per cent. Friday brings November durable goods orders and personal income and expenditure. While consumer spending is of vital importance, the November figures scarcely matter. In the week before Christmas, what matters is what shoppers are doing. The media say the news for the bond market is not encouraging: US shoppers are out in force and spending hard.</p>

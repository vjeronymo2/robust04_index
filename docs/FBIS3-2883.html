Comrade Deng  Xiaoping is also an Eighth NPC deputy. Is he very concerned  with the session?    [Xiao Rong] He is an Eighth NPC deputy. Because of age, he  did not come to attend the meeting.

He reads newspapers every day about the  meeting.    [Reporter] How is Comrade Deng Xiaoping's health?    [Xiao Rong, smiling] He is very healthy [ta xianzai shenti  hen hao].

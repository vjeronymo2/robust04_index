			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Observer: Citizen Mills Dodgy estate agents, Arthur Daleys and funeral directors massacring their industry code of practice had better watch their step. John Mills, the new director of consumer affairs at the Office of Fair Trading, will be down on them with all the authority of one with three years in the prime minister's Policy Unit under his belt. The consumer world appeared bemused at yesterday's appointment. 'Who he?', the chorus echoed, disappointed that the job should have gone to a civil servant rather than a high-profile consumer advocate. A career civil servant, Mills has spent most of his life at the Department of Trade and Industry. It was during his stint in the telecom- munications and posts division between 1985 and 1989 that he almost certainly came to the attention of Sir Bryan Carsberg, the UK's telecoms regulator who is about to become director general of Fair Trading. Still, Mills can already claim some credit for assisting the consumer of public services. He was Downing Street's man at the Adam Smith Institute seminar in February 1991 which launched the PM's big idea, the Citizen's Charter.</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Dividends The Foreign Income Dividend scheme promised in the last budget has not solved the problem of unrelieved advance corporation tax. As expected, the new class of dividend will not carry the 20 per cent tax credit normally reclaimed by pension funds on conventional dividends. Since the Treasury will not allow different classes of dividend to be targeted at different types of shareholder, companies which pay FIDs will risk the opprobrium of this powerful group. Forcing companies to pay higher dividends to compensate pension funds for the lost tax credit can hardly be what the chancellor had in mind. Companies with intractable ACT problems will doubtless still look hard at paying FIDs. Concessions made on the initial proposals at least make the scheme look workable. Allowing companies to pay FIDs out of prior year profits, for example, will help ensure that potentially volatile overseas profits are available in all years to cover the payment. But alternative methods for reducing ACT such as enhanced scrip dividends - which the chancellor has done nothing to discourage - are likely to remain the preferred option. Many institutional investors will object on principle to another round of enhanced scrips, on the grounds that companies are establishing rolling rights issues in place of cash dividends. Forced to choose between their principles and an effective cut in dividend, though, pension funds will find themselves torn.</p>

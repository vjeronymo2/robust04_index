			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHELL ISN'T CONTENDING RAIDERS IN CONTENTION;  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL: COACH DOWNPLAYS TEAM'S SUCCESS, OTHER THAN TO SAY IT HAS PLAYED  WELL AT 4-1 SINCE HE TOOK OVER.  </P> <P> They're dancing in the hallways at the Raider facility in El Segundo but in the  coach's office, calm prevails.  </P> <P> A contender at last?  </P> <P> "As I've said to you, I don't even want to speak in those terms," Art Shell  said Monday, a day after his team, for the second consecutive week, made a meal  of what was advertised as a quality opponent.  </P> <P> "We're playing good football. We're playing tough football. I don't want to  predict what we will be. All I know is what we're doing and that's playing  competitive football."  </P> <P> Shell kicked off this rally by taking the pressure off his players who were  dragged along into Mike Shanahan's pressure cooker.  </P> <P> Now that Shell is actually up there with the playoff hopefuls, he is  maintaining his posture of trying to deflect everyone's attention from the  bottom line.  </P> <P> On the other hand, the Raiders are contenders, know it and are delighted.  </P> <P> If the season were over, they'd have the first wild-card spot and would play  host to Cincinnati in the wild-card game.  </P> <P> Here's the way the American Conference wild-card candidates go, with their  won-lost and conference records, which would break ties:  </P> <P> Raiders, 5-4, 4-3; Cincinnati, 5-4, 4-3; Miami, 5-4, 4-4; Houston, 5-4, 3-3.  </P> <P> Moreover, the Raiders have a chance to be something the AFC has rarely had  since the last heyday of the silver and black: a dominating team.  </P> <P> Since Shell took over, the Raider defense has allowed an average of 91 yards  rushing a game and 3.5 an attempt. Over a full season, this would make the  Raiders No. 3 in the league in both categories.  </P> <P> The Raiders, meanwhile, have averaged 161.6 yards rushing and a startling 4.99  a carry. Over a season, that would project to Nos. 2 and 1, respectively.  </P> <P> In Shell's tenure, the Raiders have recorded 14 sacks, allowed eight.  </P> <P> Under Shell, the Raiders have taken the ball away 17 times, and given it away  10.  </P> <P> The explosion of the Raider game owes much, of course, to Bo Jackson and his  7.4-yard average, but there's more working here.  </P> <P> Fullback Steve Smith, a fine blocker -- his lead block sprang Jackson on  Sunday's 92-yarder -- and a good receiver, has a 4.1 average, and has had it  all season. He was at 4.4 when Bo began playing.  </P> <P> The young Raider line, with 28-year-old Don Mosebar the only starter over 26,  has come a long way. The new left tackle, Rory Graves, has slowed his string of  holding calls. The new right tackle, Bruce Wilkerson, has been solid.  </P> <P> Against Philadelphia, while helping hold Reggie White to no sacks, Wilkerson  irritated the dreaded Eagle into accusing Wilkerson of holding, which any  offensive lineman would recognize as a compliment.  </P> <P> Here's a higher compliment: rookie right guard Steve Wisniewski has been as  good as the Raiders hoped he would be on draft day.  </P> <P> "I told him this morning, 'You're playing at a level of performance that's just  as good as any guard in this league, whether it's an old guy or a new guy,' "  Shell said.  </P> <P> "All his future's ahead of him. He's going to be an outstanding lineman in this  league. I expect him to play in the Pro Bowl within two years. That's the kind  of player he's capable of being."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Raider Notes  </P> <P> The Steve Beuerlein watch, Week 2: Art Shell says that if Beuerlein's back,  he'll start. Shell says he expects Beuerlein to practice this week, too. . . .  Jerry Robinson didn't dress because of his concussion. Shell: "He was on the  sideline. I told him, 'You're an assistant coach, unofficially.' He asked me:  'Do I get double pay?' I said. 'Not with the money you earn, you don't.' " . .  . Safety Eddie Anderson was held out with his hamstring pull, though Shell says  he could have played, if needed.  </P></p>

The  committee threatens to invest an executive [words indistinct] if  its demands are not taken into account. After 28 months of  murderous crisis, says the committee, the solution is the  streets, asserting that it is possible to have the unfair  punishment inflicted by the international community on the  Haitian people stopped through nonviolence. According to the  committee, it is not good to witness the collapse of our social  and cultural life, of our national economy, and of the actual  and daily sacrifice of many thousands of Haitians. The  committee hopes to mobilize all vital forces of the nation  throughout the nine geographic departments of the country.</p>

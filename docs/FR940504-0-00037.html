			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (7) Marine Radiodetermination Stations (see 47 CFR part 80, Subpart M); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Personal Radio Services (see 47 CFR part 95), except applications filed after July 26, 1993, in the Interactive Video Data Service (see 47 CFR part 95, subpart F); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) Public Safety, Industrial/Land Transportation, General and Business Radio categories above 800 MHz, including finder's preference requests for frequencies not allocated to the SMR service (see 47 CFR 90.173), and including, until further notice of the Commission, the Automated Vehicle Monitoring Service (see 47 CFR 90.239); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) Private Land Mobile Radio Services between 470&hyph;512 MHz (see 47 CFR part 90, subparts B through F) including finder's preference requests, see 47 CFR 90.173; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (11) Private Land Mobile Radio Services below 470 MHz (see 47 CFR part 90, subparts B through F) except in the 220 MHz band (see 47 CFR part 90, subpart T), including finder's preference requests (see 47 CFR 90.173); and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (12) Private Operational Fixed Services (see 47 CFR part 94). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1.2103 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->  Competitive bidding design options. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The Commission will select the competitive bidding design(s) to be used in auctioning particular licenses or classes of licenses on a service-specific basis. The Commission will choose from one or more of the following types of auction designs for services or classes of services subject to competitive bidding: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Single round sealed bid auctions (either sequential or simultaneous); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Sequential oral auctions; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Simultaneous multiple round auctions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The Commission may use combinatorial bidding, which would allow bidders to submit all or nothing bids on combinations of licenses, in addition to bids on individual licenses. The Commission may require that to be declared the high bid, a combinatorial bid must exceed the sum of the individual bids by a specified amount. Combinatorial bidding may be used with any type of auction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The Commission may use single combined auctions, which combine bidding for two or more substitutable licenses and award licenses to the highest bidders until the available licenses are exhausted. This technique may be used in conjunction with any type of auction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1.2104 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->  Competitive bidding mechanisms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sequencing. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission will establish the sequence in which multiple licenses will be auctioned. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Grouping. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the event the Commission uses either a simultaneous multiple round competitive bidding design or combinatorial bidding, the Commission will determine which licenses will be auctioned simultaneously or in combination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reservation price. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission may establish a reservation price, either disclosed or undisclosed, below which a license subject to auction will not be awarded. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Minimum bid increments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission may, by announcement before or during an auction, require minimum bid increments in dollar or percentage terms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Stopping rules. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission may establish stopping rules before or during multiple round auctions in order to terminate the auctions within a reasonable time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Activities rules. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission may establish activity rules which require a minimum amount of bidding activity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Withdrawal, default and disqualification penalties. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As specified below, when the Commission conducts a simultaneous multiple round auction pursuant to &sect;1.2103, the Commission will impose penalties on bidders who withdraw high bids during the course of an auction, or who default on payments due after an auction closes or who are disqualified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Bid withdrawal prior to close of auction. A bidder who withdraws a high bid during the course of an auction will be subject to a penalty equal to the difference between the amount bid and the amount of the winning bid the next time the license is offered by the Commission. No withdrawal penalty would be assessed if the subsequent winning bid exceeds the withdrawn bid. This penalty amount will be deducted from any upfront payments or down payments that the withdrawing bidder has deposited with the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Default or disqualification after close of auction. If a high bidder defaults or is disqualified after the close of such an auction, the defaulting bidder will be subject to the penalty in paragraph (g)(1) of this section plus an additional penalty equal to three (3) percent of the subsequent winning bid. If the subsequent winning bid exceeds the defaulting bidder's bid amount, the 3 percent penalty will be calculated based on the defaulting bidder's bid amount. These amounts will be deducted from any upfront payments or down payments that the defaulting or disqualified bidder has deposited with the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When the Commission conducts single round sealed bid auctions or sequential oral auctions, the Commission may modify the penalties to be paid in the event of bid withdrawal, default or disqualification; provided, however, that such penalties shall not exceed the penalties specified above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bidder identification during auctions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  During any auction, the Commission may identify bidders and the bids only by bid numbers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The Commission may delay, suspend, or cancel an auction in the event of a natural disaster, technical obstacle, evidence of security breach, unlawful bidding activity, administrative necessity, or for any other reason that affects the fair and efficient conduct of the competitive bidding. The Commission also has the authority, at its sole discretion, to resume the competitive bidding starting from the beginning of the current or some previous round or cancel the competitive bidding in its entirety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

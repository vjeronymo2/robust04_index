Dinkins' sale of cable stock to his son and  will not file criminal charges. In a brief statement, prosecutor Andrew  Manloney said the investigation "has been completed without the filing of  criminal charges." Questions centered on whether Dinkins gave 588 shares of  Inner City Broadcasting Corp. stock to his son, David Jr., through a genuine  transaction, how much it was actually worth and whether taxes were fully paid  on the deal.  </P></p>

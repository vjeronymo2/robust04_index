			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Consumers report delay in buying ALMOST 10 per cent of consumers are delaying making significant purchases because of uncertainty about the general election, according to a survey published by Barclaycard yesterday. The proportion of those intending to postpone decisions such as moving house, buying furniture or booking holidays, rises to 12 per cent among people aged 35 to 64. Barclaycard gives no explanation for this reluctance to spend, but it does not appear to be related to Labour's plans to increase taxes on the higher paid. Those in social classes A and B are less likely to delay decisions than other people. The survey finds no sign of a revival in the housing market, with only 4 per cent of those questioned planning to take out a mortgage in the next six months.</p>

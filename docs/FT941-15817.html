			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Technology: Citizen brings simple colour to the home computer market / A look at a new low-cost printer that is easy to use Citizen, the Japanese watch and electronics equipment manufacturer, yesterday announced the first colour computer printer designed to be sold in volume through retail outlets to non-expert users. The recommended UK retail price is Pounds 189, excluding VAT, but the street price is expected to be closer to Pounds 129. Edward Huggins, Citizen Europe's marketing director, says it was impossible to produce an electromechanical printer at lower cost and make a satisfactory profit. The printer, the Citizen ABC, is designed as a simple-to-use first machine for home users. It is based on 24-pin dot matrix technology, offers letter quality fonts and prints text and graphics in colour. Its chief advantage, according to Huggins, is the ease with which it can be connected to a computer and set up for use by computing novices. Even low-cost printers today are targeted chiefly at the business market, and Huggins's words will strike a chord with anyone who has found themselves unscrewing parts of their newly-purchased printer to flip mysterious switches deep within its interior, or wrestling with printer driver software. The ABC printer does away with control panels; instructions for assembling and connecting the equipment are supplied on a floppy disk that accompanies the machine and there are only three control buttons. Citizen says the average first-time user can be up and running within five minutes of opening the box. The machine has been designed for retail sales and Citizen has developed a five-minute demonstration using CD-Rom to do away with the need for dedicated sales staff. The company claims to be the European leader in dot matrix printers offering optional colour. The ABC is part of its strategy to dominate the low-price end of the market. It also aims to extend the life of dot matrix technology, which is fast giving way in business to laser jet and ink jet printing.</p>

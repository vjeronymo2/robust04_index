(``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which items have been prepared by the NYSE. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NYSE proposes to amend its listing standards for equity-linked debt securities (``ELDS'') contained in Paragraph 703.21 of the Exchange's Listed Company Manual (``Manual'') to provide for greater flexibility in the listing of ELDS. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, NYSE, and at the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, the NYSE included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NYSE has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ELDS are intermediate-term, debt securities of an issuer where the value of the debt is based, at least in part, on the value of another issuer's common stock or non-convertible preferred stock. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  The purpose of the proposed rule change is to provide alternative market capitalization and trading volume criteria for the linked security, that is, the security on which the value of the ELDS is based. Specifically, the proposed rule change will add the following alternative standard for securities that can be linked to an ELDS: (1) market capitalization of at least $500 million; and (2) annual U.S. trading volume for the one-year period prior to the listing of the ELDS of at least 80 million shares. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  Paragraph 703.21 will also be amended to provide flexibility for the listing of issues of ELDS in cases where the linked security does not meet the specified capitalization and trading volume criteria provided in Paragraph 703.21 of the Manual, provided the staff of the Commission concurs with the listings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission originally approved the Exchange's ELDS listing standards on January 13, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33468 (January 13, 1994), 59 FR 3387 (January 21, 1994) (``Exchange Act Release No. 33468''). The ELDS listing standards have twice been amended since that time.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Securities Exchange Act Release Act Nos. 33841 (March 31, 1994), 59 FR 16671 (April 7, 1994) (order approving alternative minimum market capitalization and trading volume requirements for the security underlying an ELDS) (``Exchange Act Release No. 33841'') and 34545 (August 18, 1994), 59 FR 43877 (August 25, 1994) (order approving the listing of ELDS linked to sponsored American Depositary Receipts (``ADRs'') and other securities issued by non-U.S. companies subject to reporting requirements under the Act) (``Exchange Act Release No. 34545''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, the market capitalization and trading volume requirements for a security underlying an ELDS are as follows: (1) market capitalization of at least $3 billion and trading volume in the U.S. for the one-year period prior to the listing of the ELDS of at least 2.5 million shares; or (2) market capitalization of at least $1.5 billion and trading volume in the U.S. for the one-year period prior to the listing of the ELDS of at least 20 million shares.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Exchange Act Release Nos. 33468 and 33841,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, the proposed rule change amends existing language in Paragraph 703.21 regarding the listing of ELDS that represent more than the specified maximum percentages of the outstanding shares of the linked security. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  The amended language parallels the language discussed above regarding the ability of the Exchange to list ELDS that do not meet the specific capitalization and trading volume standards,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  an ELDS linked to more than the maximum specified percentages of the outstanding shares of the linked security could be listed provided that the NYSE, with the concurrence of the staff of the Commission, determines that the listing is appropriate. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph 703.21 presently provides that an issue of ELDS linked to a security issued by a: (1) U.S. company may not exceed 5% of the total outstanding shares of that security; and (2) non-U.S. company that is subject to reporting requirements under the Act may not exceed (i) 2% of the total worldwide outstanding shares of such security if at least 30% of the worldwide trading volume for the security and all related securities during the six-month period preceding the date of listing occurs in the U.S. market, (ii) 3% of the total worldwide outstanding shares of such security if at least 50% of the worldwide trading volume for the security and all related securities during the six-month period preceding the date of listing occurs in the U.S. market, or (iii) 5% of the total worldwide outstanding shares of such security if at least 70% of the worldwide trading volume for the security and all related securities during the six-month period preceding the date of listing occurs in the U.S. market.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 33468 and 34545,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission notes that Paragraph 703.21 presently provides that an ELDS may relate to more than the maximum percentages set forth above if the Exchange, in consultation with the staff of the Commission, determines that the listing is appropriate. As a result, the Commission believes that this portion of the proposed rule change is non-substantive in that it merely clarifies the intent of current standard set forth in the NYSE's rules, provides uniformity throughout Paragraph 703.21, and provides uniformity among the wording of the NYSE rule and similar rules of other self-regulatory organizations ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> see infra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  notes 10&hyph;12). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NYSE believes the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NYSE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Of the 15 pairs of ports linking up Heilongjiang  Province with the Russian Federation, 13 have been accessible by  vehicles. Their annual import and export volume reaches 830,000  tonnes, up 117 times from the figure of 1988 when the vehicle  transportation between the two sides opened. The port vehicle  transportation has become a key transportation force with which  the province delivers its goods to foreign countries.    In 1988 when the province started to open its vehicle  transportation to the Russian Federation, only 7,000 tonnes of  goods were transported. Along with the ceaseless expansion of  the border trade between the two countries, the transportation  volume has increased by a big margin. Over the past six years,  more than 1.8 million tonnes of goods were transported through  these ports by vehicles. Of this, more than 1.33 million tonnes  of goods were transported through Heihe and Suifenhe ports. So,  these two ports become the province's two largest ports with  vehicle transportation with the Russian Federation. There are  international regular passenger bus services linking up Heihe  and Dongning ports with the Russian ports opposite to them.  Some of the ports have also temporarily opened passenger bus  services. So far, 23 international vehicle transportation  enterprises with more than 850 vehicles have been established in  the province through examinations and approvals. When examining  and approving the foreign transportation enterprises and the  vehicles used for foreign transportation, the provincial  communications department has broken down the barriers between  different trades and made efforts to develop big container  vehicles, refrigeration vans, tank trucks, and [words  indistinct] goods transportation vehicles so as to gradually  rationalize the vehicle transportation structure.    The infrastructural facilities of the province's border  county towns and border ports are extremely weak. With the  strain on construction funds, over the past years, the  provincial communications department has built the  infrastructural facilities in these towns and ports in a  well-planned manner and in the order of priorities. The  Ministry of Communications, the province, and the localities  jointly invested more than 10 million yuan to build goods  transportation storehouses in Heihe, Suifenhe, and Tongjiang.  So, these three ports have basically obtained 30,000-tonne  storage capacity and semi-mechanized loading and unloading  capability. The port transportation conditions have ceaselessly  improved.    Dongning-Sanchakou, Luobei-Mingshan, and Mishan-Shangzhi  highways and [words indistinct] project have been made available  to the users.</p>

			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (23): The shape of things to come - Personal Numbers / One day, everyone may be given a telecoms number at birth, as they get a national insurance number today BY THE turn of the century, business cards listing a veritable directory of phone and fax numbers could be a thing of the past. Instead, most business people may have just one number - a 'personal number' connecting callers to whichever telephone, fax or messaging service its 'owner' chooses at any given time. Eventually, everyone might get a telecoms number at birth, just as in the UK they are given a national insurance number today, but for the foreseeable future 'personal numbering' will be a premium-rate service, geared mainly at companies, executives and others on the move and wanting to be contactable anywhere, anytime. The technology for the task is largely in place, with the development of intelligent networks which can 'recognise' different types of call, refer to databases, and then direct calls - and charge for them - in a pre-determined fashion. There is strong support for personal numbering from regulatory authorities, which are keen to boost competition between operators to provide new value-added services. In the UK, Oftel, the industry regulator, proposes to devote a large block of numbers for personal numbering. Prefixed by the digits '07', they would come on stream when the existing numbering regime is reformed in 1995. A recent Oftel policy statement highlighted personal numbering 'an area of rapid growth' in the next few years. It pointed to the US, where AT&amp;T has launched a service using '700' numbers and the Federal Communications Commission has floated the idea that the '500' number range be generally used for personal communications services. The expense of the operation is widely thought to make it unviable. When Oftel published its statement on numbering this summer, a BT spokesman dismissed the idea as 'way, way off . . . It's like Concorde,' he said. 'You can build it, but that doesn't mean many people will be able to afford to fly in it.' With a Dollars 7 a month subscription, AT&amp;T's 'EasyReach' service is not unduly expensive. Two companies are planning to launch similar services in the UK - Goodall Personal Numbering (GPN), which will brand a personal numbering service under the name 'Flextel' from the end of this year; and 'Numbering Viewed Worldwide', which plans to enter the market next year. Neither is toying with tariffs that will unduly frighten those anxious for their services. Goodall has two separate services in mind. First, a 'low mobility' service geared at companies which want a single number they can keep when they move. Second, a 'high mobility' personal number which individuals can take around with them day by day. Numbering Viewed Worldwide will concentrate on the second service. Mr Will Goodall, GPN's founder, believes the low mobility services will have most impact in the short term - 'the damage done to businesses by number changes is enormous,' he says. 'Many will be prepared to pay a small premium for the security of being able to move all or part of their operation around without forfeiting their number.' He downplays the immediate potential of 'high mobility' services. 'If people want day-by-day number portability, cellular services are doing most of the job already,' he says. In any case, there are serious practical difficulties in making a 'high mobility' service viable. They are highlighted by Dr Michael Grant of Analysys, the Cambridge-based telecoms consultancy. The key problem is to find a quick and simple way for the 'owner' of the database to update it with his/her movements on a day-by-day basis. AT&amp;T's 'EasyReach' relies on real-time updating, requiring users to phone a database each time they want their number transferred - unless they follow a pre-set daily pattern. This can be an off-putting process. As Dr Grant says of existing solutions: 'The user is required to inform the system of home, office and mobile telephone numbers, manage a list of preferred and barred caller numbers, specify re-routing times, and make ad hoc changes to the profile as the daily work pattern changes from its normal routine.' Moreover, 'informing the system' generally requires a phone call, the entering of an account code and PIN number and then the number of the terminal on which the user wishes to register. THE search is on for new technological solutions to the problem. Dr Grant highlights five which have potential: Calling line identification, being introduced in many networks around the world, which greatly reduces the time taken to register on a terminal. The DTMF 'tone card' concept, which could automate both the dialling of the service provider and the entering of the account number. Voice recognition, which could be used to speed up the inter-action. Subscriber identity module (SIM) cards - as already with phones on GSM digital cellular networks - which could be used to separate handsets from numbers, making all handsets docking stations for mobile terminals. Turning phones 'on' and 'off', to give signals to the network - as, again, do mobile phones already - as to whether the subscriber is there, and routing calls accordingly. Of the five, the SIM concept is the most path-breaking. Once the people, not the phones, have the numbers, the era of mobile communications will have truly arrived.</p>

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Low wage costs 'fail to draw foreign investment' BRITAIN'S LOW labour costs are not attracting investment by foreign industrial companies, says a study published today by the Trades Union Congress. The TUC points out that the share of foreign-owned companies in UK manufacturing employment fell during most of the 1980s and by 1989 had recovered only to its 1981 level of 15 per cent. It says: 'Foreign direct investment, a measure of financial flows which includes takeovers, increased between 1985 and 1989 but more than half of this took the form of takeovers of existing assets rather than new investment.' It points out that inward direct investment has fallen sharply from 3.4 per cent of gross domestic product in 1989 to 1.8 per cent last year. Since 1985 the net outward investment flow has 'amounted to a loss' of more than Pounds 36bn at 1992 prices - equivalent to more than a year's industrial investment in plant and machinery. The TUC also argues that Britain has lower wage rates than its main industrialised trading rivals but the country's competitiveness remains weak because of poor productivity due to the lack of skills and training, and a low level of technological investment. According to the TUC's figures for 1991, wages remain lower in Britain than the US, Germany, France and Italy but productivity remains even lower. The TUC says that Britain is in no position to compete on labour costs with low-wage economies such as Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore but 'nor is it yet in a position to compete with other industrialised countries on skills, productivity and innovation'.  ---------------------------------------------------------------          BRITAIN'S MANUFACTURING UNIT LABOUR COSTS 1991  ---------------------------------------------------------------             Labour costs    Productivity    Unit Labour costs  --------------------------------------------------------------- UK              100             100              100 US              115             175               66 Japan            98             150               65 German          124             175               71 France          114             139               82 Italy           128             121              106  --------------------------------------------------------------- Source: TUC Calculated from US Dept of Labor and OECD  ---------------------------------------------------------------</p>

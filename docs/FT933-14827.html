			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Ciampi aims for extra revenue THE Italian government is considering raising L32,000bn-L35,000bn (Pounds 13.7bn-Pounds 15bn) in extra revenues and spending cuts in the 1994 budget, writes Robert Graham in Rome. The aim is to hold the public sector deficit next year to L150,000bn, a small reduction on the 1993 target of L155,000bn. The budget outlines emerged yesterday as the government indicated it hoped to have the details agreed in cabinet either by the end of this week or early next. Today, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, prime minister, will be unveiling to parliament his government's three-year macro-economic projections for 1994-96. This will in turn provide the framework for discussion of the 1994 budget.</p>

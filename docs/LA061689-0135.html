			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOW FALLS 28.36 AS BOND, DOLLAR MARKETS WANE  </P> <P> Stock prices took a pounding Thursday, hit by futures-related selling programs  and plunges in bond prices and the dollar.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials tumbled 28.36 to 2,475.00.  </P> <P> Losers swamped gainers in nationwide trading of shares listed on the New York  Stock Exchange, with 1,078 issues declining, 444 rising and 466 unchanged.  </P> <P> Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 179.48 million shares, up from  170.54 million in the previous session.  </P> <P> Stocks were sold in preparation for the so-called triple witching hour, which  occurs once each quarter when stock-index futures, index options and options on  individual stocks expire. Trading volume was expected to be heavy today as  investors adjust their positions in stocks and futures.  </P> <P> A setback in the credit market acted as a catalyst to the stock selling. The  30-year Treasury bond rate dropped about 1 1/2 points, or $15 for every $1,000  in value. The bond's decline coincided with a steep slide in the dollar.  </P> <P> Bond traders previously had been buying out of optimism that the dollar's  recent strength would attract foreign investments.  </P> <P> Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities, said the market  declines were unsurprising.  </P> <P> "I guess we just got a case of tired blood," he said. "The bond market, the  stock market and the dollar have all moved to excess."  </P> <P> Integrated Resources Inc. shares plunged nearly 50%, to a closing price of  $6.25, after the insurance and mutual funds company said it was stopping  payment on $864 million in short-term debt. Integrated, which has $7.8 billion  in assets, said that its affiliates and subsidiaries would continue paying  creditors. Banks on Wednesday withdrew Integrated's access to short-term credit  markets. About 1.7 millions shares of Integrated were traded Thursday on the  New York Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> Stock prices on the London Stock Exchange finished mostly lower Thursday on the  back of early losses on Wall Street. The Financial Times 100-share index lost  4.0 points to close at 2,129.6.  </P> <P> Credit  </P> <P> Bond prices dropped in hectic trading, dragged down by the tumbling dollar.  </P> <P> The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond tumbled about 1 1/2 points, or $15  for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite  direction from price, soared to 8.30% from 8.16% late Wednesday.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other for short-term  loans, was quoted late in the day at 9.438%, down from 9.50% late Wednesday.  </P></p>

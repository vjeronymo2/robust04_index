			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / UK Company News: BSkyB to raise about Pounds 810m in global offer British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television venture, launched its UK retail offer yesterday without setting a firm price for the shares. It is offering UK investors 36.4m shares out of a global offer total of 343m shares. The offer closes on December 6, and the price will be set - in a range between 233p and 268p - on the morning of December 8, when dealings begin. The lower price would value the group at Pounds 4bn, while the upper price would give a valuation of Pounds 4.6bn. A price in the middle of the range would raise about Pounds 810m, which would be used with a new bank facility to pay off debts. Investors can set a limit on how much they are prepared to pay per share, but applications will be based on the amount of money to be invested. The minimum investment is Pounds 500. The prospectus shows the group had 3.6m subscribers at end-September, up from 3.45m last June. Group revenues in the year to June 30 were Pounds 550m, mainly from subscriptions. Operating profits were Pounds 170m, pre-tax profits Pounds 93m and earnings per share 6.8p. The group promises 'to maintain a dividend policy that reflects the presently high cash generative nature' of the business. For the year to June the directors would have recommended a net dividend of 3.3p per share. The main shareholders are Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation; Pearson, the media group that owns the Financial Times; Granada, the television and leisure group; and Chargeurs, the French industrial company. The group will be run by a board of 19, with Mr Frank Barlow remaining as chairman and Mr Sam Chisholm, who has played an important role in turning BSkyB round, as chief executive and managing director. Among 11 new directors will be Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada chief executive, and Mr Jerome Seydoux, Chargeurs chairman. The group 10 days ago submitted an affidavit to the High Court which estimated that total losses to the company in the first five months of this year through pirate card devices were Pounds 2.25m. The prospectus says there has been some piracy, but 'the directors believe that there has been no material loss of revenue over the past fiscal year as a consequence.' The group said it had been advised that a loss should only be considered material if it was 5 per cent instead of the 0.5 per cent loss over the period.</p>

			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Election 1992: Chalker forecast to lose Wallasey MRS Lynda Chalker, the overseas development minister, could be defeated on Thursday, according to an opinion poll of her Wallasey constituency by the Liverpool Echo newspaper. The Conservatives may also lose the nearby seat of Chester, which Mr Gyles Brandreth, the broadcaster, is contesting following the retirement of Sir Peter Morrison. The Echo poll, of 841 people, shows Mrs Chalker trailing Labour's Ms Angela Eagle by 7 per cent. Ms Eagle has 45 per cent of those who have already made up their minds, Mrs Chalker 38 per cent, and Mr Neil Thomas, the Liberal Democrat, 16 per cent. A Green party candidate has 1 per cent. In Chester, a poll by the Liverpool Daily Post newspaper shows Labour in the lead by 42 per cent to 37 per cent, with the Liberal Democrats on 20 per cent. The sample was 502 people.</p>

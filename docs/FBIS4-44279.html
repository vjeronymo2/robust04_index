			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Union: Commission, No </F> Replacement for Delors as Summit Ends"]    [Excerpts] (ANSA) Corfu, June 25 -- The European Summit  concluded today without reaching agreement on a successor to  European Commission president Jacques Delors, who leaves his  post at the end of the year. [passage omitted]    In a comment earlier this morning, before meetings began on  the second day of the summit, Italian Prime Minister Silvio  Berlusconi said that "if there is no agreement today on one of  the present candidates, others must be sought."    During negotiations yesterday, Italy had been seen as the  swing vote in an election that confronted "pro-Europe" forces  (which the Belgian Dehaene would be expected to represent) and  the so-called Euro-skeptics, led by the British.    Italy, Martino explained, had "placed no personal or  ideological vetos, just a methodological one" he said, referring  to earlier reluctance to approve Dehaene as the result of  Italy's "perplexity" because "a Franco-German initiative had  been set in motion without prior consultation."    The Italian Foreign Minister said that Britain's position  was  different, however. "The problem is a methodological one and  Prime Minister Major says he's not ready to bargain on the  issue."    The question had seemed near to resolution late last night  and early this morning, with much attention focusing on how  Italian opinion would swing.    The new government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi,  which  has presented itself as more "Euro-moderate" than previous  administrations, was seen by some as forging a conservative,  "Euro-skeptic" alliance with Britain.

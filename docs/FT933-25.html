			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (20): Half-baked solutions feared - The shape of financial reform is still unclear If India's economic reforms make progress anywhere in the next year, it will be in the financial markets. Officials at the finance ministry and at the Reserve Bank of India, bankers, brokers and businessmen all expect to see changes in the next few months. But they differ greatly about what the impact of those changes will be. While there is little doubt that policymakers are committed to further financial liberalisation, there is serious concern among pro-reform financiers that the government may stop short of creating fully-fledged open markets. They fear that India could be left in an economic half-way house in which the government-owned banks and other public sector institutions will continue to have the upper hand in their dealings with private companies. Last year's Rs40bn securities market scandal, in which brokers siphoned funds illegally out of banks for stock market investments, has reinforced the belief that the government will be very reluctant to give the private sector a free rein. As Mr N. Vaghul, chairman of the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India, says: 'Policy reform is going very well. In a few months it will be completed. But there is a serious problem with the institutions. I don't see the government having the courage to reform them.' India's financial markets are a curious hybrid. There are pockets of raw capitalism such as the Bombay Stock Exchange, with its total market capitalisation of Dollars 70bn, where the brokers are largely a law unto themselves. Leasing, merchant banking (loosely defined), gold, silver and diamond trading are also mostly pursued with little interference from the authorities. But all this rumbustious money-making, reminiscent of 19th century Britain or early 20th century America, goes on around the underskirts of large publicly-owned institutions, which have operated in one of the tightest regulatory regimes in the non-communist world. Bringing some order into this jungle requires three main changes: firstly, the stock market must be brought under regulatory control without being stifled; next, markets dominated by public institutions must be opened to private competitors, including foreign companies; finally, public institutions must be prepared for competition, including banks, which need to be cleared of the bad debts accumulated during years of operating on non-commercial lines. And these changes must be carried out without jeopardising growth. The reform-minded government of Mr PV Narasimha Rao has gone a considerable way with stock market reform. Laws have been passed to increase investor protection, ban insider trading and promote greater transparency. The Securities and Investment Board of India, the watchdog organisation established last year, has set about its job more vigorously than expected. To the annoyance of stockbrokers, it is delving deep into the workings of Bombay Stock Exchange, trying to enforce open market rules - such as transparent pricing. It wants brokers to give clients information about commission and other payment details. It has also proposed an ambitious plan for computerised futures and options trading to replace the present informal forward market called badla in which brokers carry forward own-account and clients' speculative positions using funds borrowed from other clients at rates of up to 25 per cent. Badla transactions account for 75-85 per cent of all trades  -creating considerable opportunity for brokers to manipulate prices. Brokers are in a quandary. To fend off SEBI's attack, they are making counter-proposals including plans for computerised trading and settlement and a centralised depository. But such plans would cost a great deal of money. The exchange is divided between some of its larger member firms, which support modernisation because of the efficiencies it would bring, and other firms, including many small ones, which seem to prefer to carry on in traditional ways. One consideration is the interests of foreign institutional investors, which have since last year been permitted to invest directly in Indian shares instead of through a limited number of country funds. So far, 56 funds have secured licences, though fewer than 10 have been active investors. As India wants foreign capital, it will have to take care that they are treated fairly by brokers and other intermediaries. The government is also committed to increasing competition in markets dominated by state-controlled institutions. In fund management, it is chipping away at the near-monopoly enjoyed by the Unit Trust of India, a mutual fund group with 90,000 agents and 30m accounts throughout India. SEBI has this year cleared 14 private sector groups to launch funds. UTI is responding to the competitive threat by agreeing with Alliance Capital, the US fund management group, jointly to launch an Indian mutual fund. In insurance, a committee that is expected to report to the finance ministry soon is almost certain to recommend ending the monopolies enjoyed by LIC and GIC. Among foreign insurers, Sun Life of the UK has already established ties with LIC under which the two companies jointly sell life insurance to Indians living in Britain. They plan to establish a second joint venture in India. But it could take time before there is genuine competition. Like most Indian publicly-owned institutions, UTI, LIC and GIC are over-staffed and under-computerised. But their problems pale in comparison with the country's banks, where the government and the reserve bank face the greatest challenge - and where they are likely to fall furthest short of creating genuinely competitive commercial markets. Since 1991, the authorities have gone some way towards liberalising interest rates, abolishing a complex multi-rate interest structure and keeping just three rates - a maximum deposit rate (now 10 per cent), a concessional lending rate for small loans (12 per cent) and a minimum lending rate for other loans of 15 per cent. The amount of enforced lending from banks to the government has been reduced, albeit modestly. Until 1991, banks had to deposit with the government 38.5 per cent of their deposits and another 25 per cent with the reserve bank. Now these figures have dropped to 34.7 and 14.6 per cent. The plan is to cut them again to 25 and 10 per cent. The rationalisation of the interest rate structure and compulsory deposit ratios have given banks slightly more room for manoeuvre, releasing more funds for commercial lending. But distortions remain - for instance, on a small loan banks are obliged to charge at least 3 percentage points less than on a large one. In countries with relatively open banking systems, small borrowers usually pay a large premium over big corporations. Moreover, the government has expressed no wish to reform a much greater restriction on banks' activities - an obligation to advance at least 40 per cent of credit to politically-favoured sectors, including farmers and small businesses. As a result, others must pay more for credit. However, distortions in credit policy pale in comparison with the weaknesses of the banks themselves. The 28 nationalised banks, with 40,000 branches, accounting for over 90 per cent of total bank assets, employ too many people and too little technology. State Bank of India, the largest, says 28 per cent of its 8,738 branches lose money. The 200 regional rural banks with 15,000 branches are even worse off. Both the national and the rural banks were encouraged to expand rapidly in the backward regions of India by the government. The result is a massive backlog of bad debt, accumulated because too little regard was paid to credit quality. Mr C. Rangarajan, the central bank governor, says: 'At the moment the (capital) base of banks is weak according to the norms we have laid down.' The central bank has this year introduced rules requiring banks to account fully for bad debts. As at the end of March 1993, it estimates bad debts of the national banks totalled Rs100-110bn. Others put the figure as high as Rs220bn. Rural banks' bad debts could raise the total to Rs270bn. The government, which has injected Rs40bn in the past to bail out banks, is this year putting in a further Rs57bn. But without even more, the banks will be unable to make full provision for debts. Nor will they be able to meet international capital adequacy norms laid down by the Bank for International Settlements. Banks with international operations have until March 1995 to meet the BIS's requirement of a minimum ratio of capital to assets of 8 per cent. Other banks have until March 1996. In order to fund their needs, banks are being urged to go to the capital market. The State Bank of India is planning to raise Rs20bn later this year, in a move which will reduce the state's ownership stake from 98 per cent to 70-75 per cent. However, SBI is a particularly well managed institution. Others will be unable to attract private shareholders. Mr D. Basu, the SBI chairman, says there will be mergers among banks. Yet he doubts whether they will lead to greater efficiency since banks will not be free to close branches rapidly or cut staff. For instance, the Punjab National Bank, a state-owned bank, recently took over the loss-making New Bank of India. But the deal was held up for three years while staff at the two institutions sorted out their relative seniorities. World Bank studies show that countries determined to sort out loss-making banks are usually able to finance recapitalisation. If the Indian banks' bad debts reached Rs200bn, that would be only about 3 per cent of GDP. By comparison, Spanish banks' bad debts total 16.8 per cent of GDP. However, recapitalising banks will be a waste of resources unless banks are also required to operate more efficiently. At the central bank, Mr Rangarajan believes they will, to compete with the 55 existing private banks (including 24 foreign) plus four newly licensed private banks. State-owned banks will have to sign operating agreements with the reserve bank that make profitability rather than asset growth the top priority. These pressures could improve the efficiency of a handful of well-managed institutions. But a fully-liberalised banking industry is not even on the government's agenda. As one Bombay banker says: 'The banks will modernise but control will stay 90 per cent with the government.'</p>

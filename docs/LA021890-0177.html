			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GEAGEA ISSUES PLEA AFTER LEBANESE FORCES RECEIVE A SEVERE POUNDING;  </P> <P> CIVIL WAR: HIS CHRISTIAN MILITIA LASHES BACK WITH AN ATTACK ON GEN. AOUN'S  HELICOPTER BASE. ANOTHER TRUCE IS CALLED.  </P> <P> Caught in a deadly ring of armor and artillery, Lebanon's main Christian  militia lashed back Saturday at rival army forces, pouring tank fire on an  isolated helicopter base.  </P> <P> The Lebanese Forces attack on an estimated 750 army defenders at the Adma base  near Juniyah, north of Beirut, swung the two-week-long struggle to another  front.  </P> <P> Later Saturday, the warring Christian factions declared a cease-fire. Up to  now, however, more than 10 such truces between the army troops of Maj. Gen.  Michel Aoun and the Lebanese Forces militia of Samir Geagea have failed, and  there were few hopes that any settlement was within sight Saturday.  </P> <P> Loss of the Adma base could cost Aoun 12 of his 18 Puma attack helicopters  should his pilots be unable to fly them out. Meanwhile, according to an  unconfirmed report carried by Beirut radio stations Saturday, the general's  minuscule air force, four old British Hawker Hunters, were flown by defecting  pilots to an air base under Syrian control.  </P> <P> But the prospect of such setbacks for Aoun could not erase the devastating  defeat that the militia suffered Friday night.  </P> <P> Nearly 1,000 army infantrymen, backed by 36 tanks, Friday ground block by  block, house by house, through the militia-controlled district of Ain Rummaneh  in Christian East Beirut. At nightfall, according to press reports from the  Lebanese capital, militia leader Geagea pulled out the last of his men.  </P> <P> He then went on the radio of the rightist Falange Party, whose militiamen form  the core of the Lebanese Forces, and appealed for help. "I call on all world  powers and all spiritual and political leaderships, especially the legitimate  ones, to resume their full responsibilities towards the country and its  citizens," he implored in a message broadcast repeatedly by the Voice of  Lebanon.  </P> <P> While outside powers with influence in Lebanon -- including France, the Vatican  and the United States -- have demanded that renegade army commander Aoun break  off his assault on the militia, none appears likely to intervene. Geagea's  appeal appeared directed instead at "legitimate" forces, namely the Lebanese  government headed by President Elias Hrawi and backed by a Syrian army of  40,000 or more, the overwhelming military force in Lebanon.  </P> <P> Hrawi made no immediate response to Geagea's plea. But in Damascus, the Syrian  capital, the authoritative Al Thawra newspaper declared again Saturday that  President Hafez Assad's regime stands ready to support Hrawi, saying that  Syrian troops are at his disposal.  </P> <P> Some press reports from Beirut mentioned movements of Syrian units in the  Lebanese mountains above Aoun's headquarters at Baabda on the outskirts of East  Beirut.  </P> <P> "But ask yourself, why would the Syrians want to get into a very dirty fight  among Christians," said a Nicosia-based diplomat Saturday. "Assad is not the  sort to rush into a situation that can only smear his army, even in victory.  This fight has no direct effect on him."  </P> <P> The internecine struggle began at the end of January when Aoun, who has been  sacked as army commander by Hrawi, demanded that the Lebanese Forces either  disarm or join his ranks. The general appears utterly convinced of the justice  of his beliefs -- that there should be no armed force within Lebanon except  what he considers his army.  </P> <P> Aoun speaks of the Lebanese Forces simply as "gunmen." In a country where no  political party lacks a militia, the Falange has borne the brunt of the  fighting against Muslim rivals over 15 years of civil war. But it has been no  less combative against its Christian rivals.  </P> <P> The party militia of the powerful Gemayel clan, Falange fighters took on the  Tigers militia of the late Christian leader Camille Chamoun and the Giants of  former President Suleiman Franjieh in the early years of the war.  </P> <P> In a particularly vicious attack, Falange raiders killed Franjieh's son, Tony,  his wife and their baby daughter. The raid was led by an up-and-coming  militiaman named Samir Geagea.  </P> <P> Aoun has declared war on all militias, which he accuses of usurping government  authority, and has shown no reluctance to engulf Beirut in urban warfare to  achieve his aim. His conquest of Ain Rummaneh tightens the ring of army power  around the Lebanese Forces. The district lies south of the Museum Crossing, the  main transit point through the Green Line separating Christian East from Muslim  West Beirut. To the north of the crossing lie Geagea's last redoubts in the  capital itself, the districts of Ashrafiyeh and Karantina.  </P> <P> Press estimates put the number of dead in the 17 days of fighting at more than  580, with 1,800 or more wounded. In last year's punishing artillery war between  Aoun's loyalists and Syrian and Muslim militia gunners on the west, more than  800 soldiers and civilians were reported killed, but that round of fighting  lasted six months.  </P></p>

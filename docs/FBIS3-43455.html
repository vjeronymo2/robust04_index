Speaking to the GHANA  NEWS AGENCY in Accra, Dr. Asamoah said the Togolese authorities  have no evidence to support the claim that the attackers came  from Ghana. He said, however, that the government was  monitoring the situation and would respond at the appropriate  time. Dr. Asamoah, who is also the acting attorney general and  minister of justice, recalled that the Togolese authorities  leveled similar accusations against Ghana on the eve of the  presidential election in Lome last August.    On the closure of the land border with Ghana by the Togolese  authorities, the minister described it as unfortunate as it has  caused hardship to people living on both sides. Dr. Asamoah  hoped it would not be too long for the border to be reopened as  provided for under the ECOWAS [Economic Community of West  African States] Treaty.</p>

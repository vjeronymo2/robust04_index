			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> JAILBIRD SINGERS SPREAD GOSPEL  </P> <P> A group of convicted murderers and other criminals has recorded four gospel  songs in the hope of repaying the victims of their misdeeds.  </P> <P> The New Faith Singers, made up of a dozen Tennessee State Penitentiary inmates,  recorded their songs for Warner Bros., which has the option of releasing the  music.  </P> <P> Songwriter and minister Moses Dillard is promoting the singers and said he will  ask Tennessee Gov. Ned McWherter to move them to a minimum-security prison so  they can get out to perform for churches, schools and civic groups.  </P> <P> New Faith has been incorporated as a nonprofit ministry so any proceeds from  their music will go to their crime victims, Dillard said. Lead singer Victor  Shears, serving a life term for burglary, said he just wants to repay those he  victimized.  </P> <P> Dillard organized the singers while ministering to them in prison. He said the  state refused to allow them to leave for recording sessions, so a temporary  studio was built in the prison chapel. Two studio musicians came in every day  to back up the singers.  </P></p>

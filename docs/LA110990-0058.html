			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LETTERS IN VIEW;  </P> <P> MAX THE MOUTH FROM THE N.Y. TIMES  </P> <P> N.Y. Times Executive Editor Max Frankel's bloopers on affirmative action were  truly amazing. Frankel makes ex-Interior Secretary James Watt sound in  retrospect like a polished diplomat ("Editor Is Back in Hot Water," Oct. 24).  </P> <P> If the president of General Motors or IBM had made statements like Frankel's,  it's a safe bet that the media would have mounted a crusade against such  hopeless insensitivity. In the vanguard would be the New York Times, which  could be counted on to weigh in with at least three scornful editorials (op-ed  pieces excluded).  </P> <P> However, when Frankel ricochets from one affirmative action gaffe to the next,  we hear mostly silence. Professional courtesy, no doubt. The Los Angeles Times  is to be commended for running the story.  </P> <P> JOHN A. JUDGE  </P> <P> Alameda  </P></p>

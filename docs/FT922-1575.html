			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Letter: Big penalty for small firms Sir, Do employers know about the penalties in 1993 for completing their end of year returns late? We are a small business but had 376 different short-term employees last year. Next year, we will be fined up to Pounds 9,600 for being just three weeks late. Rupert Emerson, Vincent Knight Sanchez Consultancy, 108 Kingston Road, Wimbledon</p>

Agriculture and animal husbandry make up 80 percent of the  region's local output, and this year the regional government  will carry out a more preferential policy with regard to loans  to the two sectors.    The additional funds will be used mainly to promote the  development of farmland, grassland, hydropower stations and  other water conservancy facilities.    The government will increase funding by seven million yuan  (804,600 U.S. dollars) each year in an attempt to spread fine  strains of crops. Chemical fertilizers will continue to be sold  with government price support.    The region will also appropriate 20 million yuan each year  to  ensure the construction of some key or small hydropower  stations. The funding in animal husbandry will remain at ten  million yuan a year as before.    In addition to the central government's aid to impoverished  areas, the regional government will expand the scale of loans to  township and town enterprises to boost their growth.</p>

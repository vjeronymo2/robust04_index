			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / International Company News: Elkem returns to the black in second quarter with NKr96m ELKEM, the Norwegian light metals producer, has announced its first quarterly pre-tax profit before extraordinary items for three years due to cost-cutting, lower energy taxes and a stronger dollar. The NKr96m (Dollars 12.85m) second-quarter profit helped the company rebound to a NKr61m pre-tax profit in the first half from a NKr189m loss in the same 1992 period. It confirms that the company is recovering following last year's crisis refinancing, although the market outlook for many of its products remains uncertain. Net sales in the first half fell to NKr3.78bn from NKr3.82bn, but the effects of a cost-cutting drive were apparent in the fall in operating costs to NKr3.44bn from NKr3.59bn. Staff numbers have been cut by around 1,000 to 5,700 over the past 18 months. Group financial expenses were also lower at NKr186m, compared with NKr203m. Interest payments have fallen in line with a sharp reduction in net debt, which at June 30 was NKr3.3bn, NKr1.2bn lower than at the start of the year. The company was also able to book NKr60m back into its accounts as the cost of withdrawing from high temperature waste treatment has proved less than expected. Elkem said ferro-alloy exports from the CIS and China were continuing at high levels, adding to uncertainties over future price levels. It also warned that western steel production may not continue to show the same level of growth it displayed in the first half.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Blagov] </F>   [Text] Hanoi, 16 Apr -- The Russian Government delegation  headed by Deputy Chairman of the Russian Federation Government  Yuriy Yarov today visited a Russian military installation in Cam  Ranh Bay in Vietnam.    Answering questions from the ITAR-TASS correspondent on the  eve of the visit, the Russian deputy prime minister praised the  present state of bilateral cooperation in the military field, a  new impetus to which was, in his words, given by a visit to  Russia in March by [Lieutenant General] Dao Dinh Luyen, chief of  the General Staff of the Vietnamese People's Army. Yarov noted  that the visit to Cam Ranh Bay was purely fact-finding. At the  same time, he said that the visit could result in new proposals  on joint mutually beneficial use of the installation, even  though the problem had not been discussed in the course of the  present visit to Vietnam.    The materials and machinery supplies station at Cam Ranh  peninsula is at present used by Russia on the basis of the  agreement signed by the former USSR and Vietnam in 1981. It  expires in 2004. The numbers of the Russian staff servicing the  installation have been reduced by about three-quarters compared  with 1980, while cooperation with the Vietnamese side has been  transferred to a commercial basis.</p>

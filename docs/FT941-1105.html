			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow slides for second consecutive day Wall Street US share prices went into steep decline for a second straight session yesterday after the yield on the benchmark US Treasury bond climbed above 7 per cent for the first time in 10 months, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 46.36 lower at 3,774.73, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 3.77 at 460.58. NYSE volume, at 249m shares, was moderate. Declining issues outnumbered advances, 1,188 to 845. However, the secondary markets held up better than the NYSE, in contrast to the previous session, when all leading indices showed big losses. The American SE composite slipped 1.23 to 468.43, and the Nasdaq composite shed 3.23 to 783.45. After Thursday's heated session, which brought a 48-point plunge in the bellwether blue-chip index, yesterday's session began on a subdued note. Investors had only one shred of economic news to guide sentiment - a 9.9 per cent decline in February sales of existing homes - but the distorting effect of last month's bad weather mitigated any negative implications suggested by the data. EP) More important for stocks, the report failed to stir the US Treasury market, which drifted lower amid continued uncertainty generated by the assassination on Wednesday of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the Mexican presidential candidate. But in the afternoon the sell-off in bonds intensified. Near 3.30pm the yield bid on the benchmark 30-year government issue finally breached the 7 per cent level, an important psychological barrier. Traders could not identify a single reason for the fresh slide, but instead pinned the blame on a variety of factors, including inflationary fears and political concerns, which have been driving prices down and yields up in recent weeks. The impact on blue-chip stocks, however, was never in doubt. Share prices lurched downward after trading modestly lower for most of the session. Among the Dow components, Alcoa dropped Dollars 2 to Dollars 76 1/4 , Bethlehem Steel lost Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 20 7/8 , International Paper shed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 68 3/8 and General Electric Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 102 1/8 . Automobile issues were down sharply. General Motors backtracked Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 56 7/8 , Ford Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 60 1/4 and Chrysler Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 53 1/2 . UAL, the parent of United Airlines, jumped Dollars 7 3/4 to Dollars 131 1/2 after completing an agreement to sell a majority stake in the company to its employees. But International Business Machines was marked down Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 54 after a turnround strategy drew mixed reviews from investors. Canada Stocks were down sharply in active trading. The TSE-300 composite index fell 41.36 points, or 0.91 per cent, to 4,528.29, a loss on the week of about 39 points. The tumble was blamed on the major banks' first rise in prime rates since last August. Mexico Equities fell, as expected, with the resumption of trading following the assassination on Wednesday of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the leading presidential candidate, but finished with a surprising recovery. The IPC index ended down 22.79 points, or only 0.90 per cent, at 2,520.78. Brazil Sao Paulo closed up 6 per cent in moderate trade, boosted by strong buying of major state blue chips tied to speculation on whether or not Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, minister of the economy, would run for president. The Bovespa index was 825 higher at 14,591.</p>

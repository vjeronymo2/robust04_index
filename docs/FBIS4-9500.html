			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Albanian President Sali Berisha to the National </F> Assembly in Sofia -- live, in Albanian with simultaneous  translation into Bulgarian]    [Text] Your Excellency Mr. President Zhelev, esteemed  National Assembly Chairman, esteemed Deputies of the National  Assembly of the Republic of Bulgaria, ladies and gentlemen:    It gives me particular pleasure to greet the lawful  representatives of the friendly Bulgarian people from this  platform. Permit me to express my gratitude to you for this  meeting today and to offer my thanks to President Zhelev, who  invited me to make this visit, which I hope will be of service  for cooperation, drawing together, and friendship between our  two countries.    History and joint coexistence in our region have been  associated with numerous friendly links between our two peoples.  The Albanians do not forget that in times of great difficulty  for them, they were able to set up colonies here in Sofia, which  were powerful centers for our national rebirth. Enlighteners  and eminent Albanian revivalists who lived and worked in Sofia  organized associations which published books and newspapers that  cleared the path for our nation to advance toward independence.  Leaders of the Albanian bands fighting for freedom also found  support in Bulgaria. The Bulgarians helped the Albanians to win  their independence, and we experienced a feeling of true  friendship.    When Albania won her independence, this was welcomed with  immense joy by our people. The Albanians should have confidence  in our support for ensuring that their state remains free and  independent -- this was stated in the greetings telegram from  the Bulgarian state in connection with Albania's independence.    The new atmosphere that has been created in the countries of  Eastern Europe following the overthrow of the dictators'  regimes, which oriented Albania and Bulgaria toward the  universal democratic values and integration into Europe, has  indubitably opened up broad horizons and new prospects for  developing comprehensive cooperation and friendship between us.    The visits to Albania by President Zhelev, National Assembly  Chairman Yordanov, Foreign Minister Daskalov, and other  Bulgarian ministers, as well as the visits to Bulgaria by  Albanian Parliament Chairman Arbnori, Prime Minister Meksi, and  Albanian ministers, helped us to establish closer cooperation  and to sign agreements of mutual interest to both states. Among  these agreements I would like especially to mention the signing  by our two presidents in Tirana of the Treaty on Friendship and  Cooperation Between Albania and Bulgaria. I am glad that during  this visit we also signed an agreement on economic and trade  cooperation and an agreement on protecting and stimulating  investments that will directly help us to increase economic  production-sharing between our two countries.    Esteemed ladies and gentlemen, many times in the course of  past centuries our two peoples overcame difficulties and  troubles. However, I do not want to dwell on history now, but  merely to stress that during the second half of the 20th century  the communist regime was an immense common drama that we both  experienced, but the liberation from totalitarian domination  clearly demonstrated that the Albanians and Bulgarians can be  bent but never broken.    At the moment, Albania and Bulgaria are committing their  utmost efforts to realizing the wishes of their peoples,  expressed by their free vote, to build a society on the basis of  a rule-of-law state, with due respect for the liberties and  rights of man, to build a market economy, and to achieve their  integration into Europe and the international community.    Permit me to pay my respects to this parliament in  recognition of its exceptional work in replacing the legislation  of a dictatorial society with the laws and norms of a free  democratic society. [applause]    I take pleasure in being able to inform you that Albania is  strongly committed to the same transformation. During the last  two years, to overcome the legacy, certainly the most bitter one  of all the legacies in Eastern Europe, we chose the fast track  for implementing in-depth legislative, social, and economic  reforms. This course is probably the most painful one; it  requires the most sacrifices, but on the other hand most quickly  produces visible results. The Albanian Parliament passed  hundreds of laws meeting European standards, the most important  of which are a Charter of Human Rights and difficult  constitutional laws that correspond to the European Human Rights  Convention. In two years, all our institutions have undergone  profound transformations. In the economic field, we privatized  the land, housing plots, road transportation, trade, and  services. We have privatized over 1,000 enterprises during the  last eight months alone.    In 1994 we will continue the privatization of medium-size  and  large enterprises. The have liberalized prices and foreign  currency exchange, and the results were not slow in coming. The  stores are full, the long lines have disappeared, and our  currency has stabilized and, in practice, is convertible. Last  year annual inflation fell to 30 percent from 400 percent prior  to the elections on 22 March 1992. In 1993 Albania reported the  greatest economic growth in Europe, a growth of 10 percent in  the GNP.    Despite all this, Albania remains the poorest country in  Europe, with an infrastructure of a Third World country, with  obsolete technologies, and a high rate of unemployment that  varies between 14 and 18 percent. These factors hamper our way  forward.    Ladies and gentlemen, our two friendly countries, as well as  the other countries of the Eastern Europe, have liberated  ourselves from communist dictatorships and chosen the road of  freedom [applause], the market economy, and the rule-of-law  state, a road that they do not expect to be strewn with flowers.  However, as well as the immense natural difficulties of the  transition, of orientation toward the market economy, we have  encountered unexpected problems and even unforeseen dangers.  The dismantling of the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain are  naturally immense achievements of mankind as a whole and of  Western society in particular. Their replacement with a  financial wall, barriers of a different psychological nature,  and ultranationalist and racist obstacles constitute an immense  threat, not only for our countries but also for our continent.  The removal of the Iron Curtain was not only accompanied by the  liberation of the dozens of countries and hundreds of millions  of people from one of the most cruel dictatorships that mankind  has experienced, but we have to admit that it was also  accompanied by dangerous phenomenons: the Bosnian syndromes,  the Zhirinovskiy phenomenon [applause], the Serbian aggression,  and its exacerbation by various forms of nationalism,  ultranationalism, racism, and so on.    Before the specter of communism had fully disappeared, other  ghosts from the near and more distant past today pose a threat  to peace, security, and democratic values on our continent.  Taken together, all of them hamper and interrupt the process of  integration that is vitally important and crucial for both the  fate of democracy in our countries and the whole of Western  mankind, and intensify confrontation. Therefore, today more  than ever, the consolidation of bilateral and regional  cooperation is of particular importance for our present and  future, for our children. [applause]    Mr. Chairman, our peninsula has been plunged into in a  profound and dangerous crisis. The war in Bosnia is the  greatest human drama that Europe has experienced since the time  of World War II. This war, if the aggressor is allowed to get  away with it, is only the prelude to a regional war waged on a  broader scale, the consequences of which cannot be described.  [applause]    First, the war in Bosnia is the result of the decision of  the  communist dictatorship in Belgrade to create a Greater Serbia by  aggression and in conformance with the memorandum of the Serbian  Academy of Sciences that envisages the ethnic purging of more  than 40 percent of the population inhabiting this territory, on  the sole ground that it is not Serbian.    Second, there is an exacerbation and encouragement of this  aggression by other nationalist Balkan -- and not only Balkan --  countries that believe that, following the Serbian model, they  can satisfy their own chauvinistic and ultranationalistic  ambitions. [applause]    Third, it is more than naive to think that a Greater Serbia,  if established, could establish peace, stability, and  equilibrium in the Balkans. In practice, this idea is just as  dangerous as the previous two, and would have graver  consequences. This is so because first, it accepts the  alteration of borders by force, and second, it supports the  ridiculous thesis that the Serbian people should dominate in the  Balkan peninsula, when it makes up no more than 7 to 8 percent  of the population of the Balkans. Believing in this viewpoint  is tantamount to aiding the long-term destabilization of the  region, because history has clearly confirmed on numerous  occasions that a Greater Serbia was always a transitory and  unstable structure and lead to war, conflicts, instability, and  aggression. [applause].    It is a fact that a Greater Serbia always represents a  direct  danger for the Bulgarians, Albanians, Macedonians, and other  peoples. We believe that the aggression against  Bosnia-Herzegovina, a sovereign state and a member of the United  Nations, and its dismemberment by force of arms set a question  mark over the common and individual security of the countries in  our peninsula. We are seriously worried about the continuous  degradation of the situation in Kosovo, where 2 million  Albanians live on a compact territory, making up 90 percent of  its population. In the former Yugoslavia, Kosovo was an  autonomous province and enjoyed almost all the rights of the  former Yugoslav republics. Kosovo had its own state, economic,  and cultural institutions, whereas today Belgrade denies these  human and national rights, rejects dialogue with them, and is  creating in Kosovo an explosive situation that may easily blow  up.    Albania declares that it opposes changing borders from a  position of force. It insists that if Belgrade transfers the  conflict to Kosovo, it will bear the total responsibility for a  regional war. The prevention of this war is an important and  permanent priority for Albania, Bulgaria, and other countries  interested in peace and stability. I consider that, under these  conditions, bilateral cooperation -- political, economic,  cultural, and military -- between Albania and Bulgaria, and also  within the multilateral framework of the European institutions,  the Partnership for Peace initiative, and the Black Sea Economic  Zone initiative are of immense importance for peace and  stability in our region.    By their policies, Albania and Bulgaria have provided and  are making an important contribution to preserving peace and  preventing conflicts. In this context, I would like to stress  that Bulgaria's refusal to take part in the trilateral summit in  Athens is of immense importance for reducing and restraining the  expansionist ambitions of those who consider that they can  implement them by forming aggressive axes and alliances.  Furthermore, although it maintains that the Albanian question  is the chief one in the Balkans, Albania does not want borders  to be changed by force. It stands for a democratic region in  which respect is shown for the human and national freedoms and  rights of the Albanians in the place where they live.    Our two countries recognized The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia and regard its stability as a condition for preventing  a conflict in the southern part of the Balkans. [applause]    Ladies and gentlemen, I am an optimist regarding the  development of the spirit of understanding, cooperation, and  friendship between Albania and Bulgaria. Albania attaches  particular importance to its friendly relations with the  Republic of Bulgaria because it is convinced that this  corresponds to the political, economic, and cultural interests  of our two nations, and also contributes to expanding a climate  of defusing tension and cooperation in our region, the Balkans.  I consider that bilateral and multilateral cooperation in the  Balkans is a crucial factor for the process of the integration  of our countries and peoples into Europe.    I express my wish for the traditional friendly cooperation  between Albania and Bulgaria and the multilateral cooperation to  develop even further. May God help Albania to develop and  speedily advance along the road of progress, states the  greetings telegram that I quoted at the start of my speech. I  would like to conclude by offering the same good wishes to you.  [applause and cheers]    May God bless our countries and peoples, and the friendship  and cooperation between them! Thank you.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Tatyana Samolis, press secretary of the </F> director of the Foreign Intelligence Service, by correspondent  Sergey Omelchenko; interview is interspersed with video footage  of Ames and his wife being arrested and Yeltsin with Clinton  walking along surrounded by a crowd of people -- from the  "Novosti" newscast]    [Text] [Announcer] The trial in the United States of the  case of Ames who has been charged with spying for Russia was  expected to start today. However we have not yet received any  news about the start of this trial.    [Omelchenko] In my opinion, the passions raging around  intelligence activities have a whiff of dirty tricks about them,  because the intelligence service in all countries, at any time,  is as it were an early warning system warning regarding  conflicts, the various unpleasant things that menace the state.  And in this case, in the Ames case, don't you think, Tatyana  Viktorevna, that this is more a matter not of professional  problems, but of political ambitions and political problems,  even far-fetched ones?    [Samolis] If this problem is raised on this level of high  politics, then it is not raised by intelligence officers,  because in any country professionals understand one another.  And in general I think that in today's civilized world,  conducting intelligence activity against one another is  absolutely no impediment to maintaining friendly and even  ally-style relations.    [Omelchenko] All that fuss surrounding the Ames affair and  the stirring up of the public makes one form the impression that  here, on the one hand, the CIA is in trouble in general; on the  other hand, perhaps some kind of influential forces want to  suggest to Clinton that he should alter relations with Russia,  perhaps to have some kind of pause in our relations.    [Samolis] I would not argue with you. In any case, the  Russian intelligence service is interested in continuing  cooperation with the U.S. intelligence service. It will strive  for that.    [Omelchenko] In what fields?    [Samolis] We have many common problems in this far from  simple and rather dangerous world. First and foremost, it is in  such fields as the problems of proliferation of weapons of mass  destruction, the fight against international crime, against drug  trafficking, against terrorism, and the exchange of information  on the development of the situation in crisis spots. That is  enough for today. Tomorrow perhaps there will be some new  problems in the solution of which we may need one another.    [Omelchenko] Tatyana Viktorevna, after the mutual expulsions  of Morris and Lysenko, if there is a further escalation in such  actions, how will the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service react?    [Samolis] First and foremost, we would not like this to  happen, of course. We think that common sense should prevail,  but if it becomes an issue like you have mentioned, then the  measures will probably be mutual ones, but it will not be the  intelligence service that will take them, but the country's  highest political leadership.</p>

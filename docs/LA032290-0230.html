			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> EXCURSION;  </P> <P> UNOCAL MUSEUM IS A CELEBRATION OF OIL  </P> <P> The 1890s red brick building with its beige awnings and green cast-iron columns  looks as if it has been transplanted from Disneyland's Main Street.  </P> <P> The quaint, two-story building has played a prominent part in Santa Paula  history, as well as doubling as a tourist attraction for decades. Now, two  years after its closure in 1988, the Unocal Museum is open for business again.  </P> <P> The museum on East Main Street was where Union Oil Company (now known as Unocal  Corporation) was founded nearly a century ago. The company headquarters were  moved to Los Angeles in 1901, but division offices were kept at the Santa Paula  location until 1988, said Karen Sikkema, a Unocal vice president.  </P> <P> The first floor of the building has housed museum exhibits since 1950, but the  second floor was reserved for offices, Sikkema said. About $2.5 million was  spent updating the first floor exhibits and converting the second floor into  turn-of-the-century style offices.  </P> <P> Judging from a preview of the museum before its March 25 opening, the money was  well-spent. An old-fashioned time clock is the first thing that greets visitors  when they come through the door. Visitors may punch in and keep a card as a  souvenir.  </P> <P> The self-explanatory exhibits and videos allow tourists to roam freely on the  first floor. The museum exhibits are an unabashed celebration of oil and the  oil industry.  </P> <P> For children, there's the crude-oil pinball machine, and for history buffs,  there are old photographs and 1890s film footage that accompany the Unocal time  line.  </P> <P> For model builders, there are miniature versions of a drill ship, a jack-up  brig and off-shore oil stations.  </P> <P> For movie fans, there is a little-known Unocal commercial featuring Marilyn  Monroe. And there are exhibits showing how oil is created, how geologists find  it and how it is transported.  </P> <P> Those who think wistfully of the good old days when gasoline was 9 cents a  gallon can relive them by viewing an old-fashioned pumper and cash register.  </P> <P> Visitors who wish to see the old-fashioned offices upstairs should make  appointments first, said museum curator Carol Schwindt. Tour guides, many of  whom are retired Unocal employees, will lead groups through the restored  offices.  </P> <P> The second floor features an apartment from the 1930s, when the superintendent  of the operation lived at the office. The brass bed, old-fashioned stove and  kerosene lamps are right out of an episode of the Waltons.  </P> <P> Other offices feature the original desk of Unocal's first geologist, plus his  old maps and files. A family photograph sits on his desk, along with an  old-fashioned pencil sharpener.  </P> <P> The board room, which offers a view of 10th Street and Main Street, actually  doesn't look much different from today's version, with the possible exception  of brass lights and kerosene lamps.  </P> <P> In an adjoining building, in front of a park, is an old cable-tool drill rig  that is over 100 hundred years old.  </P> <P> And, naturally, adjoining the museum is a Unocal gas station.  </P> <P> Thirty minutes to two hours could be spent at the Unocal Museum.  </P> <P> * UNOCAL MUSEUM  </P> <P> The museum is open 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Wednesdays through Sundays. Call  805-933-0076 for more information.  </P></p>

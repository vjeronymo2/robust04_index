			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / International Company News: Restructuring at Sears, Roebuck SEARS, ROEBUCK, the world's second largest retailer, announced yesterday it was spinning off or selling a large part of its successful financial services operation in a large restructuring that should reduce corporate debt. Analysts estimate the total effect of the restructuring will be to reduce debt from Dollars 38bn to around Dollars 16.5bn. The demerger is a big gamble for Sears, which is disposing of its most profitable operations in the hope that, by reducing debt levels and concentrating on a few businesses, it will be able to lay a secure foundation for its loss-making domestic retailing operation. The units Sears is selling accounted for 27 per cent of the Dollars 1.28bn in group profits earned last year and 10 per cent of group revenues, which totalled Dollars 57bn. In recent years, this operation has lost market share to fast-growing discount chains and speciality stores. In the shake-up Sears intends to: Sell 80 per cent of its Dean Witter Financial Services subsidiary (which includes the highly profitable securities brokerage and Discover credit card operations) to shareholders and float the remainder on the stock market via an initial public offering (IPO) of stock; Sell to private or public interests all of its Coldwell Banker Residential Services group, which consists of the property brokerage and relocation businesses, Sears Mortgage Corp and Sears Savings Bank; Sell a 20 per cent stake in its Allstate composite insurance subsidiary to the public in an IPO. Sears expects the transactions to be completed by the end of next year, by which time the group will be left to focus on two core businesses: its big merchandise retailing operation, and its 80 per cent interest in Allstate. Mr Edward Brennan, chairman of Sears, said yesterday although its financial services businesses had been successful 'a thorough assessment of today's economic and business climate led us to conclude that refocusing our business strategy, changing our structure, and reducing leverage are all in the best interests of our shareholders and Sears.' The demerger will be seen as a victory for the large group of dissident shareholders who, unhappy with Sears' poor earnings performance, put forward a plan to spin-off the financial services business at the company's annual general meeting in May. News of the restructuring was well received on Wall Street, where Sears shares climbed Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 44 3/4 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Restructure helps Allied Radio cut loss Allied Radio, which operates the licences for Radio Mercury and Mercury Extra in the south-east, cut pre-tax losses from Pounds 901,000 to Pounds 364,000 in the six months to March 31. Mr Brian Rowbotham, chairman, said the improvement followed the successful capital restructuring, resolved at general meetings and now subject only to formal approval of the Scottish court. An underwritten rights issue closed in May with 46 per cent taken up. An 11 per cent dip in turnover on continuing operations to Pounds 1.34m was anticipated at the time of the restructuring which Mr Rowbotham said reflected the new management's policy of restricting advertising minutage in order to improve audience figures, while increasing spot yield rates to advertisers. This strategy had resulted, as budgeted, in revenue in the short term being reduced until the full increase in rates began to take full effect, he added. The chairman said he was confident revenue would accelerate as higher yields were obtained in a more buoyant market, and Allied's broad base of advertisers responded to improved programming and promotion. Losses per share before reconstruction were 0.8p (2.01p) or 0.3p after, on a pro forma basis.</p>

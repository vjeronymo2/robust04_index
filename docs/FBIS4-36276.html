			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ahmad Birru from Sanaa] </F>   [Text] The first cease-fire in the one-month old Yemeni war  lasted only six hours. Sanaa, which announced a cease-fire as  of midnight last night, accused the southern forces of breaking  the cease-fire six hours after it began, according to Foreign  Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah, by southern Air Force raids  against the legitimate forces inside Aden and the areas of  Ma'rib and al-'Abr on the border. The bombing did not result in  any damage to the oil installations. Gunboats also attacked the  legitimate forces in (al-'Arish) near the Aden airport. Sanaa  informed the United Nations, the Arab League, Washington, and  ambassadors of other states of this violation and asked them not  to support those who do not abide by international resolutions.    Addressing a news conference, the Yemeni minister asserted  that Sanaa is still prepared to abide by the cease-fire but  cannot prevent its forces from defending themselves and  confronting any attack against them. Basindwah said that the  forces of legitimacy are present in Aden and have the right to  be in any part of Yemen. Basindwah did not explain if these  forces has actually entered the city.    On the mission of UN envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi, who is expected  in Sanaa tomorrow, Basindwah voiced his confidence that Ibrahimi  will deal with the legitimacy, which no longer needs to set  preconditions because the facts are enough to prove that the  constitutional legitimacy enjoys support in all parts of Yemen.    [Begin Basindwah recording] [Words indistinct] because we  are  confident that His Excellency Lakhdar Ibrahimi, envoy of the UN  secretary general, will deal with the constitutional legitimacy  [word indistinct] in the Yemeni Republic. Of course we no  longer need to set preconditions because the facts are enough to  prove that constitutional legitimacy enjoys support everywhere  in Yemen. The [word indistinct] by the UN Security Council  resolution and the immediate cease-fire. This proves our good  intentions toward international legitimacy and our concern to  respect its resolutions. However, this does not mean that we  will deal with the insurgents after the ruin, destruction, and  bloodshed they caused. This also does not mean that we will  accept that anyone comes here and talks with us or to us about  dismembering Yemen. This is impossible. [end recording]    He also said that the role of the UN envoy will not be at  the  expense of Yemeni unity in any case and that we will not accept  anyone coming here and talking with us about dismembering Yemen.  He said Sanaa's announcement of an immediate cease-fire is  proof of respect for international legitimacy and abidance by  its resolutions.    Asked by Radio Monte Carlo if there is dialogue with certain  Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leaders, the Yemeni minister said:  There are YSP leaders even inside Sanaa and dialogue with them  is being held. These leaders still hold their positions. There  are also elements in Aden and Hadhramaut that we could not talk  to in the past despite their readiness for dialogue.    Asked if there were definite contacts, the minister said  that  he could not reveal if there were contacts of this kind. He  also refused to give any explanations on the external assistance  that the southern leaders might have obtained or name the side  extending this assistance to them.</p>

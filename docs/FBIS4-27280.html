			<p>BFN     [Text] Kumamoto, June 1 KYODO -- The Japan New Party (JNP)  office in Kumamoto, western Japan, has received a threatening  call following an abortive shooting attempt by a right-wing  member against party leader Morihiro Hosokawa on Monday [30  May], police said Wednesday.    Investigative sources quoted the caller as menacingly saying  Tuesday morning that "unlike the rightist in Tokyo, we will not  fire at a ceiling." The office has filed a charge against the  anonymous caller with Kumamoto prefectural police, the sources  said. Police are questioning the president of Seinen Aikokuto,  a right-wing group in Kumamoto.    Hosokawa escaped uninjured after Masakatsu Nozoe, a former  member of the right-wing organization Shokonjuku, fired a gun  toward the ceiling from behind the former premier at Keio Plaza  Hotel in Tokyo, where a party reception was being held. Nozoe,  52, was arrested immediately after the incident.    The suspect said he had no intention of killing Hosokawa but  wanted to "threaten" him for Hosokawa's remarks on Japan's  wartime aggression and his economic program, police sources  said. An investigation revealed that Nozoe had checked into the  hotel under a false name about five hours before the incident,  according to police sources.</p>

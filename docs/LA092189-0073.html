			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINE NOTES: FEWER WINE ADS FOR 1988  </P> <P> Media advertising for wine in 1988 dropped 24% from 1987, and advertising for  wine coolers dropped 34% in the same period, according to the 1989 Jobson's  Wine Marketing Handbook, published annually by Jobson Beverage Alcohol Group.  </P> <P> The handbook showed that only sparkling wine advertising rose in 1988, and the  only medium to show an increase was spot radio.  </P> <P> "Retrenchment was the industry's strategy in 1988," said Seymour Leikind,  publisher of the handbook. He said the wine industry is in transition, with  many of the leading brands "trying to shore up eroding bases."  </P> <P> Gallo, the leading advertiser of wine in the United States, spent $13 million  less in 1988 than in the previous year, with total ad expenditures dropping to  $51 million, Jobson said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cooler Ads Down  </P> <P> The handbook showed that wine cooler ad outlays went from $123 million in 1987  to $81 million in 1988, and 85% of that total came from the industry's Big 3 --  Gallo's Bartles &amp; Jaymes, Seagram's, and Miller Brewing Co.'s Matilda Bay.  </P> <P> The increase in sparkling wine advertising in 1988 was spearheaded by Gallo's  new Tott's and by a campaign for Martini &amp; Rossi Asti Spumante, the  handbook reported.  </P> <P> Jobson is the publisher of Beverage Dynamics, a magazine that reports on the  national alcoholic beverage business, and in the latest issue of that  publication Jobson predicts a 10.9% growth this year in non-alcoholic beer  sales.  </P> <P> The publication notes that Anheuser-Busch is test-marketing a non-alcoholic  beer called O'Doul's and that another non-alcoholic beer called Buckler is  being marketed by Van Munching in eight major cities.  </P> <P> The publication said 6.7 million cases of non-alcoholic beer were sold in the  United States in 1988. The category leader is Kingsbury.  </P> <P> Arbor Crest Winery in Spokane, Wash., announced it would import three wines  produced in the Soviet Union. They are to be priced at about $7 a bottle.  </P></p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Finland to introduce 22% VAT FINLAND plans to introduce value added tax next January, at a general rate of 22 per cent, to help trim government debt and bring the country into line with the European Community, which Finland hopes to join in 1995, Hugh Carnegy writes from Stockholm. Assuming parliament approves, VAT will replace a turnover tax currently levied at the same rate. But it will cover an extended range of services. Exemptions are planned on health, social, educational, banking and insurance services, and on agriculture and forestry.</p>

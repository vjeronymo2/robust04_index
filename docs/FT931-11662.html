			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Israel seeks EC restraint over deportees issue ISRAEL yesterday urged the European Community to show restraint in the Palestinian deportees controversy so as not to disrupt efforts to strengthen bilateral trade ties. Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, made the plea during talks in Brussels which included meetings with Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president and senior EC commissioners, and a dinner with EC foreign ministers. The EC last December condemned the Israeli decision to deport more than 400 Palestinians to Lebanon. Work to update the 1975 EC-Israel trade accord slowed down, but the Community has been reluctant to take additional steps because the Israeli government led by Mr Yitzhak Rabin is viewed as more flexible in the Middle East peace talks than its predecessor led by Mr Yitzhak Shamir. Mr Peres said yesterday that Israel, Egypt, the US and the EC were working jointly to resolve the deportee controversy in a manner 'acceptable to all parties', but he declined to offer details. He noted however that Israel could not comply with present UN resolutions because they made no reference to the Hamas deportees. Mr Peres singled out Israel's willingness to be constructive in an interview yesterday. Recent measures included an end to settlements in the occupied territories, an end to subsidies for Jewish housing in the West Bank and Gaza, and a change in the law banning contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organisation. The Israeli foreign minister said the Egyptians had been very helpful in trying to resolve the row over the deportees. He also invited EC foreign ministers - the so-called 'troika' - to visit Israel, declaring that his government wanted to have a relationship with the Community 'more or less parallel with the US'.</p>

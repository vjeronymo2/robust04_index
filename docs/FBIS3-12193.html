'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, the armed wing of the Islamic  Resistance Movement HAMAS, warned: "Very soon Israel will be in  mourning and put up black flags because 'Izz-al-Din will strike  harder than even the Zionist terrorists can imagine."    Islamic Jihad said: "The blood of the people will not be  shed  for nothing.    "The bullets of the Islamic fighters will be our immediate  answer to the Zionists."    In their statements, the fundamentalists joined the  Palestine  Liberation Organization's call for three days of mourning and a  general strike throughout the occupied territories.    The mosque massacre sparked widespread clashes between  Palestinians and Israeli troops who shot dead nine protestors  and wounded scores more.</p>

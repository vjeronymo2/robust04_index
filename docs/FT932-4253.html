			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Law Society in the dock over its regulatory role: Robert Rice on a case that could have serious implications for SROs THE High Court will today begin hearing a case brought by a 77-year-old woman against the Law Society, the solicitors' professional body, which could have important implications for all self-regulating organisations. Miss Peggy Wood is suing the society for its alleged failure to investigate properly her complaints against her former solicitors after she lost her home and development land. If she wins, the case could set a precedent by deciding that regulatory bodies owe a duty of care to the public in investigating complaints and that they must pay damages to those who suffer loss as a result of their failure to uphold that duty. The society admits it was wrong to dismiss her initial complaint but denies that it owes a duty of care to anyone who loses because of its failure to investigate properly. On Tuesday the High Court ruled that Miss Wood, who had her legal aid withdrawn last November and who lives on income support and so cannot afford a barrister, could be assisted by a 'friend', Mr Ole Hanson, a solicitor and journalist. Because Miss Wood is in poor health and partially deaf Mr Hanson is to be allowed to address the court on her behalf. Normally 'friends' are restricted to taking notes and giving advice. The court ruled that because the case raised issues of public importance a barrister should be briefed by the Official Solicitor as amicus curiae to assist the court with the legal issues raised by her claim. Miss Wood was also given permission to amend her claim against the society to allege conspiracy to injure her cause by the leaking of confidential legal aid information. Her complaint against her former solicitors, Hubbard &amp; Co of Chichester, West Sussex, dates back to 1973 when, left without any income, she consulted Mrs Sylvia Hubbard about obtaining four loans totalling Pounds 10,000 secured against her home. When she was unable to repay the loans the firm acted against her on behalf of the lenders. The main lender, Mobile Homes, was 50 per cent owned by Mrs Hubbard's husband, Joseph, then also a partner in the firm. Miss Wood was evicted and her house sold leaving her with just Pounds 1,400 after all her debts had been paid. Following modernisation, the house and another house built on the land were resold for almost Pounds 200,000. Miss Wood complained to the society of conflict of interest and professional misconduct by Hubbards. The society initially refused to investigate but later issued a reprimand. In 1987 she accepted Pounds 2,500, which had been paid into court, in settlement of her claim for negligence and breach of duty against the firm. The hearing is expected to last two weeks.</p>

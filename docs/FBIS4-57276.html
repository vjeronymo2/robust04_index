			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Daisy Torres from the "Extravision" Newscast] </F>   [Text] On the morning of 11 May at Radio Ya studios, former  President Daniel Ortega answered journalists' questions. During  his visit to Radio Ya today, Daniel Ortega explained that he  hasn't resigned the presidential candidacy because the FSLN has  not nominated him yet. He said he never had any aspirations for  any post.    [Begin Ortega recording] The FSLN has not nominated me. Had  the FSLN said: our candidate is Daniel Ortega or any other  person, then I could have resigned. However, I have not  resigned. I simply said what my revolutionary behavior should  be. I have no aspirations for any post. [end recording]    The FSLN secretary general would not discount the  possibility  that the FSLN would strike an alliance with another party,  except possibly with Mayor Arnoldo Aleman's PLC [Liberal  Constitutionalist Party], because it is a Somocist stronghold.    [Begin Ortega recording] The main thing is to remain  receptive to a policy of alliances. We must also find the right  time to strike an alliance. I believe alliances are a necessity  in forming a government of national unity. I think it is  paramount in promoting [words indistinct], because it is the  only thing that can give this country stability, hope, and a  future. [end recording]    He also talked about the need for a government of national  unity condensed in a program that will listen to people's hopes  for solutions to socioeconomic problems.    [Begin Ortega recording] I believe forging an alliance with  several socioeconomic sectors is essential because these  organized sectors -- namely unions, workers, and producers --  are strong. Producers are organized under UNAG [National Union  of Farmers and Cattlemen] and Cosep [Higher Council of Private  Enterprise]. Workers are organized under the CPT [Permanent  Workers Congress] and other organizations like the Nicaraguan  Workers Federation. Thus, there is a large number of organized  producers and workers interested in the stability of the country  and aware of the need for consensus. I believe this consensus  must and can be reached through a program for national unity.  [end recording]    To allegations from a Sandinist faction that is accusing him  of resorting to violent methods, the former president replied:    [Begin Ortega recording] The FSLN cannot be divided into  violence and nonviolence because the FSLN is a political  organization that makes decisions binding all party members. We  are not a group of people where everyone makes his own  decisions; we are a political force that must have a unified  position. [end recording]</p>

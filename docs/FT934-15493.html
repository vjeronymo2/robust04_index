			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / S Africa open for business: A successful transition depends on the economy MR Derek Keys, South Africa's finance minister, and the ANC president, Mr Nelson Mandela, are taking a joint message to the world: South Africa is back on the international stage, and it is united. Beneath this banner, the two men will be seeking foreign investment at a Confederation of British Industry conference in London today, in an effort to complete a reversal in economic fortunes which has gained momentum with the African National Congress's call for an end to economic sanctions and a new convergence between the ANC and the government on economic policy. The next step is the wooing of foreign investors, with the country needing foreign investment 'more than ever before', according to Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank. The urgency has come with a realisation that a successful political transition is going to depend on improving the dismal growth performance of recent years. The key issue is jobs. In its annual report the Reserve Bank estimates that the portion of the workforce unemployed, or involved in the informal sector of the economy, rose to 46 per cent in 1992, from 39 per cent in 1988. While some argue that this figure is overstated, none disputes that unemployment is a serious contributor to the high levels of violence in the country. Although a better agricultural season, a weaker rand and the mid-year flurry in the gold price should help the economy reverse three years of decline in 1993, there is widespread agreement that only restructuring will produce sustainable high growth. This will involve investing more and spending less, restoring investment as a percentage of GDP to something closer to 25 per cent than the low of 15.9 per cent reached in 1992. It will also require a substantially improved export performance. In the first flush of the post-sanctions era, the air has been positively thick with good will, especially abroad. Back at home, though, the going has been rougher, with the government embroiled in disputes about the issue of cellular telephone licences and a rise in the petrol price. Although the petrol dispute may yet drive the unions to mass action, economic policy is not the war zone it once was. These latest difficulties are much more a reflection of the transitional phase in which South Africa finds itself - in both cases the core objection of the ANC and its trade union ally Cosatu is that they were not adequately consulted - than of serious policy differences. Indeed, the ANC has now turned to soliciting the foreign investor with fervour. In a series of appearances in the US last month, both Mr Mandela and Mr Trevor Manuel, the ANC's economics spokesman, went out of their way to persuade investors that not only would they be 'very, very welcome' (Manuel) in South Africa, but they would not have to fear 'radical policies' (Mandela). As Mr Keys told a Washington investor conference, the 'best move' South Africa's policymakers can make is to equip a government of national unity, which South Africa will have after next April's elections, with a 'credible and attractive' economic policy. He believes South Africa's chances of achieving this are 'very good' and cites four recent events as constituting important steps towards this goal. They are the renegotiation of foreign debt repayments; the revised tariff reduction offer to Gatt in terms of the Uruguay Round of global trade talks; the negotiation of an Dollars 850m (Pounds 563m) loan from the IMF; and agreement on how South Africa will work with the World Bank. Certainly, finalising the debt agreement, and renewing ties with the IMF - South Africa last accessed IMF facilities in 1982 - immeasurably improve the country's creditworthiness. The Gatt offer is also crucial to South Africa's hopes of improving economic growth. All of this is music in the ears of foreign investors hoping for a business-friendly future under a new government. But the past is not far below the surface. It is a source of wry comfort to businessmen that the ANC has now taken to justifying what it describes as anti-trust policy in terms of the 'efficiency of markets' rather than the whites simply having too much.  ------------------------------------------------------     SOUTH AFRICA: AN ECONOMY THAT IS FOCUSING MINDS  ------------------------------------------------------                                 1990    1991    1992  ------------------------------------------------------ GDP growth                      -0.5    -0.4    -2.1 Inflation                       14.4    15.3    13.9 Budget deficit as % of GDP*      0.6     2.5     4.2  ------------------------------------------------------ *For fiscal year ending March 31 Source: Department of Finance  ------------------------------------------------------</p>

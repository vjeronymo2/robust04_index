			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 11.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Adjudication of Issues Associated With Profiling and Reemployment Services <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Participation Requirement.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 303(a)(10), SSA, creates a requirement that ``as a condition of eligibility for regular compensation for any week, any claimant who has been referred to reemployment services *&blank;*&blank;* participate in such services or similar services.'' (Emphasis added.) The Department interprets the phrase ``for any week'' to mean that a claimant must participate in reemployment services (as defined in item 6 above) only during the week or weeks that the claimant is required to attend. Therefore, eligibility with respect to participation in reemployment services is determined on a weekly basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Claimants must be held ineligible for any week in which there is a failure to participate in reemployment services which they are required to attend unless they: have justifiable cause, have completed such services, or are attending similar services, as discussed below. Federal law does not require, however, that the maximum UI benefit amount be reduced. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal law does not require State UI laws to provide for a finding of ineligibility when claimants are no longer required to participate. For example, a claimant may refuse to participate during one week and be held ineligible for that week. If the claimant is required to participate the next week and again refuses, then the claimant will continue to be ineligible. However, if the claimant is not required to participate the next week, then there is no failure to participate and the State is not required to find the claimant ineligible. Similarly, a claimant who has refused to participate in available services and has been held ineligible may later agree to participate. In this case, if the services are no longer available to the claimant, Federal law does not require the claimant to be held ineligible for any additional weeks since there is no longer a failure to participate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is also no failure to participate when the service provider relieves claimants of the requirement that they attend. This may occur when, for example, a claimant notifies a provider of an inability to participate due to a family emergency and the service provider advises the claimant that it is not necessary to participate. (Note: This may raise an availability issue for the week(s) in question. This is why service providers must provide information concerning availability under item 5.b. above.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Claimants are not required to be held ineligible if the failure to participate is minimal and does not significantly affect their ability to benefit from the reemployment services in attempting to obtain new work. For example, if a claimant misses one hour of an eight hour seminar, the State may find that this limited absence is not a failure to participate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Similar Services.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Section 303(a)(10), SSA, a claimant referred under the profiling system is not required to participate in reemployment services if the claimant is participating in ``similar services.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Similar services'' are reemployment services that claimants are attending on their own initiative. Examples of ``similar services'' include, but are not limited to, services offered by a company prior to a permanent layoff or services offered by private employment agencies. The ``similar services'' need not be identical to those to which the claimant was referred by the State; they need be only reasonably similar. The quality of the services being provided should be a relevant factor in determining whether the services are ``similar.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the Secretary's Standard for Claim Determinations, the UI agency is required to obtain and record such information as will reasonably insure the payment of benefits to individuals when due. Therefore, the UI agency must perform sufficient factfinding to determine if, in fact, the services are similar. This means the UI agency must determine, among other things, to what services the claimant was referred and what the ``similar services'' are which the claimant is (or will be) attending. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Exceptions to Participation Requirement.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 303(a)(10), SSA, contains two exceptions to the participation requirement. The first is whether the claimant has completed such services. The second is whether ``justifiable cause'' exists for the claimant's failure to participate in the services. (Note: As indicated in item 11.b, there is no participation requirement if claimants are participating in similar services.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Completion of ``Such Services.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 303(a)(10)(A) provides that a claimant who has completed ``such services'' is not required to participate in services to which the claimant has been referred. How recently the services were completed should be considered in making this determination since, for example, certain approaches to finding a job may have changed due to changing labor market conditions. Although the language ``such services'' appears to refer to those services to which the claimant was referred, it is reasonable to also include the completion of ``similar services.'' Therefore, the Department interprets Section 303(a)(10)(A), SSA, as allowing States to consider the completion of ``similar services'' as the completion of ``such services.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Justifiable Cause.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 303(a)(10)(B) provides that a claimant who has ``justifiable cause'' is not required to participate in services to which the claimant has been referred. As noted in (1) above, although the language ``such services'' appears to refer to those services to which the claimant was referred, it is reasonable to also include the completion of ``similar services.'' Otherwise, claimants attending ``similar services'' would not be relieved of the requirement to participate when justifiable cause exists. Therefore, the Department interprets Section 303(a)(10)(B), SSA, as allowing States to consider justifiable cause as a reason for not participating in ``similar services.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of ensuring consistency with Section 303(a)(10), SSA, States must apply the ``reasonable person'' test in determining if justifiable cause exists for failure to participate. That is, States must determine if the reasons offered by claimants for failure to participate are such that a reasonable person would not have participated. As in other areas where the ``reasonable person'' test is used, such as failure to report to the UI office as required, States must expect the claimants take the actions a prudent and reasonable person would take prior to concluding that participation is not possible. For example, although a reasonable person would not be expected to leave children at home unattended, a reasonable person would also be expected to make an effort to obtain child care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A finding of justifiable cause will last only for the period the justifiable cause is relevant. For example, justifiable cause due to short term illness will last only for the period of the illness. There may be cases when the State determines that the justifiable cause continues for a longer period or through the life of the claim, for example, when the claimant is in approved training under State law. (Note: The Department anticipates that claimants in approved training will not be required to participate in reemployment services while they are in training.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Relation of Participation Requirement to Other State Eligibility Requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Depending on the nature and extent of the reemployment services in which the claimant is participating, States should apply other eligibility requirements in such a way as to not overly burden the claimant. For example, the State may choose to reduce the number of work search contacts required or relieve the claimant of the work search requirement during a period of participation in reemployment services, as appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

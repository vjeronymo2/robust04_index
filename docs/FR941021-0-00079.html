			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Accordingly, as of the effective date of this Order, where the franchising authority is regulating basic rates, increases in basic rates attributable to increases in franchise fees will not be subject to the prior approval requirements for proposed rates increases set forth in &sect;76.933(a)&hyph;(c) of our rules. However, operators will continue to be required to abide by the notice provisions of our rules. When the operator provides the notice to the franchising authority, it must also provide documentation that demonstrates that the rate increase has been properly calculated. We find it unnecessary to prescribe the precise form of this documentation. The operator need not use FCC Form 1210 since Form 1210 was not specifically designated for use in calculating rate adjustments that reflect changes in franchise fees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. As under existing rules, where the Commission is regulating basic service tier rates, operators must give the Commission 30 days' advance notice of any such increase attributable to franchise fee increases. Operators must also give subscribers and franchising authorities 30 days' advance notice of changes in basic rates attributable to increases in franchise fees as required by our rules. In addition, where the Commission is regulating basic service rates, the operator should submit with its filing to the Commission the same documentation which it would need to submit if the franchising authority were regulating basic service rates as outlined above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The franchising authority or the Commission, as appropriate, may then review the pass-through of increases in franchise fees and may order a prospective rate reduction and refunds in accordance with our rules in the event the operator has increased its basic service rates by more than the increase in franchise fees properly allocable to the basic tier. The burden of demonstrating that any such increases are proper shall remain on the operator as with any other rate adjustments. The procedures set forth in &sect;76.933 of our rules will apply to a franchising authority review of rate increases resulting from franchise fee pass-throughs, except that the increased rate attributable to the increased franchise fee will be treated as an ``existing rate'' for the purposes of &sect;76.933. Thus, franchising authorities will have an initial 30-day period, beginning on the date the operator provides notice and supporting documentation, whichever is later, to review the rates. The rate increase will go into effect at the end of this 30&hyph;day period. The franchising authority may extend the period for reviewing rates for an additional 90 days in a non-cost-of-service case or 150 days in a cost-of-service case by issuing a tolling order within the initial 30-day period. It may further extend its period for review by issuing an accounting order prior to the expiration of the 90 or 150 day additional period. See 47 CFR 76.933(a)&hyph;(c). However, during these periods the increased rate is in effect. The procedures set forth in &sect;76.945 will apply to Commission review of rate increases resulting from franchise fee pass-throughs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Franchise fees will continue to be allocated in a manner that is most consistent with the assessment methodology used by franchising authorities. Under &sect;76.924(f) of our rules, a portion of franchise fees may, in some circumstances, be allocated to cable programming service tiers. Operators that have had cable programming service rates deemed unreasonable within the prior 12 months, or some other period specified by the Commission in a particular case, must submit increases in CPS rates attributable to an increase in franchise fees to the Commission for its review. Rate justifications relating to franchise fee-related increases in CPS tier rates will be reviewed by the Commission according to existing rules for Commission review of basic service tier rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. These rule revisions do not change our rules governing rate adjustments attributable to decreases in external costs, including franchise fees. Decrease in franchise fees allocable to either the basic service or a CPS tier will continue to be treated as external cost decreases under our existing rules. Such decreases must be passed through to subscribers within the periods set forth in our rules for passing through decreases in external costs. The operator must provide 30 days' notice to subscribers, the local franchising authority and the Commission, as appropriate. As with franchise fee increases, operators must provide documentation for the amount of the decrease. Consistent with the rules adopted in the Report and Order and Further Notice of proposed Rulemaking, 8 FCC Rcd 5631 (1993) (Rate Order), 58 FR 29736, May 21, 1993, our action herein with respect to the pass-through of franchise fees applies only to the extent there are net increases in the costs imposed on the system operator. Fees may not be passed through to the extent there are other fee changes that offset the increase.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Making good in bad times - Unit Trusts / M&amp;G Dividend THERE CAN be few blue chip companies which have matched the income record of the M&amp;G Dividend fund. Founded in 1964, there has never been a year in which the trust has cut its distribution to unitholders. Since launch, it has grown by a compound 14.7 per cent per annum (including net income reinvested). Someone who initially invested Pounds 1,000 would now be receiving an income of Pounds 564. But like other trusts in the M&amp;G range, things have not been easy over the past five years. The high yield philosophy of the trust means that, like its sister Recovery fund, it tends to invest in weaker companies, which perform badly in recessions. Manager Patrick Harrington says that 1991, the year he took charge, was an awful time for the fund, with many companies in the high yield sector of the market either cutting dividends or simply not surviving. The good news has come since sterling's departure from the Exchange Rate Mechanism which, for the Dividend fund, was a golden, rather than a black, Wednesday. Over the year to November 1 1993, the fund has returned 36.6 per cent (offer-to-bid with net income reinvested: source Micropal) to unitholders. Furthermore, the problems which have faced the Dividend fund have also plagued the rest of the UK equity income sector, so its relative performance looks good. It is 20th out of 106 funds over one year, 17th out of 104 over three, 27th out of 94 over five years and 9th out of 51 funds over the 10-year period. Yield is the first consideration for Harrington when he selects a share. When the trust was first established, it aimed to produce an income 50 per cent higher than that on the All-Share - a very difficult target these days. Nowadays, Harrington only needs to produce a yield which is 10 per cent higher than that provided by the Index. Even that target has caused difficulties for some funds in the UK equity income sector, since it is measured after the manager's annual charge has been deducted. With an annual charge of just 0.75 per cent, compared with a sector norm of 1 per cent to 1.5 per cent, M&amp;G Dividend has found the going easier than most. The fund currently yields 4.07 per cent; Harrington hopes to be able to push up the yield to 20 per cent above that of the All-Share. The recession has made Harrington concentrate on those high-yielding companies which are soundly-financed. 'The problems we have suffered were with companies where the balance sheet was weak.' His favourite situations occur when companies are restructured. 'If new management comes in and shakes things up, performance can be changed quite rapidly,' Harrington says. As with other M&amp;G managers, Harrington is very much a stock-picker. 'One cannot worry about sector weightings because of the yield consideration,' he says. 'For years we had nothing in the low-yielding health and household sector.' At the moment, the fund has quite high weightings in depressed sectors such as food manufacturing. 'In the early 1980s, the trust made quite a lot of money out of restructurings in the manufacturing sector,' he says. Harrington hopes that the same thing might apply to the consumer sector in the 1990s. The 10 largest stocks in the portfolio are: BT, Zeneca, Harrison &amp; Crosfield, BAT, Dalgety, ECC, British Gas, Booker, Commercial Union and T&amp;N. Harrington says that around 50 per cent of the fund is in FT-SE 100 stocks; 25 per cent is in the next 100 (the so-called Tootsie); the remaining 25 per cent is in smaller companies. Even though M&amp;G Dividend, at Pounds 821m, is one of the largest trusts in the industry, Harrington perceives his role on a commendably human scale. 'I run the fund for the old lady in Southport who is living off the income. We try at least to maintain the dividend in real terms,' he says. That has not been possible during the recession, but at least the trust has managed to increase its distributions, when many funds in the sector have been making cuts. Charges. The initial charge is 5 per cent and the annual charge is 0.75 per cent; the bid-offer spread is 5.5 per cent. The minimum investment is Pounds 500, or Pounds 40 a month. Both income and accumulation units are available; distributions are made twice a year. The trust is available in Pep form; minimum investment is Pounds 1,000.</p>

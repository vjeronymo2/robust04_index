			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Miu Oikawa Dieter] </F>   [Text] Beijing, March 20 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa voiced grave concern Sunday [19 March] over  recent situations surrounding North Korea's alleged development  of nuclear weapons, saying the international community's  patience is nearing its limit, Japanese officials said.    Chinese Premier Li Peng said, however, the international  community should try to solve the problem through patient  negotiations, the officials said.    Li was also quoted as saying it is important to call on  North  Korea to accept complete international inspections but giving  North Korea "what it needs" is also important, they said.    The Chinese premier, however, did not specify what North  Korea needs, the Japanese officials said.    During a two-hour meeting at the Diaoyutai Guesthouse,  Hosokawa said Japan has "grave concern" that inspections by the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of North Korea's  nuclear facilities ended insufficiently despite Pyongyang's  accord with the IAEA, and talks between Seoul and Pyongyang  failed because of North Korea's negative stance, the officials  said.    "If this problem goes as it is, the possibility of this  problem being raised in the U.N. Security Council is becoming  high," Hosokawa was quoted as telling Li.    He also said the international community's patience is  "nearing the limit" although Japan, China, the United States and  South Korea have held common acknowledgement that it is best to  solve the problem through dialogue and negotiations.    "Looking at North Korea's stance up to now, the  international  community cannot but feel that it is trying to procrastinate,"  Hosokawa was quoted as saying.    He said it is vital to call on North Korea to accept all  inspections by the IAEA and to exchange envoys between Seoul and  Pyongyang.    Hosokawa also told Li China has an important role to play in  conveying the mood of the international community properly to  North Korea, the officials said.    Li told Hosokawa China supports nonproliferation of nuclear  weapons and also does not wish the emergence of a new nuclear-  possessing country.    He said, however, that by trying to solve the problem  patiently through negotiations "the results will naturally come  out," the officials said.    "It is very important to cope with this problem by taking  more time," Li was quoted as saying.    Since South Korean President Kim Yong-sam is to visit Japan  and China next week, the problem of North Korea's alleged  nuclear weapons is expected to be discussed among Japan, South  Korea and China.    In the talks that covered a wide range of topics, Hosokawa  referred to japan's wartime responsibilities and said he wants  to "foster future-oriented Sino-Japanese relations" based on his  policy speech at the Diet last August.    In the speech, he expressed "deep remorse and apologies for  the fact that past Japanese actions, including aggression and  colonial rule, caused unbearable suffering and sorrow for so  many people."    It was the first time for a Japanese prime minister to use  the words "aggression and colonial rule" in a policy speech in  referring to Japan's actions during World War II. Millions of  Chinese are believed to have died during the Sino-Japanese war  that lasted from 1931 through 1945.    Li welcomed Hosokawa's remarks, telling him it was the "most  frank and sincere attitude" he has ever heard, the officials  said.    Also during the meeting, Hosokawa urged China to make its  military spending "transparent." Li replied that china will  make efforts to increase the transparency, they said.    Hosokawa also told Li that Japan is particularly interested  in extending yen loans to projects involving environment  preservation and agriculture, and in shifting emphasis to inland  china from the coastal regions, they said.    Li expressed concern over Taiwan's "vacation diplomacy,"  alluding to Taiwan President Li Teng-hui's series of visits to  the Philippines, Indonesa and Thailand in mid-February.    The Chinese premier told Hosokawa he wants Japan to cope  with  the matter based on the 1972 Sino-Japan joint communique that  restored diplomatic ties between the two countries.    In the document, Japan endorses Beijing's position that  Taiwan is part of China. China strongly opposes any attempt to  create "two Chinas" and the notion of "One China, One Taiwan."    During the meeting, Hosokawa voiced support for China's bid  to enter the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, while Li  did not openly support Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the  U.N. Security Council, the officials said.    Hosokawa and Li agreed to meet again in Tokyo, they said.    In the cultural field, Hosokawa pledged to provide 1 million  dollars through the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural  Organization (UNESCO) to help preserve the Hanyuan Palace in the  ancient capital of Xian.    Earlier in the day, he visited the monument to the People's  Heroes in Tiananmen Square and placed flowers in front of the  monument.</p>

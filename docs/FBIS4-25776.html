			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 14 (XINHUA) -- U.S. State Secretary  Warren Christopher called Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev today to discuss the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea (DPRK) nuclear issues.    President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin  also had a discussion about DPRK by telephone last night.    The two foreign ministers at the instructions of the  presidents followed up on that conversation today, said Mike  McCurry, State Department spokesman, at a regular news briefing.    Christopher and Kozyrev "obviously discussed Korea at some  length, and particularly the announcement by North Korea  yesterday concerning its status in the International Atomic  Energy Agency," McCurry said.    Both of them "agreed that announcement was most serious," he  said, "They agreed that they would continue their very close  consultations on addressing this issue through our  representatives at the United Nations."    Christopher also discussed the DPRK issue last night in a  phone call with Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, McCurry  disclosed. They had "very productive consultations" on the  issue, he added.    In addition, Christopher and Kozyrev talked about the  Partnership for Peace and Russia's impending decision or  agreement to join the Partnership for Peace.    And finally they discussed Bosnia and the work of the  contact  group, which resumes on Thursday [16 June], the spokesman said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] This morning, the three terrorists who murdered  Li'or Tubul, Ronen Qaramani, Rafi Doron, and Yehoshu'a Friedberg  were given four consecutive life sentences each. Two of them  were given an additional 20 years in prison for attempted  murder. The Jerusalem District Court handed down the sentence  after convicting them upon their own admission.    Our correspondent Mira Amsalem reports that in an  unprecedented move, the president of the court did not allow one  of the defendants to complete his statement before the sentence  was issued in view of the political nature of his remarks, as  the judge put it. After the sentencing, Qaramani's brother  tried to attack one of the murderers, but was stopped.</p>

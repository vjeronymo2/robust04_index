			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zou  Jiahua called for continued nationwide price inspections to  check inflation.    Price rises have slackened recently, but it is necessary to  continue to curb inflation, to stabilize the market and to lower  prices, the vice-premier told a three-day national conference on  price inspection, which closed today in Beijing.    Zou said that the aim of the price reform is to build a  market price system with a reasonable resource distribution and  indirect government control.    To achieve this goal, it is imperative to change the price  formation mechanism, straighten out the price system and reform  traditional price management.    But the vice-premier stressed that even if the price reform  is completed, the government will still exercise controls of  various forms over commodities and services either under state  monopoly or necessary for the public good.    He pointed out that after state controls over prices are  lifted, it is necessary to transform the price mechanism and to  raise the prices of basic products and infrastructural  facilities in a gradual, planned way.    Currently, he said, price hikes are accompanied by fake and  shoddy goods and staggering profiteering. Efforts must be made  to crack down upon these illegal activities, he said.    Zou noted that the relationship between macro-controls over  market prices and economic growth must be handled correctly.    In addition, governments at all levels must pay attention to  price legislation, he said, adding that a price law and  regulations curbing cheating, price gouging for unreasonable  profits and monopolies must be formulated soon.    To check price rises, the State Council, China's cabinet,  will again send inspection groups to provinces and autonomous  regions across the country in mid-June.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  CITIZEN </H8>   Amnesty Issue Viewed -- "The question of amnesty has never  been satisfactorily dealt with," begins the Johannesburg CITIZEN  in English on 30 May in a page-6 editorial. Responding to  recent talk of extending the cut-off date, the editorial writes  that "since we never accepted amnesty for `political' crimes, we  are not enamoured with the idea of any new cut-off date. It  means there will be no end to the political violence if people  or organisations think they can get away with the killing or  maiming of innocent people for `political' reasons." Justice  Minister Omar "says the government is considering a commission  which will facilitate disclosure and acknowledgement within a  framework that provides amnesty, justice and dignity. We hope  that what Mr Omar has in mind is not the `truth commission'  advocated by Mr Justice Richard Goldstone." "We would rather  not have a truth commission but an end to the Goldstone  Commission's probes, an end to trials that can only result in  amnesty, and a final, firm cut-off date that will not be  adjusted."  <H8>  ILANGA </H8>   Action Against ANC's SDUs Urged -- Durban ILANGA in Zulu on  23-25 May in a page-8 editorial says that "the killing of 12  people in Thokoza Township in the past week is an abomination  like all such incidents in the past. This killing happens at a  time when many people in the country had hoped that the violence  would abate following the first democratic election in the  country." "The emerging truth shows that the Thokoza killings  are the result of infighting among members of an ANC brigade  known as the self-defense unit [SDU]. Reports say members of  this unit have turned into thugs fighting for supremacy." "The  ANC must disband this unit as it is now obvious that its members  are mere thugs. If it supplied them with arms, these must now  be taken from them promptly. They are nothing but criminals."  "To those that were pointing fingers at other political groups  over the killing of the 12 people, what have they got to say now  that the truth is out? Let them comment!"    Furor Over Land Issue Viewed -- Durban ILANGA in Zulu on  26-28 May in a page-4 editorial notes that "the matter of land  given to Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini should not be manipulated  to create bad relations within the leadership of the new South  Africa. It should not be used to create unnecessary noise.  Those that do not love peace should not be allowed to use this  matter to create division, more especially now that the violence  that has gripped this country shows signs of abating." "It is  encouraging to hear that President Nelson Mandela and Home  Affairs Minister Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi discussed the matter  amicably." "It must also be remembered that the land given to  His Majesty has always belonged to the Zulu nation. The British  usurped the land from the Zulus when they were conquered.  Actually, there is nothing amiss in the land being given back  to the rightful owners." "Therefore there is no need for any  furor."</p>

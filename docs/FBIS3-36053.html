He is  prosecuted for misappropriation of state property of great  dimensions.    Artavazd Gevorkyan, the general prosecutor of Armenia,  states  the chairman of the Businessmen's Council misappropriated by  means of machinations and forgery more than 34 million rubles.  2000 cartridges were found during his apartment's search.    Myasnik Hakopyan was one of the candidates on the  president's  post.    The parliament's consent was necessary because  Dashnaktsutyun  Party had proposed Hakopyan as a candidate to the Supreme Soviet  of Armenia. Therefore, Dashnaktsutyun demanded his immediate  release and remonstrated at the Office of Public Prosecutor.</p>

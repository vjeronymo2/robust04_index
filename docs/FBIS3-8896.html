			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jaroslaw Palyska: "A Long Way to Europe: Why </F> They Don't Want Us in the European Union"]    [Text] Polish politicians keep setting hopeful deadlines  by which, they believe, Poland should be accepted into the  European Union. Western politicians are much more circumspect  on the subject.    Recently, the European Commission's delegate to Prague,  Gerard Sabathil, presented his views on the question of the  admission of countries from our region of Europe into the  Community: Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic should  indeed join the European Union, but only after they have moved  at least halfway toward the levels of economic development  standard throughout its countries.    Mr. Sabathil must surely be aware of the unrealistic quality  of his suggestion. In the West, GDP figures are at least dozens  of times higher than in Poland. Our GDP amounts to 4.7 percent  of Belgian GNP and 6.1 percent of the German GDP. These  proportions could change even further to our detriment,  considering that, since 1989, our GNP has already fallen by  about 12 percent.    Gerhard Sabathil's words gave rise to a storm of protests.  Wolfgang Roth, SPD deputy and vice president of the European  Investment Bank, accused Sabathil of creating an atmosphere  conducive to another war in Europe. In his opinion, West Europe  must accept the necessity of making efforts to "propel" the  weaker economies of East European countries in order to prevent  a political disaster. "The European Union cannot become some  kind of exclusive `Prosperity Club' for countries that have  inherited Charlemagne's legacy," Roth insists.    The view that the speedy integration of East Europe into the  European Union is a necessity remains an empty declaration.  Reality paints a completely different picture. There are few  honest intentions underlying the facade of fine words.    The European Commission has rolled out the heavy artillery  of  its protectionist policies, which have been hitting our exports  with all their might. The West applies the weapons of  antidumping prices and predetermined limited import quotas.  Steel producers have fought the hardest campaign against goods  exported by the East. It is true that the European Union has  promised a gradual lowering of tariffs on these products, yet it  did not hesitate to introduce antidumping prices against the  Czechs, who, in the opinion of Brussels politicians, were  selling their products at below-production costs. So where is  the alleged free market that has been praised to high heaven by  the same politicians from Brussels?    Not only steel is at issue. There is a large variety of  goods on which import limits or customs tariffs are imposed:  meat, soft fruit, grains, and so on.    The West's resistance is not restricted to erecting economic  barriers against us. Within the European Union itself, there  are politicians hostile to the idea of accepting us into the  Community. The French are terrified that East Europeans could  reinforce Germany's powerful position. The weaker countries,  such as Spain and Portugal, are afraid that East Europe's  accession to the Union will weaken their own importance in the  group.    There is no need to go on at length about the disastrous  effects of such policies. Our countries' share in the trading  figures of West European markets is rapidly decreasing for all  sectors of the economy. Only 1.3 percent of chemical products  sold there come from East Europe; the corresponding figures are  2.7 percent of steel and steel products, and 2.3 percent of  agricultural products.    We on our part are determined to give as good as we get in  our trading with the West, and so we also slap customs tariffs  on imported products and set limits on the quotas on individual  goods (such as, for instance, automobiles).    It is not the purpose of this article just to describe the  consequences of the protectionist policy. However, it must be  said that it is first and foremost the customer who loses by it  because he has no opportunity to choose freely the product that  it would suit him most to buy. When imports are restricted,  prices rise above the levels they would otherwise have reached.  It is the customer who pays the difference. Moreover, the  imposition of customs tariffs is harmful also to companies  themselves because the weaker producers manage to survive in the  market precisely thanks to tariffs. If these were eliminated,  they could move their capital to more cost-effective sectors of  the economy.    There are many more consequences of the protectionist  policy,  and the harmful ones outnumber those that are beneficial. Apart  from our low GDP, what other reasons influence the Brussels  politicians' unwillingness to approve our accession to the  European Union?    In 1990, the average length of the Polish working week was  33.3 hours. In Germany, it was longer by six hours, while in  Austria and Switzerland it was longer by eight hours. In  addition to this, we must remember that, in the West, people  work those longer hours with better machines and equipment. For  the time being, at least, their managerial personnel are also  superior to ours. Consequently, they achieve higher  productivity figures.    Furthermore, the structure of our economy also leaves a lot  to be desired. In the West, the industry sector produces 25-35  percent of the GDP. In Poland, our industry turns out as much  as 40.9 percent of the GDP. It is possible that this is the  result of the strong predilection that our former rulers  manifested for the fire-belching smokestacks of heavy industry.  By contrast, they paid absolutely no attention to the services  sector, which generates the highest proportion of the West's  wealth.    Our agriculture is in a state of complete collapse. Even  though we turn out plenty of agricultural products, this is done  at tremendous expense. Our farms are fragmented in the extreme.  As many as 53.4 percent farms work between 1 and 4.9 hectares  of land, a situation that is practically unknown in the West.  The rural sector employs 27.8 percent of our working population  in Poland, while the corresponding percentages in all countries  between the Odra and the Atlantic are expressed in single  figures. As we can see, here in Poland a whole massive army of  agricultural workers cultivates a large number of small fields.  Given such excessive fragmentation, it becomes not  cost-effective to buy machines and fertilizers or to strive for  higher productivity. Even though farmers keep agricultural  production going, they are forced to do so at such a high price  that they have hardly any money left in the form of decent  profit.    These are merely the basic reasons the European Union does  not want us in its midst. As long as we fail to put our own  economic house and backyard in order, we need not count on  receiving from the West a positive assessment of the possibility  of our admission. It will depend on nothing but our own work  whether we catch up with the wealthier countries. And we had  better believe that no one is going to help us with it. We are  forced to rely on ourselves and ourselves alone.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper smelter to expand capacity PRODUCTION CAPACITY at Spain's Huelva copper smelter will be expanded by 20 per cent, from 150,000 tonnes of metal to 180,000 tonnes, by 1995 under the terms of a deal for Freeport McMoRan, the US natural resources group, to take a majority shareholding. The smelter is the principal asset of Rio Tinto Minera and Freeport will pay about Dollars 54m for a 65 per cent interest in RTM, subject to several conditions being satisfied. The deal is an important element in Freeport's strategy for its rapidly-growing copper-gold complex in Indonesia. The US group is also involved in a Dollars 545m copper smelter project in Indonesia, of which Metallgesellschaft of Germany would be the majority shareholder and operator. Freeport would supply only half that smelter's concentrate (an intermediate material) so it has been looking for more 'captive' smelting capacity and the Spanish plant, which at present treats about 450,000 tonnes of concentrates a year, fits the bill. RTM at present is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ercros, the troubled industrial group 39-per-cent-owned by the Kuwait Investment Office's Spanish holding company. Freeport's Indonesian subsidiary has agreed to sell some of the present infrastructure and some still to be built at its mining complex in the highlands of Irian Jaya to the ALatief Corporation for about Dollars 200m. ALatief has retail, property management, real estate, manufacturing, agriculture and hotel operations in Indonesia. Freeport says in future ALatief will provide a major part of the non-operating services to its mining operations.</p>

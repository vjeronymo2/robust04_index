			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Schools may teach first year of degree courses Former polytechnics have stepped up their campaign to recruit high-quality students by developing plans with independent schools for pupils to take the first year of their degree course while they are still at school. The plans are still at an early stage, and would not come into force for at least two years, but they signify a bold attempt by the 'new' universities to recruit pupils who would normally be earmarked for more traditional centres of excellence such as Oxford and Cambridge. The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, which represents all UK universities, confirmed that talks were under way with the Headmasters' Conference - which represents leading independent boys' and mixed schools - to allow some pupils to take units towards a degree in their final year at school. They would then complete their normal BA or BSc degree after two years at the university, and spend the third year earning a masters' degree. Studying degree-level courses alongside A-levels would be demanding, but many independent schools could use their experience of teaching pupils for 'fourth-term' entry to Oxford and Cambridge, which also requires more advanced teaching alongside A-level. Schools had complained that pupils often spent their first year at university repeating work they had already done. The initiative, which has been taken only by new universities, is intended to solve the problems. Mr John Patten, the education secretary, has not been directly involved in the talks, but education department officials said that he was enthusiastic about the plans. New universities failed to meet their targets for student numbers last year, with numbers recruited falling by 1 per cent. 'Old' universities, against which the former polytechnics competed for the first time, expanded their intake by 7 per cent. Former polytechnics had invested heavily in new corporate identities and advertising, with De Montfort University - one of the leaders in the plans for degrees in schools - spending Pounds 500,000 on a press and television advertising campaign. Another recent proposal from new universities which are anxious to boost intakes involved setting their own entrance exams, to avoid heavy reliance on A-levels, and to give applicants an earlier decision.</p>

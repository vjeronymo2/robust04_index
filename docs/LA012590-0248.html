			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: DAWN STEEL WALKS AWAY WITH NIFTY $6.4 MILLION  </P> <P> How would you feel about $6.4 million -- which is what the first female movie  tycoon of any real effect -- Dawn Steel -- is said to have walked away with in  all those recent maneuvers whereby Sony bought Columbia Pictures? (The Japanese  quickly installed Jon Peters and Peter Guber in Dawn's place.)  </P> <P> Well, I feel darned good about it. Dawn deserved a great settlement and the  profit on her Columbia stock. She did a wonderful job, taking over in the wake  of British movie man David Puttnam. And Dawn didn't even get to stay at  Columbia long enough to prove all she might have been able to accomplish.  That's OK, she made a good high-water mark.  </P> <P> STEEL REFUSES to confirm or deny the amount quoted above. But she gave an  interview to the London Daily Mail's reporter with the great name -- Baz  Bamigboye -- and this is the figure he offers. I think it's right in the  ballpark.  </P> <P> Baz said Dawn is glad her job as head of Columbia is over. He quotes her: "The  work became very administrative and not at all about being creative and making  movies. I wasn't making the movies. I was making the deals, overseeing the  marketing and the budgets -- and it wasn't what I was about.  </P> <P> "I said to a friend the other day that I couldn't remember the last time I had  a haircut or sat down and read a book for ME and not for work. More  importantly, I feel now it's crucial to have time to yourself, time to  daydream. It made me feel resentful that I didn't have it. I felt I had become  a drudge. And that's awful. I began to feel like I was selling cars."  </P> <P> Regarding her tough reputation, Dawn remarks, "Look, I'm not Mary Poppins, but  I think I functioned with integrity. And it's true that I am demanding of  myself and of the people who work for me. Now I'm going to think about my  future. I've had offers, but I'm taking time off to dream."  </P> <P> THEY CAN'T keep Jackie Mason down, not even if ABC cancels his TV series  "Chicken Soup," not even if he is criticized for things he said about Mayor  David Dinkins of New York when he (Jackie) was working for Rudy Giuliani during  the recent campaign.  </P> <P> Jackie opens at Joe Papp's distinguished Public Theater in New York Saturday  night for a week of previews of his new one-man show, to be called "Jackie  Mason . . . Brand New."  </P> <P> In March, Jackie will be appearing at London's Palladium; in the spring he'll  tour three or four big U.S. cities and then head back to the Great White Way --  again.  </P> <P> FRANK SINATRA'S office confirms that the man will present a hot new talent in  the coming Sinatra summer concerts in London. The newcomer is Brendan Grace,  said to be one of Ireland's funniest men but mostly unknown outside his own  country.  </P> <P> The way it happened: Sinatra was in Dublin for concerts last summer. He asked  someone to arrange for him to see some Irish artists at a party in a Dublin  pub. Grace came in with a 20-minute show in which he said at one point, "I  thought I was entertaining Perry Como." Sinatra laughed like crazy and invited  Grace to share his stage next July.  </P> <P> THEATER and movie folks are extending love and sympathy to the grand actor Alan  Bates, who is heartbroken over the death of his son, Tristan. The boy, living  with his twin brother, Benedick, for modeling assignments in Tokyo, dropped  dead of a heart attack. He was only 18. Bates and his wife, Victoria, went to  Japan and took the body back to England.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- The first and second  issues of the South Korean magazine HUMAN RIGHTS of 1994  reported that the South Korean headquarters for the promotion of  the repatriation of old Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan which was  formed in June last year has conducted brisk activities  demanding the repatriation of these two old men, long-term  prisoners who have refused to be converted.    This headquarters involves the human rights committee of the  Council of Christian Churches, human rights committees of Roman  Catholic and Buddhist organisations, the bar association for a  Democratic Society, the Council of Family Movement for Realising  Democracy and other civilian human rights organisations, and  human rights committees and dissident organisations in Taejon  and Kwangju.    After its inauguration, it sent appeals to the South Korean  "minister of the Unification Board" and presidents of the  International Red Cross and of the South Korean Red Cross,  strongly demanding the repatriation of the two unconverted  long-term prisoners to the northern half of Korea.    A statement of the headquarters carried in the magazine  HUMAN  RIGHTS said old Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan must have been  repatriated at the time of exchange of POWs according to the  Geneva Conventions because they were taken prisoners during the  war, but they had been submitted for trial by the  "court-martial" and made to suffer in prison for scores of  years. It strongly urged the South Korean authorities to return  the two old men to the North as soon as possible.</p>

			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON;  </P> <P> NO-BUSING INITIATIVE APPROVED IN SEATTLE  </P> <P> An initiative asking the Seattle school board to halt busing of students to  achieve racial balance was declared approved, by a margin of 50.4% to 49.6%,  after absentee ballots were counted. The unofficial count in last Tuesday's  election had it losing by 70 votes. The school board must vote on whether to  implement the initiative. If it does, schools will receive about $4.5 million a  year from sales taxes for "magnet" school programs designed to achieve  voluntary integration. However, rights organizations have vowed to sue if the  board does approve the initiative. No vote has been set.  </P></p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / People: Progenitor joins ICI Bioscience The man from SG Warburg who played a central role in advising the planned break-up of ICI is joining the chemicals and pharmaceuticals company next week and will become finance director of ICI Bio-science in January when ICI Bio is split from ICI. John Mayo, 36, a corporate finance director at Warburgs, ICI's lead banker, was called in at the beginning of the year to look at the various options for ICI - which, at the time, was hard-pressed by the 2.8 per cent stake Lord Hanson had taken in the company. The plans for the split, the largest demerger ever in the UK, were announced at the end of July. Mayo will report to David Barnes, 56, a main board director and long-serving ICI man, who has been named as the chief executive of Bioscience. The appointment marks another departure from the conglomerate's tradition of producing its own senior executives. While Mayo is not coming on to the board, his will be a senior position, and among current directors, only Colin Short, finance director, joined from outside in 1990. Before that, the last external appointment was Sir Paul Chambers (chairman from 1960-1968) in the 1950s. 'Times are different now,' says ICI, partly reflecting the changes wrought by the presence of Hanson - which sold its stake in May. Mayo, a graduate in economics and economic policy from Loughborough University, joined Arthur Andersen in 1978 as an articled clerk. Six years later he moved to Warburgs.</p>

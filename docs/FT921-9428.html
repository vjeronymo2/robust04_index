			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Parliament approves Taurus changes LEGAL changes needed to bring in the UK's planned paperless settlement system, Taurus, finally received parliamentary approval on Monday night, a year after they were originally due to be adopted. The completion of the legal process opens the way for British companies to seek the support of their shareholders to 'dematerialise' - that is, transfer their shares on to the new system. However, the timing of the regulations means that it is too late for many of the British companies that have annual meetings early this spring to seek shareholder support this year. The London Stock Exchange said it was talking to a number of companies which it hoped would be in the first wave to move on to Taurus at its planned launch in April 1993. The law changes are necessary to reflect the way title to shares passes in a paperless stock market, rather than under the existing system. Amending company law proved far more complex than had been expected, and led to substantial delays before draft regulations were able to be published last summer. These met considerable opposition in the investment industry, and were subsequently simplified before being put to Parliament. Much of the detail contained in the original draft regulations is due to be reproduced in a separate stock exchange rule book, expected to be published in draft form in May. Mr Andrew Hugh Smith, the exchange chairman, said this would 'allow greater flexibility in the future than would have been possible if everything had been contained within the regulations'.</p>

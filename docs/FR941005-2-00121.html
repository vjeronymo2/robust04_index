These procedures are set forth in order that they may be incorporated by reference in future individual meeting notices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ACRS is a statutory group established by Congress to review and report on applications for the licensing of nuclear power reactor facilities and on certain other nuclear safety matters. The Committee's reports become a part of the public record. The ACRS meetings are normally open to the public and provide opportunities for oral or written statements from members of the public to be considered as part of the Committee's information gathering procedures. The meetings are not adjudicatory hearings such as those conducted by the NRC's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel as part of the Commission's licensing process. ACRS full Committee meetings are conducted in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> General Rules Regarding ACRS Meetings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An agenda is published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for each full Committee meeting.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ramon Oriol: "Santander Pursues Its American </F> Adventure"]    [Editorial Report] The Spanish bank is going to  increase its ownership in the First Fidelity Bank, which is  going to take over a fifth bank, the Baltimore Bancorp, and  reinforce its position on the U.S. market.    Before the end of the year, Banco de Santander will increase  its ownership in the First Fidelity Bank from 22.7 percent to  24.9 percent, exercising all the warrants it expects to receive  from the agreement it signed in 1991. At the same time, First  Fidelity just acquired the Baltimore Bancorp, a Maryland bank  with branches in Virginia, Delaware, and North Carolina, for  $346 million. It is the fifth bank acquired by First Fidelity  during the last i2 months, after Northeast Bancorporation,  Village Financial of New York, People's Westchester, and the  First People National Bank.  <H5>  Three Types of Activities To Be Developed </H5>   Last summer the Banco de Santander requested permission from  the Federal Reserve to operate as an investment bank and stock  brokerage on the U.S. financial market through its affiliate  Santander Securities, Inc. If the [Federal Reserve] response  turns out to be positive, the bank group will invest $20 million  in the capital of this affiliate. Banco de Santander wants to  develop three types of activities on the U.S. market: to  negotiate government securities and corporate stocks from Spain,  Italy, Portugal, and South America; support companies in stock  operations, mergers and reorganizations; and develop an active  presence on the futures and options market. The Banco de  Santander explains that the activity of its affiliate will be  carried out as a priority in cooperation with institutional  investors.    If the Federal Reserve gives its green light, the Banco de  Santander will be the first Spanish bank to operate as an  investment bank and stock brokerage on the U.S. market. The  bank group is already the first Spanish group on the U.S. market  in terms of its assets, which have reached $8.127 billion--$3.5  billion alone for the Banco Santander Puerto Rico affiliate.  Since August 1993, the bank also has owned 89.3 percent of the  Kemper Corporation, which fulfills for Santander today the role  which the new affiliate will play tomorrow. In fact, Santander  intends to acquire the stock brokerage business of the U.S.  group. Since 1982, Kemper Securities has lost $207 million.  The commercial bank, Santander de Negocios, also helps Kemper  manage the investment fund, The Growth Fund of Spain.    All these operations will in the future be subject to the  fate of the Banesto reorganization of its operations on the  American continent and on their eventual integration into the  Santander network.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The estimates of secondary migration were based on data submitted by all participating States on Form ORR&hyph;11. The total migration reported by each State was summed, yielding in- and-out-migration figures and a net migration figure for each State. The net migration figure was applied to the State's total arrival figure, resulting in a revised population estimate. Because the reporting period covered on Form ORR&hyph;11 was a maximum of only 8 months as of June 1993 for the majorigy of States whose reporting base was their cash/medical assistance caseload, extra weight was given to the secondary migration reported by those States to arrive at estimates of secondary migration over a 36-month period. In 1993, no count of recently-arrived refugee children was available from the Department of Education for use as a comparison. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Estimates were developed separately for refugees and entrants and then combined into a total estimated 3-year refugee/entrant population for each State. Eligible Amerasians are included in the refugee figures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table 1, below, shows the estimated 3-year populations, as of October 1, 1993, of refugees (col. 1), entrants (col. 2), and total refugees and entrants (col. 3); the formula amounts which the population estimates yield (col. 4); and the proposed allocation amounts after allowing for the minimum amounts (col. 5). Table 1 also shows the number of former political prisoner arrivals in FY 1993 (col. 6); and the allocation amounts for services to this population (col. 7). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These population estimates and proposed allocation amounts are intended to be as close to the final figures as was possible at the time they were developed. However, revisions may need to be made, based on data submitted by States in accordance with Section VI of this notice, and all population estimates and allocation amounts may change somewhat as a result. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A detailed explanation of the development of data used in this formula allocation can be obtained by writing to the address indicated in Section VI of this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Proposed Allocation Amounts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Funding will be contingent upon the submittal and approval of a State annual services plan. The following amounts are proposed for allocation for refugee social services in FY 1994: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

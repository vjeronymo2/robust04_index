			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Ford to offer free mobile phones Ford will add a new dimension to the fierce battle for new car sales by offering a free mobile telephone and connection to the Cellnet network with almost every new car and van sold from October 18, John Griffiths writes. The company, which is spending Pounds 4m to promote the offer, said it expects at least 100,000 buyers a year to take up the offer - about one in five of new Ford vehicle customers. Mr David Thomas, Ford of Britain's marketing plans manager, acknowledged yesterday that the UK mobile telephone market was a 'jungle' with offers of 'free' handsets typically offset by very high line rental and call charges. However, Ford is an airtime provider itself and says that its line rental and charges are competitive with the rates charged for handsets costing more than Pounds 175.</p>

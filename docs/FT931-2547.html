			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Zaire political crisis deepens Zaire had two rival prime ministers yesterday after President Mobutu Sese Seko carried out his threat to dump pro-opposition premier Etienne Tshisekedi, Reuter reports from Kinshasa. A 'political conclave,' convened by Mr Mobutu but boycotted by the Sacred Union opposition alliance, named Mr Faustin Birindwa as prime minister on Wednesday night. The appointment was a direct challenge to Mr Tshisekedi, who was sacked by Mr Mobutu last December but refused to accept the president's authority. His stand was backed by a majority of Zaire's interim parliament, the High Council of the Republic (HCR), and by the governments of the US, Belgium and France.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Iryna Syarohina: ``Are Sun, Air, and Water Our </F> Enemies?'']    [Text] Nowadays, life expectancy in Belarus is one of the  shortest in the world.    According to Academician I.I. Lishtvin, secretary of the  Belarusian Academy of Sciences and director of the Institute for  Ecology and Use of Natural Resources, this is connected not only  with the aftermath of the catastrophe at the Chernobyl Nuclear  Power Plant. We have already interfered in biological processes  of nature to such an extent that further development of  civilization requires special measures. Thus, for instance,  while reclaiming a marsh, nobody thought about the harm to the  atmosphere -- 1 hectare of marsh equalizes 5 hectares of forests  for absorbing pollutants from the atmosphere. Purity of the  atmosphere is an issue of great importance especially now, when  the stream of cars used in the Republic has increased.</p>

			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Warning over lack of cover for exporters EXPORTERS will suffer a 'substantial competitive disadvantage' unless the government rejoins other European states in providing exporters with reinsurance against political risks, such as coups, warns Trade Indemnity, the UK credit insurance group. In a report to the Department of Trade and Industry, published esterday, Trade Indemnity calls on the government to work in partnership with private insurers to provide reinsurance cover at commercial rates. It calls for this cover to be extended to all private-sector insurers able to work in the field - a criticism of the competitive advantage of NCM Credit Insurance, its main UK competitor. As part of a privatisation deal two years ago NCM was granted transitional access to reinsurance cover in spite of the government's withdrawal from short-term export credit insurance. NCM's transitional support is due to run out at the end of next year. Mr Colin Foxall, NCM's managing director, has called for the facility to be made permanent. The Trade Indemnity report complains that the UK is the only leading industrial nation not providing state-backed insurance or reinsurance for short-term credit risks, which account for 90 per cent of UK exports. As a result UK exporters are likely to face difficulties in getting political risk cover when the NCM transitional support ends. The report challenges government hopes that private sector reinsurers would emerge to fill the vacuum formed by its withdrawal from reinsurance activity. Even without the recession and a string of natural disasters that have brought two bad years for reinsurers, it argues that the private sector would lack capacity. The report says leading reinsurers, including Swiss Re and Munich Re, are 'adamant' that no further capacity can be provided. It adds: 'Even Lloyd's is flagging drastic reductions in available capacity. Insurance of 90 per cent of the UK's exports now hinges on the balance sheet strength of TI and NCM and their respective reinsurers.' Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday launched a Business in Europe campaign aimed at alerting companies to export opportunities in the single market and providing streamlined help. This will include the secondment from the private sector of 20 executives.</p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Oil on the rocks again When the Braer, the Liberian registered oil tanker, smashed onto the rocks of the Shetland Isles in January 1993, spilling 85,000 tonnes of crude oil, the public and MPs understandably called for immediate measures to prevent such a disaster occuring again. Lord Donaldson's 500-page report into the implications of the wreck for merchant shipping, published yesterday, says that the call should be heeded. The picture Donaldson paints is of an industry in near-crisis: suffering from 'vast overcapacity', slender or non-existent profit margins, and an unwieldy system of safety regulation. His team was 'shocked', it says, to discover that there had been 67 incidents potentially as serious as the Braer in UK waters last year. Of the team's 103 recommendations, the main one - more regular inspections by ports of ships' maintenance - appears both to be workable and to stand a chance of improving safety standards. Under this proposal, European ports would delay the granting of permission to load and unload cargo for ships which did not comply with inspections. Donaldson is right to identify maintenance standards as the heart of the industry's poor safety record. He avoids, too, the temptation of calling for further changes in ship design. There is no evidence that the double-layer hulls incorporated in new tankers since 1993, in response to the Exxon Valez disasters off Alaska, would have saved the Braer. Public concern However, Donaldson's recommendation that the UK should surround itself with a network of salvage tugs to help struggling tankers appears more of a gesture to public concern - and potentially an expensive one - than an effective policy. Tugs were available to tow the Braer, but the captain delayed in alerting them. Similarly, the report's endorsement of the costly practice of spraying oil slicks with detergent to disperse them is open to challenge. Environmentalists say the detergents are as harmful to marine life as oil pollution, while one of the lessons of the Shetlands is that the force of the waves can be the most effective tool for dispersing pollution. However the report's most serious omission is its failure to find more ways, in its own words, 'to make it unprofitable to cut corners'. The key is tackling the shortcomings of the present international rules on liability for shipping pollution. The Torrey Canyon spill in 1967 gave birth to the Civil Liability and Fund Conventions, under which shipowners limit their liability for oil spills to several hundred million dollars. Two voluntary compensation regimes known as Tovalop and Cristal, financed partly by levies on the oil industry, cover countries which have not signed the conventions. Liability limits Maximum liability under these schemes has been rising steadily - by more than 20 per cent under Tovalop and Cristal for the current year. A further rise in liability limits should be encouraged, given that the sums still amount only to a tiny fraction of the costs of cleaning up. That is not to back the scale of liability in the US, where Exxon has already paid more than Dollars 2bn for the Valdez incident. Pitched at too high a level, insurance rates soar and pressures on a struggling industry intensify. What is needed is something midway between the global voluntary schemes and US. Governments also need to find replacements for the voluntary schemes, which expire in February 1994, or press more countries to ratify the conventions. The low level of compensation for non-oil pollution - which runs at only about 20 per cent of that for oil - represents another troubling gap in the present regime. The Donaldson report focuses mainly on measures within the UK government's control. But, as it recognises, most of the toughest problems are international in cause. That is the arena in which solutions need to be framed.</p>

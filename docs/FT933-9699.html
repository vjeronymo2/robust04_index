			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Rites of Summer: The creak of ageing willow AS WE ALL know, modern professional cricketers arrive at the crease clad in armour only slightly less impressive than that of a Chieftain tank. But their eyes are keen, their reactions electric. The wickets they play on are pedantically manicured, regular to a fault. So the need for bodily protection, at the professional level, is not great. The players who really need the helmets, thigh-pads and tungsten-reinforced boxes are the cricketers who only turn out once a year. Their co-ordination is rotten. They bat on a sloping surface of stubs, divots and grasses well-known to connoisseurs of set-aside. They face bowlers who tickle the divots with one delivery, and with the next fling a full-toss at the cranium. But what thoughts of their own human frailty are entertained by these occasional players? None. Not even a copy of The Economist strapped to the thigh. From an ancient brass-bound trunk, the occasional cricketer roots out a pair of wickerwork pads, a shrivelled felt cap in the old school colours, and a bat of brittle willow, which in the event of striking the ball cleanly sends massive reverberations around the frame of whoever wields it. It is a sort of summer madness that allows the occasionals to take to the field like this, and a peculiar hubris that makes a man believe that cricketing skills, once instilled, are enduringly residual. If asked by his captain to take a couple of overs, the occasional cricketer likes to think that his dormant skills are readily on tap. A half-dozen wides and no balls ensue; but he feels the old line and length reasserting themselves. Looking down at the flannels last laundered a year ago, he pastes one side of the ball with spittle and gets a red rub going. Where is that pleasing hiss of velocity which once sang in his adolescent ears? The toll for this foolish pride is exacted the next day. And every morning, probably, for the next week. Yet it is guaranteed that when the call comes round the following year - Accounts vs Sales; a provocative Aussie raising his compatriots from their bar stools; a visiting trade delegation from Swaziland or Swat - the occasional cricketer will blot out the memories of pain. To decline the tussle remains beyond him: this is the bond of boyhood on middle age. So the madness persists. For those prone to it, I can only offer these salient rules: 1) Batting. In spite of the foregoing, in occasional cricket it is always easier to face fast bowling than slow. The captain may flatter you by saying: 'You shall be our Beefy.' Your sobriquet may only be earned by a succession of what are generically known as cow-shots. But in occasional cricket, fast bowling is rarely aimed at the wicket, and any of the following strokes should speed past a naturally inert wicket-keeper towards the boundary: the startled nick, the shy flourish, the speculative prod and the crisply mistimed slash. 2) Bowling. Let others go for pace. Vaguely say that you will do 'a modified googly, coming round the wicket.' Float something towards the batsman on his leg side. Make each delivery follow its own singular flight path. There is an art to doing this without actually bowling a wide. You may get struck out of the ground, but more likely the batsman will swipe and scythe at a conglomeration of pure air. 3) Fielding. It is desirable to take up a position neither too near to the batsman nor too far. The dangers at close quarters need not be specified. But those idle sportsmen who imagine that they can hover at some tropical reach of the boundary and peruse their Joanna Trollope without disturbance require a caution. True, the ball rarely speeds out that far. But when it does, be warned. The throwing arm does not survive a desk-bound life, and nothing is more humiliating to middle-aged virility than having to return a cricket ball to the crease with a series of three, or even four, successively pathetic lobs.</p>

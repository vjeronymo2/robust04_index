Chadian Interior Minister Abderamane Izzo  yesterday accused the CSNPD leader, Moise Kette, of being  responsible for the failure of recent talks in Bangui. Moise  Kette, in return, blames the failure of the Bangui talks on the  government in an interview with Raphael Mbadinga.    [Begin recording] [Kette] Ndjamena blames us for the failure  of the roundtable negotiations. We categorically reject this,  as we think that it is Ndjamena which is to blame for the  failure. We raised the real problem which has been tearing Chad  apart for over 30 years: the form of the state. Each time we  raise this problem, the government delegation retreats behind  the idea of sovereignty so that it will not have to discuss the  issue, although it well knows that this is the problem which has  been undermining the country for 34 years.    [Mbadinga] Will the negotiations resume shortly?    [Kette] I think the mediating parties are maintaining  contacts with the two parties and each party has gone back to  its base to receive fresh instructions before coming back to the  negotiating table. As far as we are concerned, for the Chadian  problem to be definitely resolved we would prefer that all other  political- military forces -- political parties and civil  associations -- take part in the second meeting so that we bury  the hatchet once and for all.

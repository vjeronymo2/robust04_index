			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Italians face tough task, says Savona Mr Paolo Savona, the Italian industry minister, has warned that the country's steel industry faces a tight timetable to comply with the agreement reached last week by EU ministers to cut steel capacity. The warning comes in spite of Italy obtaining a better deal than had been expected. Government subsidies to the state-dominated steel sector and Italy's consistent refusal to reduce capacity has been the most serious source of friction on industrial policy between Rome and Brussels for more than three years. The agreement, endorsed last Friday by EU industry ministers, involved Brussels accepting that Ilva, the Italian state steelmaker, envisages a reduction of 2m tonnes in overall Italian steel capacity. The concession accepted by Brussels was that this cut be spread between the state and private sector instead of wholly on Ilva. The EU ministers also accepted that L500bn (Pounds 201m) in tax credits for Ilva would not be treated as subsidies. Though pleased at being able to keep alive a third production line of flat products at Ilva's Taranto complex, the biggest steel works in Europe, Mr Savona warned Italy was under tight surveillance. The first inspection of a special monitoring commission would be in March. If the timetables were not met and Italy failed to proceed with its planned privatisation of Ilva, the agreement could unwind. There would then be no further opportunity for the EU to endorse a state-aided solution to the losses in the steel industry. The Italians also said they would watch the position of the British and Danish governments which have pledged to placed the deal before their respective parliaments. The agreement paves the way for Ilva's privatisation, with the group being split into two - one for flat products, the other for special steels. Mr Savona said he expected that Iri, the state holding and Ilva's proprietor, should obtain L4,100bn from the sale, due to be competed by the end of 1994. In tandem with the privatisation process, the government now has to address the problems of several loss-makers in the private sector and establish how at least 500,000 tonnes of annual capacity is to be cut. Mr Savona said that some 3m tonnes of steel was being produced by companies with problems. The government's problems with Ilva's workforce and especially its sub-contractors are also unlikely to be resolved easily. Between 10,000 and 12,000 jobs are expected to be lost at Ilva, over a quarter of the workforce. The Bagnoli plant at Naples has been closed for two years but occupied for most of this time by workers hoping the plant could be saved. At Taranto 170 workers employed by sub-contractors forced the plant almost to shut down on two days last week.</p>

			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> A CAPABLE WATLEY SLICK, ENTERTAINING AT WILTERN  </P> <P> Mostly through the avenue of music video, Jody Watley has already proven  herself one of the most watchable women in pop -- thanks not only to her  model-like physique, cheekbones that won't quit and those lips/those eyes, but  also to real singing and, especially, dancing talents.  </P> <P> In her local headlining debut Saturday at the Wiltern Theatre, Watley showed  that it's not just camera angles and editing techniques propping up her  popularity: She's been as blessedly created for the concert stage as she was  made-for-MTV.  </P> <P> Opening in a red halter and bell bottoms (to be replaced in later costume  changes with more lacy things) and adorned in swinging crosses, Watley looked a  little like a skinny Madonna at first. As a hoofer, Watley easily comes out on  top of that competition; Madonna would kill to move with such relentless ease,  for the way all of Watley's jerky, high-energy, go-go flair never betrays her  innate grace. Two terrific female dancer/singers added immensely to the sharply  and wittily choreographed fun.  </P> <P> Like Donna Summer, Watley the singer is at her sexiest in the low range that  she too rarely dips into (as in "Still a Thrill," her best single to date).  There's a sameness to much of her pop-funk material, but her unassuming  presence, if not necessarily her voice, redeems much of it. She's as sexy as  they come, but never raunchy, and her winning smile and her penchant for  offsetting those model-ish poses with daringly gangly moves make her a little  less aloof, even as you dare not take your eyes from her charismatic visage.  </P> <P> Still, there was a slight hollowness to the victory. For all the songs she  sings about "commitment," Watley falls shy of making the biggest commitment of  all to her audience: self-revelation.  </P> <P> Superior as she is to most in her genre, Watley is beginning to seem a little  less special as vivacious upstarts like Nenah Cherry and Gail Ann Dorsey appear  on the scene. To paraphrase a line from Cherry's current hit, you end up  asking, "What is she like, anyway?"  </P> <P> That you leave Watley's slick, consistently entertaining show without feeling  that you really know one way or another is a drag, and whether she can  eventually transform the watchable into the personable may well determine her  professional longevity.

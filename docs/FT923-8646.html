			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Observer: An age old problem Why is it that some big companies are so reluctant to publish the age of their directors and how long they have been on the board? Surely shareholders shouldn't have to turn up at the agm just to check whether their representatives are in their forties or their eighties. Marks &amp; Spencer, for example, is one blue-chip company, which maintains a discreet silence on the subject. No wonder its annual report doesn't win the same accolades as its merchandise. Lord Forte, an executive director and chairman of Britain's largest hotelier, is in his 84th year and has been a director for over 50 years, although you couldn't tell it from his company's annual report. Nor can you tell whether Forte's board is packed with young turks or elderly time servers. By contrast, Land Securities, one of the few solid pillars in the property world, makes no secret of the fact that one of its directors, 78-year-old Richard Caine, has been on its board since 1948. Old men have their uses, and Land Secs deserves to be congratulated for its openness in reporting its affairs. Meanwhile, Observer offers a bottle of finest malt to anyone (Forte directors excepted) who can prove that they are the longest-serving director of a FT-SE 100 company.</p>

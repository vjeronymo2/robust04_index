			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lifeline thrown to Welsh cockle gatherers THE THREAT of closure hanging over one of Wales's most ancient industries appears to have been removed. The cockle gatherers of Penclawdd had feared that new EC hygiene directives, due to come into force on January 1, would effectively put them out of business, summarily ending their centuries-old trade. But the government now seems to have thrown them a lifeline, at least until September. 'I understand the local authorities have been advised by the department of health to allow current practices to continue until next gathering season beginning in autumn 1993,' according to the ministry of agriculture. Supporters of the cocklers, like Mr Gareth Wardell, Labour MP for Gower, contend that the government's slowness to react to the consequences of the directives was largely responsible for the industry's problems in the first place. In parliament earlier this month, Mr Wardell accused Mr David Curry, agriculture minister, of sounding 'the death knell' of the industry through his incompetence. The department of agriculture had delayed for more than a year after the directives had been approved before applying for a process for heat treating molluscs and gastropods to be cleared by the European veterinary committee, Mr Wardell claimed. As a result, the industry had been unable to arrange for the requisite treatment plant to be installed. Although the process - known as the Torry process - had now been approved, this did not give enough time to act before the directives came into force. Mr Curry retorted by saying the regulations would be applied 'with common sense' and promising: 'Nobody will be closed down on 1 January or 2 January'. According to the ministry of agriculture, the application for approval of the Torry process was submitted to the EC 'in the permissible time limit'.</p>

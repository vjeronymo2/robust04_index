			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / People: Williams prepares to get his fingers inky David Williams, who arrived at Fleet Street-based printing ink specialists Usher-Walker 15 months ago, has been made chief executive in a boardroom reshuffle designed to prepare the company for growth. Peter Walker, previously chairman and managing director, remains executive chairman. Williams, who says he had no experience of inks 'beyond the little bit I used at school' when he joined from acquisitive mini-conglomerate Mosaic Investments, explains that Usher-Walker has been 'basically very much a family-run company', despite its stock market listing. He came in with the title of corporate development director, and there was no chief executive. The board of nine members was far too unwieldy, according to Williams, and a priority was to institute 'proper reporting systems'. Hence Gerry Burdall, 55, technical director since 1983, steps down from the main board, and becomes purchasing director. Ron Loynton, 50, remains director in charge of sales, but also steps down from the board. Williams explains that Walker 'has his finger on the pulse on the ink side'. That leaves Williams to concentrate on acquisitions - possibly in the speciality chemicals field. He also thinks that, while Britain is acknowledged as a world leader in inks manufacture, Usher-Walker has paid too little attention to the export side.</p>

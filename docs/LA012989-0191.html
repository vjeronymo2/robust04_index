			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OCCIDENTAL ENDS SKID WITH WIN OVER WHITTIER  </P> <P> Before the referees arrived at the Occidental College gym Saturday night, the  Whittier basketball team performed an impromptu -- and illegal -- slam-dunk  session while Occidental players stretched under their goal.  </P> <P> When the game started, however, it was the Tigers who were impressive.  </P> <P> Occidental (12-5 overall, 2-2 in conference play), riding a 2-game losing  streak that had dropped it to the basement of the Southern California  Intercollegiate Athletic Conference standings, regained much of the intensity  it had lost over the past few weeks and turned back Whitter, 92-76, at  Occidental.  </P> <P> "We went back to the way we were playing," said center Chris Anderson, who  scored 21 points, had 3 blocks and a thunderous double-fisted jam in the first  half. "We had good motion and we didn't try to force it inside."  </P> <P> As for the Poets' pregame theatrics?  </P> <P> "Why show off?" Anderson said. "In the game is where it counts."  </P> <P> The biggest contribution might have been the backcourt pressure of guards Ethan  Caldwell, Jason Greenstein and Jay Caba. The trio stole the ball from  Whittier's guards several times for easy layups.  </P> <P> The Poets (8-11, 1-3) committed 17 turnovers.  </P> <P> "It really bothered us," Whittier Coach Dave Jacobs said of the pressure.  "Every mistake we made, Oxy scored on. It was a double crucifixion."  </P> <P> Occidental Coach Brian Newhall said that he enjoyed the game's upbeat tempo.  </P> <P> "We're going to start playing 10 people," he said. "We'll keep rotating --  pulling them out, putting them in -- those little breaks really help."  </P> <P> Forward John Keister led Occidental with a game-high 25 points. Keister said  that the Tigers had better luck trying to exploit Whittier's lack of speed.  </P> <P> "When we ran a little bit we'd get some room," he said. "They were all over me  in the set offense."  </P> <P> The game started evenly and Occidental founded itself trailing by a point,  16-15, 9 minutes into the first half. But then the Tigers applied backcourt  pressure and capitalized on 4 Whittier turnovers to put together a 9-2 spurt.  </P> <P> Leading by 8 at the intermission, Occidental opened the second half with an  11-6 rally paced by Anderson, who scored 6. The Tigers maintained momentum and  led by 12, 63-48, with 12:40 to play.  </P> <P> Nine minutes in the second half Whittier trailed by 19. But the Poets weren't  through as they mounted their own rally, putting together an 8-0 run over the  next 3 minutes to trim the deficit to 74-63.  </P> <P> But the Tigers, who muffed a 13-point second-half lead in an overtime loss to  Claremont last Wednesday, held on.  </P></p>

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Heseltine's crusade progresses in silence: Industry minister Tim Sainsbury tells Kevin Brown why the DTI's cultural revolution is still on track despite some setbacks THE TROUBLE with industrial policy, says Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, is that it takes a long time to produce results. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, gave his department a new lease of life last year when he initiated a raft of proposals designed to improve Britain's industrial competitiveness. The policy revamp revolves around a 'partnership' between government and industry, and a deregulatory crusade to rid companies of the burden of red tape. But 16 months later there is little concrete evidence that the Heseltine approach is working. In part this is because the DTI was sidetracked for most of last year by the pit closure crisis. The department has also been leaderless since June, when Mr Heseltine suffered a heart attack while holidaying in Venice. He is recovering, and is expected to return to work in time for the Conservative party conference in October. Mr Sainsbury, in charge of industry policy in Mr Heseltine's absence, concedes that there is 'some scepticism as to whether (the new approach) is actually going to deliver'. Part of the problem, he says, lies in the low-key nature of the partnership work, much of which takes place out of the public eye. As examples, he points to the DTI's efforts to improve the relationship between carmakers and component companies - regarded as vital for improved competitiveness - and its success in persuading a number of companies to co-operate in bidding for overseas contracts - acting, in effect, as 'national champions' - rather than wasting resources by bidding against each other. 'It's not 'hold-the-front-page' stuff,' he says. But the result has been 'a big improvement' in the DTI's relationship with industry, much of which was contemptuous of the department less than two years ago. Dipping into a briefing file he quotes with approval speeches in which corporate leaders have praised the department's 'supportive' role. 'You would not have got that not long ago,' he says. Nevertheless, progress towards the fulfilment of many of Mr Heseltine's initiatives has clearly been slower and more difficult than expected. For example, only 40 of 100 'exporting experts' who were to be seconded to the DTI from the private sector have been appointed. It has been 'difficult' to find the right people, Mr Sainsbury says. More importantly, perhaps, the opening of the first of a network of 'one-stop shops', intended to offer comprehensive advice to small businesses, has been delayed by several months. The shops, dismissed by some critics as a gimmick, are regarded by Mr Heseltine as an important vanguard in the march towards a cultural revolution in business and government. Mr Sainsbury says he is not concerned by the postponement - the first shop will open in Birmingham at the end of September - claiming that he is more interested in ensuring that the shops offer the right service. But the delays serve to highlight the department's difficulties in producing concrete evidence that the Heseltine regime is making a difference to industry. Much will depend on the success of the second arm of policy, the crusade against red tape, which will focus on an omnibus deregulation bill in the next parliamentary session starting in November. Already the department is claiming some successes. A series of seven business taskforces is busy identifying regulations that could be scrapped, and the European Commission has agreed to consult industry before issuing draft directives, rather than afterwards. Mr Sainsbury says co-operation from other departments - which are supposed to be helping in the reduction of red tape - is 'getting better', mainly because the prime minister has made clear his strong support. 'I think the message has been received and understood,' Mr Sainsbury says. Nevertheless, he admits: 'Industry, quite reasonably, wants to see some red meat. It wants to see things actually changing.' That may take some time. About 3,500 regulations have been earmarked for investigation, and the DTI has given the impression that many could be scrapped easily. This may be true of rules such as those which regulate the spacing of clothes pegs in factory changing rooms, or which designate harmless commodities such as Brillo pads as dangerous substances. But many regulations have health and safety implications or are incorporated into workplace agreements, or implement EC directives. Those will be more difficult to shift. For the moment everything is on the table in negotiations with other departments - including the deregulation of London buses, which has not yet been dropped by the transport department in spite of criticism from Tory MPs and business pressure groups. 'The concept of working in partnership to help British industry is not easy to grasp because it is not something dramatic like privatising British Steel or finding a home for Rover,' says Mr Sainsbury. But, he says, the department will be judged in the end by its performance. 'When people see the bill I think they will realise that we are making real progress.'</p>

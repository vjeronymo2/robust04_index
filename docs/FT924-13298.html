			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Construction downturn leaves MJ Gleeson lower MJ GLEESON, the Surrey-based construction, housebuilding and property group, reported a 16 per cent decline in pre-tax profits from Pounds 11.8m to Pounds 9.94m for the year to June 30. Turnover slipped to Pounds 183m (Pounds 199m). The company, however, is proposing to increase the final dividend by 7.55 per cent to 9.4p for a total of 12.75p (11.58p). Earnings per share were 67.1p (75.49p). Trading profits from construction and housebuilding fell to Pounds 3.94m (Pounds 5.83m) but were partly offset by an increase in rents from commercial property which grew to Pounds 4.6m (Pounds 3.56m). Net interest received fell from Pounds 2.46m to Pounds 1.39m. Because of the depressed state of the commercial and industrial property market, the company has departed from its previous policy of revaluing one third of its investment properties each year. At June 30 the group's investment and owner-occupied properties were valued at Pounds 55.1m resulting in a deficit of Pounds 7.21m. The company noted that while the reduction in the value of properties was 'disappointing' it represented a diminution of only 11.78 per cent on previously reported figures.</p>

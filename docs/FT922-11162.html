			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / (CORRECTED) Japan's banks face Y1,297bn loss: The effects of the sharp decline in portfolio valuations Correction (Published 28th April 1992) appended to this article. JAPAN'S city, long-term credit and trust banks have announced a total of Y1,297.3bn in portfolio valuation losses from the decline of the Tokyo stock market. The losses have forced some of the banks also to revise earnings estimates downward for the year ending last month. Sanwa Bank was hit hardest, with losses amounting to Y145bn (Dollars 1.09bn). The bank said net earnings would decline 10 per cent compared to earlier estimates of Y120bn. Last year earnings were Y123bn. The Industrial Bank of Japan and Fuji Bank reported losses of more than Y90bn. The losses are in aggregate nearly five times more than last year. The losses directly affect current profits, and some banks have aggressively sold securities on which they can realise a capital gain to boost the bottom line. The banks continue to hold significant hidden profits on other securities whose market value remains above acquisition costs. Valuation losses have been partly offset by rising interest rate spreads as rates decline, and the banks are reporting higher operating profits as a result. The disclosure of losses is required under stock exchange rules. They appeared timed to follow Ministry of Finance attempts to calm investor fears about the health of the banking system. The ministry last week said the banks were 'very sound', in spite of rising bad loans linked to the property sector. The announcements were aimed at convincing investors the banks' problems were manageable. However, the ministry's efforts appear to have raised further questions about the likely growth of non-performing loans in the current year, about which the ministry had no comment. The valuation losses are also dated to the end of March, after which the stock market plunged. Further losses will have to be declared if the market fails to recover. Valuation losses for the banking sector in 1991 came to Y1,734bn, said the ministry.

This amount was the valuation loss of the Bank of Tokyo. The Tokai Bank's correct valuation loss was Y54.7bn.</p>

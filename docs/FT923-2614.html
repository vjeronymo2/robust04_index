			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / UK Company News: LGW at Pounds 0.44m and resumes dividend LGW, the USM-quoted marketing services and luxury goods group, achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 438,000 in the six months to June 30, compared with losses of Pounds 254,000. The group returned to the black in the second half last year and reported profits of Pounds 77,000 for the full year. The result was achieved, directors said, by maintaining a lower level of expenses, better profit margins, and by a reduction in stock levels. Turnover improved to Pounds 6.76m (Pounds 6.21m). Earnings per share worked through at 7.8p (5.7p losses) and an interim dividend of 1.125p is declared, the first payment since 1990.</p>

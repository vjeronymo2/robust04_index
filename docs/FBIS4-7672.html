			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 1/4/1994 -- Local elections  should precede legislative ones, irrespective if the latter are  normal or early, Oliviu Gherman, chairman of the ruling party,  the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR], told a ROMPRES  correspondent after the Thursday, March 31, meeting of the PDSR  Standing Delegation.    Gherman said that the PDSR had a very clear point of view on  snap elections. "Although we are not afraid of early elections,  we deem they are counterproductive, it may even be dangerous to  favor them," mentioned the politician.    The PDSR chairman expanded by saying that huge sums of money  would be necessary for the organization of early elections this  year, which is decisive for the reform and characterized by  financial shrinking. Gherman opined that the political spectrum  had not changed considerably since 1992 and mentioned that a new  electoral law should be drafted. The 1992 polls were held in  keeping with a law written uniquely for them, added Gherman.    According to the PDSR chairman, favoring early elections is  tantamount to political frivolity.</p>

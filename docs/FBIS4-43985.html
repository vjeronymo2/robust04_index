			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "ett": "Pressure for Stricter Emissions </F> Norms; Restrictions Also for Cars From East Europe"]    [Text] Vienna -- After joining the European Union [EU],  Austria will advocate the reduction of emissions from cars.  Yesterday, Wednesday [22 June], Transportation Minister Viktor  Klima (Social Democratic Party of Austria) made a corresponding  statement at a press conference in Vienna.    His specific plans: In addition to the already valid  regulations, unified "ecological minimum standards" -- also for  cars from East Europe -- are to be introduced. Already at the  next EU transportation ministers' conference on 22-23 July he  wants to become active on the "emissions front."    Austrian preparations for EU membership provided the  occasion  for the press conference by Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, Klima,  and European Affairs State Secretary Brigitte Ederer in Vienna  yesterday. In autumn a government white paper -- similar to the  EU white paper -- is to be presented. Its contents: economic  and structural policy activities so as to contribute Austria's  ideas "at the touch of a button" already at the state of  discussions in the EU.  <H5>  Against Unemployment </H5>   For the time being, these are just declarations of intent.  Ederer cited the following key concerns after joining the EU:  strengthening European employment policy, including a more  intensive struggle against unemployment; efforts to raise  environmental standards in the EU; final negotiations on the  EU's regional subsidies; a "peace policy" in the form of social  and economic policy integration; use of Austria's experiences as  an intermediary for East Europe. Ederer's motto for Austria's  role in the EU: "Small but important."  <H5>  Air Traffic Control in Vienna? </H5>   Klima announced further specific activities. One of the main  concerns refers to air traffic: Vienna would like to get  superivision of air traffic control for southeastern Europe.    Klima is also trying to further develop Austria as an  international business location. Agreements, which have already  been concluded with individual countries, are being transformed  into "Euroagreements." Regarding subsidies, the main focus will  be on technology and innovation.</p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRA SHOTS KILL 3, INCLUDING 2 ELDERLY MEN  </P> <P> Two gunmen jumped out of a stolen car and opened fire with automatic weapons at  a village garage near here Tuesday afternoon, killing the garage owner and two  elderly men standing with him, the police reported.  </P> <P> The British Broadcasting Corp. reported that the garage owner's wife and  teen-age children are believed to have witnessed the attack -- and that the  gunmen cheered as they drove off.  </P> <P> The Irish Republican Army, in a statement to the local news media, took  responsibility for the killings. The statement said the garage was a stronghold  of the illegal Ulster Volunteer Force, an armed Protestant group. But police  said the shooting was "indiscriminate."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tit-for-Tat Violence  </P> <P> The incident occurred in Coagh, about 50 miles west of here, and was the latest  in what Northern Ireland security authorities describe as a worrisome spate of  tit-for-tat sectarian violence in which 16 people have been killed this year.  </P> <P> Coagh is a predominantly Protestant village identified with the majority of the  people in Northern Ireland who want to remain a part of the United Kingdom.  </P> <P> The Ulster Volunteer Force claimed responsibility last month for killing John  Joe Davey, a town councilor from the same general area who represented the  nationalist Sinn Fein party. Sinn Fein, which wants the British out of Northern  Ireland, is the legal political arm of the outlawed IRA.  </P> <P> Tuesday's shooting was considered noteworthy because of an IRA pledge to  "refine" its activities after a year in which its operatives killed 23  civilians in bungled attacks.  </P> <P> Sinn Fein leader Jerry Adams told a party conference in Dublin five weeks ago  that there had been "an exceptional and regrettable level of civilian  casualties arising from IRA operations" in 1988.  </P> <P> The IRA is believed to be responsible for killing 33 soldiers and 6 policemen  in the province last year. Illegal Protestant groups are blamed for 22  killings.  </P> <P> The police said that at least three men drove up to Leslie Dallos' garage in  Coagh shortly after 4 p.m. Tuesday in a red Vauxhall auto that had been stolen  shortly before. Two of the men jumped out and sprayed the garage with gunfire.  </P> <P> Dallos was killed instantly, as was 72-year-old Ernie Rankin, a pensioner,  according to the police. A second pensioner, Austin Nelson, 61, died of wounds  on the way to a hospital.  </P> <P> Nelson, a former truck driver, had taken up violin-making in retirement and was  featured on a local television newscast Monday evening. He said he hoped that  through his hobby he could make a lasting contribution to the world.  </P> <P> Garage owner Dallos was described as a drag-racing enthusiast in his early 40s.  His wife was reportedly visiting the garage at the time of the shooting. His  teen-age children were among a group of youngsters who witnessed the killings  as they were getting off a school bus nearby.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Arms, Ammo Discovered  </P> <P> In a related development, authorities in northern England reported Tuesday that  they had found a cache of arms and ammunition and a large quantity of  high-explosive Semtex buried in a wooded area near the seaside town of  Scarborough.  </P> <P> Officials pointed out that in 10 days Scarborough is to be the site of a  conference of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party and that  Thatcher is expected to attend.  </P> <P> In 1984, IRA assassins bombed the hotel where Thatcher and members of her  Cabinet were staying in Brighton during a Conservative Party convention. Five  people were killed in the explosion, but the prime minister was not injured.  </P> <P> There have been a number of other IRA bombings in recent months aimed at  military targets in England. The police have uncovered other caches of  explosives, which the IRA is believed to have acquired through Libya.  </P></p>

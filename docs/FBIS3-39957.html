			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Morten Fyhn and Geir Salvesen report: "Internal EU </F> Conflict Leaves Its Mark on Negotiations"]    [Text] Brussels -- Late yesterday evening, after three  hours of debate, the EU [European Union] countries' foreign  ministers had still not succeeded in reaching agreement on a  joint fisheries position vis-a-vis Norway. But the Spanish  demands for a large quota have not been rejected, and clear  signals from the meeting indicate that at today's negotiating  meeting with Trade Minister Grete Knudsen the EU will try to  find out how far Norway is willing to go.    Yesterday evening the trade minister was disappointed that  there has still been no clarification from the EU. "There is  nothing special in the fact that things are moving so slowly in  the final spurt, but I had hoped that the fisheries position  would be ready by the time we arrived in Brussels," she said.    If Knudsen firmly rejects demands for increased EU quotas  the  EU will be forced to decide what concrete demands should be  pushed in the negotiations next weekend. If the other EU  countries either are unable to force Spain onto the retreat, or  choose to back a demand for a little fish at least, the scene  will have been set for a crisis in the negotiations.    "I think that Norway will have to expect that the EU will  make strong demands on Norway in the fisheries field,"  Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jacques Poos told AFTENPOSTEN. Poos  said that Norway's stance that it does not have a single fish to  give away has given rise to strong reactions from some of the EU  countries. At the meeting Poos stressed that the EU must take  account of the Norwegian demands, chiefly those to do with the  country's northernmost regions which are particularly dependent  on fishing.    "But Norway cannot expect the EU not to demand access to  Norwegian waters," Poos said. But he believes that Norway is in  a good negotiating position bearing mind the fact that several  EU countries do not want to give Norway full access to the EU  market from day one of membership.    "You can do a trade off market access against quotas," he  proposed.    A major problem for the EU countries' attempts to hammer out  a common fisheries stance is the fact that Spain -- supported by  Portugal -- does not want the EU concept of relative stability  to apply to an EU with 16 members. Relative stability means  that quota allocation occurs on the basis of historical rights.  Spain has claimed that with new countries in the EU a new  situation arises which means that all quota allocations must be  renegotiated. Such a demand is unacceptable to a number of EU  countries, including Denmark.    At yesterday's meeting on fish Spain reiterated its demands  for 7,000 tonnes of cod for itself and a so-called solidarity  quota of 11,000 tonnes. Spain and Portugal are also opposed to  the idea that Norway will have better access to the EU's waters  than they themselves have achieved. They will not have full  access until 2003. France and Ireland are standing firm on  their demand that Norway be denied full market access. Here  Spain is proposing that Norway adopt voluntary limits on exports.    It is likely that there will be limits to how much progress  can be made in the round of direct negotiations with the  applicant countries which begins today. Norway thinks that it  is realistic to expect to tie up the energy protocol, the  declaration of the principle of public access to information,  and questions to do with the position of the Lapps. But these  are mere bagatelles against the heavyweight areas which will  have to wait until the weekend.    The trade minister said yesterday that Norway still has the  goal of negotiating in parallel with the other Nordic countries.  But Norway thinks that achieving a good agreement is more  important than the danger that Norway could fall behind a little.    Late last night the EU countries took a break from the  fisheries discussion and tackled agricultral and regional  issues. In this latter area the Commission has proposed that a  new so-called objective region classification be created -- 1(A)  -- for the Nordic countries. They in their turn have asked to  receive structural support under today's Objective 1 region  classification -- something to which Spain, among others, is  opposed. The new objective region classification aims to meet  the applicants' demands that account be taken of their special  circumstances.</p>

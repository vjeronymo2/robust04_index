			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Observer: Political banker A big morale-raising job awaits Efthymios Christodoulou, who took over this week as the new governor of the Bank of Greece. The central bank's reputation as a watchdog inevitably suffered from the Pounds 110m Bank of Crete embezzlement scandal, even though retiring governor Dimitris Halikias escaped blame for it. Another problem for the newcomer is that his bank's research department, once a respected think-tank, is suffering from a brain-drain as bright staff are lured away to the private sector by higher pay. From 90 researchers not long ago, it has shrunk to under 50  - barely enough to crank out the forecasts required by the OECD and IMF. Even so, the 59-year-old Christodoulou must feel relieved to be leaving the economy ministry. He had a hard time during his 18-month tenure as minister, not least when it came to persuading his cabinet colleagues to back his medium-term austerity programme. On the other hand, as a gregarious Euro-MP for over a decade, Christodoulou built a useful network of contacts in Brussels. These paid off in 1990 when Greece found itself in the embarrassing position of having to ask the Commission for an emergency balance of payments loan for the second time in only four years. With Greek credibility in Brussels at a low ebb, Christodoulou's lobbying was crucial in getting the Pounds 1.6bn loan approved. Now he has to disprove those critics who argue that skilful politicians do not make good central bankers.</p>

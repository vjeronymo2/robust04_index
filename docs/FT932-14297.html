			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / BBC will survey employee opinion THE BBC is going to conduct its most detailed investigation of what its staff think of the corporation, their jobs and their management. One third of the 24,500 staff, including the World Service and BBC Enterprises, will be chosen at random and be asked to complete a 28-page questionnaire. The 100 questions include more than 20 on BBC managers. Staff will be asked the extent to which managers accomplish high-quality work, take public responsibility for mistakes and communicate in an open and direct manner. The questionnaires will be confidential and will be sent directly to independent consultants for analysis. The results of what is expected to become an annual test of staff opinions will be published. Mr Alaric Mostyn, head of corporate international communications, said the results would not change basic corporation strategies such as Producer Choice - the controversial strategy which gives producers the freedom to buy services from the external market. The BBC has also commissioned a large survey of public opinion of the corporation.</p>

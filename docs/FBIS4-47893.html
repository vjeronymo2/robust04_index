			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The Zimbabwe Government has finally capitulated in  the so-called land grab scandal. There has been uproar in the  country since it was found that land compulsorily acquired from  white farmers for distribution to landless peasants was being  assigned on license to government ministers and ruling party  faithfuls. President Mugabe himself said that an investigation  into the issue would be held. Now the agriculture minister,  Kumbirai Kangai, has canceled the deals and taken some of the  blame, as Fariah Mungazi reports from Harare:    The cancellation of the land agreement follows criticism of  the Tenant Resettlement Scheme, under which farms earmarked for  resettlement were leased to individuals, some of them top  government officials. Lands, Agriculture and Water Development  Minister Kumbirai Kangai told parliament in a ministerial  statement that he shouldered responsibility for what he called  the apparent misunderstanding that arose over the scheme. He  said in our pursuance of that objective and in our enthusiasm  to carry out the task we may have attracted criticism. However,  he denied that the exercise was a scandal, saying the scheme was  an appropriate tool for indigenization of the economy. He said,  in line with government policy of indeginizing the economy, the  ministry found it prudent to use the scheme to promote the  advancement of emergent black commercial farmers. He described  the scheme as a stop gap measure taken by his ministry in a bid  to use the land productively, conserve natural resources, and  prevent what he called vandalism of permanent improvements and  assets on farms. The minister said some of the farms whose  leases had been canceled were being handed over to the Ministry  of Local Government for immediate resettlement. Those farms,  whose resettlement plans were not yet in place, would be  advertised for temporary leasing to members of the public.</p>

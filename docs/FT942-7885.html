			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Hebron observers left watching from their window: Julian Ozanne reports on an Israeli curfew that shut the international force of 117 inside its compound A Norwegian member of the international observer force in Hebron pointed to the stretch of tarmac outside the force's compound: 'We are not allowed to move beyond that point. We can't patrol the town. We don't know what is going on beyond our front door.' As he spoke last week, the West Bank flashpoint of Arab-Jewish violence was under a 24-hour military curfew. Israeli soldiers were conducting house-to-house searches looking for Palestinian guerrillas who killed two Israelis in revenge for an attack on Palestinians the day before. Israel has since lifted the curfew but the incident has left doubts among Palestinians about the credibility of the observer force which was deployed two weeks ago. 'This was the most significant test so far of the force but they did nothing,' said Mr Awny Sughyer, deputy mayor of Hebron. 'The Israelis made the whole area a closed military zone and the observers were not even allowed to enter any of the places of violence. 'People feel angry and sad about the force. There were high expectations when they first came here but now people say they can't do anything to protect Palestinians.' The observer force has a three-month mission to reduce tension between Hebron's 110,000 Arab residents and militant Jewish settlers after the February 25 Hebron mosque massacre of 30 Palestinians. They were deployed in the wake of a United Nations Security Council resolution and weeks of difficult negotiations between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation. After fierce arguments about the size of the force and whether its members should be armed, the two sides eventually agreed to a 160-strong force from Italy, Denmark and Norway, of whom 60 should carry arms 'for their personal protection'. The force quickly ran into problems. First, it was unable to recruit enough suitable people and settled for 117. Second, despite the hard PLO bargaining for light weapons, the observers decided against being armed. This left the force under the protection of the Israeli army. Last, a clause in the Israel-PLO agreement specified that observers would be denied entry to any area which Israel declared a closed military zone. Israel's declaration of the whole of Hebron as a closed zone 'was a funny interpretation of the agreement that we did not expect', said Mr Bjarno Sorenson, spokesman for the force. He said the force had filed a complaint but could do little else. In response to Palestinian criticism that the force had been unable to prevent Israeli soldiers and settlers wounding 19 Palestinians last Monday and had been denied access to the site, Mr Sorenson said: 'People here want us to be a shield but the word protection for us means to report an impartial view of what is going on here.' Criticism is also emerging about the financing of the force. One observer said it had no fixed budget but had been told to spend as much money as possible and had been given a blank cheque by Denmark, Norway and Italy. The compound, which has been off-limits to outsiders, is reportedly stacked full of new computers, fax machines and furniture and the force is lavishly equipped with Israeli radios, mobile telephones and rented cars. According to the agreement, all equipment bought by the force will be handed over to the PLO once the mission is completed. The real problem remains the conflict between Palestinians and militant Jewish settlers in Hebron, a town sacred to both Moslem and Jew. 'There is a contradiction between settlements in the town and peace. Together they are impossible,' said Mr Khaled Osaily, a local businessman. 'The force clearly can do nothing about that. For us Palestinians the worst thing is that by being here maybe they will legitimise the presence of the settlers.'</p>

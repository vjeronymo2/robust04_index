			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / EETPU may prompt row THE newly formed Amal-gamated Engineering and Electrical Union may become the focus of a Trades Union Congress row over the recruitment of a non-TUC breakaway group of airline cabin staff. The EETPU, now the electricians' section of the new union, has agreed to provide services 'on an agency basis in the first stage' to Cabin Crew '89. The 5,000-strong cabin crew group broke away from the TGWU general union in 1989. The EETPU was expelled by the TUC in 1988. Cabin Crew '89, which consists mainly of British Airways staff, after a link with the airline officers' association Balpa, has turned to the white-collar section of the EETPU. The electricians will provide support services at first. The EETPU section of the AEEU said yesterday that the arrangement had 'not been entered into to be provocative or controversial' but was between 'one non-TUC-affiliated trade union and another non-TUC-affiliated union'. But the arrangement may jeopardise the readmission to the TUC of the electricians' section of the new union, formed by the amalgamation of the EETPU and the AEU engineering workers' union.</p>

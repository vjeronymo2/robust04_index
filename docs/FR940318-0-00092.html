In anticipation of the impact of these requirements on small businesses, the CAA requires that states adopt a PROGRAM, and submit this PROGRAM as a revision to the federally approved SIP. In addition, the CAA directs the EPA to oversee the small business assistance program and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing a PROGRAM are set out in section 507 of the CAA and the EPA guidance document Guidelines for the Implementation of section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. In order to gain full approval, the state submittal must provide for each of the following PROGRAM elements: (1) The establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance assistance to small businesses; (2) the establishment of a state Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory process; and (3) the creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MDEQ has met or will meet all of the following requirements of section 507 of the CAA by submitting a SIP revision that implements the following required PROGRAM elements and implementation schedules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> 12/31/92 Reviewed legal authority and draft legislation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 05/30/93 Passage of all needed legislation accomplished. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 09/15/93 Selection of Small Business Ombudsman and SBAP Manager&hyph;A person has been named to serve in an acting capacity for both positions pending authorization of funding by the State legislature.

A fully operational ombudsman's office is expected to be in place by the proposed implementation date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Compliance Advisory Panel <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the State statute dated April 4, 1993, MDEQ established a Small Business Air Pollution Compliance Advisory Council (SBAP CAP) to meet the requirements section 507(e) of the CAA. As described in a January 20, 1994, letter from the Department of Environmental Quality, Mississippi does not have majority and minority leaderships in its Senate and House of Representatives. To reflect political realities within the State of Mississippi, the SBAP CAP is composed of seven members appointed as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A. One member representing the Air Pollution Control Program of the Department of Environmental Quality;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. Two members who are not owners or representatives of owners of small businesses, appointed by the Governor;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. Two members who each shall be the owner or representative of owners of small businesses, appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. Two members who each shall be the owner or representative of owners of small businesses, appointed by the Lieutenant Governor (who presides over the Senate).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SBAP CAP has the following three responsibilities: (1) To render advisory opinions concerning the effectiveness of the SBAP, difficulties encountered and the degree and severity of enforcement actions; (2) to periodically report to EPA concerning the SBAP's adherence to the principles of the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act, and the Regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Flexibility Act <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ; and (3) to review and assure that information for small business stationary sources is easily understandable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 507(e)(1)(B) requires the CAP to report on the compliance of the SBAP with these three Federal statutes. However, since state agencies are not required to comply with them, EPA believes that the state PROGRAM must merely require the CAP to report on whether the SBAP is adhering to the general principles of these Federal statutes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Eligibility <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> MDEQ has incorporated section 507(c)(1) and defined a Small Business Stationary Source as a source that: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Is owned or operated by a person who employs 100 or fewer individuals;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Is a small business concern as defined in the Small Business Act, 13 CFR Part 121;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Is not a major stationary source as defined in titles I and III of the CAA;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) Does not emit 50 tons or more per year of any regulated air pollutant; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (E) Emits less than 75 tons per year of all regulated air pollutants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MDEQ has established the following mechanisms as required by section 507: (1) A process for ascertaining the eligibility of a source to receive assistance under the PROGRAM, including an evaluation of a source's eligibility using the criteria in section 507(c)(1) of the CAA; and (2) A process for public notice and comment on grants of eligibility to sources that do not meet the provisions of sections 507(c)(1)(C), (D), and (E) of the CAA, but do not emit more than 100 tpy of all regulated pollutants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Final Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this action, EPA is approving the PROGRAM SIP revision submitted by the State of Mississippi through the MDEQ. This action is being taken without prior proposal because the changes are noncontroversial and EPA anticipates no significant comments on them. The public should be advised that this action will be effective May 17, 1994. However, if notice is received by April 18, 1994, that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical comments, this action will be withdrawn and two subsequent documents will be published before the effective date. One document will withdraw the final action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by May 17, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(2).) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Office of Air and Radiation. A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for a revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By this action, EPA is approving a State program created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. The program being proposed for approval today does not impose any new regulatory burden on small businesses; it is a program under which small businesses may elect to take advantage of assistance provided by the State. Because the EPA's approval of this program does not impose any new regulatory requirements on small businesses, I therefore certify it does not have a significant economic impact on any small entities affected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental protection, Air pollution control, Incorporation by reference, Intergovernmental relations, Small business stationary source technical and environmental assistance program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: March 4, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Donald J.

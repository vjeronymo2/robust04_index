			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Anton Mrkonjic in Zepce] </F>   [Excerpt] At 0635 this morning three 82-mm mortars fell on  the British UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] base in the village  of Ljeskovica, between Zepce and Zavidovici [central Bosnia,  around 100 miles northwest of Sarajevo]. British forces  commander Major Darling informed the command of the 111th HVO  [Croatian Defense Council] Brigade that their radar equipment  detected the direction and even the location from where the  mortars were fired, but declined to say who was responsible for  the shelling of the British battalion. Fortunately, there were  no casualties, but material damage is huge. Maj. Darling said  that if the shelling happens again he would demand air strikes  against those who fire shells on UNPROFOR.

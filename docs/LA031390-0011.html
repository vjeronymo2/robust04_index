			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VAN DE KAMP SAYS HE OPPOSES EAST L.A.  PRISON  </P> <P> Attorney general and Democratic candidate for governor John K. Van de Kamp  announced his opposition Monday to a proposed state prison in East Los Angeles.  </P> <P> He acknowledged a "desperate" need for more prison cells in California, but  said a November bond issue he is seeking would finance cheaper "drug prisons"  in the desert areas of the state and avert the need for a new and controversial  urban prison here.  </P> <P> "I promise you this," Van de Kamp told a group at Lincoln Park's Plaza de la  Raza, "If the East L.A. prison is still on the drawing board when I become  governor, it will never get off the drawing board."  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BARGAIN CORNER: FIRMS OFFER INEXPENSIVE PUB STAYS IN AUSTRALIA  </P> <P> Australian Pubstays and Backpackers Headquarters have lined up inexpensive  accommodations at about 100 pubs in Australia, including some in Sydney,  Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane and Hobart. Many of these pub/hotels are old  buildings that have seen much of the country's history. Some have been  upgraded. Most offer from five to 10 rooms.  </P> <P> There are four room categories, with varying degrees of comfort. Two categories  lack private bathrooms. All, however, include a full breakfast.  </P> <P> Pub stays can be booked through U.S. tour operators, Guthrey's Pacific Travel  and Continental Newmans Vacations.  </P> <P> Guthrey's Pacific is offering the pub stays at from $32 to $60 double, $24 to  $52 single. Guthrey's sells the pub stays only if participants also make other  arrangements through it, such as car rentals.  </P> <P> Continental Newmans is selling vouchers for the pub stays. A minimum of five  vouchers must be bought, with the rates $28 to $60 single and $37 to $69 double  occupancy.  </P> <P> Making reservation for the first night's stay -- always a good idea -- can be  done in the United States. You also can book all five or more nights. The  vouchers are good for six months. Refunds are given for unused vouchers, minus  a $50 administrative fee.  </P> <P> Dormitory-type hostels with multiple bunks are used by Backpackers  Headquarters, with a rate of $8 a night. The hostels usually contain communal  kitchens, dining rooms, bathrooms, TV lounge and laundry room. Currency  exchange and tour information/bookings are among the services offered.  </P> <P> There are five hostels in Sydney and one each in Port Macquarie and on Magnetic  Island.  </P> <P> For more information on Australian pub stays, contact travel agents, Guthrey's  Pacific Travel at (714) 752-8322 or Continental Newmans Vacations at toll-free  (800) 525-2560. Backpackers Headquarters is at 79 Bayswater Road, Sydney.  </P> <P> You can also get more information from the Australian Tourist Commission, 2121  Avenue of the Stars, Suite 1200, Los Angeles 90067, (213) 552-1988.

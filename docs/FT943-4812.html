			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Arts: Today's Television Today's Short Stories documentary is about nutty enthusiasts, almost invariably surefire material for television. Until two years ago, Swansea Aero Club was run by the local council. Then money problems brought the threat of closure and a group of flying enthusiasts decided to buy it and run it as a private company (8.30 C4). Witness is another C4 documentary, this time about Boris Zolotov, a Russian who runs four-week seminars and, we are assured, uses his telepathic powers to bring rooms full of people to orgasm. Jolly useful (9.00). Michael Gambon, Susannah Harker, Connie Booth, Gemma Jones, and many more, including Ken Livingstone as himself, appear in Faith, a thriller wrapped around News At 10 today and tomorrow which combines politicians' sex scandals and arms deals (9.00). William Ivory's Common As Muck will inevitably be compared with 'The Dustbinmen', not just because both are about dustmen but because the 1969 series was written by Jack Rosenthal. That was a comedy of course, whereas the series starting on BBC1 today is a six-part drama (9.30).</p>

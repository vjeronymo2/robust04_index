			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> NEPA Consideration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The establishment of this Harvest Information Program and options have been considered in the ``Environmental Assessment: Migratory Bird Harvest Information Program.'' Copies of this document are available from the Service at the address indicated under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=2 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act, Executive Order 12866, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. This rule will not have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule may eventually affect about 5 million migratory game bird hunters when it is fully implemented. It will require migratory game bird hunters to supply their names, addresses, and other necessary information to the State licensing authority in the State hunted in order that they can be sampled for a voluntary national harvest survey. Hunters will be required to have evidence of current participation in the Program on their person while hunting migratory game birds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The States may require a small handling fee to compensate their hunting-license vendors and to cover their administrative costs. Many of the State hunting-license vendors are small entities, but this rule should not economically impact those vendors. Only migratory game bird hunters (individuals) would be required to provide this information, so this rule should not adversely affect small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The collection of information contained in this rule has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and assigned clearance number 1018&hyph;0015. The information is required from hunters to obtain the benefit of hunting migratory game birds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 0.015 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of these reporting requirements should be directed to the Service Information Collection Clearance Officer, MS&hyph;224 ARLSQ, Fish and Wildlife Service, Washington, DC 20240, or the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project 1018&hyph;0015, Washington, DC 20503.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order (EO) 12612_Federalism  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This regulation does not have significant federalism effects as provided in EO 12612. Due to the migratory nature of certain species of birds, the Federal Government has been given responsibility over these species by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. State harvest surveys presently cannot provide adequate national estimates of migratory game bird harvests for the following reasons: Some States do not now conduct annual harvest surveys or maintain accessible lists of hunter names and addresses. Comparable information is not available from all States because States have different licensing laws regulating who must buy a hunting license and different survey procedures. The harvest of those hunters who can legally hunt without an annual State license is excluded from State estimates. Hunters might buy more than one type of license in a single State and might buy licenses from more than one State, introducing duplication problems. Currently, many State license lists are not available in time to permit distribution of hunter records early in the hunting season. Budget constraints often prevent States from conducting harvest surveys during certain years or could cause some States to eliminate them completely.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule does not have a substantial direct effect on fiscal capacity, change the roles or responsibilities of Federal or State Governments, or intrude on State policy or administration. Therefore, this regulation does not have significant federalism effects and do not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. In fact, the Service would cooperate with States in providing surveys to meet special management needs, and increased cooperation between Federal and State Agencies would reduce duplication of survey efforts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12630_Taking of Individual Property Rights  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12630 discussed guidelines for the taking of individual property rights. This rule, authorized by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, does not affect any constitutionally-protected property rights. This rule will not result in the physical occupancy of property, the physical invasion of property, or the regulatory taking of any property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Authorship  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The primary author of this proposed rule is Robert L. Jessen, working under the direction of Paul R. Schmidt, Chief, Office of Migratory Bird Management.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 20  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Exports, Hunting, Imports, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Transportation, Wildlife. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set out in the preamble, 50 CFR part 20 is amended as set forth below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 20_MIGRATORY BIRD HUNTING  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

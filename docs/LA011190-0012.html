			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY / EXCERPTS;  </P> <P> WHAT IF MOM DOES WEAR COMBAT BOOTS?  </P> <P> If Rep. Pat Schroeder (D-Colo.) and others in her liberal ideological foxhole  have their way, women will be assigned to combat roles for the first time in  American history. Such a decision would be bad for the military and bad for the  country.  </P> <P> Most important, if women are allowed to be assigned to combat units, they would  lose their only protection against the draft. Should Congress decide to restore  the draft because of some future threat, the courts would surely rule that to  exempt women discriminates against men.  </P> <P> Would you want your daughter, sister, wife or mother to be forced into combat?  </P> <P> The idea of sending women to kill enemy men is contrary to our historical  experience, common sense and American social mores. It would destroy the unique  bonding between men in military services that is required for a disciplined,  effective fighting force. War is not a social experiment.  </P> <P> This nation is not ready for body bags carrying dead females. Continuing to bar  women from combat roles is in the best interest of the country. Congress, the  Pentagon and the President ought to put a stop to this bad idea before it  advances any more. Otherwise that childhood taunt, "Your mother wears combat  boots," might turn out to be true.  </P></p>

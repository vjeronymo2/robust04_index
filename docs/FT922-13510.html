			<p>920411 FT  11 APR 92 / Election 1992: Continental investors see little change as euphoria fades THE general election result clearly struck an ideological chord with institutional investors across Europe yesterday, with Continental shareholders expressing shock - and pleasure  - that professional pollsters should have got it so wrong. But as the euphoria faded, investors conceded that very little had changed and the UK equities markets were little better a bet than than they were before the election was called. Still, the upset seemed to provide more encouragement to those who watched the election from across the English Channel. 'We were shocked to see such a divergence between the polls and the results,' said Mr Claude Guillaume of Paribas Asset Management in Paris. But in the long run, Mr Guillaume and his counterparts across Europe are prepared only for a modest increase in their exposure to the UK equities markets. 'We think there will be a recovery, but a very modest one,' Mr Guillaume said. The clear Tory majority rules out the increase in interest rates Labour might have had to accept to defend the pound. But beyond that, the picture has changed little. 'There can be no real recovery until German interest rates come down,' he said, echoing investors across Europe. Several Continental investors said expectations of a Labour win - or at least, a hung parliament - had convinced them to underweigh UK equities in their portfolios before the elections. The main international equity indices are suggesting 38 to 40 per cent UK weightings, but Continental accounts had been a few percentage points below that. Ms Edith Thioun, fund manager at Banque Julius Baer in Zurich, said she was now likely to increase slightly her weighting in UK equities above the 40 per cent they now represent in her portfolio. In addition to removing the fear of a rise in interest rates, Ms Thioun said she expected the Tories' return to stimulate confidence up to the point that spending would be likely to pick up again. Closer to home, however, the Tory win has brought no new surge of enthusiasm for UK equities. 'We have felt that the economy would pick up in the next 12 months regardless of how the elections went,' said Mr Dick Barfield, chief investment officer at Standard Life. He said his pension funds carried an above-average 64 per cent weighting in UK equities before the election and he had no plans to adjust that. That view was echoed by Mr Hugh Jenkins, chief investment officer at Prudential Asset Management, the UK's largest life insurance company. 'Our immediate view was that whomever won would be restrained by the ERM,' he said, explaining that until German interest rates are cut, British and other Continental rates will remain high and restrict growth.</p>

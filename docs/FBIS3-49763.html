They have despaired of a Western  or international position that might have enabled them to  recover their territories, or given them the right to  self-defense by lifting the arms embargo.    Despite the fact that everyone thinks of Sarajevo when  speaking of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the central region  is considered the heart of the Bosnian state, its principal  nerve, and the center of the Muslim republic, after partition,  for it has natural resources and strategic sites controlling the  roads linking the parts of the country.    It was in this very region that Bosnian President Alija  Izetbegovic enjoys popularity that goes beyond his position as  the symbol of the Bosnian Muslims in a unique historical period  for them, during which they escaped the knives of the Serbs and  Croats. Pictures of him have replaced those of former Yugoslav  leader Josip Tito, who just a few months ago still presided over  government offices and official institutions, with poems and  popular songs praising and singing about him.    The speech he gave during his tour through this region a few  weeks ago was accorded great importance by the man in the  street--in it, he promised that the Bosnian army would soon move  from a defense phase to a liberation phase--especially as it  coincided with news, spread unofficially and unannounced, about  the achievement of military progress on the military fronts with  both the Croats and the Serbs.    For example, a week never passes without military units of  the Bosnian army succeeding in pushing back the Croatian  militias, which seem to be suffering from poor conditions,  especially in the regions of Kiseljuk, Busovaca, and Vitez,  whose city center has now become visible.    In recent weeks, Bosnian fighters have made considerable  progress around the capital, acknowledged by the official  spokesman of the international forces in Sarajevo, though it has  not been announced in its official media. Last week, the Serbs  began a huge military campaign on several fronts, and met with  devastating failure.    According to information AL-HAYAH obtained, there is a new  attempt to break the siege around the capital, planned for a day  and night some months ago, but awaiting the right moment for its  implementation.    The arms and ammunition crisis is no longer the Bosnian  army's worst problem; that is now the lack of the fuel necessary  for aid and supply operations, which were halted after the  outbreak of war between the Muslims and Croats. It had reached  them through Croatian territory, causing them difficult  problems, compelling Bosnian soldiers to march on foot from one  point to another.    In spite of what the Muslims have suffered at Serbian and  Croatian hands, there is a large sector of them who still  believe that coexistence by the three communities is possible.  There are still some Serbs and Croats who hold official posts,  and sometimes high office, in these regions. Even so, Serb and  Croat citizens living there are in no danger or threat of losing  their jobs or homes, or of being rounded up as happened to  Muslims in the regions occupied by Serbian or Croatian militias.    The trinity of war, hunger, and cold have imposed a high  degree of social and economic solidarity on the Bosnian people,  among individuals and whole cities. Basic goods and commodities  are bartered; Sarajevo, for example, sends flour to the cities  of the central region, which in turn send meat to Sarajevo.    Some negative social phenomena, such as stealing and moral  corruption, have, however, begun to appear on the surface,  though they are still less than in other parts of the world  afflicted with this kind of war.    This vital region of the country has gone through a  considerable period of self-sufficiency in terms of foodstuffs,  repairing the effects of war imposed by the Serbian militias,  and cutting aid routes using the Croatian militias. Some  villages are in no need of food aid, which was coming  sporadically from the [High] Commission for Refugees and  international aid agencies.    According to the new redisticting that the Bosnian  Government  has organized, the district of Zenta has come to include 14  municipalities in central Bosnia-Herzegovina, with a population  of about 1 million, the overwhelming majority of whom are  Muslims. They include six municipalities either totally or  partially occupied by Serbian or Croatian militias.    Fuad Dzidic, recently appointed minister of this district by  the Bosnian government as part of the system that divided the  Muslims' areas into four (with a minister responsible for each),  said, "We are proceeding with an ordered plan that we hope to  complete to implement self-sufficiency, beginning with grains  and vegetables." However, he thinks that the war going on in his  region began before the Serbian and Croatian military invasion  of it. "Iron and wood industries have been based in this region  since the days of communist rule, plus coal and iron mines,  causing a great deal of environmental pollution, which has  negatively affected the volume of agricultural space in the  region." He cited as an example a steel factory, the largest in  former Yugoslavia, located in the center of the city of Zenica.  It used to produce two million tons annually, without the use of  any purifying filters. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Arts: Today's Television What on earth is happening to the world of classical music? Ever since it originated in the Third Programme, the home of classical music on BBC radio, now called Radio 3, has been regarded as the last redoubt of highbrow taste. But if you told BBC mandarins that it was mad not to run a popular classical network, they muttered about turning Bach into aural wallpaper. Then commercial radio launched Classic FM, which took millions of listeners from the BBC. Their Evening Concert (8.00) tended to offer the sort of lollipops that made Radio 3 men wince. But now what do you find? At 7.30 today, pre-empting the Classic FM concert by half an hour, Radio 3 broadcasts the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra playing Tchaikovsky's Capriccio Italien and then Rachmaninov's second piano concerto (yes, Brief Encounter) with pianist Dmitri Alexeev. And the Classic concert? Today it features contemporary British music including the broadcast premiere of George Lloyd's Symphonic Mass performed by the Brighton Festival Chorus and the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra. Just who is stealing whose clothes?</p>

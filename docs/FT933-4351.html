			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of Northern Ireland (8): Convinced that the border will be irrelevant / Profile of John Hume THERE is an infectious optimism about Mr John Hume, the leader and founding member of the Social Democratic Labour Party (SDLP), that sheds a few rays of light on to the otherwise impenetrable gloom that has come to characterise Northern Ireland politics. He is convinced that nationalism, be it catholic- or protestant-orientated, will gradually dissipate in the new European union that is being forged in Brussels. This conviction is the driving force behind his vision for new political structures in Northern Ireland which, he believes, will eventually transcend the border on the island of Ireland and make it irrelevant. Mr Hume says: 'What we are facing is an absolute reality that the world is a smaller place, in terms of technology, transport and communications. It is natural that that change should be reflected in political institutions. Once upon a time we had city-states. Then we moved to nation-states and now we are moving to a continental one. It is a natural evolution. We are living in a post-nationalist world'. Is he not discouraged by the recent chaos in the ERM and the setbacks to monetary union? 'It simply reinforces my view that the logic of a single market is a single currency' he replies. John Hume cut his political teeth in the civil rights movement in Londonderry in the late 1960s, when he sat in front of British armoured cars and mediated between crowds of rock-throwing youths and army officers, was drenched by water cannons and arrested for his efforts. He went on to become a founding member of the SDLP in 1970 - 'to re-define nationalism,' in his own words. 'The problem is about people, not territory - it is the people that are divided, not the territory. We have to find the mechanisms for uniting people. Only when people start working together, spilling sweat and not blood, will the old prejudices disappear. There is no other way of solving the problem'. One of his abiding memories is as a 10-year-old watching an Orange Order march in Derry, when his father, unemployed at the time, placed a hand on his shoulder and said: 'Just remember, John, you can't eat flags.' John Hume says he was strongly influenced by the non-violent preachings for change advocated by Martin Luther King in the US, and by the whole process of the creation of the European Community. He has been in talks with Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, since last April, with a view to bringing about a permanent ceasefire between the IRA and the Loyalist paramilitaries in the province. Mr Hume is not one to be baulked by criticism of his ideas or his tactics. 'I am criticised for my approaches, but nobody else is putting any new proposals on the table. I want to see an agreed Ireland, not a united Ireland. I want a new Ireland in a new Europe. I am more confident now about the future than I have been for the past 20 years. In 10 to 20 years more there will be a whole new ball game.'</p>

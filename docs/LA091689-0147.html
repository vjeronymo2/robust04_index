			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DISCOVERY: OLD WORLD VILLAGE  </P> <P> While Orange County is called home by people of many cultures, finding a  European flavor in one stop is a tough order. But at Old World Village, at  least, visitors can douse themselves in all things German -- from lederhosen to  oompah music.  </P> <P> More than 40 families live in the village, above the shops and restaurants they  own and operate. The ethnic charm of the place is abundant -- the cobbled  walkways, the painted designs on the stores' exteriors, and the wooden signs  hanging from wrought-iron posts above the doors.  </P> <P> A variety of goods are available at the village's 30 or so shops, including  German clothing and shoes, collectibles, crystal, porcelain, flowers and  clocks. Two restaurants, a deli and a bakery tempt visitors with the smells of  bratwurst, sauerkraut and other traditional German treats.  </P> <P> The 13-room Hotel Europe can accommodate guests wishing to stay overnight. The  150-seat Old World Village Chapel offers Sunday services in both English and  German and is available for weddings.  </P> <P> The village in Huntington Beach celebrated its 10th anniversary last year. The  year before the shops opened, the first Oktoberfest was held on the grounds. On  an average weekend 500 people visit the village, but the crowds number in the  thousands during Oktoberfest weekends. This year's Oktoberfest kicks off Sept.  24 with a parade at 2 p.m. and will continue through Nov. 12. Music, dancing  and lots of German food and beer will be available, which seems the perfect  time to visit Old World Village and revel in German culture.  </P> <P> Hours: Shops are open from 10 or 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. They will stay open  later during Oktoberfest.  </P> <P> Address: 7561 Center Ave., Huntington Beach  </P> <P> Telephone: (714) 895-8020  </P> <P> Miscellaneous information: Restaurants open daily at 11 a.m. There will be live  entertainment during Oktoberfest (Sept. 24 through Nov. 12) performed by oompah  bands from Germany. Oktoberfest hours are 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Wednesday, 7  to 11 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday, 6:30 p.m. to 1 a.m. Friday and Saturday and  2 to 9 p.m. Sunday.  </P></p>

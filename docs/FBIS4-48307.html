			<p>BFN     [Text] The premier of the Orange Free State, Mr. Patrick  Lekota, has admonished the people of the region to respect  government leaders. He was speaking at Springbok Park in  Bloemfontein where many were celebrating their freedom. Even  the premier moved to the beat of the music. In his address Mr.  Lekota said the leaders in the new government will have to be  given a chance. He said, however, that the ideas of Mr. Eugene  Terreblanche and Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg and all who entertained  their war mongering ideas will not be given a chance. A  government spokesman, Reverend Motlalepule Shabaku, urged  students to dedicate their time to school work for a bright  future. He said the time when a black man was passed up for a  job because of the color of his skin is now over.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Adnan Husayn: "Armed Clashes Renewed Between </F> Kurdish Parties in Northern Iraq"]    [Text] London -- Two years after the first general free  multiparty elections in Iraqi Kurdistan (yesterday was the  anniversary), an increasing number of Iraqi Kurds feel  frustrated and disappointed as armed clashes between Kurdish  parties continue for the third consecutive week resulting in  major human and material losses as well as disruption of normal  life and appearance of signs of foreign intervention in Kurdish  affairs. Independent Kurdish sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT  yesterday that the fighting which began at the beginning of this  month between the militias of the Kurdistan Democratic Party led  by Mas'ud Barzani and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] led  by Jalal Talabani has resulted in hundreds of military and  civilian casualties, both dead and wounded, and similar numbers  taken prisoner, in addition to serious material losses. The  sources said that tension returned in the past few days after  last week's guarded calm during which the leaders of the parties  of Barzani and Talabani tried in vain to implement agreements  they had reached for stopping the fighting and normalizing the  situation.    Sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that fierce fighting  broke out yesterday between the two parties in the strategic  city of Shaqlawah near Irbil, the capital of the Kurdish region,  and, according to some other sources, widespread clashes have  been going on for days in the eastern areas near the border with  Iran between PUK forces and forces of the Islamic Movement of  Iraqi Kurdistan [IMIK] and Hizballah, the two Islamic  organizations suspected of receiving financial and military aid  from Iran.    The sources also said that a prominent member of Talabani's  party was killed last Tuesday in an ambush laid by the  Islamists. They said that Hasan Kawistani, member of the PUK  leadership, and 16 of his companions were killed in the Hajj  'Umran area northeast of Irbil near the border with Iran when  they were on their way to a meeting with local officials of  Barzani's party.    The same sources said that the population in Irbil,  al-Sulaymaniyah, and other Kurdish cities are facing increasing  shortages of food, medicine, and basic services because of the  suspension of transport movement on the road linking the two  biggest Kurdish cities with Zakhu near the Turkish border,  through which the Kurds received most of their food and medical  needs.</p>

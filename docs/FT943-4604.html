			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Hilton to build hotel in Belfast Hilton International, the hotel chain which is owned by Ladbroke Group, yesterday announced plans to build a Pounds 17m luxury hotel in Belfast. The hotel will be one of the biggest developments in the Laganbank area, Belfast's main inner city project. Hilton will build the 187-room hotel with Ewart, the Belfast-based property and investment company. Hilton and Ewart are putting up Pounds 10m in equity and debt finance and the balance will come from grants from the Laganside Corporation, with support from the Northern Ireland Tourist Board. Construction is expected to start early next year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Tan Jianrong: "Choice of Hosokawa's </F> Successor Splits Coalition"]    [Text] Tokyo, April 10 (XINHUA) -- While coalition leaders  stressed today that the framework of the current coalition  should be preserved, many analysts doubt whether the coalition  government will be able to agree on a new leader, let alone  solidly unite behind one.    The coalition is deeply divided over Japan's future  political  alignment.    It is also doubtful whether a new coalition leader will be  able to effectively tackle a horde of issues such as winning  Diet (parliament) approval for the fiscal 1994 budget,  implementing economic reforms, deregulating government controls  on businesses and defusing Japan-U.S. trade tensions.    As representatives of the seven ruling coalition parties  ended talks today aimed at picking a successor to outgoing Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, discord among them over who should  be chosen and how to choose is pushing an already fragile  alliance to the verge of division.    The Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest political  force in the coalition, proposed holding a meeting of coalition  leaders on Monday [11 April] to name a successor, party  officials said.    The SDP, new party Sakigake (Harbinger) and the Democratic  Socialist Party (DSP) are fighting the proposal by Shinseito  (Japan Renewal Party) and Komeito (Clean Government Party) to  pick Hosokawa's successor through representative dialogue.    The SDP told other coalition partners it was skipping the  next round of talks, scheduled for this afternoon.    Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura, who is also chief  cabinet  secretary in the Hosokawa administration, has said that talks  among party representatives are no longer functioning. He has  proposed that coalition leaders meet to discuss the formation of  a post- Hosokawa cabinet.    Rivalry within the eight-month-old coalition has intensified  over the selection of a successor since last Friday when  Hosokawa abruptly decided to step down and take responsibility  for dubious financial dealings, and for the month-long deadlock  in the Diet over the state budget for fiscal 1994.    Although coalition leaders agreed Saturday to pick  Hosokawa's  successor and to form a new cabinet by the end of this week, the  SDP is resisting a move to name Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata,  one of the most promising candidates for the premiership, as new  prime minister.    The Shinseito party, led by Hata, and the Komeito party  envision a new government made up of parties which are in full  accords on key issues such as tax reform and the nuclear  situation in the Korean peninsula.    The SDP disagrees with this stand, saying that the top  priority should be how to maintain the framework of a unified  coalition and keep it in power.    According to political analysts, in the event of a new  realignment of political parties, former Foreign Minister Michio  Watanabe and former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, both from the  opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), may emerge as front  runners for the premiership.    Watanabe has maintained close relations with Ichiro Ozawa,  Shinseito co-leader and the main strategist of the coalition,  even through Ozawa bolted the LDP last summer to form the  Shinseito party.    Appearing on television today with Hata and two other  coalition leaders, Watanabe, also a former vice premier,  signaled his willingness to run for prime minister if there are  a "comfortable" number of LDP members who will support him.    However, SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama voiced skepticism  about working together with the LDP saying, "there is no such  possibility."    Differences in political outlook among coalition leaders  became clear one month ago when discussions began on coalition  members forming a single party.    Plainly put, the second act of Japan's political regrouping  is now in progress. Act one was the fall of the LDP, which had  dominated Japan's scandal-ridden political world for an  uninterrupted 38 years, and the birth of the Hosokawa-led  coalition government.    There now appears to be two options for the second  realignment, political sources said. One would be the formation  of a triangular structure made up of the LDP, a group  encompassing Shinseito and Komeito, and a third bloc comprising  the SDP, the DSP, and Sakigake. The other option would lead to  two large conservative parties, one led by the LDP and the other  by newer conservatives.    Power struggles between the Shinseito-Komeito-JNP [Japan New  Party] camp on one hand and a group comprising the SDP, the DSP  and Sakigake on the other has intensified as the former has  tried to unify the coalition members into one party.    They maintain that the coalition must unite as one party  under a new electoral system to prevent the opposition LDP from  recapturing power in the next general election.    Some analysts have long predicted that the Hosokawa  government was doomed because political reform was achieved in  January focusing on the introduction of a new single-seat  electoral system for the House of Representatives.    After accomplishing this reform, Hosokawa charted new  political terrain by proposing economic and administrative  reforms as new policy goals. Since then, the coalition  government has been troubled by internal divisions.    The Hosokawa cabinet will remain as caretaker until a new  prime minister is chosen by the end of this week. No matter who  takes the reins of the new government, there is a bumpy road  ahead for the ruling coalition.</p>

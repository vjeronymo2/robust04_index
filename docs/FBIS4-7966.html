			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Belgrade, 5 April (TANJUG) -- According to a  statement by the Federal Ministry of Information, at its  session, chaired by Prime Minister Radoje Kontic, today the  Federal Government examined and adopted the draft law on a  foreign currency loan to be raised by the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia [FRY] both at home and abroad to the tune of $300  million to finance its program of transforming monetary system  and the strategy of the country's economic recovery. [passage  omitted]    Under the draft law, the loan would be paid off over  two-year  period with a one-year grace period and at the interest rate and  other terms as customary on the financial market. The loan will  be repaid in 12 equal monthly installments and the loan  repayment fund -- to equal the amount used up -- will be secured  by the FRY, or rather the republics. [passage omitted]    At this evening's session the Federal Government considered  and approved a document entitled: "FRY Government stances on the  initiatives of other states to conclude agreements on friendship  and cooperation."    Bearing in mind the changes which have taken place in  Europe,  globally and in the Balkans, as well as changes in the  international position of the FRY, the Federal Government  assesses that it is necessary to accept the initiatives of  friendly, neighboring countries to conclude general agreements  on friendship, good-neighborliness and cooperation in order to  strengthen the country's international position and stimulate  bilateral and multilateral cooperation. [passage omitted]    The government at the same time approved the Yugoslav draft  text of an agreement on friendship and cooperation between the  FRY and Romania, the Federal Information Ministry's statement  says at the end.</p>

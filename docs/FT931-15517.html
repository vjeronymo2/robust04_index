			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Certified accountants' audits rapped FEWER THAN half of the certified accountants registered to conduct audits of British companies performed satisfactorily, their regulatory body's first annual report said yesterday. Of the 297 firms and sole practitioners visited by the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants 139 were judged to have poorly developed quality controls or to have produced work which failed to support the opinions they gave. A further 23 firms - 8 per cent - were considered potentially in breach of audit regulations or professional conduct rules to an extent sufficient to justify immediate action. Only 134 firms - 45 per cent - were found to be satisfactory, with only minor deficiencies identified. The figures are contained in the first annual report submitted by the association to the Department of Trade and Industry since a new system of self-regulation of auditors was introduced in October 1991. The association found that many firms did not have systems in place that allowed their audit work to be assessed by regulators. Most firms were in the course of updating their auditing methods and documentation as a result of the new regulatory regime. One of the most common problems was that many auditors kept too much work in their heads, rather than recording it so it could be assessed by independent inspectors. Mr Anthony Booth, under-secretary of the association, said regulation had brought a 'dramatic improvement in standards of auditing' by the end of the first year. He said that problems identified early in the first year of monitoring had been declining and that any disciplinary cases had been dealt with 'firmly and swiftly'. The report shows that one fifth of practices visited need to be revisited within two years to ensure that any deficiencies were corrected. The association received 350 complaints during the year, including 245 concerning practising members. Most referred to disputes over fees, and there was found to be no case to answer for almost half the total. But eight complaints have ended in disciplinary action, including one against a member who went into partnership with a convicted fraudster, one declared bankrupt and one who had been disqualified as a company director. Two individuals were expelled, four firms had their auditing certificates withdrawn and five agreed to stop audit work while a further 59 will be revisited within two years. The association represents 39,000 members around the world, and 3,412 separate practising units have registered to conduct audits in the UK. The association plans to visit all registrants within five years. The report shows that the cost of audit regulation to the association was Pounds 362,500 last year against about Pounds 115,000 in the previous 12 months in development costs.</p>

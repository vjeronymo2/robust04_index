			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The proposed rule also incorporates the so-called ``booking rejection'' and ``contingent booking'' procedures currently found in &sect;380.31(c) of the Super Bowl charter rule, and expands them to apply to all events and to all forms of air transportation. These provisions require operators to return unsolicited bookings for which they don't have event tickets unless a tour participant authorizes the operator in writing to retain the participant's payment while the operator attempts to obtain more event tickets. We are modifying this slightly to allow for situations in which participants agree to take the tour without an event ticket; the operator would be required to obtain the participant's written acknowledgment of this understanding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of the key provisions of the Super Bowl charter rule is the requirement for the operator to refund the total tour price to any participant who does not receive a promised game ticket, even if the participant uses all of the other tour features. The ANPRM tentatively proposed to incorporate this provision in the new rule, but also asked for comment on whether the rule should contain only the ``booking rejection'' and ``contingent booking'' procedures without the ``money back guarantee.'' However, the comments solidly supported the ``money back guarantee,'' and we have incorporated it in the proposed rule. We agree with the Football Bowl Association that strong consumer remedies will also have the effect of deterring the promotion of non-legitimate tour packages. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NACA commented that there should be an exception to the ``money back guarantee'' for situations of force majeure and acts of God, such as the earthquake in San Francisco that caused postponement of the World Series. The NHL suggested that if the event is canceled or substantially altered, participants should be entitled only to a refund of the face value of the event, not the total tour price. It was never our intent to make the tour operator the guarantor of the event itself. The ``money back guarantee'' in the existing Super Bowl charter rule kicks in ``if game tickets are not supplied.'' The rule we are proposing here would require refunds ``.&blank;.&blank;. if promised admission to the [event] is not furnished by the tour operator .&blank;.&blank;.'' These provisions are directed toward potential problems with ticket distribution, not with the event itself. If people who have <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  tickets are able to attend the event and Special Event Tour participants are shut out because they don't have tickets, the ``money back guarantee'' applies. On the other hand, if nobody with a ticket can use it during the period of the tour because the event itself was canceled or postponed, the ``money back guarantee'' does not apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We wish to make it clear that we are talking only about problems with the event itself, not about any or all problems that the tour operator might view as beyond its control. Failure of a ticket broker to deliver tickets to the tour operator does not invalidate the ``money back guarantee.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We agree with the NHL that if the event is canceled consumers should receive a refund for the portion of their tour price that applied to the event that they paid for but did not receive. However, mandating such a partial refund in a situation where the event itself did not take place and where there were no problems with ticket distribution is beyond the scope of this proceeding. This is a matter best dealt with in the context of contract law or other applicable existing law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ANPRM solicited comment on whether the rule should include procedures to protect the tour operator from having to refund the total tour price to participants who don't receive promised admission to an ``event'' like a welcoming cocktail party. Most commenters who addressed this issue were opposed to requiring a refund of the entire tour price in these circumstances. Some suggested that participants so affected simply be entitled to a refund of the value of that ancillary event. Two commenters urged that a tour operator's failure to deliver admission to ancillary events that are integral to the experience for which the tour was organized (e.g., the Tournament of Roses parade on a Rose Bowl tour) should entitle the participant to a refund of the total tour price. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In raising this issue in the ANPRM, the Department had intended to focus on the situation of a tour that would not normally be thought of as a Special Event Tour but which held out admission to an ``event'' as one of its features, e.g., a welcoming cocktail party on a 5-day package to the Bahamas. If the definition of ``special event'' had been broad, we were concerned that the rule might have the effect of requiring refunds of the entire price on such tours after failure to deliver a relatively minor and low-value component. The comments have shed light on another issue: multiple ``events'' on a true Special Event Tour.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We agree with the commenters that failure to deliver a relatively minor feature should not result in a refund of the total tour price. We also feel that this rule should be limited to tours that are organized around an event, not to events that occur in the normal course of the typical vacation tour. Accordingly, we have limited the scope of the proposed rule in two ways. First, there will be a definition of ``Special Event Tour'' in proposed &sect;381.5 which is broad yet specific; it will limit the applicability of the rule to tours to sporting, social, religious, educational, cultural, political or other event of a special nature and limited duration, which exist for reasons apart from the tour itself. Second, the ``money back guarantee'' in proposed &sect;381.11 will apply only to the primary event for which a Special Event Tour is organized. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Limiting the ``money back guarantee'' to the primary event on the tour will solve the problem of having this guarantee cover minor events on a true Special Event Tour. However, it will also have the effect of excluding some more significant events such as the Tournament of Roses parade. Nonetheless, we have tentatively decided to move in this direction. Identifying the primary event on a Special Event Tour will seldom be a matter of debate. However, identifying secondary events that are ``integral to the experience'' of the tour would be a far more subjective exercise, and in any event is beyond the scope of this proceeding as set forth in the ANPRM. Tour participants who do not receive promised admission to a secondary event may have a contractual right to a refund of the value of that event, and they can pursue that with the tour operator. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the ANPRM, the Department solicited comment on whether the rule should ban last-minute or post-departure price increases, something which occurred on certain tours to the 1994 Rose Bowl. The great majority of the comments on this subject favored banning such increases. Some commenters said no price increase should be permitted unless the tour operator has reserved this right in writing and allows participants to cancel and receive a full refund in the event of a price increase. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have decided to incorporate into the proposed rule the price increase provisions of the Department's Public Charter rule (14 CFR &sect;380.33). While it is not our intent in this proceeding to address all potential sources of consumer harm on Special Event Tours, the issue of price increases is directly related to the issue of ticket availability. Almost any event ticket is procurable if the price is right; if we did not regulate price increases in the Special Event Tour rule, tour operators would always be able to acquire event tickets at greatly inflated prices and then simply increase the price to the participant to cover it. Since a ticket has been offered in this situation, the ``money back guarantee'' would not come into play. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed provisions on price increases, modeled on similar provisions in the charter rule, state that if a given participant is assessed price increases for the tour that in the aggregate are more than 10 percent above his or her original tour price, the participant shall have the right to cancel and receive a full refund (i.e., no cancellation penalties would apply). No price increases in any amount would be permitted less than 5 days before departure (as opposed to 10 days in the charter rule, recognizing the fact that Special Event Tours often have shorter lead times than the typical charter). This would eliminate both last-minute and post-departure price hikes. Finally, proposed &sect;381.11 specifies that the promised event ticket must be furnished at the price agreed to before departure or else the operator is subject to the ``money back guarantee'' just as if he had not provided the ticket at all. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NHL commented that for events with short lead times such as the Stanley Cup playoffs, the rule should permit tours on which participants are required to agree to purchase event tickets at the yet-unknown face price plus a service fee, as long as the consumer is given prominent notice of this fact. As an initial matter, we would point out that a tour would not be covered under this rule at all if the event ticket were simply held out as an option rather than as a mandatory feature. However, where the participant must agree to buy the event ticket, such tours are clearly Special Event Tours since the tour operator is representing that admission to the event is included in the tour (even if the price of that admission is not yet known and consequently any price that is advertised for that tour is not the full tour price).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, nothing in the proposed rule would explicitly prohibit a transaction of this type. The operator would still have to have the requisite number of event tickets under contract before advertising or sales could begin; in other words, the variable must be price, not availability. Beyond that, the proposed rule requires that tour participants must receive promised event tickets ``at the tour price agreed to before departure'' or else the participant is entitled to a refund of the total tour price. If a participant agrees to a price consisting of a known value  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> p <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  plus an unknown value  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and the operator delivers the tour (including the event ticket) at that price, the operator has satisfied the requirements of the rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

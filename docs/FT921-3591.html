			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Appointments: Hunter leaves his footprint 'One of the principal features of our headquarters at present is a lot of empty offices,' boasts HunterPrint chief executive Tony Caplin, who is trying to turn round the specialist magazine and catalogue printer. Another office has just been vacated, notably that of deputy chairman and founder Michael Hunter, who has resigned 15 months after Sir Ian MacGregor, 80 next September, replaced Hunter as chairman in a refinancing operation. Hunter, 55, once a leading entrepreneur and innovative force in the printing industry, incorporated his company in 1965; but three years ago he slipped up with the timing of his decision to amalgamate operations, previously spread around the country, into a single site at Corby. Probably the most modern web offset plant in the UK under one roof, Corby, however, went up as interest rates soared, the company had great difficulties relocating staff, and HunterPrint teetered on the edge of bankruptcy. Enter Sir Ian and a team including Tony Caplin, previously with First City of Great Britain, the Canadian Belzberg brothers' then UK investment vehicle. Although the shares are languishing, Caplin, 41, is proud of his record of increased productivity and of a swelling order book - believed by industry insiders to have been boosted recently by a big contract for one of the Sunday supplements. The new management at HunterPrint had not expected Hunter to want to stay on the board following the rescue in December 1990 and hence were not surprised by his decision to go now. It is not known whether Hunter has other plans. He retains a 1.4 per cent stake in the company - diluted heavily by the rescue package.</p>

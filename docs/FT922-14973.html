			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US pork producers in export subsidy row AMERICAN PORK producers and their supporters in Congress are up in arms about the US Department of Agriculture's rejection of export subsidies for the sale of pork to the Commonwealth of Independent States. In a letter to President Bush, Congressman Jim Leach, an Iowa republican, warned of political trouble ahead 'if the administration does not give farmers a sense that they have the ear of and a stake in this administration'. Otherwise, he said: 'I have no doubt that rural America will look to alternative leadership.' The Bush administration on Wednesday called for an additional Dollars 1.1bn worth of credit guarantees for the CIS. For years it provided the former Soviet government with subsidies for grain - mostly wheat - and even poultry. But it is resisting expanding the Export Enhancement subsidy programme (EEP) to other meat, even though pork supplies are likely to be at their highest point in recent history. Officials of Prodintorg, the Russian buying agency, were in Washington this week, to request subsidies for the proposed sale, of 30,000 tonnes of pork. Congressmen Leach and 59 other members of the House of Representatives and the Senate urged the administration to support the sale in order to help develop new markets. They contended that US subsidy funding would be better spent on value-added exports, particularly those in which 'the Europeans are developing a virtual monopoly'. The USDA gave no reason for rejecting the offer and said it might be considered later on. There was speculation that the State Department did not want to interfere with Poland and other Eastern European countries obtaining a share of the market in a area where they are competitive. The National Pork Producers Council issued a statement declaring its disappointment. 'The NPPC cannot get a straight answer from the administration officials as to why the use of EEP funds was rejected,' it said. 'It clearly shows that the administration still does not have the message when it comes to the need for value-added exports. It sounds like business as usual.'</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Portugal hits at E Timor attack Portugal protested yesterday at an attack by Indonesian soldiers on a student demonstration in the troubled island of East Timor and called for a strong international response, Reuter reports from Lisbon. 'Portugal wants a strong international reaction to the events in the territory,' the Portuguese news agency Lusa quoted Mr Jose Manuel Durao Barroso, foreign minister, as saying. Lisbon felt obliged 'vehemently to protest at the intolerable situation in East Timor,' he declared. Up to 20 people were injured yesterday in clashes between student protesters and the Indonesian security forces, the worst recorded confrontation in East Timor since Indonesian troops opened fire on mourners for a pro-independence activist in November 1991, killing up to 200 people. An Indonesian military official in the East Timor capital Dili said two students had been injured and 10 arrested as the security forces stopped several hundred protesters marching from the university campus to the regional parliament. But residents said about 20 people had been injured; some reports said three people had been killed.</p>

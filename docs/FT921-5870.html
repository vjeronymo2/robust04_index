			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Observer: Mused Observer would like to thank respondents to last week's 'Musing' teaser for their ingenious replies. The bottle of finest malt goes to William Pitt, the first reader correctly to identify the reference concerning advances French insurer Assurances Generales de France is making on the reluctant maiden, Aachen-based German group Aachener &amp; Munchener, which has other ideas about how it wishes to pursue its European liaisons. AGF has accumulated a 25 per cent stake in AMB, but the Germans have been refusing to register the bulk of the shares - hence 'your stock is not votund'. For readers who skipped Greek classes, 'epithalamium' is the nuptial song serenading the unhappy pair - joined in matrimony as yet only in the minds of stockmarket rumour-mongers.</p>

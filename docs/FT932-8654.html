			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Observer: Picking winners When tipping political stars, as opposed to the stock market, Kleinwort Benson's record is better than most. Hence the appointment of David Willetts, ex-director of the Centre for Political Studies, as its political consultant has caught the eye. Judging by the careers of most of Willetts' predecessors, such as John Biffen, Chris Patten and Michael Portillo, the 37-year-old MP may be bound for ministerial office. Certainly Judith Chaplin had been marked out before her untimely death. But it seems odd that KB did not reappoint Nigel Forman, Chaplin's predecessor and Nigel Lawson's former PPS, as its consultant. After all, he has just replaced Chaplin as parliamentary adviser to the Institute of Chartered Accountants, and only gave up his KB post a year ago to become a junior Education minister. Could KB's psephologists have decided that Forman is no longer marked out for high office? For what it's worth, Observer's view is that the ICA's gain is KB's loss.</p>

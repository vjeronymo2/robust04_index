			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions and US revival behind Danka increase ACQUISITIONS and a revival in the US business economy helped boost annual pre-tax profits at Danka Business Systems, the office equipment supplier, by 63 per cent to Pounds 17.5m on sales ahead 62 per cent to Pounds 186.3m. Mr Dan Doyle, chief executive, said the US-based company had purchased nine businesses last year, adding Pounds 22m in sales and Pounds 1.4m in profits. Stripping out the acquisitions, Mr Doyle said operating profits for the year to March 31 were ahead 42 per cent at Pounds 17.4m. The final dividend is raised 20 per cent to 3p for a total of 4.5p (3.75p). Earnings were up 58 per cent at 42.2p. Mr Doyle said much of the profits growth came from the release of pent up demand for office equipment, which many businesses had delayed replacing during the recession. The improvement was also due to the restructuring of many businesses purchased in the previous year. Mr Doyle said the group intended to pursue acquisitions in the current year, funding purchases through cash flow and recently increased banking facilities. Earlier this week, Danka paid Dollars 7.2m (Pounds 4.67m) for three businesses in the US, with turnover of more than Dollars 30m. The group also announced plans for a 4-for-1 share split, aimed at improving marketability. The shares closed 13p higher at 783p.</p>

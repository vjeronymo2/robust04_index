			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: M and S easier Up-market retailer Marks and Spencer saw its shares roller coaster through a 20-point turnround as it reported full year results. The figures came in at the top end of expectations and the shares surged on the news. However, a seemingly downbeat analysts meeting, followed by further inspection of the results, saw the stock marked back sharply. It finished 9 1/2 down at 345 1/2 p after turnover of 12m. Kleinwort Benson was one of a number of brokers said to have moved the stock off its buy list to a hold. Stores specialists said that while the figures confirmed M and S's premium market rating, the prospective earnings growth was around half the average forecast for the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index in the next year. 'Investors are looking for more dynamic recovery stocks than M and S,' was the comment from one stores analyst. One of the issues to unsettle the market and compound the uncertainties over earnings growth was the size of the company's proposed wage award. Rumours late in the day that M and S might be considering a fund-raising exercise to tie into low interest rates were dismissed by analysts.</p>

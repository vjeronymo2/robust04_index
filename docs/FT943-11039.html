			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / M0 growth rate slows to 6.5% A slowdown in the annual rate of growth of M0, the narrow measure of money supply, provided some encouraging economic news for the Bank of England ahead of the publication of its quarterly inflation report today. The annual rate fell to a seasonally adjusted 6.5 per cent in July, from 6.9 per cent in June, according to figures released by the Bank yesterday. This decline was smaller than analysts had expected and the annual rate remains well above the government's 0 per cent to 4 per cent monitoring range. Nevertheless the slowdown will be seen as good news by monetary authorities. M0 is used as an inflationary indicator by the Treasury and the Bank of England, and is seen as a reasonably accurate indicator of consumer spending. Mr Eddie George, the Bank governor, in the minutes of his monthly meeting on June 8 with the Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, expressed concern about rapid growth in M0. The three-month annualised growth rate was described in the minutes as being 'uncomfortably high and the governor would be looking for it to decline in the coming months'. Yesterday's figures show that the three-month annualised rate fell to 6.5 per cent last month from 8.3 per cent in June. Past explanations for the rapid growth in M0 have centred on the role of low interest rates, which have reduced the effective costs to consumers of holding cash. However, the authorities believe that this effect will gradually disappear from the figures. M0 grew 0.7 per cent between June and July, but part of this was because of a sharp rise in bankers' operational deposits. The less volatile notes and coins component grew a seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent last month for an annual rate of 6.5 per cent, down from 6.7 per cent in June.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, 18 Jun (KUNA) -- Seventeen people have been  wounded in fierce fighting at the fronts surrounding Aden. The  fighting continued until the early hours of 18 June.    The northern forces managed last night -- for the second  consecutive day -- to advance a personnel carrier mounted with  Katyusha rockets in order to shell the port of Aden; however,  the rockets fell on some residential areas close to the port.  Other rockets fell on the area surrounding Aden airport,  injuring 17 people.    Last Thursday, a northern Katyusha vehicle managed to  penetrate southern defense lines in the Bi'r Ahmad area, some 30  km northwest of Aden, where it fired its rockets and hit a  shipyard in the port area. Another vehicle managed at dawn  yesterday to penetrate several kilometers inside the Sabr front,  situated 30 km north of Aden, and fired its rockets, which hit a  military camp near the area of Aden airport.</p>

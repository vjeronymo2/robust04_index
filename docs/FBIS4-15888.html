			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Bunin: "`Help the Reforms, Not the </F> Politicians.' Results of Kazakhstani President's Visit to  Japan"]    [Text] Tokyo -- The first $120 million of Japanese  Government aid and a "high assessment" of Kazakhstan's efforts  in dismantling the nuclear arsenal, establishing market  procedures, and democratizing society -- that was the chief  result of President Nursultan Nazarbayev's first visit to Japan.    "Russia without the territorial issue" -- this is the  frequently heard unofficial Japanese view of Kazakhstan, hinting  at the country's immense natural resources and industrial  potential. The two years that have elapsed since the  establishment of Japanese-Kazakhstani diplomatic relations have  been marked by a rapid blossoming of mutual contacts. Alma-Ata  [Almaty] has become a Mecca for Japanese businessmen. The red  carpet has been rolled out regularly for Kazkah visitors to  Tokyo, where they have been given a very attentive hearing in  the highest reaches of the business world. This is all boils  down to the fact that between 20 and 30 percent of the world's  entire stocks of many valuable types of fuel, chemical raw  materials, and nonferrous and rare-earth metals, largely  undeveloped, are on Kazakhstan territory.    But almost immediately there energed some intractable  problems, although bilateral trade has actually increased,  reaching the as yet not very impressive figure of $37 million.  The first and biggest obstacle is that Kazkahstan has no  independent access to the sea and transit communications are  difficult. The second problem is the quality of deliveries. It  is still well short of world standards. According to one  Japanese businessman, who had already failed in that area of  business, the future of trade with Kazakhstan remains illusory  until these two problems are resolved, and this requires massive  capital investment in the infrastructure and in the renovation  of enterprises.    But President Nazarbayev was optimistic when he reported to  journalists on the results of his three days of meetings and  conversations in Tokyo. There will be Japanese investment. The  Kazakhstani leader was able to secure in a very short time  credits worth $220 million from the Japanese export-import bank  -- they will finance numerous private joint projects on the  territory of Kazakhstan. The biggest of them is the  construction of the West Kazakhstan oil refinery, costing $1  billion. A consortium involving the Mistubishi, Mitsui, and  Toya corporations won the construction contract. Agreement was  also reached on the free financing of geological surveys of gas  deposits in the Aral Sea area by the Japanese national oil  corporation. In the future, the president announced, we are  talking about laying a gas pipeline to the shores of Japan.  Finally, there was a promise of comprehensive financial  assistance to develop railroad transport, including the laying  of a "Friendship" track passing through China and terminating at  the East China Sea.    As far as one could judge from the president's words and  from  pronouncements by high-ranking hosts, another contributory  factor in Japan's very favorable attitude toward business  cooperation is Kazakhstan's specific steps to shed the burden of  nuclear weapons. Japan intends to allocate an immediate $110  million for the dismantling of the nuclear arsenals that have  built up over the past 40 years, following hard on the heels of  the United States.    We have never made a secret of the fact that we came here to  resolve the main questions, economic questions, Nazarbayev said  at the final news conference, and we are very satisfied with the  accords that have been reached, since they "pave the way ahead"  and impart "powerful new impetus to our relations in all  spheres."    Should Japan switch to helping the former republics of the  USSR in view of Russia's recent great-power behavior toward its  former dominions? -- a question from the floor. "Russia must be  helped, not for what individual politicians say, but in order to  support the process of reforms and democratization. This is  necessary not only for Russia but for us too, and for you, who  are Russia's neighbors."</p>

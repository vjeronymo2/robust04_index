			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: Body Shop bites the bullet - At a Glance Profits at Body Shop, the cosmetics group, fell 15 per cent in the year to end-February, ending the company's previously rapid growth. Although the group is expanding internationally, the group suffered from falling sales and profits in the UK. However, the group did feel confident enough to increase its total dividend by 6.2 per cent. The company did issue a profits warning last autumn, so the news was not unexpected. The shares rose 6.5p to 204.5p on the day of the announcement but had dropped back to 196p by the end of the week. They have rebounded a long way from the year's low of 133p.</p>

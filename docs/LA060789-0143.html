			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> HONG KONG THREATENS TO SUSPEND ASYLUM FOR VIETNAM BOAT PEOPLE  </P> <P> The Hong Kong government threatened today to suspend asylum for Vietnamese boat  people unless other countries help end an overwhelming flood of refugee  arrivals.  </P> <P> Secretary for Security Geoffrey Barnes said he hopes that an international  conference on refugees meeting in Geneva next week will help resolve the  problem. If not, he said, the government will consider more "radical  alternatives."  </P> <P> Barnes said the exodus from Vietnam, which Monday alone brought an  unprecedented 1,194 boat people to the British colony's shores, has swollen  refugee camps to the bursting point. There are a total of 41,958 Vietnamese in  11 refugee camps and detention centers.  </P> <P> "The pressure on Hong Kong has got to be removed and removed quickly," he said.  </P></p>

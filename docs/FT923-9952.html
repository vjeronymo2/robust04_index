			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Construction chiefs call for currency realignment LEADERS OF Britain's de-pressed construction industry yesterday made one of the strongest appeals to the government to change its economic policy and seek a realignment of currencies within the European exchange rate mechanism. The appeal accompanied a forecast that the recession in the industry, already severe, would be deeper and longer than previously expected. The National Council of Building Material Producers, representing more than 2,000 companies with a combined annual turnover of Pounds 20bn, said UK construction output was likely to fall 8 per cent this year and a further 2.5 per cent next year. Last year it fell 8.9 per cent. Mr Peter Roberts, director responsible for building products at the IMI metals group and chairman of the council's forecasting panel, said: 'Conditions, particularly in the private housing market, have deteriorated since the (April general) election.' More jobs would be lost unless efforts were made to stimulate the economy, Mr Roberts said. 'Very few recoveries start without government pushing some button to start it.' He appealed to the government to use its presidency of the European Community to make a concerted effort with other EC members to realign currencies and bring down interest rates over the the next six months. The Federation of Civil Engineers said Britain should try to agree on realignment even if agreement could not be reached with Germany. It said any attempt by the government to control public spending by cutting capital investment in roads, homes and other infrastructure would be disastrous for the con-struction industry and the country. The federation published a separate survey showing that 40 per cent of civil engineers expect to shed more jobs during the next 12 months.</p>

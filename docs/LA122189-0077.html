			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLEN EXPECTED TO ATTRACT BIG FINANCIAL HELP  </P> <P> George Allen, the new football coach at Cal State Long Beach, stood at the dais  in a conference room of the Long Beach Airport Marriott Hotel, a brown school  cap covering shocks of black hair, a 49er jersey in his hand.  </P> <P> He grinned at the media and waved to friends and former players who had come  Tuesday to wish him well in a job that he called "the toughest in America" --  rebuilding a university football program that was on the verge of extinction  three years ago.  </P> <P> But University President Curtis McCray and Athletic Director Corey Johnson made  it clear that they were hiring the highly successful former National Football  League coach to do more than win games. They also expect the 71-year-old  physical fitness fanatic to give the university a significant financial boost.  </P> <P> "This wasn't purely a football hire," McCray said later during an interview.  "Football is the focus, but I expect (Allen) to do more."  </P> <P> As part of his three-year, $100,000-a-year deal, Allen has pledged help in  raising funds for the school's athletic foundation, which will pay $34,000 of  his salary.  </P> <P> "He has close contacts," McCray said. "We think he can draw the attention and  resources we need."  </P> <P> By using his prestige and personal charisma to encourage major donors to  contribute "private endowments" to the university, McCray said, Allen should be  able to raise at least $1 million by the end of his second football season. "I  expect that he and I will be on the road together," McCray said.  </P> <P> Allen's hiring seemed to be in line with McCray's goal -- announced when he  took office two years ago -- of making non-academic campus programs financially  self-sustaining.  </P> <P> Of course, Allen's reputation as a winner also was a factor in the decision.  The 49ers were 11-24 in the past three years, which prompted the resignation of  Coach Larry Reisbig in November. The team was beaten 52-0 by Big West  Conference champion Fresno State, 63-10 by Hawaii and 52-10 by Oregon.  </P> <P> In 12 seasons in the NFL as coach of the Los Angeles Rams and the Washington  Redskins, Allen had a record of 120-47-5, the third best winning percentage in  league history. He rebuilt both teams quickly. The Ram franchise was 51-87-5  before him, 49-17-4 in five seasons with him. He was voted NFL Coach of the  Year four times. He led the 1972 Redskins to the Super Bowl.  </P> <P> Allen, wearing his NFC championship ring from that Super Bowl team, admitted  Tuesday that he will need all of those skills to help the 49ers. He said he  took the job because it was a challenge and because it was close to his Palos  Verdes Estates home. He said he would help raise money to build an on-campus  football stadium, solicit more support from alumni and get students on campus  more enthused about football.  </P> <P> Long Beach shares antiquated Veterans Stadium in northeast Long Beach with Long  Beach City College and local high schools, which have preference on dates and  times for its use.  </P> <P> Johnson said he intends to raise the budget of the campus sports information  director to handle the increased media attention the school expects to receive  with Allen as its coach.  </P> <P> The university's football program has held a tenuous spot in the community  since 1986 when former University President Stephen Horn incurred the wrath of  boosters by attempting to dismantle it. After drawing severe criticism, Horn  changed his mind and challenged the residents of Long Beach to raise $300,000  or lose a football team. A fund-raising drive was successful. The money was  raised. Since then, Horn has consistently described himself as a strong  supporter of athletic programs.  </P> <P> The money was raised, but the program's morale sank. Game attendance dwindled  to an average of 2,650 fans for four home games this season.  </P> <P> Horn, who is now a member of the faculty, praised Allen's selection. "I'm  simply delighted," he said. "Anyone with (Allen's) background and personality  will have a good leg up on funding. A vibrant athletic program obviously helps  the university and the community.  </P> <P> "I think it's an excellent move. (Allen's) reputation and credibility will  provide the excitement that people want to see."  </P> <P> Allen's hiring comes at a time when McCray has made cuts elsewhere on campus,  particularly at campus radio station KLON and in the arts. That didn't,  however, seem to rankle Rick Lewis, KLON's general manager, who expressed  support for Allen's hiring on the grounds that it will help make football  self-sustaining and thus help everyone on campus.  </P> <P> "I suspect it will make more people attend," said Lewis, whose radio station  suffered a 9% cut in its budget last year. "There's no jealousy. In general I  think it's good to make a program as good as you can make it."  </P> <P> Allen left many of the details of his contract to others and, by his own  admission, did not research the position as thoroughly as he would have liked  to. For instance:  </P> <P> He said he could not remember the length of his contract, although he said he  thought it was for three years. He also said he couldn't remember his salary  with the 49ers, but added, "I'd make more money in two weeks (speaking  somewhere)."  </P> <P> Allen said he had not met with the seven assistant coaches being retained by  the school. He says he has two men, "one in the NFL right now" that he wants to  add to the group of assistants.  </P> <P> He also said he had not visited the school's playing field. "The last time I  was at Veterans Stadium was in 1966," he said. "Has it changed much?"  </P> <P> As for building a winner, Allen said: "You say 'what is realistic' to me and  you mention 5-5. That doesn't sound good to me. . . . Here it might be a heck  of a season."  </P> <P> On the football field there are few details that slip by Allen, but off it he  has a reputation as a spendthrift. His NFL coaching career ended when he was  fired from the Redskins job by then-owner Edward Bennett Williams in 1977. "He  was given an unlimited budget and he exceeded it," Williams said at the time.  </P> <P> Is there a possibility Allen will make the same mistake at Long Beach?  </P> <P> "You can't spend what you don't have," Johnson said.  </P> <P> Bernie Jones, president of the 49er Athletic Foundation, said he was delighted  to have Allen in town. He said he expects the Foundation to move on one of  Allen's few priorities, upgrading the campus weight room.  </P> <P> Ken Visser, assistant coach with the 49ers for 11 years, still had not been  introduced to Allen as he waited for his new boss to exit a TV interview in an  adjoining room following Tuesday's press conference. He had come as "a  liaison," for himself and the six remaining full-time coaches.  </P> <P> "I think George understands the (financial) limitations that Long Beach has and  he has taken on the challenge the way it is," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> Cal State Long Beach has a student population of more than 35,000, but support  for its football team is minimal. Three years ago the program was almost  canceled, but a successful fund-raising effort saved it. Since then, the  football team has compiled an 11-24 record. Larry Reisbig, who coached the  49ers the last three years, resigned last month.  </P> <P> </P> <P> '49ER COACHING RECORDS  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.66IN:1.56IN:1.45IN:1.56IN:1.56IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5">

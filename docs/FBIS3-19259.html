Christopher's wish -- which was not even presented in a  particularly sharp form -- that human rights be observed was  answered in a way that almost had the effect of an insult. Not  only was his visit overshadowed by the prosecution of a  well-known Chinese human rights activist, Foreign Minister Qian  Qichen even accused the United States of violating laws:  Beijing takes offense at U.S. human rights commissioner  Shattuk's meeting with prominent dissident Wei Jingsheng a few  days before Christopher's appearance.    What caused the Chinese rulers to behave in such an  unfriendly way? What has driven them to make it almost  impossible for U.S. President Clinton to agree to prolonging the  preferential treatment of imports from China? It is true that  Christopher should have known that Beijing would react  particularly stubbornly to direct reproaches and is at best  sometimes willing to give in tacitly after Western visitors have  departed. However, no other U.S. secretary of state has met  with such a cold snub in Beijing -- even though quite a lot is  at stake for China's flourishing trade with the United States.  Why, therefore, is it so unyielding?    Unlike Russia, China is not only potentially, but even now  is  a profitable market. Economic growth has reached dimensions  that meanwhile even frighten the central planners. Therefore,  however, the political leadership has become even more  self-confident, even if the memory of the democracy movement  that was so bloodily stifled a little less than five years ago  may have a lasting effect and explain the nervousness with which  the rulers react to even the smallest movements of the  opposition. However, it is also part of this memory that the  West, with an eye on the Chinese market, quickly forgave  oppressors of the likes of Premier Li Peng. Beijing is also  banking on exactly that this time -- and knows that U.S.  businesses that are no less angry with Christopher for  advocating the observance of human rights in China are on its  side.</p>

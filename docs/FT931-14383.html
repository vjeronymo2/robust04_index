			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Arts: The Song of Tales - A Roman evening Some 20 years ago, almost at the outset of his career, the Neapolitan musicologist-composer-producer Roberto De Simone created a spectacle entitled La gatta Cenerentola (The cat Cinderella), based largely on Lo cunto delli cunti (The Tale of Tales) by Giambattista Basile, the 17th century collection of fairy-tales that has inspired many subsequent works, among them Prokofiev's Love of Three Oranges. With liberal admixtures of mime, dance and traditional music (plus some music of his own) De Simone created a piece of stage magic, subsequently revived several times, and now a part of Italian theatrical history. The recent announcement of a new De Simone full evening of Neapolitan song and story naturally aroused keen expectation among his fans, especially since the title Il canto de li cunti (The Song of Tales) again recalled Basile, and suggested that La gatta Cenerentola would have a successor. But the wily producer both disappointed and rewarded his admirers. The earlier piece was a kaleidoscope of visual invention and brilliant colour; the new work is sober to the point of starkness - the performers are all dressed in black - and movement is reduced to the essential minimum. But within these narrow, self-imposed confines, Il canto de li canti proved to be as varied and thrilling as anyone could wish. It began with Basile - a story of an Ogre and his garden - narrated, chanted and sung by seven singers, with subtle, deliberately scant accompaniment, then ranged through other traditional songs and stories to some versions of Don Giovanni, of which the most exhilarating saw Pulcinella standing in for Leporello, and then a hilarious bit of 18th century farce - L'Opera di Zeza  -with enchanting pastiche music by De Simone, and with the superb Neapolitan actor Rino Marcelli, en travesti, as Zeza (before that, he had been a magnificent Pulcinella). The second half featured more recent pieces: a staged poem by the late comedian Toto, in which two dead men - a street-sweeper (again the unparalleled Marcelli) and an aristocrat (the suitably pompous Enzo Pierro)  -come to wry conclusions about life and death; some songs of Salvatore Di Giacomo, the 19th-century poet whose lyrics were seized upon by generations of composers; and finally a series of pieces by Raffaele Viviani, a somewhat underestimated turn of the century author whose bitter streak distinguishes him from other Neapolitan humourists. The outstanding quality of this production - apart from the unerring taste and interest of the selected material - was its coherence, its apparent spontaneity along with its impeccable organisation. In a sense there were no stars (even Marcelli worked in perfect synchrony with the others); and in another sense, the interpreters were all stars: a glittering constellation that, despite the almost bare stage and the funereal dress, lit up the Teatro Valle in Rome and, from there, should go on to shine in many other theatres.</p>

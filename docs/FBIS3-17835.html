			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Juri Tikk, the government's special  representative in Paldiski, said today that the dismantling of  the nuclear reactors at Paldiski and the accompanying  introduction of a special regime is due to begin in the second  half of April. He added that the special regime will be  introduced for the whole of Pakri Peninsula. First there will  be the familiar system of permits, but when the reactor's lid is  lifted, so to speak, the peninsula will be closed completely.  The special regime will be abolished after the nuclear fuel has  been removed -- by the end of June or beginning of July.    The Russian side will not allow anyone close [words  indistinct] because several devices on site are alleged to be  secret, and thus will be assuming total responsibility. Later,  during the second stage of the removal process, the Russian  military are willing to allow both Estonian and international  observers to witness the dismantling process. [passage omitted]</p>

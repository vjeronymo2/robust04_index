			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / EC fails to agree on multinationals MINISTERIAL agreement on a European company statute - which would simplify the legal position of multinational companies in the Community  - has again been postponed, possibly until the end of this year. EC internal market ministers, meeting in Luxembourg yesterday, failed to narrow their differences over the European Commission's proposals. The measure would allow multinational companies to become societes europeennes (SEs). They would be subject to a single EC company law, instead of having to meet different legal requirements in each member state. Portugal, which holds the EC presidency until the end of this month, has pushed hard for adoption of the statute. But its efforts have been thwarted, partly because of persistent objections from some member states about proposals to encourage employee participation at board level in SEs. Britain, for example, argues that such provisions could set a precedent for binding EC company legislation later. One Portuguese official said yesterday that he thought the UK had missed a good opportunity to agree a directive over the past six months. British officials said the technical nature of the measure meant it would probably not be considered by ministers until near the end of the UK's six-month presidency, which follows Portugal's. Member states were last night still discussing a directive aimed at protecting national treasures once internal EC frontiers are removed on January 1, 1993. British auction houses are concerned that a measure, allowing a wide definition of national treasures which cannot be exported, could restrict the European art market. Ministers were still discussing compromise proposals yesterday evening.</p>

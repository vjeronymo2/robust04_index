			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY -- AN S&amp;L GRAVEYARD  </P> <P> Orange County is home to more failed savings and loans than any other county in  California. In the last five years, regulators have seized 19 county-based  S&amp;Ls. The failures range from industry giant American Savings &amp; Loan in  Irvine to small institutions, such as American Interstate Savings &amp; Loan in  Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Like S&amp;Ls nationwide, the county's thrifts have failed for a variety of  reasons: mismanagement, bad and risky investments and outright fraud.  </P> <P> Fraud appears to be more prevalent among Orange County thrifts than among  S&amp;Ls elsewhere in the state. Of seven Southern California thrift failures  deemed top-priority cases by the FBI and regulators, four are based in Orange  County. In addition, the FBI is looking into wrongdoing at six other county  thrifts, at the least.  </P> <P> There are 25 thrifts in the county still in private hands. Regulators control  Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine -- one of the nation's biggest failures --  and Charter Savings Bank in Newport Beach. In addition, New West Federal  Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine is a self-liquidating thrift created to sell off  the bad assets of American Savings.  </P> <P> Nationwide, more than 800 thrifts have failed since 1980, and about 500 of  those were put in the hands of the Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency  that manages and liquidates failed thrifts. Hundreds of other S&amp;Ls have  been absorbed by mergers and acquisitions in either friendly deals or  arrangements forced by regulators.  </P> <P> The part of the industry still privately owned now numbers 2,404 institutions,  about 40% of its peak size in 1980, according to the Office of Thrift  Supervision.  </P> <P> </P> <P> S &amp; L RESOLUTION COSTS  </P> <P> The cost of resolving -- selling, consolidating or liquidating -- failed  savings and loan institutions in Orange County has already cost the federal  government an estimated $4.5 billion. The total does not include costs related  to the failures of Charter Savings Bank in Newport Beach and Lincoln Savings  &amp; Loan in Irvine, whose resolutions are still pending. The bailout of  Lincoln alone is expected to cost taxpayers more than $2 billion.  </P> <TABLE CWL="6.51IN:2.88IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Thrift/Location  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C">  * Estimated Cost  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> (in millions)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> American Savings &amp;

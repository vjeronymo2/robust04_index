			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Prime Minister Lyuben Berov: "We Will Return </F> the Land by the Summer of 1994"]    [Text] Recently most critics of the government's  performance claim that the reforms have evidently "stalled" or  "stopped."    In this respect, the critics usually give first place to the  land reform. Precisely for this reason, it is necessary to know  the true situation with the land reform.    In contrast to the restitution of property, from which a few  percent of the town population obtained benefit, the agrarian  reform affects the overwhelming majority of the Bulgarian  people, inasmuch as just before and immediately after World War  II three-quarters of the population obtained their subsistence  from agriculture, and for this reason were connected either  directly or through relatives with the ownership of a larger or  smaller amount of land. It emerges from a special public  opinion poll commissioned with the National Center for  Investigating Public Opinion that 69 percent of the population  expected to regain possession of agricultural land. In rural  areas, the figure was 92 percent.    Information gathered under the Agricultural Land Act also  indicates a similar picture.    Up to November 1993, on the basis of applications submitted  for the return of land, the land commissions issued 1.93 million  decisions recognizing ownership titles under Article 18,  Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Agricultural Land Act, relating to a  total of 51.06 million decares of land. However, many of the  decisions made concerned land claimed by two or more heirs,  because of which a total of over 3 million land claims were  received. This means that over half of the adult population  submitted claims.    In its program, the government initially announced that it  would return 80 percent of the agricultural land to which claims  had been laid by the end of 1993, but as early as in April 1993  this commitment was adjusted to 55-60 percent, following a  careful assessment of the real possibilities in this direction.  The latter figure remains "enshrined" in all the official  statements issued from the spring until now.    These are the results of the government's work in this  direction to the end of 1993. Up to the end of November 1993,  ownership titles to agricultural land were restored as follows:    -- ownership within existing or restored real boundaries:  6.59 million decares;    -- ownership through a land division plan: 11.73 million  decares, making a total of 18.32 million decares.    To this amount one has to add 11.65 million decares for  which  temporary ownership certificates have been issued (in respect to  claims covering about 70 percent of the recognized land), making  a grand total of 29.97 million decares.    To these figures one has to add the results achieved in  December 1993, which have still not been properly recorded  statistically. The probable figure for land restored to its  owners in December will be around 3.2 million decares, plus  about 0.3 million decares in respect of which temporary  ownership has been granted.    Thus, in the final analysis, by the end of 1993 about 33.5  million decares of land was returned to its owners, representing  65 percent of the land for which claims had been submitted.  This shows that in general terms the government has fulfilled  its commitment to restore ownership of "60-65 percent of the  land." True, the issue of temporary ownership certificates does  not legally constitute full restoration of land ownership within  specific (actual) boundaries, but in practice, thanks to the  work of the land division companies, the owner can already  cultivate land almost equivalent to the land he claimed and for  which his claim has been recognized by the appropriate land  commission.    It is true that during the first half of the year the  implementation of the agrarian reform did not proceed at a  sufficiently fast rate. Because of this, from July this year  radical measures were taken to speed up the process. The  results are self-evident from the chart showing a monthly  breakdown of the total amounts of land handed over to its owners.    [A graphic is appended to the article showing the cumulative  amounts of land restored to its owners, expressed in millions of  decares for each month of 1993; the chart shows the approximate  amounts of land restored in the form of temporary ownership  certificates, actually restored within real boundaries, and  granted to the owners under the land division plan. According  to the chart, in January 1993 approximately 5 million decares  had been returned in all; by July, approximately 20 million  decares, and by December over 40 million decares.]    This trend indicates that by the summer of 1994 the process  of returning ownership titles to agricultural land will be  largely completed. It will still be necessary to complete the  work in a limited number of villages with specific juridical or  other problems that are holding up the work, for example due to  procrastination in adopting court decisions on land boundary  disputes between villages. A public opinion poll has shown that  two-thirds of the population approves extending the deadline for  returning land to June 1994.    There are a number of basic causes that delay and hinder  the process of farmland restoration, including the following:    First, one should point out the false sworn declarations on  land owned prior to the so-called collectivization (making up  more than half of the false declarations made under oath.)  These claims relate to more than 3 million decares of land that  in fact does not exist. For this reason, the claims for  restoration of land have turned out to cover a greater amount of  land than actually existed in the land holdings prior to  collectivization. This especially applies to Burgas, Lovech,  and Khaskovo Oblasts. The Council of Ministers has submitted a  bill to the National Assembly to resolve the problem, but  parliament has yet to debate it.    In many populated centers one encounters an organized  (albeit  secret) resistance to the land division plans on the part of  various political forces. Often, this is a result of the  desires of individual owners to obtain the land due to them in a  particular locality and no other, desires that cannot be  reconciled. A further major obstacle that one should mention is  the fact that in many cases no documentary evidence of title is  available because the old notarial acts have been lost, because  documents were deliberately burnt when the owners entered the  labor collective farms, and so forth.    In many populated centers the process is hindered because  the  boundaries between the agricultural and forest lands have not  been established. In many cases concerning the return of  ecologically polluted lands, the work of the land commissions is  hampered by the absence of a concrete assessment by other organs  of the form and extent of the pollution (which governs what  crops may be sown and the conditions under which the land in  question may be restored to the owners).    Major obstacles are being encountered in connection with the  granting of state lands as compensation for other land or to  landless peasants, as the law prescribes. The state land  amounts only to 2.27 million decares (0.5 million decares of  which is uncultivated land or pasture) and is extremely unevenly  distributed, mainly in northeast Bulgaria, Plovdiv and Khaskovo  districts, and elsewhere. Most of this land has been left for  the liquidation councils to dispose of.    The problem of the liquidation councils and the completion  of  their work is still unresolved. Of a total of 2,067 liquidation  councils throughout the country, only 257 will complete their  work by 31 December. Of the remaining 1,810 councils, 1,322  have already finished defining the land shares under Article 27,  Paragraph 1 of the act, but only 195 have finished apportioning  the land and property in real terms.    Among the major objective reasons delaying the liquidation  process, one should mention unresolved property lawsuits  involving the former labor collective farms or the liquidation  councils, the failure to complete financial audits, dues  uncollected from various natural or juridical persons amounting  to a total of 1.58 billion leva, the existence of stores of  unusable plant protection agents and stocks of animals suffering  from tuberculosis and leucosis, the failure of municipal land  commissions to supply necessary information, and so on. In the  case of 291 councils, the title holders do not want to receive  the shares of property that are their due. Difficulties also  arise from the fact that almost three- quarters of the  liquidation councils have to continue production activities  (spring sowing, harvesting) on a smaller or larger part of their  land holdings.    The coin of the agrarian reform also has a reverse side.  This is the extensive fragmentation of land ownership and  agricultural production that will ensue in the initial period  and will hamper the competitiveness of our new agriculture  (especially in the production of grain and certain industrial  crops). Available data on land already returned to its owners  confirm that most holdings range between 15 and 20 decares. Few  holdings are more than 50 decares in area, and very few above  100 decares. One-fourth of the title holders are receiving back  less than 10 decares, and many of these are receiving only one  or two decares. On a plot of 5-10 decares one can, for example,  cultivate a decent vegetable garden, but it is impossible to  develop competitive production of wheat, sugar beet, sunflowers,  and so on.    Several ways of overcoming the fragmentation of land  ownership and agrarian production are possible.    The first is related to the sporadic concentration of  ownership along the purchases-sales line. The historical  practice in our state shows that we cannot rely on this (at  least as far as the rapid and radical solution of the issue is  possible). During the period of 1897-1911 the degree of  concentration of the land ownership in Bulgaria preserved an  almost constant level. During the period of 1920-1945 a clear  process related to a significant fragmentation of the agrarian  property and production emerged. Now we restore this  fragmentation.    The second possible way is related to leasing the land.    This is especially important when one takes into  consideration that about 45 percent of the new owners (mostly  inheritors) are living in the cities and do not intend to  cultivate the land they are entitled to by themselves. Major  leased farms, cultivating up to several thousand decares of  land, could emerge under those conditions. So far about 10 such  farms have been created, but they are not a mass phenomenon and  will not become such a phenomenon, because of the temporary and  unstable character of their basis. In addition, it is very  difficult to merge a large number of scattered agrarian plots  into a single mechanical service bloc, among other things,  because those plots must have a common border.    The third way involves the establishments of owners'  cooperatives, but the aforementioned difficulty (lack of a  common border) applies also to this category. In addition, the  owners who unite in a cooperative often do not posses the  necessary ownership documents in which the precise borders of  their plots are listed.    A draft bill on the cadastre has been submitted to the  parliament. This draft bill will help those who want to  cultivate their plots together, to receive neighboring plots  when the agrarian land is divided, within specific and real  borders. However, this still is a matter of the future. So far  in the country 1,200 cooperatives have been registered. They  have a total of 7.2 million decares of land and 268,000  participants. Their total share of cultivated land is  substantially higher than the 13 percent they formally own,  because often those cooperatives cultivate more land than they  own. This is a typical phenomenon in Burgas Oblast.    However, the cooperatives issue is a rather politicized  matter, and this hampers the correct solution of the issue from  the view point of economic efficiency.</p>

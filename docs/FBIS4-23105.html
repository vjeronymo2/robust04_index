All four of Europe's biggest microelectronics firms--Philips of  the Netherlands, the French-Italian firm SGS-Thomson, and the German  companies Siemens and Temic--show a trend toward profitability.  Philips made a profit in 1993, as did SGS-Thomson and Temic.  The  microelectronics department of Siemens will become profitable this  year, according to department head Juergen Knorr.      These companies are also investing in new facilities.  SGS-  Thomson recently opened a modern factory near Grenoble that produces  semiconductors with structures of 0.5 micron, and will soon be  producing 0.35 micron structures.  In late May 1994, Temic will open  a new factory in Heilbronn to produce components for infrared data  communications.  Siemens' factory for memory chips in Regensburg has  become so successful that it is being expanded, and Siemens is  building a new plant in Dresden, primarily to produce primarily  DRAMs (Dynamic Random Access Memories).      European microelectronics firms and research institutes are also  developing new technologies and positioning themselves for emerging  markets.  Recently the Heinrich Hertz Institute for Communication  Technology in Berlin developed a method of combining lasers and  photodiodes with electronic chips in one component.  This device can  transform optical signals into electric signals, or electric signals  into optical ones.  This development drew worldwide attention.      Siemens has achieved an almost 70-percent market share in high-  frequency components for mobile radios.  The company is forming a  strategic alliance with the Finnish firm Nokia, which is number two  in the world in the end equipment area.     Another growing market is automobile electronics, which "is one  of the strengths of the Europeans," according to Carl Muehlner,  business manager of Dataquest GmbH.  For example, the German company  Bosch has developed a Controller Area Network (CAN), a data network  which can unite all electric and electronic devices in a car.  Mercedes-Benz already uses this system in its luxury cars.      Other markets of the future with significant European  participation are chip cards and multimedia.  The problem area  remains computers, but SGS-Thomson has established a new department  in order to enter the microprocessor market in the near future.  (Duesseldorf WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE in German 6 May 94) (BC)      POLICY ISSUES      German Industrialists View Research Policy--During a German  Ministry for Research and Technology closed conference on innovation  policy in May 1994, Tyll Necker, president of the Federal  Association of German Industry (BDI), called for cost reductions and  deregulation, as well as tax subsidies for industrial research.  He  complained of the high costs of labor and taxes in Germany.  Research Minister Paul Krueger admitted that Germany is a land of  high costs, but pointed out such advantages as a well-educated  workforce, central location, excellent infrastructure, advanced  research facilities, and productive work culture.      Necker stated that in comparison with other industrialized  countries, Germany's labor costs are 25 percent higher, additional  personnel costs are 40 percent higher, and company taxes are 30  percent higher.  German companies reacted by making cost reductions  and by introducing lean management and lean production, which also  affected research negatively.  However, the tight financial  situation gave these firms no choice, according to Necker.  He said  that the BDI would urge the reintroduction of indirect support for  research from the government.      Necker also urged reforms in European patent law, saying that the  costs are too high, especially for small and medium-sized companies.  He called for deregulation of the research institutes.  The state  should provide good conditions for research, but allow companies to  manage their own technology policies without intervention, he said.      According to Necker, Germany is still a leading technology  country with a good mix of branches of industry.  However, German  companies trail their most important competitors in certain high  technology fields such as microelectronics and information  technology, he said. (Duesseldorf HANDELSBLATT 26 May 94 p 6) BC      Netherlands Trails in Technology--A report by the Merit Research  Bureau for the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that Dutch  companies are cutting R&amp;D spending with the result that the  Netherlands is trailing its competitors in most fields of  technology.  While government R&amp;D spending appears to be reasonably   high, much of it is for nontechnical subjects, and the number of  students studying science is dropping, according to the report,  which was issued in April 1994.  Research spending by companies, as  a percentage of GNP, is also dropping.  Even in high-tech sectors  such as aerospace and computers, Dutch companies spend less on R&amp;D  than their foreign competitors.  The Merit report recommends fiscal  measures to stimulate R&amp;D, more scientific research by universities,   and closer ties between technical institutes and industry.  (Amsterdam HET FINANCIELE DAGBLAD 21 Apr 94) BC      CORPORATE STRATEGIES      Philips Investment in France--In an effort to regain predominance  within the European semiconductor industry, Philips is investing 500  million francs ($89 million) in a subsidiary in Caen, France, in  order to double the company's total integrated circuit (IC)  production capacity over the next three years.  The Caen plant will  be equipped with an additional line for producing O.7-micron-  technology ICs.  The submicron CMOS (complementary metal-oxide  semiconductor) circuits will be manufactured on 150-millimeter  silicon wafers.  The operation will boost the number of employees at  the plant (now 830) by 200. In 1993 the plant produced 300 million  chips and exported 90 percent of them. (Paris L'USINE NOUVELLE 24  Mar 94) IM      Alcatel Moves to Enhance its Competitive Stance--Alcatel, the  French telecommunications giant, recently made two strategic moves  to enhance its market position.  It created Alcatel Optronics, a  specialized subsidiary, and it decided to participate in the  Globalstar satellite communication system.      Alcatel, which has long been involved in optoelectronics at its  research center in Marcoussis and at its German subsidiary SEL,  recently set up Alcatel Optronics in Nozay, France with 250  employees, 250 million francs ($44 million) in sales and a planned  20-percent sales increase in 1994. The new operation will be  responsible for all the group's optoelectronics developments and  marketing.  Alcatel Optronics will manufacture active components  such as lasers and photodetectors, an activity which had been  divided between Marcoussis and SEL's German site. SEL will  concentrate on passive devices such as multiplexers, and the Lannion  plant will assemble and test products for underwater use.  Alcatel  Optronics will be able to respond to the present needs of its  telecommunications branches as well as to the future demands for  switching of Alcatel Bell and Alcatel-CIT.      Alcatel reacted to the emerging large-scale alliances in  telecommunications, such as the Iridium project and Teledesic, by  joining the Globalstar satellite communication project.  The company  hopes to gain a good competitive position at the beginning of the  21st century  especially in America, where these ventures have  already begun to take shape.  Globalstar will offer worldwide voice  communication, data transmission, telecopying and position fixing  services through stationary or mobile terminals.  The system is  planned to start operation in 1998 and a decade later is projected  to have 10 million subscribers. Alcatel's contribution to  Globalstar's costs over a four-year period will be to 45 percent.  Ventures like this are not new to Alcatel; in 1991 the company  joined Italy's Alenia, acquiring 49 percent of the Loral Corporation  subsidiary Space Systems, and set up a joint venture with  California-based ()ualcomm in 1990 in satellite position reporting  services (EutelTracs).  (Paris L'USINE NOUVELLE 31 Mar 94 pp 26, 27)  IM      Akebono Brake to Build R&amp;D Center in France--In 1995, Akebono  Brake, Japan's largest automobile brake manufacturer, will open an  R&amp;D center near Paris that will employ about six engineers.  Work  there will be concentrated on developing new friction type materials  and prototypes. Once installed in Europe, the Japanese firm intends  to establish relations with Peugeot and Renault.  Above all, it aims  at enlarging its customer base, which in Europe consists only of the  United Kingdom.  At present, most of the company's production goes  to Mitsubishi, Nissan, and Toyota.  It had a revenue of 106 billion  yen ($1 billion) in 1993, and a net profit of 489 million yen ($5  million).  Akebono is owned by companies including Toyota (15.4  percent), Nissan (15.6 percent), Germany's Bosch (13.8 percent),  Isuzu (5.1 percent), and  Mitsubishi (1.5 percent).  Suzuki will  presumably also become an owner.

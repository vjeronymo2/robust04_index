			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Covering up the tracks of privatisation - The background to the Tory's change of heart over British Rail BRITISH RAIL'S branch line to the Cornish fishing village of St Ives is a poor advertisement for the Conservatives' record on the railways. Granted, the 4 1/2 -mile spur off the London-Penzance main line at St Erth scores highly on scenic merit as it rounds the bird sanctuary of Leland Saltings to reveal a panoramic view of St Ives Bay. But the train that runs on it is a museum piece. Comprising one rattling, rumbling, 35-year-old railcar, it is quaintly described in BR-speak as one of its 'heritage' trains. In anybody else's language, it is clapped out. The once-bustling station at St Ives has been razed to make way for a car park. There are no station staff, and the only shelter for passengers is a rude hut - a description taken all too literally by those who have adopted it as a public urinal. These economies notwithstanding, the service loses money hand-over-fist. BR will not say how much, but acknowledges that Britain's rural branch lines rarely cover much more than a third of their costs. For the communities they serve the fear of closure is never far away. It is against this background that the Conservatives have backed down on promises to privatise BR. Voters know that it is not just the branch lines that lose money: for all BR's economies and productivity improvements, only a handful of its busiest InterCity services turn in a profit. Talk of privatisation is indivisible from fears that the private sector would swiftly eliminate loss-makers. Thus, after months of promising a white paper on BR's privatisation, the election has obliged the Conservatives to retrench. Significantly, the railways section of their manifesto published this week avoided any mention of the word privatisation. Instead, it offered the rather less threatening notion of franchising. Under this scheme, the railways will remain in state ownership, but private-sector operators will be allowed to run trains on BR tracks. They will also be invited to bid for franchises to take over the operation of existing BR services - or possibly groups of services, such as the old Great Western Railway routes out of London Paddington. The Conservatives emphasise that the idea is to increase the use of the railways. Subsidies for loss-making services will continue to be provided where necessary and 'arrangements to sustain the current national network of services will be maintained'. For the electorate, the promises may have come too late. Conversations with passengers on a railway journey through the West Country suggest that the privatisation of BR is an idea too closely associated with the Conservatives for them to be able to shrug it off three weeks from an election. On the 10.21 from Exeter St David's to Penzance, Mr Derek Fisher, a self-employed photographer from Bristol, is as firmly convinced that the Conservatives will privatise the railways as he is that it will be a disaster. 'There would be 50 per cent less railway lines than we've got now,' he says. 'All the branch lines would go, for a start, because people would start looking at them from a monetary point of view.' Mr Don Nowell, a civil engineering inspector from London, says: 'Something has got to be done about the railways . . . but for the Conservatives to hand them over to their friends for their personal gain is not the answer. I'm nearly 65 now, so I remember the old days of the railways before nationalisation, and I can tell that they were an absolute bloody shambles compared with what we've got now.' Sensitivities grow stronger as the train enters Cornwall. This far-flung part of the country feels forgotten and ignored by Westminster and Whitehall. With fishing and tin-mining long supplanted by tourism as the area's most important industry, it sees good communications as crucial to its economy. The branch line to St Ives is a case in point. Its existence at this time of year appears an absurdity. Yet in the summer the trains are packed with day trippers. Mrs Betty Oldbury, a retired teacher, says the railway is a lifeline for St Ives - not just for tourists, but for local people. 'After all, we haven't all got cars,' she says. 'People here are nervous about what the government will do next.' There is even greater anxiety over the Cornish main line. Passenger loadings on the InterCity trains through the county are light outside the summer season, and there is a strong suspicion that a profit-driven private-sector operator would terminate trains at Plymouth, reducing the Cornish section to branch line status. Feelings run high on this issue. To sever the main line would be like sawing Cornwall off and casting it adrift, say locals. Mr Peter Moore of Cornwall County Council's surveyor's department says: 'It would cause a riot.' Whether the fears are strong enough to influence an election is another matter. 'Nothing that stopped the trains at Plymouth would get my vote,' says Mr Martin Evans, a Truro solicitor. That may not be the uppermost factor in his mind on April 9. But with three vulnerable seats to defend in Cornwall, it is a risk the Conservatives could have done without.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WHO LEADS IN FT POLL OF POLLS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               Last night's     Latest opinion    Betting     Futures               FT forecast         poll            odds       trading  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Conservative   300 seats           38%            4/5         303 Labour         307 seats           42%            4/5         305 Liberal/dem     19 seats           17%          300/1          25  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                (NOP/Newsnight/   Ladbrokes   Dealing on                                Independent)       (for most  the number                                Field date 17,18   seats)      of seats                                    March                  (IG index mid-                                                              prices)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

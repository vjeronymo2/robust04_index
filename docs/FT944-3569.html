			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Redwood criticises quango for past lapses An inquiry commissioned by the Welsh Development Agency has shown what Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, described yesterday as 'serious lapses in management control over its joint venture activities'. The report, by Grant Thornton, the accountancy firm, looked at the agency's involvement two years ago in a development project in Aberdare, Mid Glamorgan. It had been alleged that the agency competed with the private sector for land. A joint venture board had been set up in 1991 between the WDA, Cynon Valley borough council and Mid Glamorgan county council. Grant Thornton said the agency should have considered a joint venture with a private developer, rather than be seen to displace the private sector. It considered the agency failed to ensure the best value for money in buying land subsequently sold for a Tesco superstore. Mr Redwood told the Commons in a written answer that the report showed 'no evidence of improper pecuniary gain or collusion by any of the parties'. But he said Mr David Rowe-Beddoe, who became WDA chairman last year, 'agrees with me that the former management's conduct fell short of the standards we expect'. The WDA was chaired at the time by Dr Gwyn Jones. Mr Barry Hartop, who became WDA chief executive this year, said yesterday: 'The criticisms of the agency's former procedures are accepted and we have already taken remedial action to improve controls and ensure transparency on dealings involving third parties.' The Welsh secretary noted that Cynon Valley council had not allowed Grant Thornton access to certain papers. 'I hope those concerned will study the report carefully and, where appropriate, carry out their own investigation.' He said it would be for the district auditor to respond to requests for an inquiry into the council's activities. The council did not comment last night. Mr Redwood said Mr Hartop had informed the Commons public accounts committee about other past matters, including the underwriting of share issues, the engagement of consultants, redundancy and pension payments, procurement issues and breaches of delegated authority. He said: 'Some of these instances of non-compliance have continued until earlier this year.' It has been disclosed that the WDA made a net loss of Pounds 150,000 on underwriting share issues of privatised and Welsh companies. Underwriting stopped in 1991. Mr Redwood said he had told the WDA that this was not an appropriate role.</p>

			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OIL PRICES TUMBLE, REBOUND WILDLY TO CLOSE UP $1.26  </P> <P> With a dramatic last-minute surge, crude oil prices on Monday -- after falling  steeply earlier in the day -- shot up $1.26 to more than $31 a barrel on  apparently unfounded rumors of Iraqi troop movements toward Jordan and Saudi  Arabia.  </P> <P> The day's wild swings were symbolic of the tension and uncertainty that have  loomed over energy markets since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. "This  shows how nervous the market really is," said Andrew Lebow, oil analyst with E.  D. &amp; F. Man International Futures Inc. "At 3 p.m. it just started to blow.  I really can't tell you why."  </P> <P> The price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate, the nation's benchmark crude,  to be delivered in October rose to $31.30 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  Earlier in the day, prices had fallen as low as $28.35 a barrel in reaction to  Sunday's meeting of President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in  Helsinki, Finland.  </P> <P> The October contract price of regular unleaded gasoline, which had fallen to 87  cents a gallon early in the day, closed up 1.5 cents at 94.56 cents a gallon.  Heating oil rose 1.91 cents to 85.89 cents a gallon.  </P> <P> Shock waves from the turbulent trading session in the energy markets spilled  over onto Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average rose about 30 points on  early news of falling oil prices, only to close down 3.96 points at 2,615.59  following the increase in energy prices.  </P> <P> The market had initially expected an easing of Mideast tensions as a result of  the Helsinki summit, where Bush and Gorbachev called on Iraq to withdraw its  troops from Kuwait. Many analysts believed their united front would force Iraqi  President Saddam Hussein to seek a peaceful resolution to the conflict.  </P> <P> Prices remained relatively unchanged later in the day after Hussein offered  free oil to Third World nations that were able to arrange for its  transportation. The offer would require the nations to break the worldwide  embargo and blockade of Iraqi and Kuwaiti imports and exports.  </P> <P> Then about 15 minutes before the close, market watchers were stunned as prices  shot up to recoup earlier losses on Monday as well as those on Friday. Traders  said various unconfirmed umors began to circulate late in the day, including  one about Iraqi troops massing on the Jordanian border and of Saddam Hussein  sending commando units to destroy Saudi Arabian oil fields. There were no news  reports to support the rumors.  </P> <P> "I came out of a meeting and rang up the (Quotron) screen and said, 'Whoa, what  happened?" said Robert Weiss, oil industry analyst at Standard &amp; Poors  Corp. "There is a lot of jitteriness, and the slightest rumor sets off  something."  </P> <P> Tom Bentz, director of trading at United Energy, a futures trading firm, said  market players jumped into the spiral, fearing that they would be left behind  if they did not buy.  </P> <P> "People were not waiting for confirmation" of rumors, Bentz said. "People don't  want to be waiting around to see what the real story is. They just panic and  are just buying on the close."  </P> <P> While the crude oil market see-sawed, U.S. energy officials in Washington  predicted that supplies of gasoline and fuel oil for the rest of the year would  be tight but adequate unless war breaks out or if there is an unusually cold  winter.  </P> <P> Calvin A. Kent, head of the department's Energy Information Administration,  which collects and analyzes energy information, told the House energy and power  subcommittee that U.S. petroleum inventories "appear adequate" and that a  worldwide crude oil shortage of a million barrels a day later this winter "can  be handled." The shortfall is linked to the embargo of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil  shipments.  </P> <P> Subcommittee Chairman Rep. Philip R. Sharp (D-Ind.) was more pessimistic.  "There now is a very small margin of safety," he said. The Energy Department,  he added, "tends to underestimate what can go wrong."  </P> <P> But some other energy experts said they believe the nation will be able to ride  out the shortage.  </P> <P> Energy consultant Scott T. Jones, president of AUS Consultants in Philadelphia,  estimated that to offset the shortfall the United States will draw down its  record high oil inventories by an average of 1.5 million barrels a day during  the three months ending Sept. 30. But that figure should fall to an average of  700,000 barrels a day during the last three months of the year.  </P> <P> "It will be close, but we should be all right," Jones said.  </P></p>

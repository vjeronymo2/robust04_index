			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE POWER OF KIEV  </P> <P> Greg Braxton's Aug. 19 article "The Graying of KABC" was most interesting, and  we at KIEV add our congratulations to George Green and his crew.  </P> <P> After 17 years with a very successful talk format at KIEV, we are sorry that  the author did not stop by for a talk with us. We could have cleared up a  serious misstatement when he wrote that we are "smaller, less powerful" when,  in fact, our 10,000-watt power is twice the 5,000 watts at KABC.  </P> <P> DICK SINCLAIR  </P> <P> Program Director, KIEV  </P> <P> Glendale, Los Angeles  </P></p>

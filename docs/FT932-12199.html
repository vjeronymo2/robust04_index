			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Total plans FFr4bn capital increase TOTAL, the French oil group, has concluded plans for a FFr4.07bn (Pounds 480m) capital increase with three new minority investors as the first step towards creating a group of friendly shareholders to take long-term stakes in the company. Total is selling new shares representing 7 per cent of its equity to Cogema, the state-controlled nuclear group, Societe Generale, the bank, and the Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez industrial concern. Mr Serge Tchuruk, chairman, said he hoped to engineer similar deals so that friendly investors controlled 10 per cent to 12 per cent of Total. The capital increase, involving Total taking reciprocal stakes in its new investors and leaving it with FFr2.5bn of additional net cash, comes as French companies prepare for the new government's privatisation programme. Total, in which the government retains a 5 per cent direct stake and indirectly owns 10 per cent of shares through state-controlled companies, sees the formation of a group of friendly shareholders as a way of stabilising its equity base. The stock market reacted badly to the capital increase, which excludes ordinary shareholders and assembles defensive shareholdings to defuse the threat of changes in ownership. Total's shares fell 1.56 per cent to FFr265.10. Cogema has agreed to pay FFr2.5bn for a 4.3 per cent stake in Total and to buy the latter's uranium interests for FFr1bn. Total plans to invest FFr1.5bn in Cogema to acquire a 10 per cent holding. Societe Generale, a long-standing adviser to Total, will take a 2 per cent stake in the oil group in return for contributing FFr1bn to its shareholders' funds. Total will buy 1 per cent of the bank for FFr500m. Lyonnaise will invest FFr500m in Total, emerging with a 2 per cent stake. Total will then spend FFr500m to take a 20 per cent holding in Ufiner-Cofreth, a Lyonnaise heating and energy subsidiary. Total said the transactions will help reduce net debt from FFr14.5bn to FFr12bn and increase shareholders' funds from FFr46.8bn to FFr51bn. Gearing will fall from 31 per cent to 24 per cent, helping it with plans to double its oil and gas reserves by the end of the century. Lex, Page 26</p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Technology: Computers on the home front - Technically Speaking HOW MANY times have we heard that millions of living rooms are about to accommodate a home computer? It seems that every couple of years one or other of the leading personal computer manufacturers takes a new stab at creating consumer interest in computers. To date, the results of their efforts have been less than spectacular. Now here we go again. Apple Computer and International Business Machines are mounting renewed efforts to address the nascent home computer market. Apple, with a new range of 'Performa' Macintosh models, and IBM, with additions to its PS/1 range, aim to open the floodgates of incipient demand which they are convinced is still lurking behind the front doors of suburban households. Some 7m American families, according to Apple's reckoning, can afford to purchase a personal computer but have not, so far, got around to it. The targeted group is parents of school-age children. These families will have 'multiple motivations' to purchase a home computer, Apple predicts. Dad and Mum may use the computer for work they bring home from the office. It will also, Apple suggests, become a tool to work out household finances. Children will use it for their homework. Parents may also use it as an education tool to learn new skills. And everyone will enjoy computer games. None of this is new. A decade ago, PC industry executives were expounding the joys of home computing in similar terms. For all of these years, PC makers have been searching for a 'compelling application' for the home computer. They have never found it. So what is going to persuade people to dig into their pockets to buy a home computer now? Apple's US marketing experts suggest that changing patterns of consumer spending, driven by recessionary pressures, should make this latest generation of 'home computers' more successful. Consumers are now looking for products with 'real value', as opposed to products with status or design appeal, according to Apple's research. Parental concerns about the so-called 'education crisis' in schools, spurring greater efforts to help children learn at home, will prompt home computer sales, the company predicts. Home office activity is also on the rise as a result of the economic recession, leading to increased demand for home computers. Working parents also want the flexibility to be able to bring work home when they need to. IBM, similarly, believes the time is right to reach consumers who have sat on the sidelines for the past decade wondering why and whether they really need a computer in the home. A blunter assessment might be that the 30-40 per cent slide in PC prices over the past year has done what millions of dollars of advertising failed to do: encourage consumers to look again at products that they previously regarded as expensive toys. At today's prices, perhaps a PC is worth considering. Whether this will translate into strong sales is less certain, with consumer spending in a slump and consumer electronics markets particularly soft. But price-war-weary PC makers are desperate to find new customers, so it is time to give the consumer market another shot. The products that Apple and IBM are offering to consumers are little more than renamed, rebundled office computers. Apple has added an easier-to-use graphics interface to its new Performa line, but otherwise its 'new' products differ little from existing models. Much is also made of the fact that these consumer-oriented computers will be available in department stores. That too, has been tried before. One day there will be real 'home computers', but they probably will not look like today's offerings. In the meantime, the 'commodity PC', whether it comes with Mickey Mouse software or the same program you use at work, will appeal only to bargain hunters who already know what a PC can and cannot do for them.</p>

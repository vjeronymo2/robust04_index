			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Jan 12 (CTK) -- Slovak Premier Vladimir  Meciar said today the U.S. Partnership For Peace project, in a  legal and a political sense, provides the same chances for all  Central and East European countries.    Speaking after a meeting with Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus  today, Meciar said, however, he believed that in fact this  equality did not exist since individual countries differ in  their geopolitical situation, the extent of their economic  development and the structure of their armed forces.    Partnership For Peace could start a certain process which  could also be developed individually. That is why the results  could also be different, he said.    Regarding cooperation between the Visegrad Four countries  (Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland) Klaus said that  the Czech Republic was currently seeking to find a "common  denominator" for cooperation with all its partners in the group.  He admitted that not everything in this cooperation was a  success but that this "was not caused by individual people on  this or that side, but rather by the real interests of these  countries." At the same time Klaus admitted that a "common  denominator" for cooperation between the Czech and Slovak  Republic could be higher than between the Czech Republic and  other Visegrad countries.    Meciar said that all the steps undertaken by the Czech  Republic to protect its political and security interests were  considered by the Slovak Government fully legitimate. He said  it was his reaction to some "critical voices which have recently  come from Poland especially." Meciar said this criticism was  one-sided, simplified and that the Slovak Government did not  identify itself with it.    Klaus said the difference in the Czech and Polish approach  towards the Visegrad Four questions and the organization of U.S.  President Bill Clinton's Visit to Prague was not as big as it  could appear judging from "some statements of some Polish  representatives."    The two premiers confirmed that their views on the American  Project Partnership For Peace and on cooperation between the  Visegrad countries were "close or similar."    Meciar expressed satisfaction over the fulfillment of mutual  agreements between the Czech and Slovak Republics. Klaus said  he shared this view and especially appreciated the fact that the  Slovak deficit on the joint clearing account "has been repaid  promptly."    Klaus said he did not see any reason why some problems which  had appeared in Czech-Slovak relations lately could not be  solved.</p>

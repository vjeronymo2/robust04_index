The Committee is being renewed in cooperation with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and was recommended by a 1985 report of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Committee on Food Protection, Subcommittee on Microbiological Criteria, ``An Evaluation of the Role of Microbiological Criteria for Foods.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USDA is charged with the enforcement of the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA), the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA), and the Egg Products Inspection Act (EPIA). Under these Acts, USDA is responsible for the wholesomeness and safety of meat, poultry, egg products and products thereof intended for human consumption. Similarly, the Secretary of HHS is charged with the enforcement of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). Under this Act, HHS is responsible for ensuring the safety of human foods and animal feeds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to continue to meet the responsibilities under the FMIA, PPIA, EPIA, and the FFDCA, the National Advisory Committee of Microbiological Criteria for Foods is being renewed. The Committee will be tasked with advising and providing recommendations to the Secretaries on the development of microbiological criteria by which the safety and wholesomeness of food can be assessed, including criteria for microorganisms that indicate whether foods have been processed using good manufacturing processes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Renewal of this Committee is necessary and in the public interest because the development of a sound public policy in this area can best be accomplished by a free and open exchange of information and ideas among Federal, State, and local agencies; the industry; the scientific community; and other interested parties. The complexity of the issues to be addressed assures that more than one meeting will be required to accomplish the Committee's tasks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Members will be appointed by the Secretary of USDA after consultation with the Secretary of HHS. Because of their interest in the microbiological criteria for foods, advice on membership appointments will be requested from the Department of Commerce's National Marine Fisheries Service, and the Department of Defense's U.S. Army Natick Research and Development Center. Nominations for membership are based primarily on expertise in food science, microbiology, and other relevant disciplines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For additional information, please contact: Mr. Craig Fedchock, Advisory Committee Specialist, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service, Room 2151, South Agriculture Building, 14th and Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, DC 20250. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Done at Washington, DC, on April 22, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Wardell Townsend, Jr., <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Assistant Secretary for Administration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;11640 Filed 5&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;DM&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / BT puts help desk in Highlands BT STAFF in the south-east of England who experience trouble with their personal computers will be calling a help desk based at Thurso in Caithness  -600 miles away at the northern tip of Britain  - by the end of this year. The Pounds 650,000 project, which will initially employ 26 people, is aimed partly at demonstrating that the remote Highlands of Scotland are a viable location for telecommunication-based operations. It is being heavily subsidised by Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), the official development body. BT is working on a Pounds 16m project to upgrade the telecommunications system in the Highlands and Islands to the latest digital standard, and is also installing integrated services digital network (ISDN), which allows very fast transmission of data. The Highlands are getting ISDN before many parts of England. The Thurso operation will be part of BT's group computing services directorate which services about 250,000 computers through 23 centres all over Britain. Users will be able to telephone Thurso for help and the Thurso centre will be able to plug into their computers to evaluate and solve faults. No jobs are being moved from the south of England. Two managers will be transferred from elsewhere in BT but the rest of the staff will be recruited locally. BT is establishing the Thurso centre to fulfil a commitment to HIE, which is contributing Pounds 5m to the cost of upgrading Highland telecommunications. HIE is contributing Pounds 158,000 towards the Pounds 527,000 start-up costs of the project and will fund half the Pounds 140,000 costs of training the staff. It will also build a 7,000 sq ft office block, which it will lease to BT. Caithness is a priority area for HIE because of the gradual rundown of the Dounreay fast breeder reactor, which could cost the area 1,600 jobs.</p>

			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / The grim legacy of the 'witches' of Salem: Three hundred years ago 20 innocent people were executed in a frenzy of demon-hunting. Today, Salem's ghosts still haunt us THREE HUNDRED years ago on Tuesday an execution took place at Gallows Hill near Salem Village, Massachusetts, which has since haunted America's national consciousness. Seven women and a man were hanged for witchcraft, mainly on the evidence of a group of village girls who were apparently suffering fits and seizures after experimenting with the occult. These victims turned down the chance to save their lives by confessing their guilt. Three days earlier 80-year-old Giles Cory had been crushed to death, with stones piled on his chest, for refusing even to plead before the special court set up to try these innocent people. Up to this point, 20 men and women, mostly humble people, had been executed at Salem. This started an epidemic of denunciations and arrests in nearby towns, during which more than 100 suspects languished in makeshift jails. The Devil was abroad among God's people in New England, many of whom came to believe that he might deceive judges as well as witches. Tourists who watch reconstructions of Cory's death (complete with recorded groans) at the Salem Witch Museum may see those events as belonging to a remote and primitive culture. Yet now thousands of people openly choose to be witches, attending covens and practising rituals. Thousands of books for children are about witches, either benign or terrifying. Horror movies bare their fangs at every other cinema and fill the video shops, while books and magazines on the occult proliferate. Although this explosion of interest in Satanism is mostly ersatz, recent historical research is transforming our understanding of witchcraft in the Western past and often suggests more disturbing parallels with modern events. It now seems that the most famous reincarnation of the witches of 1692, in Arthur Miller's powerful play, The Crucible, may be a misleading view of the true cause and significance of the witch hunt. For Miller, the victims of Salem stand for the individual conscience against theocracy and 'the repressions of order', with explicit reference to the odious Senator McCarthy and his anti-communist crusade in the 1950s. Now, 40 years later, even more sinister parallels spring to mind. Witchcraft is back among us with a vengeance when families are torn apart on charges of Satanic rituals supposedly attested by their own children. In the UK, a series of ritual abuse cases were supposedly discovered by social service investigators in the Orkney Islands and then in Rochdale, northern England. These followed an epidemic of sexual abuse cases in Cleveland in 1987. In spite of obvious differences, these cases showed a strangely similar pattern to that in Salem three centuries before: intense questioning of children to produce the denunciation of adults; the inner certainty of interrogators that evil practices were widespread; passionate denials of guilt; and failures to obey the ordinary rules of evidence. Miller focused on the principled defiance of theocracy by John Procter, a man who, having fallen from grace through adultery with his maidservant, finally tore up the confession that would have saved him, thus gaining a moral victory over his persecutors. However, the true story of the hidden evil in Salem Village is more subtle and has only been apparent since the publication of a brilliant book by two young American historians, Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum, called Salem Possessed, which finally fitted the jigsaw together. As Miller partly understood, the central issues were to do with the nature of the community and the power struggle between individuals within it. Salem Village (now Danvers) was the agricultural hinterland of the thriving port of Salem, a dependent region lacking proper institutions and struggling even to create its own church. The community was split between those linked to the cosmopolitan, commercial world of the town and the poorer, less sophisticated farmers further inland. There were two rival families from the initial settlement: the Porters, who had grown rich from the town, and the Putnams, whose land was being subdivided among too many children. The epicentre of the witch hunt lay in the house of Thomas Putnam, eldest son in the third generation. His wife and daughter were prominent among the group of 'possessed' women. It was this group which gave the crucial evidence of witchcraft, partly to protect themselves against suspicions of satanic practices. They cried out in court that they had been tormented by the accused and described visions which were held to prove that the accused had made pacts with Devil to take possession of their souls. Putnam and his family were the main supporters of Samuel Parris, minister of Salem Village, another man on the economic downslope. Parris's insecurities did much to fan the blaze of the witch hunt. Thomas Putnam was a man with many grievances, much given to unsuccessful lawsuits. One alleged he had been cheated over his wife's inheritance, another - the vital one - was against his stepmother and his half-brother, Joseph. His father had left his best land to this favoured child of his old age, who had just married into the rival Porter family, and ostentatiously sided with them in local politics. Although they were never directly accused, these treacherous relatives and the Porters were the real target for the family's anger. Almost every accused person in the Salem trials can be connected with them in some way, just as all the accusers were Putnams and their allies. It is highly unlikely that there was a deliberate conspiracy. Since the weak were attacking the strong, they could only do so in surrogate form - by imagining a diabolical conspiracy. Resistance began to mount when charges extended to people of real substance. By the autumn of 1692, the leading Puritan ministers in the colony and the Governor intervened to halt the trials; those in prison were freed. Over the next 20 years various acts of public penance would try to atone for what the Boston minister Cotton Mather, who was consulted about procedures for the trials, called: 'Those errors whereby great hardships were brought upon innocent persons, and (we fear) guilt incurred which we have all cause to bewail with much confusion of face before the Lord.' Puritans knew how to repent with a sincerity and force rarely shown by modern persecutors. The persecution proved a disaster for its makers. Parris lost his position as minister and any hopes of personal recovery. Within a generation the surviving Putnams (other than the prosperous Joseph) had sold their dwindling property and left. Witchcraft prosecutions had rarely been much favoured by the churches, and played little part in maintaining their authority, in either the old world or the new. So the analogy conjured by the modern term 'witch hunt' - with the show trials of Stalin or McCarthy is weak. Similarly, the traditional witchcraft the colonists had brought from England bore little relation to modern imitations. This 'old witchcraft' still exists in parts of rural Europe, where a belief that one is bewitched has been known to cause death. As recently as 1976 two brothers in Orne in France shot dead the male 'witch' they blamed for their misfortunes. Then, as now, the basis of witchcraft had little to do with formal religion. It is in a general sense pagan, with an immensely long history. By comparison, the persecution of witchcraft was brief; after a scattering of early trials in the 15th century, most executions in Europe took place between 1580 and 1650. In all between 50,000 and 100,000 people were put to death as witches. Between a fifth and a quarter of these were men, while midwives, always said to be especially vulnerable, were in fact rarely prosecuted. Educated witch-hunters played only a marginal role; they were probably no more representative of elite opinion than the zealous pursuers of ritual Satanism are today. Most witches went on trial because their neighbours, who hated and feared them, blamed them for specific misfortunes - usually the deaths of spouses, children or animals - following a quarrel. Behind it all lay not the clergy but their rivals, the local wizards and wise-women who functioned as witch-doctors and were skilled in making clients articulate their suspicions. Population growth, economic change and harvest failures made the decades around the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries some of the harshest ever experienced by the ordinary people of Europe. It was natural that accusations should multiply, and this would not have mattered so much if the reaction had been confined to counter-magic and the occasional lynching. Unfortunately, the pressure from below coincided with a temporary decline in elite scepticism. The reasons for this are complex, but it should be stressed that it was very relative. Critics of witchcraft prosecutions were numerous and soon became more vocal, as happened in Massachusetts. Accusations of diabolical possession was seen as particularly dangerous, for fraud was readily suspected and quite often detected. Another famous case was that of the Devils of Loudun in 1634, where a group of 'possessed' nuns accused a local priest who was burned at the stake. A sober look at witchcraft in history strips away almost all the pseudo-historical clothing in which the modern witch cults have tried to deck themselves. Some of their rituals and gods do have origins in pagan culture, but the witches' 'sabbat', (a nocturnal Satanic meeting) existed only in the imaginary world of folklore. It is striking that many of the most lurid accounts in witchcraft trials came from children and adolescents. This should be a reminder of the danger of accepting their testimony in modern allegations of satanic practices. One does not care to think too long on the nine-year-old girl from Lorraine who told stories about going to the 'sabbat' in a cart with her whole family, as a result of which her father, grandparents, uncle and aunt were all burned in 1602. In later years she might have whispered to her confessor something akin to the moving words of Ann Putnam Jr. when she was admitted to church membership in 1706: 'I desire to lie in the dust and be humbled for it, in that I was a cause with others of so sad a calamity to them and their families.' It is a poignant reminder that the real evil lies within ourselves, as much in the age of child abuse as in that of 'demonic' possession.</p>

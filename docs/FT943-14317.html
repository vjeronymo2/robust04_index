			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Business predicts increase in staff Businesses plan to hire more staff in the three months to the end of September in spite of expectations that new orders will grow at a slower rate, the latest quarterly survey from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group, shows. The company's poll of 1,500 managing directors found that 40 per cent expected to increase staffing levels in the current three months compared with a year ago, with 11 per cent planning a reduction. The balance - a positive 29 percentage points - was slightly up from the second quarter and the highest for five years. Nearly half the service companies polled plan to increase staff. The survey found that the balance of companies expecting increased net profits and selling prices rose slightly between the second and third quarters, while expectations of net sales, exports and inventory levels fell marginally. The positive balance expecting new orders to rise in the latest quarter compared with a year ago fell to 45 percentage points from 56 points in the second. Dun &amp; Bradstreet said that the survey highlighted the fragility of Britain's economic recovery. This was disputed by the Treasury, which said that the fall in orders growth could reflect a seasonal pattern. Past surveys show that the balance of new orders has deteriorated between the second and third quarters of every year since 1989. The latest poll found that just over half of businesses expected to increase orders in this quarter compared with a year ago, while 42 per cent expected no change. The north-west and west Midlands appeared to be the most confident regions.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 10. Medical Evaluation and Treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Train medical response personnel specifically to assess and manage patients exposed to chemical agents stored at the nearby military depot.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Decontaminate all exposed patients as described above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Provide medical treatment (during or after contamination), according to accepted treatment modalities, to patients exposed to nerve or mustard agents. If antidotes to nerve agents are used in the field by civilian medical responders as designated in State or local disaster plans, CDC recommends using single-dose, pre-armed autoinjectors, unless a higher level of medical response has already been integrated into EMS operations. Additional information on the effects of chemical warfare agents and accepted medical protocols for caring for patients exposed to mustard or nerve agents is available (5&hyph;14).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Recommendations for Hospital Preparedness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Primary Receiving Hospitals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A primary receiving hospital is a hospital that is designated by State or local disaster plans to provide initial medical care to the civilian population in the event of a chemical warfare agent release. Such hospitals must have established protocols detailing evaluation, decontamination, and treatment procedures for patients exposed to chemical warfare agents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Include evaluation, treatment, and decontamination protocols in the hospitals' disaster plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Include chemical warfare agent scenarios in disaster drills for hospitals that have been designated in State or local disaster plans to receive patients exposed to chemical warfare agents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Triage Considerations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Do  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  allow patients exposed to a chemical warfare agent to enter the emergency department without adequate evaluation and decontamination. Signs of mustard agent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure, in particular, may require 24&hyph;48 hours before they become clinically evident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Train medical staff designated by the hospital disaster plan to perform triage during an emergency related to chemical warfare agents to recognize the physical signs and symptoms of patients who have been exposed to such agents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Base modifications to patient triage procedures on the extent of patient contamination, the type of chemical warfare agent to which the patient has been exposed, the patient's clinical status, and the possibility of additional traumatic injuries. Priorities for medical treatment of patients should be determined by the most appropriately trained and experienced medical professional.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Security  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Address issues related to emergency department security during disasters in the hospital disaster plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Restrict access to the hospital to prevent contaminated patients from entering the hospital. During a chemical agent release, security personnel should direct all patients to enter the hospital only through the triage area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Decontamination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Decontaminate all persons who may have been contaminated with a chemical warfare agent. Proper decontamination prevents secondary contamination and chemical injury to medical and rescue personnel. Acceptable decontamination guidelines for persons exposed to chemical warfare agents are published by FEMA and DA (3,4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Have decontamination substances readily available. Suitable decontamination substances include soap, water, and 5% hypochlorite.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;In the hospital disaster plan, detail a method for catching contaminated runoff from patients whether decontamination is done inside or outside the hospital.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

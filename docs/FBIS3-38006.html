The Russian president made this appeal in connection with a  request from the U.N. Secretary General. The relevant draft  resolution instructs Russia's government to resolve the issues  connected with the forming of a corresponding volunteer military  contingent.    The Federation Council decided to consider this issue in the  framework of its defence and security committee Friday morning,  and discuss it at its evening session the same day.</p>

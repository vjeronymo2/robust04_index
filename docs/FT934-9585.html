			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Coal-fired station expected to close NATIONAL POWER, the UK's largest electricity generating company, is expected today to announce plans to close its Staythorpe power station in Nottinghamshire, underlining the decline in demand for coal. The decision to shut the coal-fired station will accompany National Power's half-year results in which Mr John Baker, chief executive, is likely to emphasise the sharp fall in the company's share of the electricity market. The results will be the last before Professor Stephen Littlechild, electricity industry regulator, decides whether to refer National Power and PowerGen, the second-largest generator, to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission over recent price rises in the electricity wholesale market. Evidence of a decline in National Power's market share will add weight to the generators' argument that competition is growing more rapidly than had been expected and weakening their opponents' case for a referral. The competition is being provided by improved performance of nuclear stations and the construction of gas-fired power stations run by independent generators. Ironically the Staythorpe closure is next to a site for which National Power has recently received planning permission to build a much larger 1,500MW combined-cycle gas-fired station. National Power was last night unable to confirm the closure ahead of today's announcement, although workforce representatives were told of the decision yesterday evening. The closure is not expected to take effect immediately. The plant employs more than 100 people and has a capacity to produce 350MW. Its closure is a setback for the Nottinghamshire coalfield which is thought to supply most of the coal which Staythorpe burns in order to make electricity. Staythorpe's closure announcement would be the second in six months, following the news in June of a shutdown at Thorpe Marsh in South Yorkshire with the loss of 200 jobs. That announcement accompanied financial results for the full year. The City expects National Power today to unveil pre-tax profits of Pounds 210m to Pounds 220m for the six months to September 30 against Pounds 201m for the same period last year. However, analysts will be as eager for news on the company's progress in cutting jobs and on the company's decline in market share. The jobs total is expected to have fallen below 7,000 against 7,400 in March and 17,000 prior to privatisation in 1990.</p>

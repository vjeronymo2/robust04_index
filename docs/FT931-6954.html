			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: Rio Algom holds sales but profits slip RIO ALGOM, an independent copper, uranium, potash and coal producer since Rio Tinto Zinc sold its 51 per cent control to the public last June, has reported lower profit for 1992. Though copper prices were favourable, potash operations improved and the Canadian dollar was lower, uranium and metals distribution results were lower. Profit from continuing operations declined to CDollars 39.4m (USDollars 31.2m), or 85 cents a share, from CDollars 44.8m, or 97 cents, a year earlier. Revenues were little changed at CDollars 1.03bn. On the same basis, fourth-quarter net equalled 22 cents a share against 29 cents, on revenues of CDollars 263m against CDollars 264.5m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Teymuraz Mamaladze report on interview with E. Shevardnadze </F> in Moscow "prior to his departure for Tbilisi": "Shevardnadze  Believes that It Is Impossible to Revive the Empire"]    [Text] Verbal political creativity as a result of a  shortage of information indubitably promotes meetings behind  closed doors. Behind the scenes at the Moscow CIS summit, the  fireworks of political neologisms have been blazing.    Unsuccessful attempts to bring together the presidents of  Azerbaijan and Armenia for the long-awaited direct dialogue, the  loud echoes of the "Odessa incident" in the poorly veiled  squabble between the Russian and Ukrainian ministers of defense,  and certain leaders' clear dissatisfaction with the  Russian-Belorussian [Belarusian] agreement, which became an  accomplished fact without their knowledge, provided grounds for  one high-ranking figure to put into circulation a new name for  the CIS -- "the enmity of independent states." He did not get  any applause, however.    According to sources close to the delegations of the  Commonwealth states, the atmosphere at the Moscow meeting  differed in many ways from the previous ones -- for the better.  Everything went without a hitch, they reported, if you did not  count several critical utterances about some of the proposed  documents. But looking at the content side of the meeting --  and this is naturally the main side -- then, according to common  opinion, the CIS has made a significant step toward becoming a  Commonwealth of Independent States in reality.    "Is this true?" I asked Georgian head of state E.  Shevardnadze before he flew back to Tbilisi.    "Our meeting in Moscow," he answered, "has undoubtedly  revealed an increasingly deepening trend toward the formation of  new integrational ties between the independent states within the  framework of the Commonwealth, accompanied by strict  consideration of and respect for their national and state  interests. In this context, I would mention the entire package  of economic documents and the Declaration on the Observance of  Sovereignty, Territorial Integrity, and the Inviolability of the  Borders of the Commonwealth States."    "In the prevailing historical circumstances," E.  Shevardnadze  stressed, "the CIS is a necessity. Its flag is in no way  reminiscent of the state symbols of the Soviet Union, nor is the  Council of Heads of State reminiscent of the Politburo, or, as  the Russian president expressed himself, some kind of enterprise  board with an all-powerful, harsh director in charge. It must  be borne in mind that we adopt all decisions by consensus,  without any kind of pressure. As for contradictions, then these  have appeared in the past and they will appear in the future.  The main thing is what methods will be used to resolve them.  According to my observations, Yeltsin does not use them to  confirm Russia in the role of that 'director.' And to speak of  any revival of the empire in the current conditions is simply  frivolous.    "The main problem of the Commonwealth and its present and  future," the Georgian leader believes, "is its present  unpredictability, which in many respects stems from the  political instability in a number of Commonwealth countries, not  least in Russia, and also from persistent conflicts and friction  in interstate relations. Analogies with the European Union end  here: Its participants have also voluntarily given up part of  their sovereignty. A powerful strengthening force is in  operation in the European Union -- trust. The quicker this  component is implanted in our procedures, the higher the  international authority and prestige of the Commonwealth will be.    "The leaders of the states have agreed that the CIS should  strive for international recognition, and this, apart from the  appropriate status, also means respect for the Commonwealth as a  real factor of peace and security. The CIS will only survive as  an internationally recognized organization guided in its  activity by modern norms of interstate relations."</p>

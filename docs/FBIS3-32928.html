			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Jose, 15 Feb (AFP) -- Guatemalan news agency  CERIGUA, closely connected with the Guatemalan guerrillas,  announced Tuesday that the Guatemalan National Revolutionary  Unity (URNG) has accused the government of President Ramiro de  Leon Carpio of waging a "dirty war" to undermine the peace  negotiations, which are scheduled to begin the second half of  February.    According to the Mexico City datelined dispatch, Miguel  Angel  Sandoval, one of the guerrilla spokespersons, accused the  government and the Guatemalan Army of opposing the "Truth  Commission," which is investigating crimes committed during the  war-torn years in that Central American country. According to  Sandoval, government negotiators will also block the  international verification of the agreements to be signed by the  parties on human rights, which is the first point of the  negotiations, .    CERIGUA also attributed statements to Defense Minister Mario  Enriquez rejecting the creation of the Truth Commission. He  thinks its purposes are "vengeful" and therefore, "instead of  having a conciliatory nature, it tends to divide."    According to the URNG, President Ramiro de Leon "lacks  autonomy, and he limits himself to doing what the Army says,"  which is why his intent is to hinder the dialogue.    In January the United Nations called on the government and  the URNG to resume the peace talks, which had been suspended  since May 1993 in the wake of discrepancies between the parties  on points relating to human rights. The meeting will be held the  second half of February on an as yet unspecified date.    The Guatemalan Catholic Church, however, has expressed  doubts  regarding the seriousness of both of government and the  guerrillas to begin this new phase of the process.</p>

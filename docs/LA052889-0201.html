			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AFTER THE DEATH OF DEBBIE KILLELEA  </P> <P> With the sentencing of Danny Ornelas for the death of my beautiful wife, Debbie  Killelea, it is time for my friends and my family to end a very tragic chapter  in our lives.  </P> <P> Each day is a struggle for my children and myself without Deb, but as time  passes and with the spiritual and emotional help of our friends and faith, we  will manage to survive this very painful period. It is difficult for me to  believe that the pain caused by the loss of Deb will ever die, but I pray that  one day the sorrow will be replaced by our fond memories of a loving and giving  wife and mother.  </P> <P> My faith allows me to believe that Deb had served her time on earth and is now  in a better place. One day, Michael, Hillary, Joseph and myself will be  reunited with her to again enjoy her warm smile, her positive view of life and  her special sense of humor. These convictions truly give me and my family the  strength to continue.  </P> <P> With the end of a chapter we can look forward to the next, and I wish to begin  by thanking my church, family, and friends and all those unknown people who  have prayed and helped my children and myself. At this time I encourage  everyone affected by this tragedy to continue with their lives, as we must. Deb  would want us all to move on and to forgive.  </P> <P> BRIAN M. KILLELEA  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

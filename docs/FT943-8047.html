			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Plutonium parity The FBI apparently believes that the smuggling of plutonium represents the greatest long-term threat to US security. It is hard to disagree. Plutonium is the basic building block of nuclear weapons, and the hardest part of a bomb for a would-be weapons state to produce in secret. It is also a highly toxic metal which, if inhaled in even the smallest quantity, causes cancer. There are thus very good reasons to prevent the theft of plutonium stocks. Yet both superpowers are currently adding to the risks through their laudable nuclear weapons reduction treaties. Almost 20,000 nuclear warheads are being dismantled and their plutonium returned to store. In Russia, the problem is compounded by economic collapse. Poverty encourages smuggling - even the smuggling of plutonium. Whatever the current level of trafficking, there is ample reason to act now before matters deteriorate further. The difficulty, however, is that all nuclear weapons states have been notoriously precious about their bomb programmes and determined to keep weapons stocks under full sovereign control. Russia is also a proud country, and does not take kindly to allegations of nuclear laxity, whether justified or not. In assisting Russia to come to terms with the issue, there is a need for multilateral action which produces the highest standards of plutonium control worldwide, yet does not blame one country for failing to meet its obligations. Since both superpowers agreed to dismantle these warheads, they should both now be prepared to put the surplus plutonium into internationally controlled safe storage, where it can be properly monitored. It would be even better if they were prepared to allow the plutonium to be degraded with civil plutonium so that it would be hard to detonate, and remixed with highly radioactive fission products making it deadly for smugglers to handle. Both Russia and the US should also offer a more open audit of their total plutonium stocks to make theft harder. If the US were to agree to equal oversight, it might ease Russian sensitivities. More should be done to keep redundant Russian nuclear scientists off the streets - a programme which would cost far less than the Dollars 2bn reactor recently promised to North Korea. Washington may balk at such suggestions, arguing that it is not to blame for the current leaks. Yet what better example could it offer to those non-weapons states going to next year's conference on the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty? Weapons states often choose to forget that in the original NPT they agreed to work towards nuclear disarmament. International action to secure and reduce plutonium stocks now would show that they are finally taking those responsibilities seriously.</p>

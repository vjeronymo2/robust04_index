			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (4): Every variety from Apple on display - The strategy of IBM's arch-rival APPLE'S determination to plough its own furrow, away from the fertile fields occupied by IBM PCs and their clones, rarely seemed as justified as it did in 1992. While IBM, its arch-rival in the world of personal computers, posted a loss for the final quarter of Dollars 5.46bn, the highest ever in US corporate history, Apple finished the year on a high note. Quarterly profits were Dollars 161.3m on record sales of Dollars 2bn, close to the level made by IBM's personal computer division. Sales of the Powerbook range of portable computers alone were worth about Dollars 1bn in their first full year on the market. The company's share price reflected the mood, almost doubling in the second half of 1992. One of the factors behind this performance has been an explosion in the company's product range. By the end of this year, Apple will have launched more products than ever before in a two-year period. New arrivals include the Powerbook Duos - portable computers sold with adaptors that turn them into desktop computers - colour screen versions of older models and additions to a range of high-powered, high profit margin machines, the Quadras. This marketing-led proliferation of brands reflects the priorities of Mr John Sculley, Apple's chairman and chief executive, who was recruited from Pepsi-Cola in 1983 to replace the boffins who began the company in the 1970s. In spite of Mr Sculley's marketing credentials, the current brand-led management philosophy is a more recent arrival. 'Two years ago there was a change of strategy,' says Ms Jane Burley, Apple's UK regional group product marketing manager. 'From being a middle-of-the-range desktop computer maker, we moved both upmarket with the Quadras, and downmarket with the Classic and LC models.' Since then, the upmarket Quadras have consolidated their position as the first choice for design studios and publishers, with the help of some price cuts. The move downmarket was largely a matter of cutting the prices of older models. It culminated at the end of 1992 with the price of the cheapest Apples falling below Pounds 400. Although the approach boosted short-term finances, there have been problems behind the scenes. The price cuts and wider range of products boosted sales too much. Last quarter saw turnover 7.4 per cent higher than a year earlier, but margins were eroded and profits fell 2.8 per cent. Still worse, the company was unable to keep up with the demand for some of its products. Potential buyers were turned away as demand outstripped the supply especially of Powerbook portables and the budget models selling into the Christmas market. The price of the bottom-of-the-range Classic has now risen again and the company is busy mollifying frustrated customers. Apple's financial performance, especially compared with other computer hardware suppliers, has also distracted from the fact that the company faces an ever-growing challenge on the software front from Microsoft's Windows programmes. Like Apple software, Windows uses striking graphics to appeal to non-technical buyers. This is more than a matter of pretty packaging: when a computer is easy to use, employers have to pay less for technical help. A survey by market research company Gartner Group shows how expensive it can be to assist the users of unfriendly computers. The cost of owning personal computers based on the old IBM personal computer software, DOS, is one quarter higher than using Windows on a similar computer and 50 per cent more expensive than Apple. Much of the history of Apple has been about the battle between such technical advantages of its software and the marketing of microchip power by IBM and its sales-driven followers such as Dell and Compaq. The arrival of Windows represents a recognition by Apple's rivals that software is as much part of marketing a computer as the model number of its microprocessor. Apple's response has been twofold. In the first instance it has established a set of alliances with IBM itself. The aim is to share the costs of developing the building blocks of the next generation of personal computers. The ventures include Taligent in software more suited to screen graphics, and a tie-up with electronics company Motorola to build a more efficient kind of microchip using the 'reduced instruction set computing', or Risc, approach. The second response is to try to take the friendliness of its technology to new heights. It is driving hard into a new area of computing called 'multimedia' in which text, moving pictures and sound all form part of the application. More dramatic still is its proposed Newton computer, designed to accept handwriting instead of typed-in words and commands. The company has signed alliances with Japanese electronics companies Hitachi and Sharp to develop products associated with the Newton. These ideas have immediate appeal, but Apple is not alone in its efforts. At least one company, Dauphin Technology of Illinois, has announced a Dollars 2,500 computer that it says will compete with the Newton. And last month IBM itself set up a venture in multimedia on which it promised to invest 'tens of millions of dollars'. Apple's world is a fertile one and it has in recent months reaped some of its rewards. But the computer industry moves quickly and for Apple to maintain the momentum it gained in 1992, multimedia and the Newton must succeed.</p>

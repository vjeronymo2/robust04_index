			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: Dow Chemical hurt by European losses DOW CHEMICAL, the second biggest US chemicals company, revealed a 20 per cent drop in second-quarter net income and said it had suffered from the weakness of the US economy and heavy losses in Europe. Although Dow's operating earnings were 9 per cent up at Dollars 568m, the quarter's net profit was Dollars 186m, compared with Dollars 233m a year ago. Second-quarter sales were 1 per cent higher at Dollars 4.9bn. Earnings per share were 68 cents, down by 21 per cent from 86 cents in the second quarter of 1991. Dow noted that earnings per share were reduced by 5 cents because Dow Corning, in which it has a 50 per cent stake, took a Dollars 45m pre-tax second-quarter charge associated with the costs of its discontinued silicone gel breast implant products. Mr Enrique Falla, Dow's executive vice president, called the second-quarter results 'disappointing' and said Dow does not expect to exceed the performance level of 1991 until some time during the second half of this year. He noted that earning momentum in some of Dow's businesses normally lags the economic recovery. Mr Falla added that margins were also squeezed because of lower prices and the European slowdown. Sales for Dow Europe in the quarter were Dollars 1.4bn, down 4 per cent. Operating income from Europe slumped by 79 per cent to Dollars 30m and, excluding earnings from Dow Europe's consumer specialty products business, the area experienced 'an unprecedented loss for the quarter'. In addition, Dow suffered temporary closures of polyethylene plants in Canada and Spain and of a styrene facility in the Netherlands. Dow's chemical and performance products sale were unchanged at Dollars 1.1bn, while operating income recovered by 53 per cent to Dollars 92m. Sales for plastics were unchanged at Dollars 1.7bn while operating income declined by 18 per cent to Dollars 113m. The energy and hydrocarbons division suffered an operating loss of Dollars 47m on Dollars 382m of sales, a fall of 15 per cent year-on-year. Dow's consumer specialties division achieved 18 per cent higher operating income of Dollars 381m on 13 per cent improved sales of Dollars 1.7bn. Monsanto, the Missouri-based chemicals company, meanwhile achieved a Dollars 113m or 92 cents a share second-quarter net profit, compared with a net loss of Dollars 52m (42 cents) a year ago. Last year's earnings were affected by a Dollars 325m after-tax charge for a corporate restructuring programme. Sales in the quarter were Dollars 2.28bn, down from Dollars 2.47bn a year ago, although Monsanto said the 1992 quarter did not include some Dollars 111m of revenues from businesses involved in the restructuring. Operating income from the agricultural division was Dollars 147m, down sharply from Dollars 243m a year ago. The chemicals division managed a Dollars 64m operating profit, against a Dollars 370m loss a year ago. The NutraSweet artificial sugar business suffered a fall in operating earnings, from Dollars 57m to Dollars 49m. The Searle drug business lost Dollars 39m, compared with a Dollars 27m profit a year ago. On Wall Street, Dow's share price was marked  3/8 higher to Dollars 53 1/4 while Monsanto's price slumped by Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 53 7/8 .</p>

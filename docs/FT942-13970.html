			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Technology: Doing away with the dentist's drill The whirring sound of the dentist's drill may soon be little more than an echo from the past for millions if a dentistry technique being promoted by the World Health Organisation catches on. Its novel approach to cavities, or dental caries as they are known to dentists, involves cleaning them with simple hand-held instruments and then filling them with an adhesive material. The material used is glassionomer, which sticks to the teeth and releases fluorides to help protect against future cavities. Glassionomer has been used in the industrialised world for small cavities in front teeth for about a decade. The WHO now believes that the substance could form the basis of improved dental care for millions in the developing countries, thanks to advances in its durability, adhesion and ability to release fluoride. The substance has been tested in Zimbabwe and in rural parts of Thailand where, after three years, 86 per cent of the glassionomer fillings were still in place. The technique, known as atraumatic restorative treatment, has further advantages in the developing countries as it requires neither water nor electricity. The few instruments needed can be stuffed into a satchel, enabling the dentist to carry out the procedure in the field. The restorative treatment was tested and evaluated by Taco Pilot, a professor at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. He and his team believe the process could be also used for those with dental problems in underprivileged urban groups and refugee situations as well as the developing countries. Although widespread water fluoridation has reduced the incidence of tooth decay in industrialised countries over the past 20 years, there are still high-risk populations, according to data published by WHO. In the US, for instance, black children have 65 per cent more untreated tooth decay than the average, while among American Indians it is 265 per cent. More than half of housebound elderly people in the US had not seen a dentist in 10 years, according to the survey.</p>

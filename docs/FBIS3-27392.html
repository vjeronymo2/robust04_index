Three of the seven were executed immediately, while three  more had their sentences suspended for two years, the newspaper  said.    Among those executed were two banking accountants, Shi  Yuqing  and Zheng Xiaojie, who embezzled 189,000 yuan (22,000 dollars)  and 990,000 yuan (114,000) from their respective bank branches.    A further 23 people were given prison sentences ranging from  three years to life for a variety of crimes, including  embezzlement, bribery, fraud and graft.    In a separate report, the newspaper said eight people were  sentenced to death -- suspended in six cases -- for  masterminding a series of robberies at an oil field in  northeastern Hebei province.    On three separate occasions, they entered the oil field and  stole hundreds of barrels of oil which they then sold on the  black market. During one robbery, a dropped cigarette sparked a  serious fire that raged for 21 days, the newspaper said.</p>

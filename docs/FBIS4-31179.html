			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Svetlana Belousova: "Bulgarian Socialist Party </F> Initiates Petition To Topple Berov"]    [Text] At the first sign of deterioration in the social  situation in the country, Yuri Borisov will initiate a petition  among the deputies of the Parliamentary Union for Social  Democracy [PSSD] with the demand to propose a vote of  no-confidence in Lyuben Berov's cabinet. The deputy informed  journalists of his intention during the 29 May plenum of the  Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP].    At their two-day national meeting in Karlovo the members of  the Socialist Youth Union [SMS] decided that their organization  should leave the PSSD if a petition aimed at prompting a  no-confidence vote is not immediately initiated, SMS leader  Lyubomir Nikolov announced on 29 May.    The upcoming 41st BSP Congress should direct the party's  activity toward holding early elections, while the PSSD should  facilitate the adoption of the necessary laws by the end of the  summer vacation, BSP leader Zhan Videnov insisted in the draft  resolution he proposed at the plenum. Videnov also proposed to  the PSSD deputies to reject changes in the cabinet which lead  toward asserting a party character in this organ. In yet  another proposal he suggested to the PSSD to deny support to the  governmental program until September 1994, and seek  possibilities of initiating joint activities with the trade  unions vis-a-vis the cabinet and the social commitments it  assumed.    In his statement he clearly implied that in anything related  to amendments in the Constitution and the Election Law  negotiations must be conducted only with the Union of Democratic  Forces [SDS].    At the plenum Ananieva explained the situation related to  the  confidence vote, requested by the prime minister on 26 May.  According to Ananieva, Aleksandur Tomov [leader of the Civic  Alliance for the Republic] was trying to organize the support of  30 PSSD deputies for the idea of forming a pro-president  government. The alternative of forming a caretaker cabinet had  also been discussed, Ananieva said.    The young Socialist proposed a draft resolution calling on  the PSSD deputies to carry out a vote of no-confidence in their  chairman, but according to Videnov the proposal was not made in  accordance to the correct procedure and was not discussed at the  plenum because of its unserious character.</p>

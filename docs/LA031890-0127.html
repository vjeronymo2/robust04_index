			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YUPPIE HOBOS  </P> <P> Your Jan. 24 article "It's a Jungle Out There" refers to the well-heeled Los  Angeles "Hobo Club" members who like to hop trains. Your report omitted the  other side of the story.  </P> <P> While these yuppie hobos coming from well-heeled backgrounds may be lucky  enough to experience what you describe as a "genuinely American form of  folklore" without getting hurt, not everyone can say the same.  </P> <P> In 1988, for example, 444 people were killed while trespassing on railroad  property. More than 1,000 others were injured -- with many suffering the loss  of a foot or a hand or ending up in a wheelchair as a paraplegic.  </P> <P> In the article, reporter Bob Pool described "the danger of jumping aboard a  moving train, the joy of watching the scenery slide past an open boxcar door  and the thrill of outsmarting railroad police."  </P> <P> I hope he never has to interview a survivor of such fun gone awry.  </P> <P> ED TRANDAHL  </P> <P> Director Special Projects-  </P> <P> Systems Public Relations  </P> <P> Union Pacific Railroad  </P> <P> Omaha, Neb.  </P></p>

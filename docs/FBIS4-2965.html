			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 15 (XINHUA) -- Chinese economists  today forecast the country's gross national product (GDP) would  increase by 11.5 percent this year.    The prediction was the latest made by economists from the  Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the State Statistics  Bureau.    The economists said that, normally, the economy will not  experience a setback abruptly after it has rushed at high speed  for two consecutive years. The growth rate is also welcome as  it prevents ups and downs in the economy and maintains a stable  social order.    "In addition, it benefits foreign investment and the income  of the Chinese people," said economist Li Jingwen.    An improved economic environment, increasing investments and  an expanded infrastructure last year will continue to play a  firm role in pushing the economy, he said.    What the experts are anxious about is inflation, which has  been rising for five months since the last quarter of 1993.    According to the Statistics Bureau, prices in the first  quarter of this year went up more than 20 percent nationwide  over the same period of last year. In 1993 China's inflation  rate was 13 percent.    The economists attributed the driving up of prices to  complicated factors, instead of the sole reason of imbalance in  supply and demands.    However, they expressed satisfaction with the various  methods  which the government has adopted to curb inflation.    "If things go smoothly, the price hikes will be controlled;  at the same time, the economy will avoid being stalled," Li said.    Last year the Chinese Government imposed a macro-control  policy to cool down the overheated economy. But both officials  and scholars said they hoped that the economy would continue to  rise at a moderately high speed.    The economists noted that further GDP growth will be  basically promoted by increased investment. Investment in fixed  assets this year will stand at about 1,500 billion yuan, up 12  percent over 1993.    "But we can bring fixed investment under control if we  control new bank notes and loans," Li said.    The experts advised the government to move actively but  cautiously in the reform this year to avoid uncertainty among  the masses of the people.    They also predicted that the actual per capita income of  urban residents will rise by 10 percent this year, and retail  sales by 8.8 percent.    Meanwhile, urban bank deposits are expected to increase by  26  percent.</p>

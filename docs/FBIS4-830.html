			<p>BFN     [Text] Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini says he has never  supported violence as a means to settle political differences.  Speaking after a 5-hour meeting with a delegation of church  leaders and members of the National Peace Committee, King  Zwelithini called on his subjects to stop killing each other.  He said he was aware that Zulus belong to different political  parties, however, as Christians they should be able to settle  their differences in a peaceful manner.    After the talks, Archbishop Desmond Tutu expressed the hope  that the Zulus would heed their king's call. Peace Committee  Chairman John Hall said South Africa would be relying heavily on  peace structures in the months ahead. He said it might be  necessary to meet with political leaders again to reaffirm their  commitment to the peace accord.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Yamani: Iraq Returns to Oil Market </F> Next Year"]    [Text] London, AL-QUDS AL-'ARABI -- Former Saudi Oil  Minister Shaykh Ahmad Zaki Yamani told an oil conference in  London yesterday that there are indications that a number of  Security Council members have become more agreeable to Iraq's  returning to the world oil market, and that it can be assumed  that this will happen in the middle of next year.    In his opening speech to the fourth conference of the World  Energy Studies Center, which he heads, Yamani said that Iraq's  resumption of oil exports would put OPEC members under great  pressure unless they work to offer it a suitable quota of the  organization's output. He added that the oil price would in  this case fall to $10 a barrel and remain at this level during  1996.    Yamani pointed out that the official U.S. position on Iraq's  resuming its oil exports continues to make it conditional on  Iraq's compliance with all UN resolutions concerning Iraq, but  this position is not now as clear as it used to be.</p>

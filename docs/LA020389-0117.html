			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE CONVICTS 31 IN ILLEGAL PROTEST;  </P> <P> DEMONSTRATION WAS HELD ON VA LAND OVER U.S. EL SALVADOR POLICY  </P> <P> Thirty-one activists opposed to the U.S. policy in El Salvador were convicted  Thursday of holding an unauthorized demonstration on Veterans Administration  property in West Los Angeles, despite their contention that it was necessary to  prevent the breaking of higher law.  </P> <P> U.S. Magistrate Joseph Reichmann, who heard the one-day trial without a jury,  allowed the defendants to avail themselves of the so-called necessity defense,  although defense attorneys Arthur Goldberg and Gail Ivens said they believed  that it was the first time a federal court in California has permitted it.  </P> <P> He sentenced each of them to pay a $50 fine or devote 25 hours to community  service, observing that it might be appropriate for them to give that service  to organizations helping Latin American refugees.  </P> <P> The 31 members of Pledge of Resistance, a national organization that claims a  membership of more than 90,000, were arrested last Oct. 15 after they refused  to leave the National Guard armory on federal property.  </P> <P> They were among about 500 activists marching that day to protest U.S. support  for the government of El Salvador, which they accuse of death-squad  assassinations and other human rights violations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Not Sufficient'  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. Martin J. Murphy contended that the necessity defense was  not applicable, because the defendants were not in danger nor was civil  disobedience their only recourse.  </P> <P> "Mere disagreement with the process is not sufficient for the necessity  defense," he said.  </P> <P> Murphy asked each of the defendants who testified whether he or she was in  personal danger at the armory and whether the orders to leave were clear.  </P> <P> One after another, they freely admitted trespassing and defying orders to  disperse, declaring their conviction that American policy in El Salvador and  the rest of Central America is the greater sin.  </P> <P> "I think that what we're doing in El Salvador -- murdering innocent people --  puts us all in danger," insisted Cynthia Anderson Barker, a UCLA Latin American  studies student who said she has worked for eight years with Lutheran Church  Social Services, helping Latin American refugees obtain legal aid.  </P> <P> She said she was convinced that Salvadorans have been discriminated against in  requests for asylum here and that members of Congress have shown "an incredible  ignorance . . . on what's going on in El Salvador."  </P> <P> She said that shortly before the West Los Angeles demonstration, she visited  the Central American country and saw soldiers prepare to shoot a group of  protesting students, then settle for beating them when they realized there were  witnesses.  </P> <P> "I felt I had no choice but to join the civil disobedience," she testified. "If  I don't, I'm really guilty of murder, because I'm not doing anything to stop  the policy."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Asked to Leave  </P> <P> Army Maj. Jeffrey Kramer testified that the demonstrators were asked to leave  because their presence was disruptive. He conceded on cross-examination,  however, that no one did anything physical to interfere with training.  </P> <P> In the end, the magistrate said he had to find the defendants guilty, despite  their sincere belief in their cause, because they failed to meet the  requirements of a necessity defense.  </P> <P> The courtroom was filled with supporters of the defendants. During the morning,  they held a demonstration outside the Federal Courthouse, displaying three  coffins to symbolize Herbert Anaya, Imelda Medrano and Rigoberto Orellana,  three anti-Salvadoran-government figures they said were murderered by rightist  death squads.  </P></p>

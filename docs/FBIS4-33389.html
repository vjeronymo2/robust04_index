			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has said Mexico  will not be used as a springboard for exports of other nations.  Investments and production must be in the country. Here is a  report by Jaime Guerrero.    [Begin recording] [Guerrero] For the federal government,  there is no alternative. Either one invests and produces in  Mexico or the products of other countries will not be able to  enter the North American free trade zone. President Salinas  clearly stated that our country will not be a mere springboard  for other nations to export to the United States.    [Salinas] That is why these investments, especially German  investments, are taking place now so as to take advantage of  that opportunity, which the treaty has opened and which in fact  means more jobs for our fellow countrymen.    [Guerrero] The president spoke after inaugurating the first  industrial complex of auto parts in Puebla. The inauguration  came during his tour dealing with electricity services. In the  past six years, the electric power generating capacity increased  more than 35 percent. This is equivalent to supplying the  Federal District and Mexico, Nuevo Leon, and Puebla States with  electricity. In short, electric power service in the country is  guaranteed.    [Salinas] Without sufficient electric power, the foundations  for additional economic growth for Mexico could not have been  laid.    [Guerrero] Salinas inaugurated the San Lorenzo Almecatla  electricity substation in Puebla. Afterwards, in Guerrero  State, he inaugurated the Presidente Plutarco Elias Calles  thermoelectric plant. It is the biggest in Latin America and  represents an investment of $2.5 billion. In this tour,  President Salinas inaugurated three infrastructure projects  which received investments from three different countries.    [Salinas] We do not depend on either a single market or a  single investor.    [Guerrero] The results of this administration in the area of  electricity service are positive. Twenty-one million Mexicans  began receiving service and by the end of the government's  six-year term, 95 percent of the population will have  electricity. [end recording]</p>

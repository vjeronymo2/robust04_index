			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Canberra draws up budget tactics AUSTRALIAN cabinet ministers are to form a special 'ministerial strategy' committee to help guide the federal government's contentious budget legislation through parliament. Six weeks since the budget package was unveiled, the government still lacks the support needed to ensure its proposed measures pass in the Senate. Last week, it was obliged to split the original, single budget bill into eight separate bills, because of fears that the 'omnibus' approach could be declared unconstitutional. Yesterday's decision to set up a special committee to oversee the bills' passage through the Senate followed the first cabinet meeting since Prime Minister Paul Keating returned from a two-week overseas trip at the weekend. The committee's aim is to ensure a co-ordinated approach to negotiations with the two minority parties, the Greens and the Australian Democrats, which hold the balance of power in the Senate. The committee will be chaired by whichever minister is responsible for the particular budget bill under consideration. When parliament reconvened yesterday after its two-week break Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer, came under further attack from the opposition over the budget debacle. Mr Dawkins retorted that the opposition was behaving irresponsibly and should 'do the decent and proper thing' by passing the bills. The bills were due to be debated in the House of Representatives last night and could be back in the Senate today. Strike action by Australia's notoriously militant waterfront unions over job cuts was estimated to have left about 46 ships in limbo yesterday. The dispute centres on plans by Australian Stevedores to axe 317 jobs, as part of a cost-cutting plan. The unions, opposed to the move, began industrial action last week, and then called a full-scale stoppage over the weekend. Arbitration began yesterday, but Mr Jim Sweetenson, managing director of Australian Stevedores, estimated that 24 ships were already marooned alongside wharves and 22 more were waiting to enter the country's ports.</p>

			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 3 GROUPS URGE BUSH TO DISMISS THRIFT OFFICIAL  </P> <P> Three public interest groups Wednesday called for the resignation of M. Danny  Wall, but White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that President Bush had  no immediate plans to oust the embattled chairman of the Office of Thrift  Supervision.  </P> <P> The National Taxpayers Union, Public Citizen, and Citizens Against Government  joined the chorus of groups and individuals seeking Wall's resignation because  of his role in the failure of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of Irvine. The three  nonprofit organizations sent a letter to Bush urging him to oust Wall.  </P> <P> "Wall may have cost citizens of this country more than any other political  appointee in history," James Davidson, chairman of the National Taxpayers  Union, said at a press conference.  </P> <P> Wall, who previously headed the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, is under fire for  not acting on a recommendation by regional regulators to seize Lincoln in 1987.  The government did not take control of the thrift until last April, and critics  contend that the delay greatly increased the eventual cost to taxpayers. The  failure could cost taxpayers more than $2 billion.  </P> <P> Asked at a press briefing if the White House planned to fire Wall, Fitzwater  replied: "No, there's been no consideration of Mr. Wall's tenure. He's serving  on the (OTS) board, and there's been no change."  </P> <P> Fitzwater did not elaborate on the statement. Nor did he mention earlier  comments by Bush, who indicated in a recent interview that he would ask Wall to  resign if it were determined that a lack of aggressive action by regulators  contributed to the nationwide thrift crisis.  </P> <P> Wall's agency, however, said studies showed that it had saved taxpayers between  $6 billion and $8 billion last year by selling failed thrifts rather than  liquidating them.  </P> <P> "It's good to know the findings of independent research support our contention  that the record number of cases we resolved in 1988 will mean substantial  reductions in losses and ultimately savings to the taxpayers," Wall said in a  statement.  </P></p>

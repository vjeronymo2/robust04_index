			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Leadership Contest: Close call in Labour grassroots vote - David Owen finds modernisers may just have the edge among constituency members 'The evidence shows that as far as the grassroots are concerned, it will be a very close race.' Mr Patrick Seyd's forecast for the Labour leadership contest carries more weight than most. A senior politics lecturer at the University of Sheffield, he is probably Britain's leading expert on the party's rank-and-file membership. It was his book - co-authored with Mr Paul Whiteley - which two years ago provided the statistical ballast to back up what many people had long suspected: that the average constituency Labour party was no longer dominated by hard-left activists. The two men's research, based on a survey of more than 5,000 party members, demonstrated that Labour's grassroots consists predominantly of middle-class home owners in public-sector non-manual jobs, and nearly two-thirds are male. Mr Seyd said: 'While Labour's membership is principled, it is keen to get power. The Kinnock reforms have grassroots support.' These people - Labour's 250,000 party members - will have one-third of the say, along with the two other segments of the party's electoral college, over who succeeds John Smith. The decidedly un-radical picture which emerges from Mr Seyd's book appears to be a positive sign for Mr Gordon Brown and Mr Tony Blair, the two Labour modernisers who are most likely to run for the leadership. They may be further helped by the steps taken by Labour in recent years to empower the ordinary rank-and-file at the expense of dedicated activists. This should ensure that even the least active members vote. According to Mr Ian Cruickshank, chairman of the Glasgow Garscadden constituency Labour party: 'I don't see many people not returning their ballot paper.' The results of a survey conducted by Mr Seyd 18 months ago among 1,300 new members who joined during the 1992 general election campaign seem to provide further reassurance for the party's leading modernisers. Asked who they would want to be leader if it were not Mr Smith, 26 per cent said Mr Brown and 15 per cent Mr Blair. Mr John Prescott and Mr Robin Cook, two of the leading potential traditionalist candidates, polled only 6 per cent and 4 per cent respectively. Mr Seyd, however, is cautious about the conclusions that should be drawn from this, pointing out the survey took place when Mr Brown's star was at its zenith. He sets more store by a survey of the full membership sample on their attitudes towards shadow-cabinet members. This ranked the four potential candidates more or less equally. Recent results of the annual elections to the constituency section of the party's ruling national executive committee also point to a tight outcome. While the hard-left vote has fallen sharply, the poll was topped last year by Mr David Blunkett, a prominent traditionalist. Mr Blair and Mr Brown were sixth and seventh of the seven candidates elected. But inquiries around a random selection of constituencies suggest that the modernisers may indeed have the edge in this section of the electoral college. Mr Iain McIntosh, secretary of the west London Ealing Southall constituency party - Labour's biggest in terms of membership - said he thought Mr Blair's handling of the crime issue had 'resonated quite well' in that 'very traditional' relatively poor community. Ealing Southall voted 'solidly' for Mr Smith and the deputy leader Mrs Margaret Beckett, and would vote for a 'similar sort of ticket' this time, Mr McIntosh said. If its turnout matches or exceeds the average, Ealing Southall will have the biggest say of any constituency in deciding Labour's next leader since for the first time all votes will count nationally. Under the old system, all constituencies were given an equal weighting and all of a constituency's votes were cast for one candidate. The change will work in favour of the southern constituencies which tend to have a larger membership. The chairman of a key Tory-held marginal critical to Labour's hopes of winning the next general election predicts Mr Blair would 'probably have the edge'. He added: 'This is a constituency where we came so close last time there is a real will to win. People will be looking for someone who will win over the last few wavering voters.' In Glasgow Garscadden, with its relatively elderly constituency profile and towering Labour majority, Mr Cruickshank said local members have 'a tendency to be more to the left than the right' but 'not particularly hard-left'. He predicted there would be a 'Scottish tinge' to the outcome in the constituency. 'A lot of people say Gordon Brown would be the Scottish successor to John Smith.' Labour's Grassroots.

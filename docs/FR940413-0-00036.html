			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Example 10. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Beauty Limited of Montreal, Quebec, sells a shipment of cosmetics to Total Woman, Inc. (a U.S. company) in care of (c/o) Unique Image of Albany, New York. There is no address listed on the invoice for the buyer, Total Woman, Inc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ultimate consignee in this case is Total Woman, Inc., which is the buyer in this transaction. Its name and address must therefore be included on the Customs entry or release documents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Example 11.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Spring Water Company of Los Angeles purchases a load of bottled water from Healthy Water Limited of Calgary, Alberta. The address of Spring Water Company is listed as a post office box in Los Angeles. The water is shipped to Ralph's Grocery Store on Sepulveda Boulevard in Los Angeles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ultimate consignee is Spring Water Company of Los Angeles as the U.S. buyer of the water, regardless of the fact that its address shows a post office box.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Example 12.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FTX Company in Mexico City ships a load of door knobs to the Rio Company in El Paso, Texas. There are no other parties located in the U.S. shown on the invoice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Rio Company should be shown on the entry or release documents in accordance with &sect;142.3(a)(6) since there is no known buyer of the merchandise at the time of its importation and those are the premises in the U.S. to which the imported goods are being delivered. However, if there is a known buyer that name must be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Example 13.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ABC Garments of Edmonton, Alberta, manufactures children's clothing and sells to small boutiques in the U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These boutiques place orders (usually small) with ABC Garments which will accumulate a number of orders before sending them as a consolidated shipment with their customhouse broker listed as consignee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although &sect;141.51, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 141.51), allows all merchandise arriving on one vessel and consigned to one consignee (in this case, the broker) to be included in one entry, the ultimate consignee ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the person to whom the merchandise is sold) for each shipment in the consolidated entry must be provided to Customs in accordance with &sect;&sect;141.86(a)(2) and 142.3(a)(6), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 141.86(a)(2) and 142.3(a)(6)). Furthermore, pursuant to &sect;&sect;24.5(a) and 142.3(a)(6), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 24.5(a) and 142.3(a)(6)), a Customs Form 5106 would also have to be filed for each ultimate consignee for which entry is made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Example 14.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Through Quicksilver Delivery, an international courier company, Just Fabrics, Limited, of Montreal, ships a parcel of fabric cuttings to Dresses-Are-Us in London, England. Dresses-Are-Us is listed as the destination party on the invoice. After Customs clearance, the parcel is forwarded to England by A&hyph;1 Freight Forwarders of Buffalo, New York. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because there is no known buyer in the U.S., A&hyph;1 Freight Forwarders in Buffalo, New York, should be shown on the entry or release documents in accordance with &sect;142.3(a)(6), since theirs are the premises in the U.S. to which the merchandise is to be delivered before being forwarded to England.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Example 15.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Top Hat, Ltd., ships twenty orders of clothing accessories on individual bills of lading to various consignees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The entire shipment is included on a master bill of lading designating a customs broker as consignee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One entry would be filed in this situation in accordance with &sect;141.51, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 141.51). Although the broker listed as consignee on the master bill of lading may be the importer of record, tariff-line items would designate the individual ultimate consignees. Ultimately, all twenty ultimate consignees would be listed on the entry. Some line items may be repeated for more than one ultimate consignee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Drafting Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The principal author of this document was Russell Berger,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulations Branch, U.S. Customs Service.

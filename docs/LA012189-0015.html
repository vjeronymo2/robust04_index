			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RACIAL GAP: LINGERING PROBLEM FOR BLACKS IN AMERICAN SOCIETY  </P> <P> The articles by Times staff writers Lee May ("Stereotypes Haunt Black  Achievement," Part I, Jan. 9) and Ron Harris ("Minorities in TV: Black, White  Issue," Part I, Jan. 11) spotlight the lingering problem of racism in our  country. Such exposure of the prejudices and intolerance toward other human  beings was long overdue.  </P> <P> What those very timely articles may have done is to rouse the conscience of  those who are the staunchest racists but who will never admit it.  </P> <P> It is quite true as they acknowledge, great strides have been made since  slavery and the beginning of this century, especially during the civil rights  movement and remedial legislation; nevertheless, we have a long way to go  before the stigma of racism can be significantly remedied in the United States.  </P> <P> The Times is deserving of praise for featuring those articles on the front  page. If other publications do half as much to contribute toward the solution  of this complex problem, within the next decade or two, we may witness a nation  which has conquered one of the vices which has caused much pain and human  suffering in our country. I hope and pray that the above will be accomplished.  Genuine racial harmony may become a reality.  </P> <P> C. ANTONIO PROVOST  </P> <P> Oceanside  </P></p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / The Markets: London hosts metals jamboree - Commodities The world metal trade and its entourage will be in London this week for the London Metal Exchange's annual jamboree. As dealers, analysts and industry executives mingle at lunches, conferences, seminars and, of course, tomorrow's LME annual dinner, a frequent topic of conversation is sure to be the recent surge in the prices of most metals - can it be maintained, especially if the investment fund money that played a large part in fuelling it is attracted elsewhere? 'The underlying force for the climb in metal prices is demand from end-users, as is shown by the premiums being paid for certain types of metal in certain places,' Mr David King, the LME chief executive, told the Reuters news agency last week. Some senior LME traders are concerned, however, about the growing influence of the investment funds. 'These funds owe no loyalty to commodities,' one pointed out. 'They could bring instability to the market when they try and take profits'. But that view was not shared by Mr King. 'It would be dangerous,' he suggested, 'to exaggerate the importance of fund investment in driving prices higher.' LME Week gets under way today with the start of a two-day conference on the metal industry of the former Soviet Union and a lunch given by the American Metal Market publication. The London-based Metal Bulletin magazine holds a seminar tomorrow on the role of investment activity in base metals markets. And in the evening, guests at the LME annual dinner will hear speeches by Mr Raj Bagri, the exchange's board chairman, and Mr Juan Villarzu, president of Codelco, Chile's state-owned metals and mining concern. The fun continues on Wednesday with a Japanese Metal Mining Agency forum and a presentation by Magma Copper, the US company that last week made the winning bid in the auction sale of Tintaya, Peru's second biggest copper mine.</p>

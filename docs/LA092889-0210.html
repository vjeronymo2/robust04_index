			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> EX-COP HITS MARK WHEN DOING FUSION  </P> <P> Ex-Policeman Andy Summers' current music, all of it vocal-less, falls in the  netherworld cracks somewhere between new age and jazz fusion. His latest album,  "The Golden Wire," veers more toward the former, but his band's performance of  the same songs Tuesday at the Strand in Redondo Beach, happy to say, had more  of the spirit of the latter genre -- tougher, tenser, rockier, more stinging  (no pun intended).  </P> <P> The esteemed guitarist will be bringing his band to Orange County tonight with  a headlining appearance at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> On the new record (his second instrumental release for the Private Music label  after a brief, failed fling with a solo vocal rock career), Summers tends to  opt for the "ambient" -- i.e., somnambulistic -- approach, just right for a  wine-and-cheese party but not appropriate for a your-attention-please club  showcase.  </P> <P> Live, he's wisely put a lot more rock fire and kick into the erstwhile mellow  music, partly by hiring an electronic percussionist and a very busy kit drummer  to replace the tentative drum programming that is the album's sorriest feature.  This was most evident on the LP's title song, which starts as an acoustic solo  number and kicks into a syncopated band jumper; on record you hardly notice the  shift, but in concert the dynamics came through.  </P> <P> At its best, Summers' elixir suggests some kind of '90s lounge music, with  lounge not necessarily used as a pejorative; the expansiveness and  aggressiveness of the music seemed just right at times for the relaxed, open  spaces of the Redondo Beach club.  </P> <P> The guitarist works with a wider palette now than he did with the Police, both  in music styles (Tuesday's concert ran the gamut from Indian-influenced riffing  to reggae) and guitar styles; he still favors those muddled, muffled riffs and  plenty of delay and reverb but also working in some clearer, ringing tones  along the way. His finest moments would come when, after spending minutes  humbly and unassumedly establishing the melody, he would cut himself loose from  it or go against its grain entirely. During one rocker he let fly some tremolo  bar effects that seemed to be in some kind of wild aural 3-D.  </P> <P> Yet the band -- expert players all -- was almost never encouraged to go with  him on these excursions, and even Summers would quickly return from his  dissonant flights of fancy to the basic structure of the song. Which isn't bad,  but it makes one wonder whether Summers' talents might still not be best  applied to fusion, the full risks of which he seems wary to take, than to good  old vocal pop songs, in the context of which his brief off-kilter explosions  have always sounded incendiary indeed.  </P></p>

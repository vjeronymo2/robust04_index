			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Big rise in jobless at Devon resort ILFRACOMBE, the north Devon resort, is the unexpected name at the top of the national league table for the sharpest increase in unemployment over the past year. The town hopes to regain the status of assisted area that it lost eight years ago. Parts of Devon face heavy unemployment because of cuts in traditional industries and because of the absence of government incentives to attract new jobs. Local authorities have applied for the retention of assisted-area status in Plymouth and the restoration of such status in four zones: Barnstaple and Ilfracombe, Bideford, Torbay and Totnes. Unemployment in Ilfracombe is running at 22 per cent and the increase over the past year has been 36.6 per cent. The story of Ilfracombe indicates the significance of assisted-area status and its impact on a local economy. From 1966 to 1982, virtually the whole of north Devon enjoyed development-area status, and a number of new industries were attracted to the area. From 1982, only Ilfracombe retained full development-area status. Since 1984, no incoming manufacturing companies have gone to the town because of the lack of government grants and incentives, while the staple source of work, tourism, has been affected by structural changes in holiday habits. There has been a change away from peak season resort-based visitors towards self-catering. The number of bedspaces in hotels and guest houses in Ilfracombe dropped by 40 per cent between 1976 and 1991. A big obstacle that needs tackling is the poor infrastructure, particularly access by road, which is especially difficult in the crowded summer months.</p>

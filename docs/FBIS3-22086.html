Between the beginning of 1992 and the discovery of  the drug consumers and dealers, the main culprits in Vienna and  in Korneuburg district probably sold about 22.5 kg of cannabis  resin at a price of 100 schillings per gram. Three suspects  were arrested at least temporarily.    A major ring of heroin dealers has been cracked by the  Innsbruck police; eight people have been arrested so far. It  has been proven that the suspects, who are between 18 and 24,  have taken many "shopping trips" to Zurich. The suspects, most  of whom are addicts, appear to have brought several kilos of  heroin to Innsbruck and sold it there in 1992 and 1993.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 18 May -- The Federation Council will reject  the 1994 budget approved by the State Duma. This prediction was  made by Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko. Speaking  to correspondents today, he explained that this "will not be to  spite the government or its prime minister, whom I hold in high  esteem," but merely in the interests of Russia's regions.  Vladimir Shumeyko disclosed that the chamber was actively  discussing the reform program, and deputies do not agree with  all its provisions.    The budget will be discussed with interregional economic  associations. Vladimir Shumeyko said this was why the next  session of the Federation Council was being postponed from 23  May, the date originally scheduled, to 30 May. A number of  questions connected with the economy have been proposed for the  draft agenda.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Where claim must be presented.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A claim must be presented to an agency or instrumentality of the DA. However, the statute of limitations is tolled if a claim is filed with another Government agency and forwarded to the DA within 6 months, or if the claimant makes inquiry of the DA concerning his or her claim within 6 months after it was filed with another agency of the Government. If a claim is received by an official of the DA who is not a claims approval or settlement authority under this chapter, the claim will be transmitted without delay to the nearest claims office or JA office for delivery to such an office.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.54  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> So far as not inconsistent with this chapter, the claims procedures set forth in subpart B will be followed. Subrogated claims will be processed as prescribed in &sect;536.20(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.55  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Law applicable to liability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Claims arising within the United States, and its territories, commonwealths and possessions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As to claims arising in the United States, its territories, commonwealths, and possessions, the law of the place where the act or omission occurred will be applied in determining liability and the effect of contributory negligence on the claimant's right to recover damages. However, theories of strict or absolute liability will not be applicable to claims under this subpart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Claims arising within foreign countries.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) For claims arising in a foreign country, liability of the United States will be assessed by reference to the law of the District of Columbia applicable to torts committed in and having their operative effect in the District (i.e. District of Columbia choice of law rules will not be applicable). The United States shall be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances, except that theories of absolute or strict liability may not be applied under this chapter. Damages will be determined under the provisions of &sect;&sect;536.56 through 536.59.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The law of the place in which the alleged negligent act occurred will be applied to determine the effect of the claimant's own negligence on the merits of the claim. Where there is no law on this issue, the MCA requires application of traditional rules of contributory negligence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) In traffic accident cases, questions of negligence, and the degree of the claimant's comparative negligence, will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluated based on the traffic and vehicle safety laws and regulations of the country in which the accident occurred, but only to the extent they are not specifically superseded or preempted by U.S. military traffic regulations. Likewise, where a claim is based on the failure to comply with some safety or regulatory standard, the standard applicable at time and in the place where the claim arose will be used, rather than any comparable standard in the District of Columbia.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.56  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Measure of damages for property claims.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The measure of damages in property claims arising in the United States or its possessions will be determined in accordance with the law of the place where the incident occurred. The measure of damages in property claims arising overseas will be determined in accordance with the law of the District of Columbia (see &sect;536.55(a).

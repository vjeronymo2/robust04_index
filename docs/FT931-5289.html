			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / International Company News: Ciga share trade suspended as doubts on Situr deal mount SHARES IN CIGA, the Italian luxury hotel chain controlled by the Aga Khan, were suspended yesterday pending a statement by the company. The move followed reports in Italian newspapers that Situr, the privately-owned group which last year agreed to acquire Ciga's hotel-owning subsidiary, had discovered unspecified irregularities in its accounts. The deal with Situr was a vital step in reducing the severe cash flow problems at Ciga, which has built up debts of about L1,000bn (Dollars 639m). After failing to sell some of its hotels, which include flagships such as the Grand in Rome, the deal with Situr represented a lifeline for the company. Under the complex arrangement, Situr would have bought 51 per cent of Ciga Immobialiare, the subsidiary which owns the group's 21 Italian hotels. Combined with a linked transaction involving assets in Sardinia, the deal would have provided around L300bn in cash. The transaction, subject to approval by Ciga's banks, had run into difficulties recently after opposition by many bank creditors. A steering committee of banks has appointed Mediobanca, the Italian merchant bank, to recommend alternatives for the group's future. Matters reached a head this week, when Mr Luigi Clementi, Situr's managing director, was quoted as saying the due diligence audit of Ciga's accounts, to which the transaction was subject, had revealed certain unspecified 'very important facts'. A Ciga spokesman yesterday denied the claim. 'We are not aware of any facts in relation to the latest statements of the company, which have been formally certified by Price Waterhouse.' With financial and stock market pressure on Ciga rising yesterday, the three-way battle of wills between the company, its bankers and Situr looked set to intensify.</p>

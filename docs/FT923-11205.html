			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Shots traded in beer imports war THE US-Canadian beer war came to a head yesterday when the two countries slapped a 50 per cent duty on some imports of each other's beer. The US accounted for the first round by imposing the duty on imports of beer brewed or bottled in Ontario in retaliation for alleged 'discriminatory' practices against American beer. It is the first time the US has imposed sanctions against an individual state or province in a trade dispute. Molson and Labatt, two large Ontario brewers, are expected to suffer the most severe damage. Not to be left lagging, Canada quickly responded with its own 50 per cent tax on imports of some American beers into Ontario. The US has already twice taken its complaints on beer to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) and won panel rulings. Canada has its own complaints against the US, but US officials estimate the damages incurred by American brewers at Dollars 80m compared with Dollars 5m in damages inflicted by US practices. Deadlines set in US trade law forced the US to act now - even though it is the eve of sensitive trade talks. Senior officials of the US, Canada and Mexico are to get together in Mexico City today to try to wrap up final details in the formation of the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Clearly US officials hope to contain damage to the Nafta talks by limiting sanctions to Ontario.</p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Profits rise gives boost to Mitie shares Shares in Mitie Group rose 14p to 337p after the building maintenance company announced a 47 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the six months to end-September. On turnover up 31 per cent at Pounds 46.6m (Pounds 35.6m), profits advanced from Pounds 943,000 to Pounds 1.39m. Earnings per share improved to 7.2p (5.7p) and the interim dividend is raised from 1.5p to 2p. The advance was helped by a fall in interest payments from Pounds 126,000 to Pounds 17,000. The figures excluded a contribution from Olscot, the Scottish cleaning company, the acquisition of which was completed on September 30. Mr David Telling, chairman, said that all group companies had performed well despite the difficult economic environment. The turnround in the fortunes of the cleaning activity in the south-east of England had continued and was an important factor in the profit improvement. Mr Telling added that there were indications that trading conditions would improve in 1994 and the board was confident 'of further significant progress' in the second half.</p>

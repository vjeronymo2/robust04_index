			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / International Company News: Ashanti to seek London listing ASHANTI Goldfields, owned jointly by the Ghanaian government and Lonrho, the international trading conglomerate, is to seek a London listing next year which could value it at up to Pounds 900m. The Ghanaian government, which owns 55 per cent of the mine, has decided to sell about one quarter of its stake. Lonrho, which manages the mine and owns 45 per cent, has decided not to sell any shares. The sale will be Ghana's biggest sell-off exercise to date. It had recently called for interested bids from mining companies and asked the World Bank's International Finance Corporation to handle the sale. But in the past few months it decided that a flotation would raise more. It held a 'beauty parade' of merchant banks last week to advise it on the sale. These included Morgan Grenfell with stockbrokers James Capel and UBS. Mr Emmanuel Agbodo, the head of Ghana's privatisation programme, recently said Ashanti was 'conservatively valued' at Pounds 500m. But the merchant banks competing to advise the government on the flotation believe it could be worth up to Pounds 900m. Following the takeover of Consolidated Goldfields by Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, in 1989, the banks believe there could be 'significant interest' in what will be the first big new listing of a gold mine. However, they will have to overcome doubts about the stability of the Ghanaian economy and overseas dividend remittance. Ashanti had a good first half, with gold production amounting to 380,000 ounces - 16 per cent up on last year. Lonrho has said that projected production for the year at 760,000 ounces is ahead of target. Lonrho will retain operational control of the mines.</p>

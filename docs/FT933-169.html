			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: MPs should lead on pay freezes Sir, You report Gordon Brown's statement to the Labour party conference on full employment, and this is to be welcomed wholeheartedly ('Brown pledges Labour drive for full employment', September 28). A commitment to full employment will give new direction to the party's thinking and campaigning. What is now required is the detailed work on a raft of policies necessary to any significant expansion in the numbers in work. This is a debate in which Labour should attempt to set the agenda, but it will involve some hard choices. You also report Gordon Brown as emphasising the importance of growth in the economy. Of course this is crucial, but growth by itself will not necessarily lead to an expansion in jobs. Other countries, such as Spain, have shown that a doubling in national income can result in an actual decrease in the numbers in work. Crucial to the regaining of full employment is people's attitudes to how the new wealth should be shared. The government asserts that there will be no automatic pay increases in the public sector in the coming year. But, as David Goodhart reported on September 18 ('Keeping the lid on pay rises'), a freeze on recruitment in the public sector would mean 'losing' half a million new jobs. By freezing recruitment, workers could thereby gain a 5 per cent wage increase and appear to keep within the government's overall nil increase in the pay bill. Last year workers at Sheffield City Council were faced with the hard choice of a pay increase and sending some of their colleagues on to the dole queue, or accepting a wage freeze and maintaining the existing workforce. Their choice of the latter was brave and principled. If Labour is serious about setting the debate for full employment, this year's public sector pay round offers a major opportunity. Some will say it will need considerable political courage to spell out the case for a wage freeze in order to safeguard those half a million unfilled jobs. But a clear lead from the Labour party on the need to offer a hand-up to half a million people in the dole queue would win widespread support in the public sector. Labour MPs could give a lead to public sector workers in respect of their own pay here in Parliament. MPs and cabinet ministers are expected to gain an automatic increase in the coming year. Labour should put a motion down suggesting a freeze on MPs' and cabinet ministers' pay, providing that the monies foregone are earmarked for job creation programmes. In this way the public would see there was a direct link in the short term between limiting pay increases and creating new jobs. Sharing out existing pay packets with those in the dole queues is not itself a panacea to full employment. But it would be a start and it would signal a new beginning.

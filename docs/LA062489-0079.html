			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OPINIONS ON OPINION POLL  </P> <P> For some years I've been reading of Richard H. Close's objections to Burbank  Airport, and I would like to comment on his letter of June 3 in reference to  the Los Angeles Times poll concerning the airport.  </P> <P> Mr. Close thinks "the cities of Burbank, Glendale and Pasadena should bear the  majority of the airport noise, since it is their airport." It is their airport  because the city of Los Angeles didn't want to be one of the owners.  </P> <P> However, is it only residents of Burbank, Glendale and Pasadena who use it? No.  </P> <P>  Residents of Sun Valley, Pacoima, North Hollywood, Studio City, Van Nuys,  Sherman Oaks, Woodland Hills and other San Fernando Valley communities (all  part of the city of Los Angeles) use Burbank Airport.  </P> <P> Yes, there is noise, and it is to be hoped that methods of lessening the noise  will be effective. Nevertheless, I shudder to think of the consequences if Mr.  Close and other worthies such as Rep. Howard L. Berman, Assemblyman Richard  Katz and Councilman Joel Wachs were to be successful in their efforts to close  Burbank Airport. Besides the inconvenience to those who like the proximity of  Burbank Airport, we'd all be clogging the 405 to LAX, or the Flyaway in Van  Nuys would have to enlarge its parking lot and add dozens more buses.  </P> <P> LORRAINE M. DAVIS  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> * Dear Family: Lawyer John Cicilline said Monday in a Boston court that the  Mafia is in some ways comparable to the Elks Club. He was speaking on behalf of  his client, reputed New England mob boss Raymond (Junior) Patriarca.  </P> <P> Cicilline said a Mafia induction ceremony was similar to an Elks Club meeting.  "We have men who gather together to discuss an organization, its rules, its  philosophy," Cicilline said. But what about the oaths to kill defectors?  Cicilline said such ideas are protected by constitutional guarantees to free  speech.  </P> <P> * Playing Favorites: Instead of Chicago patronage, politics and race, the  issues were chocolate, strawberry and vanilla. New TV commercials for Edy's  Grand Ice Cream are a spoof on Chicago's well-known Council Wars. "Order,  please," commands the chamber speaker (an actor) in one ad as the real-life  aldermen argue. "Yeah, order more vanilla," responds Roman Pucinski. Alderman  Edward Burke prefers blueberry, Lawrence Bloom can't decide between chocolate  and vanilla. "I love ice cream," said peach partisan and dieter Danny Davis.  "But I have to be careful."  </P> <P> * Order in the Court: The U.S. Supreme Court may be increasingly conservative,  but at least one liberal isn't ready to retire. "I'm still enjoying myself,"  said Justice William J. Brennan. His 84th birthday is today. In March, doctors  treated a bronchial infection with antibiotics. "I had a bad reaction, lost a  lot of weight," but "I'm going to stay" on the bench, he said. That stay has  lasted through 34 years and eight Presidents.  </P> <P> * German Minimalism: West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl returned Monday from an  Austrian spa where he lost 16 pounds from a diet of tea, milk and bouillon. His  weight is now 235 pounds. Kohl said he felt a little "strained" as he joined a  political meeting.  </P></p>

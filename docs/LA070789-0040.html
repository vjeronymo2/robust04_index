			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRADLEY OUTLINES ATTACKS ON CRIME, STREET CONGESTION  </P> <P> Sounding as much like an upstart campaigner as a newly inaugurated fifth-term  incumbent, Mayor Tom Bradley on Thursday unveiled sweeping remedies for the  city's crime-ridden public housing projects, courted support for a stalled  traffic initiative and laid plans to announce a proposal to revitalize one of  Los Angeles' most troubled neighborhoods.  </P> <P> In a City Hall press conference, Bradley, "declaring war" on drugs and violence  at the city's 21 housing projects, proposed a comprehensive, seven-point plan  to increase security and social services for the Housing Authority's 31,000  tenants.  </P> <P> After making the announcement, Bradley raced to a hearing by the executive  board of the Southern California Assn. of Governments (SCAG), where he sought  and won support for his plan to ban 70% of truck traffic from city streets  during rush hours. The SCAG vote by itself will not implement the program, but  it presented the mayor with an important ally on an issue to be heard later  this month before the City Council.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sets Press Conference  </P> <P> The mayor also scheduled a press conference for today to announce what aides  described as yet another "sweeping proposal," this one aimed at revitalizing  South-Central Los Angeles. Details were not available, but the mayor is  expected to announce formation of a task force to promote economic development  in the neighborhood, improve housing, expand job training programs and increase  services for senior citizens.  </P> <P> A press aide promised that the mayor will make the announcement on a "decaying,  grafitti-covered street corner, which symbolizes the charge of the task force."  </P> <P> The proposal is one of many mentioned last week by Bradley in his inaugural  address, in which he promised to make Los Angeles a more livable city.  </P> <P> In part, an aide said, that means limiting growth in those neighborhoods that  are choked with congestion and funneling development to those areas that have  yet to enjoy the booming economy of the last several years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Facing Investigations  </P> <P> The mayor's vigor seemed intended to serve notice that he is still in control  of City Hall, even as he faces investigations into his personal finances and  business dealings. The city attorney, the city controller and the federal  Securities and Exchange Commission are conducting separate inquiries.  </P> <P> "We've been busy, and we will stay busy," said Deputy Mayor Mike Gage, who has  complained about the political paralysis the multiple inquiries have created  for the mayor.  </P> <P> The housing proposal, which does not require council approval, attempts to link  some existing city programs in a concerted effort, allocate more personnel for  others and launch new partnerships with the Police Department and schools.  </P> <P> Proposed are more city police officers to supplement the existing 48-member  housing authority police staff, a bolstering of the housing authority's legal  staff that handles evictions of drug dealers, and the establishment of six  pilot "service centers" to offer job training and placement.  </P> <P> "Tenants need not be economic hostages, forced by poverty to live amidst  violence and drug abuse," Bradley said.  </P> <P> In one of his few appearances before SCAG in several years, Bradley outlined  his partial truck-ban proposal and fielded questions from representatives of  other area cities which suffer the same traffic congestion as Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The 20-member executive committee of SCAG, an alliance of various government  agencies throughout the region, has no jurisdictional authority, but is  influential in the setting of public policy.  </P> <P> The board quickly voted unanimously to endorse the Bradley plan, which would  require trucking companies to reduce their deliveries during the heavy commute  hours.  </P> <P> The proposal is to be brought before the council later this month.  </P></p>

			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Building trade blocs in east Asia and the Pacific THE REGIONAL trade bloc bug is spreading around the globe. The success of the European Community in generating internal trade between its members has encouraged the emergence of new free-trade zones in north and south America, while Efta and the EC are set to create a wider European Economic Area (EEA). Last week the bandwagon reached East Asia. The six members of the Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean) have agreed to establish an Asean free-trade area within 15 years, thereby inventing a new acronym: Afta. Yet the Afta agreement, unlike the EEA or Nafta (North American free-trade area), has been greeted with considerable scepticism. It is not difficult to see why. Lower tariffs on internally traded goods will apply only to manufactures and processed agricultural goods and can be dodged if a product is deemed 'sensitive' or the industry needs protecting as an 'emergency measure'. The Asean members do not, in fact, have a compelling reason to put internal trade links before their external interests. More than 80 per cent of Asean exports went to non-Asean countries in 1990, as the chart shows. Moreover if Singapore, which re-exports many of its imports, is excluded, the share of intra-Asean exports in total exports falls to just 4.6 per cent, against 61 per cent for the intra-regional trade of EC members. The Afta agreement is less a reflection of regional self-interest than a product of Asean fears that they will be excluded from the benefits of global free trade and foreign direct investment. They suspect that developed countries are more concerned with safeguarding their regional trading interests than the multilateral trading system. The EEA will further raise the share of intra-bloc trade in total European trade; the share for the EC and Efta combined was 68 per cent in 1990. Little wonder that the EC appears more interested in completing the internal market than bringing the Uruguay Round of Gatt negotiations to a successful conclusion. Afta is the right response, argued President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines last week, to a world which 'adopts economic exclusion and attrition as a new strategy of national defence'. Yet Asean's modest weight in world trade means it has little negotiating clout alongside the EC. One option is to expand the free-trade area into an East Asian Economic Group (EAEG), including Japan and the three remaining newly industrialised countries (Nics) - South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan. This idea has been championed, with little success, by the Malaysian premier, Dr Mahathir Mohamad. Many potential members, especially Japan, cannot afford to upset the US, which remains opposed to any East Asian free-trade zone. The US has instead backed the toothless Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation group (Apec), a 15-member forum which includes Australia, New Zealand and China. The share of intra-regional trade within total EAEG trade was, in fact, a relatively low 33.8 per cent in 1990. But growing economic ties within East Asia, and the emergence of fledgling market economies, are increasing the proportion of intra-Asian trade. Foreign investment and market structures in southern China have caused China's exports to more than double since 1982, of which 60 per cent goes to other East Asian countries. China, Taiwan and Hong Kong have all joined Apec within the last year, while Vietnam and Laos are queueing to join Asean. Adding in Australasia, China and the remaining East Asian countries to the EAEG increases the proportion of intra-regional trade to 44.2 per cent, higher than the 41.5 per cent of total US, Canadian and Mexican exports that were traded within the proposed Nafta in 1990. That both Nafta and the largest possible East Asian free-trade zone still rely on external trade for more than half their total trade suggests that neither has an interest in undermining the multilateral trading system. But Apec could offer an alternative route to trade dynamism if Europe becomes overtly protectionist or simply loses interest in global free trade. Combining the 23 Nafta, East Asian and Australasian countries into one Asia-Pacific bloc boosts their intra-regional trade ratio to 69.4 per cent in 1990, exceeding that of the EC and Efta combined.</p>

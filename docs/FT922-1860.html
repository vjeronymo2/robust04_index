			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Severn Trent Yesterday's annual results leave no doubt Severn Trent paid too much for Biffa, the waste management company it bought from BET after the start of the last financial year. Thanks to the recession, Biffa contributed a disappointing Pounds 11m, against financing costs of more than Pounds 20m. Barring a vigorous economic recovery, it will make only around Pounds 15m this year. So it is still a long way from covering its costs. Granted, Severn Trent has been sensibly cautious in accounting for the acquisition. Biffa's landfill business in particular looks to have fine scope for growth. By mid-decade, the division should be making the steady unregulated earnings for which it was purchased. The question is whether it will be worth the wait. Severn's annual dividend was increased by 10 per cent, thanks in part to Pounds 4.5m of efficiency gains, but the company's earnings will be under pressure this year as a combination of interest and depreciation charges begins to bite. Small wonder, then, that the company is stressing its record in the regulated water business. The group invested nearly Pounds 600m last year, and claims the lowest average water charges in the country, even though its franchise covers a relatively dry region. Its capital spending programme has already peaked. Severn Trent can keep its dividend running ahead by sacrificing high cover, but that is hardly an inspiring outlook.</p>

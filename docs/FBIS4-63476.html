			<p>BFN     [Text] Having restored the Crimean Constitution to its  previous version, the Crimean Supreme Council session is  continuing to surprise everyone with its highly productive work.  Only two hours after adopting the law on restoring the  constitutional foundations of statehood on the peninsula, it  adopted a resolution on compulsory military service for Crimean  citizens. According to this document, sending Crimean  conscripts to serve in other regions of Ukraine is halted  simultaneously with the adoption of the resolution. They will  be sent outside the Crimea only with their consent. The Supreme  Council charged military commissars of the Crimean Republic and  Sevastopol with ensuring implementation of this resolution.    Explaining the adoption of this resolution, the deputies  were  referring to the bullying of conscripts [words indistinct], as  well as an anti-Crimean syndrome apparently widespread in the  Ukrainian Armed Forces, predominantly in western oblasts. At  the same time, Crimean Military Commissar Oleksandr Volkov,  assured that, according to agreements reached with the  autonomous republic, conscripts have not been sent to these  oblasts for a year and a half. He also noted that the  implementation of this resolution is unrealistic due to the lack  of efficient material utilization and education in the Crimea.</p>

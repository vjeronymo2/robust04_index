			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "America's Half-Hearted Reaction"] </F>   [Text] Pakistan has described the U.S. reaction to the  Indian Prithvi missile test as half-hearted and said that this  action will encourage India to extend the missile race in South  Asia. The United States asked Pakistan and India last year to  stop the manufacture, acquisition, and testing of missiles in  South Asia. Pakistan accepted the U.S. advice, but India did not  respond. The issue was once again raised when Strobe Talbott,  the U.S. deputy secretary of state, visited the region in April.    India then postponed the Prithvi missile test just before  Narasimha Rao's visit to the United States. However, as soon as  Rao concluded the visit, India test fired the missile and made  it clear to the whole world, including the United States, that  it is free to deal with its own matters without regard to the  advice of the United States or any other country. The U.S.  reaction to India's attitude is not only half-hearted, but also  superfluous. As far as Pakistan's nuclear program is concerned,  it has been clearly pointed out to the United States that  Pakistan will not accept any unilateral decision in this regard.  Amazingly, India pays no attention to U.S. advice, nor does it  care about world public opinion on the nuclear issue or on  missile production. This arrogance is leading to a lack of  balance of power and is causing concern and apprehension among  the smaller countries in the region.</p>

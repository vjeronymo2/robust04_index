			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Rights issue helps Select Appointments fund US buy Select Appointments, the international recruitment group, yesterday accompanied news of its sixth acquisition in a year with a financial restructuring. The Dollars 32m (Pounds 21m) purchase of New Boston, a US recruitment business, doubles Select's turnover and will help move the lossmaking UK group into profit. New Boston consists of five speciality employment agencies based in New England. Turnover last year was Dollars 49.8m, with operating profits of Dollars 3.65m. Select reported a reduced loss of Pounds 642,000 last year, on improved sales of Pounds 35m. Select is launching a Pounds 44m rights issue to fund the acquisition, the balance being used for the refinancing. It is issuing 352m new ordinary shares at 12 1/2 p, on a 1.64-for-1 basis. A consortium of Swiss investors, which own 90 per cent of existing shares, have opted not to take their full allocation in order to widen the shareholder base. As a result, their 260m new shares will equate to 80 per cent of the new issued capital, and the remaining 90m shares have been placed with institutions. Select will use Pounds 15m of the rights issue to redeem its preference shares, all of which were bought by the Swiss investment consortium in order to fund the group's ambitious expansion strategy. Mr Zach Miles, Select's finance director, said that the company was searching for further acquisitions. 'Our strategic plan is to be geographically spread in different markets. The recruitment business is cyclical and by being in different locations we can develop a stable income stream.' He added that Select had already moved into profit prior to yesterday's acquisition, and that New Boston would boost this year's results further. Select shares firmed a quarter of a penny to 13p.</p>

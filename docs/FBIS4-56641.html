			<p>BFN     [Text] Montevideo, 5 May (EFE) -- The Uruguayan Government  has decided to unilaterally withdraw from negotiations to  establish a Common Market of the South [Mercosur] common  external tariff until Brazil, the largest Mercosur member  country, clarifies the terms of its proposal to create a  continental free trade zone.    Official sources advised the press of the decision today.  The decision was made by President Luis Alberto Lacalle at the  suggestion of Economy and Finance Minister Ignacio de Posadas.    The minister argued that Uruguay must pay dearly for  maintaining a very high external tariff and cannot permit other  countries in the region to use the American free trade zone to  allow products into Brazil "at a significantly lower cost."</p>

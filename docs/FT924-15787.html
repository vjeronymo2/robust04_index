			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Malaya reduces losses to Pounds 160,000 Malaya Group, the loss-making Mercedes-Benz dealer which recently came under the control of Lancaster Associates Holdings, yesterday reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 160,000 for the first half of 1992. Mr Keith Goldie-Morrison, chairman of the USM-quoted group, said the holding costs of its Billinghurst dealership and the recession had prevented any significant recovery from the Pounds 259,000 deficit last time. Sales rose to Pounds 3.65m (Pounds 3.4m). Operating profit of Pounds 14,600 compared with losses of Pounds 50,000 and interest payable took Pounds 174,600 (Pounds 209,000). Lancaster gained control of Malaya and injected Pounds 3m in new capital under a rights issue in August.</p>

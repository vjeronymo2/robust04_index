			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TECHNIQUES DEMONSTRATED;  </P> <P> MIAMI NURSING SCHOOL MAKES VIDEO ON ALZHEIMER'S  </P> <P> Victims of Alzheimer's disease suffer from the inability to communicate, making  it difficult for families trying to care for them, but one research project has  come up with a few communication techniques that may ease the burden for  everyone.  </P> <P> The University of Miami School of Nursing has produced a 25-minute videotape,  "Communication With the Cognitively Impaired Older Adult," designed to help  nurses and families communicate with elderly people whose thought processes are  impaired by Alzheimer's disease.  </P> <P> The tape demonstrates techniques that proved effective during a 2-year research  project at a North Miami nursing home.  </P> <P> "We know many people don't know how to communicate with these people. The aim  of the tape is to try to convince people that there is something they can do,"  said Ruth Tappen, dean of the School of Nursing.  </P> <P> The physiology of memory and thinking is not well understood. It is believed  that the brain translates the words it receives into concepts, stores the  concepts in the memory, then translates the ideas back into words when they are  needed again.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Translating Process Impaired  </P> <P> Alzheimer's disease somehow impairs that translating process. Victims have  trouble receiving, storing and retrieving ideas. They may retain the mechanical  ability to hear, speak and read words, but lose the meaning of them.  </P> <P> They forget quickly, cannot process new information in a normal way, and  usually suffer impairment in judgment, reasoning and logic.  </P> <P> In conversations, they tend to use short, repetitive phrases, often  interrupting another speaker or stopping in the middle of a sentence. They may  change the subject abruptly, seem to ignore the speaker or give answers that  make no sense.  </P> <P> "These people have, specifically, problems with cognition, the thinking  process. They are not mentally ill or emotionally disturbed," Tappen said.  </P> <P> It is estimated that 5% to 15% of those over 65 suffer some degree of cognitive  impairment, and that 50% of nursing home patients are cognitively impaired.  </P> <P> In the tape, nurses and aides demonstrate techniques that they used during a  "revitalization" project aimed at finding out whether Alzheimer's victims could  be taught to become more independent.  </P> <P> They worked with 20 Alzheimer's patients aged 60 to 103 in groups of six to  eight, helping them perform such tasks as walking, and grooming and feeding  themselves.  </P> <P> It should be noted that communicating with these patients requires an extreme  amount of patience. "It is draining. You are working all the time," Tappen  said.  </P> <P> Some techniques recommended are:  </P> <P> * Speak slowly and allow ample time for a reply. Rapid stimuli are confusing to  the cognitively impaired. Because they have trouble processing thoughts, it  takes them a long time to formulate answers.  </P> <P> * Be repetitive. You may have to repeat yourself five or six times before they  grasp the meaning of your words. Phrase your message several different ways,  using simple synonyms. Use the same words they have used -- it indicates that  they may have retained some recognition of that word.  </P> <P> * Ask simple yes-or-no questions. A therapist on the tape gets no reply when  she asks a woman to "Tell me something about yourself." But the woman is able  to answer such questions as "Are you married?" and "Do you have children?"  </P> <P> * Avoid pronouns such as he, she and it. Repeating the name of the person or  thing may help them remember what you were talking about.  </P> <P> * Do things one step at a time. Instead of telling a patient to "Eat your  breakfast," nurses and aides got better results when they broke down their  instructions into separate steps such as "Pick up your glass" and "Drink your  juice."  </P> <P> * Be concrete. Talk about things you can see, feel, point to or show pictures  of. Attempts to discuss philosophical, hypothetical or abstract topics will  probably compound their confusion.  </P> <P> * Be supportive and keep criticism to a minimum. Alzheimer's victims may become  frustrated, embarrassed or frightened by their failure to communicate. Show  respect and understand that they may be very much aware of what's going on  around them.  </P> <P> "They're impaired adults. They shouldn't be treated like children," Tappen  said. "Would you want to be treated like a child again?"  </P> <P> * Use gestures and nonverbal cues. Demonstrate or act out your words when  possible. Many cognitively impaired people seem adept at reading nonverbal  cues. Pay attention to their nonverbal cues, too. Their voice tone, gestures  and facial expression may provide clues to what they are trying to communicate  even if the words don't make sense.  </P> <P> * Maintain eye contact. It helps hold their attention and can help you measure  whether they comprehend what you are saying. Watch your spatial relationship.  If they are sitting and you are standing, you may literally be talking over  their heads. If they can see or hear better on one side, sit on that side.  </P> <P> * Use touch. A light pat or touch on the arm can reassure them, get their  attention and prepare them to receive information. Approach them from the front  and don't touch them without speaking first or you may startle them.  </P> <P> * Understand that it may be easier for them to talk about the past than about  current events because those old memories have been "stored" and can be  retrieved.  </P></p>

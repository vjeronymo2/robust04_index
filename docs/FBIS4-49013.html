			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, May 1 (XINHUA) -- The last round of the  PLO-Israeli peace talks resumed here today to put the finishing  touches on the general agreement of the implementation of the  Gaza-Jericho self-rule deal.    The Palestinian side is presided by Major General  'Abd-al-Razek al-Yehya, for the chief PLO negotiator Nabil  Shaath is in Tunisia now, and the Israeli side is headed by  Major General Ammon Shahak, the Israeli deputy chief of staff.    Khaled al-Qudra, a member of the Palestinian negotiating  delegation, said in a press release that the Palestinian and  Israeli sides are about to finish the phraseology of the general  agreement.    Some sources close to the talks said that the viewpoints of  the two sides were brought closer and that agreement on the  standing disputable issues are expected to be phrased out in  paragraphs of the general agreement during this round.    As for the entry of the Palestinian police force into the  Gaza Strip and Jericho, the Israelis consider accessing of 25  elements of the Palestinian police vanguards on the day of  initialling the agreement. A week later 1,000 to 1,500  Palestinian policemen will be permitted entry.    The Palestinian side deems as necessary the deployment of  all  the Palestinian police force, not only 25 of them, during the  first week after signing the agreement following the withdrawal  of the Israeli Army, slated for the second day after initialling  the agreement.    The sources said that 'Arafat and Rabin are due to discuss  during their imminent meeting, slated for Tuesday [3 May]  evening, two issues: the size of Jericho area and the  Palestinian police presence at border crossings.    This round of talks is scheduled to last for three days and  end on Tuesday evening, the night before signing the final  agreement on Wednesday.    President Husni Mubarak of Egypt, the Palestinian President  Yasir 'Arafat, the U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher  and the Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres held a conference  on April 28 to probe ways of removing the standing obstacles  before initialling the final PLO-Israeli agreement on  implementing the Gaza-Jericho deal.    President Mubarak said after the conference that the  Palestinian and the Israeli sides agreed on holding a meeting  between the Palestinian President 'Arafat and the Israeli Prime  Minister Rabin on May 3 and signing the final agreement the  following day.</p>

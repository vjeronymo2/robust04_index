			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Appointments: US forests branch out Fountain Forestry, a private company managing some 350,000 acres of trees in the UK and the US for institutions and wealthy individuals, has made its US president Bruce Jacobs a director of Fountain Forestry Incorporated, a division of the group. Based near Concord, New Hampshire, the 42-year-old American is managing primarily hardwood forests along the length of the Appalachians, from Vermont southwards. With a degree in forestry and a period of research during which he developed a speciality in hardwoods, Jacobs came to Fountain from International Paper in 1984 and has been president of the US operations for a year. As well as looking after some 150,000 acres of land, Jacobs will be recruiting new investors. A handful of US institutions put forests in their portfolios, but he will mostly be flying to seminars in the UK and Europe, selling chunks of US forest that are much cheaper than the UK equivalent because of prime growing conditions. Fountain, with others, attained a degree of notoriety in the early 1980s for its afforestation of a remote corner of Scotland when the 'green money-machine', operating for wealthy famous names ranging from media to snooker stars, caused an environmental furore. Since then there has been 'steady progress in reconciling commercial with environmental objectives,' says Barry Gamble, managing director of the group. 'Indeed, our management practices are now championed by conservation groups in the US.' Fountain is a management buyout company, in which Charterhouse Development Capital has a 20 per cent stake. Jacobs is not a shareholder; there are complications in giving share options to a US-based director.</p>

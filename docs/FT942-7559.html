			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Management: Dizzy pace of change The trend for UK companies to allow their subsidiaries greater autonomy looks set to continue. But the move to political correctness in the boardroom is proceeding at an even dizzier pace. This emerges from a survey of company structures and group management styles among 270 finance directors of leading UK quoted companies by the venture capital group 3i. The report* says most respondents (71 per cent) identify their companies with the 'strategic control' model, where short-term financial performance and long-term strategies are of equal concern to the centre; 16 per cent said that their management style could best be characterised as 'financial control' (the centre's primary role is to set strict financial targets while delegating strategic decisions); and 15 per cent said they had adopted a 'strategic planning' model (where the centre aims to shape the strategies of the group as a whole). A surprising issue raised by the research is how to describe these 'increasingly autonomous operating companies'. The authors say 'the term 'subsidiary', though accurate, is no longer 'politically correct''. The reason why, however, is left to readers' imagination. As for future corporate trends, most respondents expect a cut in the size of head offices; a majority now employ less than 1 per cent of their total staff at headquarters. Further elimination of middle management tiers is predicted; as is the growing need for managers to be technically qualified and the need to build structures and training. Improvements in information technology will 'allow more control' but 'require greater accountability of operating companies'. * Available from 3i, 91 Waterloo Road, London SE1 8XP</p>

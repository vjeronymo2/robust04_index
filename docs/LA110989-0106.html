			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> ORDERS TO REMOVE SANTA PAULA PLAYER CAUSE COMMOTION  </P> <P> Santa Paula High coaches are still upset about the events surrounding the  removal of Freddie Torrez from Saturday's 35-21 loss to Santa Clara.  </P> <P> The controversy began because Dr. Michael Huff removed Torrez from the game  because he felt the player was in danger of rupturing his spleen.  </P> <P> Santa Paula coaches were unaware that Huff was the game physician and  questioned his authority to remove Torrez.  </P> <P> Torrez, who starts at outside linebacker and fullback, had complained about  pain in his side after getting hit numerous times during the first half.  Torres, however, did not believe he had suffered a serious injury.  </P> <P> "Some guy comes running out on the field and says Torrez has to come out,"  Santa Paula Coach Mike Tsoutsouvas said. "I told him he's not hurt. The guy  goes crazy and starts yelling at us that he's the game doctor. We don't even  know who he is. He was wearing a Santa Clara jacket and he never identified  himself."  </P> <P> Tsoutsouvas said he had his player examined by another doctor before Torrez was  allowed to continue to play in the second half.  </P> <P> Huff, who works as a family physician in Oxnard, said he didn't see Torrez get  hurt in the first half, but was asked for advice about the player's condition.  Huff said he later witnessed Torrez get hit a half-dozen more times in the side  during the second half and felt that Torrez could have been suffering from a  ruptured spleen.  </P> <P> "By the way he was grabbing his side, I had reason to believe that if he played  further, he could suffer a significant injury," Huff said. "I also felt that it  was possible that nothing was wrong. But it wasn't worth the risk. He was taken  out of the game at my request."  </P> <P> Huff admitted, however, he should have handled the situation in a more  professional manner. "The situation was handled poorly for a number of  reasons," he said. "There was a failure to communicate between me and their  coaching staff. It was 100% my fault."  </P> <P> Add Torrez: The Santa Paula starter is healthy enough to play, but will not be  in the lineup for tonight's finale against Calabasas.  </P> <P> Torrez was suspended from school for a week by Santa Paula administrators  because he cursed at Huff and slammed his helmet into the ground after being  removed from Saturday's game.  </P> <P> Torrez has a 3.2 grade-point average and an excellent attendance record,  according to Santa Paula athletic director Henry Jacinto.  </P> <P> Add suspensions: Also, four Santa Paula players were suspended before the Santa  Clara game because of disciplinary reasons.  </P> <P> They are kicker Juan Carlos Rodriguez, fullback Jamie Jimenez, defensive tackle  Richard Polcori and tight end Gabriel Alcantar. None will play this week.  </P> <P> Ups and downs: For lessons in the importance of maintaining quality football  teams at the freshman and sophomore levels, look no further than Hueneme and  Fillmore highs. Not only do players become acquainted with the philosophies of  their varsity coaches, but they also develop an attitude toward winning and  losing.  </P> <P> Hueneme (0-9 overall, 0-6 in the Channel League), for example, may suffer their  first winless season under Coach George Machado. That team is composed of  seniors who also failed to win a game at the freshman and sophomore levels.  </P> <P> "It's like the old story about the circus elephant," Machado said. "You teach a  baby elephant not to run away by tying a heavy chain from his leg to a stake.  What happens after a short time is the elephant stops pulling on the chain.  </P> <P> "That's why you see an older elephant tied to a stake with a thin rope. It  doesn't want to make the effort.  </P> <P> "I thought we had as much talent as Dos Pueblos and San Marcos. But they  traditionally win and play well as a team. We didn't have the intestinal  fortitude to pull the rope. We were afraid to take the extra step to become a  good team."  </P> <P> Fillmore (9-0, 4-0) has become the upstart of the Tri-Valley League and the  Flashes believe they has can knock perennial league champion Carpinteria from  its perch tonight.  </P> <P> The juniors on Fillmore have never lost a Tri-Valley League game at any level.  </P> <P> "To the kids, Carpinteria is no big mystical entity that we have to worry  about," Fillmore Coach Curtis Garner said. "They have beaten them as freshman  and sophomores and they see no reason why they can't beat them as juniors. I  think their confidence has rubbed off on the seniors."  </P> <P> Add Fillmore: Quarterback/safety Chad Van Winkle, who missed two games with  torn ligaments in his right (throwing) thumb, will start on defense and be used  in a reserve role on offense.  </P> <P> Art Sosa, who started the season at wide receiver, has been the quarterback the  past two weeks. Garner is reluctant to make any changes. Sosa, more of a  running threat than a passer, has 11 completions in 33 attempts for 141 yards  and three touchdowns.  </P> <P> "I think we're getting the job done with Sosa as quarterback," Garner said.  "Van Winkle did a great job for us earlier this season, but I hate to make a  change when we're winning."  </P> <P> In six starts, Van Winkle has completed 37 of 70 passes for 531 yards and four  touchdowns.  </P> <P> Young leader: St. Bonaventure sophomore Peter Houston made his season debut at  quarterback against Fillmore after injuries sidelined senior Chris Conley  (separated shoulder) and junior Jeff Hicks (torn ligaments in his right knee).  </P> <P> Houston completed five of 10 passes for 30 yards with one interception.  </P> <P> "I thought he did a real good for a sophomore playing against one of toughest  defenses around," Coach Damian Wilkerson said.  </P> <P> Water polo: Ventura High finished in a tie with Dos Pueblos for the Channel  League title with a 9-1 record and is ranked fifth in the final 2-A poll.  </P> <P> Ventura will open the playoffs Thursday against the winner of Tuesday's Temple  City-Pasadena Poly wild-card match. Buena, which finished third in league play  at 6-4, travels to Cabrillo today.  </P></p>

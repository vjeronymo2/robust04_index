			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Major moves to regain political initiative THE GOVERNMENT is to launch a new year drive to regain its grip on the domestic political agenda after its preoccupation in recent months with economic crisis management and the battles in the Tory party over Europe. Senior ministers are planning a series of initiatives to demonstrate that the recent political turmoil has not dented the government's determination to meet the policy objectives in its April election manifesto. Among the initiatives will be measures to restructure and expand education and training opportunities for the 16-to-19 age group; intensified co-operation with business through developing an industrial strategy; and significant reforms of the police and of the treatment of juvenile offenders. Mr John Major is anxious also to restore the momentum of the Citizen's Charter by tightening the standards set for public services. Plans for the policy launches reflect growing if still cautious confidence among ministers that the signs of economic recovery have lifted the state of siege imposed on the government by sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism in September. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said yesterday he was hopeful that the combination of a sharp fall in interest rates, the fall in the value of the pound and the recovery measures in the Autumn Statement was beginning to yield results. He said that businessmen were now sounding more optimistic as Britain had positioned itself in a way that held out better prospects for growth. Other ministers said the successful outcome of this weekend's Edinburgh summit would also support Mr Major's efforts to rebuild his authority after the disasters of the past few months. The prime minister was conscious, however, that the government needed to dispel the impression of drift in domestic policymaking. He was determined that the central themes of the election manifesto - opportunity, choice and responsibility - were fully reflected in Whitehall decisions. The key elements in the new year package will be a restructuring of the training and technical education available to teenagers. The Departments of Education and Employment are to co-ordinate expansion of further education places and the extension of training vouchers and vocational qualifications. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, plans to add substance to the pledge of a new 'partnership' with manufacturing industry. The immediate focus will be fresh deregulation, involving every department in Whitehall. Mr Major has signalled his interest in wider help for industry by calling a Downing Street seminar for ministers and representatives of the food industry.</p>

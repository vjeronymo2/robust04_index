Under the  bill on international agreements adopted by Ukraine's parliament  recently, such statements are not subject to the process of  ratification, he pointed out. The document signed by the  Russian, American and Ukrainian presidents in Moscow "serves to  develop the resolution on the ratification of START-1 adopted by  the Ukrainian parliament, Zlenko said.    According to him, no nuclear country recognized the way  Ukraine's parliament ratified START-1. "International isolation  could bring Ukraine to its knees. Its independence would be out  of the question," the foreign minister said.    Earlier a number of influential members of Ukraine's  parliament strongly criticized the trilateral document on  Ukraine's nuclear disarmament signed in Moscow.</p>

			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> U.S. Deeper in Debt: The United States, already the world's largest debtor  nation, strengthened its hold on that dubious title in 1988 as its foreign debt  surged 41% to $532.5 billion. The Commerce Department, releasing its annual  balance sheet on America's global economic standing, said the U.S. debt burden  had risen by $154.2 billion in 1988, up from $378.3 billion in debt to  foreigners the United States owed at the end of 1987. The figures mean that  foreigners own more in U.S. assets than Americans own abroad.  </P></p>

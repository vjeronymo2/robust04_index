			<p>BFN     [Text] Viktor Mikhaylov, the Russian minister for atomic  energy, has said that a train carrying 25 tonnes of  highly-enriched uranium obtained through dismantling nuclear  warheads will arrive in Ukraine from Russia in the next few  days. He said in an interview with INTERFAX on Monday that it  is planned to send another train to Ukraine in April with  nuclear power plant fuel. Altogether Russia is to supply 100  tonnes of highly-enriched uranium to Ukraine as a compensation  for the removal of nuclear warheads from that republic.</p>

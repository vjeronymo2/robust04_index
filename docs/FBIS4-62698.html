			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Konstantin Parishkura under the "Neighbors" </F> rubric: "Crimea Wants Out of Ukraine"]    [Text] A session of Crimea's parliament will reinstate in  the next few days the 6 May 1992 Constitution of the Republic of  Crimea under which Crimea is not part of Ukraine. This was  announced to journalists by Sergey Tsekov, speaker of the  Crimean Supreme Council, in his first news conference on 15 May.  The Crimean Supreme Council's final objective is to restore  unity with Russia, he said. This is recorded in the programs of  the Republican Party and the "Russia" election bloc from which  the majority of the deputies and President Yuriy Meshkov were  elected. The speaker also intimated that a Crimean national  guard will soon be set up.    Vyacheslav Chornovil, leader of the People's Rukh of  Ukraine,  has stated in this connection to the "INTERFAX-UKRAINE" news  agency: "A coup is under way in Crimea with all-round support  from the Russian Federation." In his view, the fact that  "ranking officials from Russia are taking part" in the work of  the Crimean parliament is also a matter for concern. They "are  suggesting to Crimean leaders the idea that Crimea join the CIS,  and that Crimea should raise the question of the withdrawal of  Ukraine's armed forces from its territory."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 18 Feb (NA) -- President Carlos Menem  allegedly held a telephone conversation with Cuban leader Fidel  Castro. During the conversation, which lasted several minutes,  the two leaders discussed the situation of their respective  countries and, particularly, the commercial blockade against  Cuba.    This information was published today by the Buenos Aires  daily AMBITO FINANCIERO, which also said the contact had been  made by a relative of Menem, of Syrian origin, who lives in  Havana.    According to the press report, Menem spoke to his relative  and after the protocol greetings, she said, "I will put you on  to a friend" and Castro's voice appeared on the other end of the  line.    Relations between Menem and Castro remain distant because  the  Argentine president criticizes his Cuban counterpart for not  calling elections in the island so its inhabitants can elect  their leaders.</p>

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / International Company News: Munich bank expands in Hungary Bayerische Landesbank, the Munich-based regional bank, is paying Ft5.8bn (Dollars 56m) for a stake in Kulkereskedelmi Bank, Hungary's fourth largest bank. BLB is taking a 25 per cent stake with the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development taking a further 17 per cent. The Munich bank is the first western bank after the Dutch ING to take part in a significant east European bank privatisation. ING took a stake in Bank Slaski in Poland but most international banks prefer stand-alone branches in the former communist bloc. The acquisition of a Hungarian bank accords with BLB's drive to expand in central Europe. In the past two months, it has emerged that BLB is forming a joint-venture building society in the Czech Republic, taking a stake in a savings bank in Bolzano in northern Italy and exploring an investment in Austria's troubled GiroCredit. JP Morgan, the US investment bank, acted as adviser to the Hungarian government and Kulkereskedelmi Bank.</p>

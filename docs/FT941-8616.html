			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: CSFB shrugs off costs of restructure CS First Boston, the New York-based investment bank which underwent significant management changes and a heavy structural reorganisation last year, showed yesterday that the upheavals had little impact on profitability. The bank unveiled record annual net income of Dollars 328m for 1993. The final result was a big improvement on the previous year, when CS First Boston, a unit of the Swiss banking group CS Holdings, earned a disappointing Dollars 175m. Pre-tax income also rose sharply last year, climbing to Dollars 440m from Dollars 277m in 1992. The firm said its return on common equity, a key measure of profitability, was 32.1 per cent in 1993, and its capital rose 54 per cent to Dollars 4.65bn. Like every other big Wall Street investment bank, CS First Boston benefited greatly last year from low US interest rates, active domestic and international stock and bond markets, and heavy demand from corporations worldwide for underwriting and other investment banking services. The firm said the largest contribution to profits came from the trading and sales of fixed-income and derivative securities. Strong results from underwriting debt and equity issues, especially those of newly-privatised companies, also played a big part in the improvement in earnings. Last year was marked by considerable change at CS First Boston. After years of struggling to overcome the rivalries and confused corporate identity created by having three separate units in New York, London and Tokyo, the firm decided to reorganise its businesses on product, rather than geographic, lines, and unify the global operations under a single name: CS First Boston. Also, there was change at the top of the firm when Mr Archibald Cox, head of the New York unit, resigned following a spate of defections by top investment bankers unhappy with their annual bonuses. After Mr Cox's departure, CS First Boston appointed Mr Allen Wheat, who had previously run the Tokyo operation and, later, the firm's highly-profitable derivatives business, as its new president and chief operating officer. He now reports to Mr John Hennessy, the chief executive.</p>

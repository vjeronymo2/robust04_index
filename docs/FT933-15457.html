			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices slip in nervous market OIL PRICES slipped by 30 cents in light trading in London yesterday as many traders stayed out of the market because of uncertainty over the Iraqi oil talks in New York. The Baghdad government is talking to the United Nations about a one-off sale of Dollars 1.6bn-worth of oil to pay for humanitarian aid. North Sea Brent crude for August delivery dropped from Dollars 17.20 a barrel to Dollars 16.90 a barrel after edging upwards on Tuesday as traders took profits on short positions following large falls last week. The talks broke up yesterday with the leader of the Iraqi delegation saying they had been 'in a spirit of co-operation'. Iraq is believed to have softened resistance to some conditions attached to the sale. Talks resume today and could take over a week. 'The market is nervous and thin,' said one trader. Buyers have been reluctant to stock up ahead of the Iraqi oil talks as if they are successful and Iraqi oil returns to the market, prices could plunge. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries is monitoring the situation carefully and would probably call an emergency meeting if the talks proved successful.</p>

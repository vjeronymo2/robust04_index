			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PALMDALE DAY-CARE CENTER GETS PROBATION IN ABUSE CHARGES  </P> <P> A Palmdale day-care center has been placed on three years probation as part of  a settlement between the state and its owner, who had been accused of  physically abusing children there and in her home, officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> A two-year investigation led state authorities to sanction the license of the  Agapeland Center for Children, 1850 E. Avenue R, and its operator, Debra L.  Sweeney, 34, of Palmdale. In addition, the state permanently revoked the  license Sweeney and her husband held to provide foster care in their home.  </P> <P> In a settlement with state officials, Sweeney admitted biting, pinching and  slapping a girl in her home on East Avenue R-13 in 1987. Her husband, James,  admitted hitting the girl and a boy there, "sometimes using a wooden board,"  numerous times between February, 1985, and July, 1987.  </P> <P> In return, the state did not press criminal charges against the couple and  allowed her to continue to operate the day-care center. Additionally, the state  agreed not to pursue other allegations of abuse against the couple.  </P> <P> The Christian-oriented facility, licensed for 72 children, leases space from  the First Presbyterian Church.  </P> <P> Neither of the Sweeneys could be reached for comment Thursday about the case.  </P> <P> Under the terms of the settlement, Sweeney must not be alone with children at  the center, must see a therapist until it is found "she poses no risk to  children" and must provide training for all staff members to ensure that their  disciplinary practices comply with state standards.  </P> <P> A 21-count accusation filed by the state Department of Social Services earlier  this year also accused Debra Sweeney of failing to hire qualified day-care  teachers and of failing to comply with criminal record clearance requirements  for center employees.  </P> <P> In addition, she also allegedly battered a foster girl, who was under the age  of 10, and forced her to work "as a servant" at home and at the day-care center  for more than two years until July, 1987. County officials, acting on a  complaint, removed the girl. The boy had already left the home by then.  </P> <P> The accusation also said Sweeney suffered a miscarriage in 1985 and forced the  girl "to carry the plastic bag of fetal remains to the doctor." It also accused  Debra Sweeney of slapping the face of a child at the day-care center, screaming  at an infant there and grabbing and pushing a third child.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Two opposition Knesset factions, the Likud and the  National Religious Party [NRP], are due to submit to the  parliamentary secretariat the 30 signatures required for a  special plenary session. It would take up the issue of the  deployment of the Palestinian police in the territories.    NRP Knesset Member Hanan Porat told Qol Yisra'el that the  urgent session was being called because the house had not been  given any details about the makeup and strength of the force,  not its equipment. Porat said that facts were being created on  the ground without the knowledge and approval of the Knesset.</p>

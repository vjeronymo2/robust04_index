			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Arts: Aristocrat with a vicious streak / Review of Patrice Chereau's production of 'Don Giovanni' for the Salzburg Festival There can have been few more enticing festival prospects this summer than Patrice Chereau's new production of Don Giovanni at Salzburg. Despite the success of his centenary Ring at Bayreuth and the inducements offered by major companies, the French director has been a rare visitor to the opera house. He is now vowing to give up the theatre altogether and devote himself to film, a medium in which - judging by the recently-released La Reine Margot - he still has something to learn. Gerard Mortier can, therefore, count himself lucky to have won Chereau's services for Salzburg and for a work which, ever since Furtwangler's legendary performances, has been a stern testing ground. The new production has been cooking for a long time. A Chereau Don Giovanni was first mooted by Rolf Liebermann in Paris in the 1970s, and the idea was later picked up by Daniel Barenboim in his ill-fated plans for the opening of the Opera Bastille. So it is no surprise to find Barenboim conducting in Salzburg, with a cast as glittering as can be gathered today. As in Chereau's staging of Lucio Silla (Brussels 1984), Richard Peduzzi has designed a single set consisting of a huge stage-wide facade. It is faintly indented with architectural features, painted blue-grey with some red at the side, and modulated where necessary to suggest a door, an alley or a window. The sinking or raising of stage platforms lends the same subtle variation to the playing area, which - despite the width of the Grosses Festspielhaus proscenium - is well focused. In the churchyard scene, two giant stone heads appear - one signifying retribution for Giovanni, the other presumably for Leporello - and the larger of the two returns for the finale, crashing through the wall and trapping Giovanni beneath it. Moidele Bickel's costumes are rococo, and the subdued lighting illuminates the cast's movements rather than their faces. The character of the performance is determined entirely by Chereau's choreography, which flows with the music and is often strikingly realistic. After his swordfight with the Commendatore, for example, Giovanni hurls Leporello to the floor in a fit of angry remorse, only to end up beside him  -kneeling over his victim's corpse. The scene in which Elvira interrupts Giovanni and Zerlina has an almost balletic impulse as he swirls them across stage holding one and then the other. And there is a very human touch in Act 2, when Leporello's guise is uncovered and he still wants Elvira's hand - but is rejected. Beyond the choreography, Chereau seems unwilling or unable to take a strong interpretative stance. The performance develops an air of uncompromising austerity - there is precious little humour - and the characters are not strongly etched. Donna Elvira fares best, partly because of the larger-than-life stage personality of Catherine Malfitano. Chereau has her veiled and prostrate in a distant corner for 'Ah] chi mi dice mai', but never overplays the lovelorn neurosis. Malfitano underpins her performance with a confident display of Mozartian coloratura, showing again what a versatile artist she is. At the other end of the spectrum is Donna Anna, a figure embodying fragility and sorrow rather than fire and passion. Lella Cuberli's singing was brittle and sometimes barely audible. Don Ottavio profited from her weakness: looking more like an advocate than a wimp, Peter Seiffert seemed very much at home in the part and sang exquisitely. Cecilia Bartoli's petite Zerlina was sparky rather than sexy, the voice perfectly tuned but a bit small for this theatre. Andreas Kohn was the shadowy Masetto, Matti Salminen a massive Commendatore. Which leaves the central pair of master and servant, a distinction Chereau respects. It would be hard to imagine a more sympathetic Leporello than Bryn Terfel, boasting a long mane of hair and an easy stage presence. His intelligent grasp of words and musical line, allied to his soft-grained bass-baritone, is in Salzburg's finest Mozart tradition. Ferruccio Furlanetto, who sang Leporello in the Karajan production, cuts a handsome figure in the title role and sounds effortlessly suave. His Giovanni is an aristocrat with a vicious streak, whose sole misdemeanour is to have killed the man who challenged him to a duel. He shows too many pangs of conscience, too much gentlemanly courtesy, to rank as a libertine. Sensuality is in short supply, not least in the Serenade and there is no sign of debauchery. In short, Giovanni does not stand out enough from the rest of the cast. The biggest disappointment is the contribution of Barenboim and the Vienna Philharmonic, whose soft-focus accompaniments sounded like background music, shedding little light on character or drama. For long stretches one could comfortably forget the orchestra was there - until Barenboim produced one of his sudden forte outbursts. Anyone looking for Mortier's revolution in Salzburg would find little evidence of it here. But the show is a useful crowd-puller, certain to impress the festival's rich, unrepentant clientele.</p>

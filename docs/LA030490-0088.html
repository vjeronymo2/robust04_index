			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POINT DEDUCTION  </P> <P> Regarding deduction of the cost of points on the refinance of a home residence  on your income tax, both Robert Bruss, and now Benny L. Kass are giving out  incorrect information.  </P> <P> While it is true that points are not usually deductible in one year on a  refinance, but must be amortized over the life of the loan, there are  exceptions.  </P> <P> Before our refinance this year, I carefully investigated with the IRS, and  found out that if the points are paid out of separate funds rather than the  funds advanced by lender through the refinancing, and if a portion of the  refinance money is used to improve your home, the points may be deducted in  full in the same year.  </P> <P> With the cost of home remodeling, it is certainly possible to deduct the full  cost of points on a refinance in the year the loan is obtained, as we are  doing. You are doing a disservice to your readers not to get this information  out to them before they refinance, so that they may pay the points out of  separate funds and thus qualify.  </P> <P> DOROTHY E. FIERING  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks  </P></p>

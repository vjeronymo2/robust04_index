			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / International Company News: Flotations set to raise record amount MORE than Pounds 2bn was raised through flotations in the first three quarters of the year and the full year total looks set to exceed the Pounds 2.6bn record set in 1987, according to figures released today by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountants. Commenting on the figures, which exclude privatisations and other issues raising more than Pounds 1bn, Mr Neil Austin, head of new issues at KPMG, said: 'the amount of funds being raised on the markets is very encouraging for an economy not fully clear of recession.' In the third quarter 35 new entrants came to market, despite the impact of the summer holidays, compared with 20 in the same period last year and 28 in the 1991 third quarter. The third quarter numbers boosted the total for the first three quarters this year to 93 companies, back up to the levels seen in 1989 and 1990. Last year 52 companies came to market in the first nine months. However, the Unlisted Securities Market, which the stock exchange is thinking of closing, only had one company join it in the third quarter, bringing the total for the year to date to just three. The KPMG report suggests, therefore, that the number of companies joining the market as a whole will not recover to the levels enjoyed in the mid to late-1980s, when substantial numbers of companies were joining the USM. Mr Austin says he remains concerned about the needs of smaller growing companies, which he does not believe are being catered for by the Official List. 'The average capitalisation of companies coming to market remains low, with some companies joining the market with capitalisations as low as Pounds 10m,' said Mr Austin. 'Past experience shows that smaller companies can have many problems with the stock market when the boom is over, including lack of marketability of their shares and difficulty raising capital at a sensible price.' As a result he argues that 'there is still a pressing need for an alternative market for smaller companies, one better suited to their needs and capitalisation.' KPMG's research shows that smaller companies join the market with the expectation that their shares will be marketable and provide them with funds for expansion, but are 'very often disappointed with the actual outcome.' Mr Austin also sounds a note of caution about the number of companies joining the market at present, arguing that there appears to be 'an element of opportunism.' He said a number of companies are floating for the traditional reasons, either private companies wishing to raise capital for expansion, or management buy-outs and institutionally-backed companies seeking an exit. 'There are however a number of opportunistic flotations seeking to capitalise on the current high prices being paid by the market, he added. 'A number of such companies may find that they cannot fulfil their ambitions when the markets turn again, and such companies fall out of favour.'</p>

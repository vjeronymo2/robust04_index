			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 14 (YONHAP) -- The good news is that  South Koreans became much more richer and in the world's fastest  speed, but the bad news is that the country is underdeveloped in  most other areas, particularly in environment.    Korea's per capita national income growth was the world's  greatest in 1985-1992, with an average rise of 8.5 percent,  according to indicators of a creditable institution.    Elementary school enrollment rate was 100 percent for Korea,  sharing the top place with France, Britain, Japan, China, and 10  other countries.    "The World Bank Atlas 1994", a book of comparative  indicators  of population, economy, and environment of 207 countries with  the help of the associated United Nations agencies like the  International Labor Organization and United Nations Educational,  Scientific, and Cultural Organization, was obtained and released  Friday by the Finance Ministry.    But Korea showed energy inefficiency with its gross domestic  product (GDP) per one kilogram estimated at 3.4 U.S. dollars  and scored low in most other indicators in comparison with  advanced countries.    Korea ranked 15th with a GNP (gross national product) of  296.3 billion dollars, in the similar line with Australia (299.3  billion dollars) and Mexico (294.8 billion dollars). Per capita  national income was 6,790 dollars, the world's 32th.    Per capita income grew 8.5 percent from 1985 to 1992, the  world's greatest, and all South Koreans had primary schooling,  sharing the priviledge of just 14 other countries. Illiteracy,  in result, was just 4 percent.    China topped with the biggest population of 1.17 billion,  followed by India with 880 million, and the United States with  260 million. Korea ranked 25th with 44.66 million.    Population growth in 1985-1992 was 1 percent, the world's  57th, and average life expectancy was 71 years old, 61th on the  rankings.    Per capita woman employment rate was 34 percent (68th) and  child birth per a woman was 1.8, the world's 16th lowest.  Under-one infant death rate was 13 per every 10,000 live  births, the world's 42th, doubling the number of five in Japan.    Inflation in 1985-1992 averaged 6.8 percent, the world's  68th, and farming share in the GDP was 8 percent (38th), exports  portion, 29 percent (66th), and investment accounting for 39  percent (eighth).    Per capita energy consumption was 1,936 kilograms (40th) and  GDP estimation of one kg of energy was 3.4 dollars, the world's  76th, just half of Japan's 7.6 dollars.    Withdrawals of water resources in 1970-1989 was 17 percent  (32th) and per capital water withdrawals was 299 square meters  (65th). Forest area was 65 square kilometers, compared with  North Korea's 90 square kilometers.</p>

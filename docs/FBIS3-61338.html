			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Armen Khanbabyan: "Peace, Light, and a New </F> Constitution, the President Promises in 1994"]    [Text] Levon Ter-Petrosyan's New Year's address was  reminiscent more of a political speech than a holiday address.  The president declared that the current extremely difficult  situation left little room for optimism. But the situation would  deteriorate even further unless the war in Karabakh were ended  and the problem of the blockade resolved. According to the  president, certain opportunities for the establishment of a  long-term and firm armistice appeared at the end of the past  year. Yerevan and Stepanakert agreed to the peacemaking  initiatives of the CSCE and Russia. Azerbaijan rejected these  initiatives, attempting to settle the problem militarily;  nonetheless, the Armenian leader believes that before the end of  the present year, Baku will have reached the conclusion of the  futility of military pressure and of the need for compromise.  According to Ter-Petrosyan, there is now hope that the year that  has just begun will be one of peace.    The president termed the adoption of a new constitution a  most important factor of the preservation of domestic political  stability, expressing the hope here that it would be possible to  adopt the Basic Law this year also.    Levon Ter-Petrosyan called the third task whose  accomplishment in the very near future is inevitable the  achievement of energy independence. The government is hoping for  a resumption of the operation of the Armenian Nuclear Electric  Power Station. As the president said, preliminary expert  evaluations are promising, and there are all the prerequisites  for the nuclear power station coming on stream as of the start  of next winter.    If all that was promised in Ter-Petrosyan's address to the  nation really comes to pass, 1994 could be considered a success.  But in reality, circumstances could shape up somewhat  differently. The termination of Russian assistance and regional  neighbors' abrupt obstruction on the question of a resumption of  the operation of the nuclear power station could put back  fulfillment of the dream of energy independence for an  indefinitely long period of time. It would be extremely  difficult under present conditions to cope in isolation with  this technically very complex task, which requires, in addition,  considerable foreign currency investments. The adoption of a new  constitution could drag on also, inasmuch as parliament is not  disposed to rush this matter--this would mean, after all, early  parliamentary elections, about which a large part of the  people's elect thinks with fear and trembling.    It is possible that the hopes for peace could be realized,  it  is true, but not, most likely, thanks to the efforts of the  international community of Russia or Iran, of which Armenia  recently requested mediation in the conflict. The situation in  Karabakh today is reminiscent of the situation that took shape  following Abulfaz Elchibey's assumption of power. At that time  the Azerbaijani leader succeeded, using Russian mercenaries, in  breaking the resistance of the inadequately trained self-defense  detachments and in occupying roughly half the territory of the  Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. But the people of Karabakh held their  ground and in time not only retrieved what they had lost, but  also settled many questions of their security, pushing back the  front a considerable distance from Stepanakert and other  localities of their republic. Major defeats destabilized the  situation in Baku and played a decisive part in Elchibey's  departure from the political arena.    Today Geydar Aliyev is continuing to increase the pressure  on  Karabakh. In two weeks of fighting, Azerbaijani formations  reinforced by detachments of Russian mercenaries and Afghan  mojahedin have already lost over 700 men killed and a  considerable quantity of armor. But they have yet to accomplish  a single tactical assignment in a single sector of the front.  And this despite the vigorous activity of guard detachments  composed mainly of Chechens executing retreating forces, both  Azerbaijanis and Russian mercenaries. In addition, the savage  pre-New Year's shelling in the border areas of Armenia have  provoked the increased offensive activity of the Karabakh people  themselves, and the situation has in places today once again  begun to shape up to the disadvantage of the Azerbaijani Army,  which again runs the risk of losing the strategic initiative.  Such a development of events in the future could represent a  great danger for Geydar Aliyev. An endeavor to escape the fate  of his predecessor could force the present Azerbaijani leader to  begin to move toward compromise. If this does happen, it will  not, however, be before spring, when it will finally be clear  that on this occasion also the blockade and the severe winter  difficulties have not changed the situation in Armenia.</p>

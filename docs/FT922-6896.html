			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Major and Thatcher clash over Maastricht: Prime minister's assurances contradicted by predecessor A CLASH of views between Mr John Major and Mrs Margaret Thatcher over Maastricht's impact on European Community powers last night jarred with government attempts to control today's expected revolt by Tory MPs over the treaty's ratification. Mr Major's predecessor as prime minister flatly contradicted his assurance to those Conservative MPs worried about a European super-state that Maastricht 'marks the point at which, for the first time, we have begun to reverse that centralising trend'. In The European newspaper today, Mrs Thatcher writes that Maastricht 'passes colossal powers from parliamentary governments to a central bureaucracy'. Mr Major, like Mrs Thatcher, favoured stiff resistance to the threatened loosening of UK border controls. But his comments amounted to a rebuff to his predecessor, implying she had overseen moves towards centralisation, while he had reversed the trend. He said the 1986 Single European Act and its accompanying declaration recognised Britain's concern to keep border controls in order to stop terrorism, illegal immigration and drug smuggling. Mr Major told Euro-sceptics that Britain would 'fight for that position' even if the dispute went to the European court. In her article, Mrs Thatcher said she was 'amazed when I hear it suggested that it (the declaration) does not have the force of law and can be ignored. Upholding it is a matter of good faith and good faith, once lost, is hard to regain'. Up to 20 or 30 Conservative MPs, some heartened by Mrs Thatcher's interventions, together with possibly a higher number of rebel Labour MPs, are expected to vote against the government tonight. One potential rebel, Mr John Biffen, former Conservative cabinet minister, expressed 'considerable reservations' about the centralising impact of Maastricht. But the bill is likely to pass its second reading comfortably. Labour MPs are supposed officially to abstain and Liberal Democrats will support it. Government whips have stepped up the pressure particularly on new Tory MPs, warning that careers would be wrecked by opposing, or abstaining on, the bill. Mr Major sought to appease critics, saying that 'what we kept out of the Maastricht Treaty is as important as what is in the Treaty'. There was no Social Chapter, no diminution of Nato's role, no word 'federal', and Britain retained 'an absolute right' to decide in its own time whether to move to the third stage of economic and monetary union. He added: 'Many in this house and throughout the country have expressed anxiety that decision-making in the Community is becoming too centralised. In fact, many of the issues which are most problematic for us . . . are ones that arise from the application of the original Treaty of Rome, not the Maastricht Treaty.' Mr Major stressed the importance of the legally binding text he secured at Maastricht on 'subsidiarity' - the principle of decisions being made at the lowest possible levels. If necessary, Britain could take disputes over its implementation to the European Court of Justice, he said - angering those Scottish Labour MPs calling for devolution. The prime minister quoted Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, as saying that, 'if a success is to be made of Maastricht and the single market, the Commission will have to comply fully with the principle of subsidiarity. Indeed its future existence depends on this'. Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, urged the prime minister to end his 'opt-out' mentality. But the opposition front bench also had to face tough criticism from its own Euro-sceptics as the debate continued.

			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PRODUCERS GAMBLED WITH WOMAN'S LIFE, LAWYER CHARGES;  </P> <P> STUNT: SUIT OVER BLAST  </P> <P> Producers of the "Airwolf" television series "gambled with Desiree Kerns' life  and career" by having the stunt woman unknowingly detonate a gasoline bomb in a  pickup truck while she was in the vehicle, her lawyer said Wednesday during a  civil trial in San Fernando Superior Court.  </P> <P> Kerns, 33, suffered second- and third-degree burns on her face, scalp, neck and  arm as she leaped from a pickup truck rigged with an explosive device in a 1985  stunt for the television series. She is suing the show's director, producer,  stunt coordinator and special-effects coordinator for unspecified damages.  </P> <P> In his opening statement, Kerns' attorney, Gerald L. Kroll, told jurors that  the show's producers were "on a limited budget and running out of time," so  they set up the dangerous stunt "the cheap and easy way."  </P> <P> Originally, the script called for a stunt woman to detonate a smoke bomb, then  jump out of the truck. Cameramen were to film the truck explosion later, Kroll  said, when there were no passengers inside.  </P> <P> But to save time and money, stunt coordinator Ron Stein, one of the four  defendants, decided Kerns would detonate the gasoline bomb while she was still  in the truck so the shot could be filmed in one take rather than two, Kroll  said.  </P> <P> However, Stein never told Kerns of the change in plans, fearing that Kerns, who  had little experience with pyrotechnics and stunts involving fire, would refuse  to perform the stunt. He told her just to "press the button and jump out of the  truck," Kroll said.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Thomas A. Foster denied that "Airwolf" producers ignored  safety to save money. Foster said Stein and others discussed the stunt with  Kerns several times and "she appeared to hear what was going on."  </P> <P> A special-effects technician specifically told Kerns that she would detonate a  gasoline bomb, Foster said.  </P> <P> But when the 20-foot-high fireball engulfed the truck, Kerns was not wearing  any of the standard safety devices used in pyrotechnic stunts, her attorney  said.  </P> <P> "She had no protective clothing, no fire retardant wig or fire retardant gel  for her skin. She did not request these things because she expected smoke. She  had no reason to expect fire," Kroll said.  </P> <P> Kroll said the accident occurred just as Kerns "hit the magic stride of her  career that stunt people dream of." After seven years in the business, she had  daily stunt jobs and grossed about $200,000 a year, Kroll said.  </P> <P> Since the accident, he said, Kerns has not performed any stunt work.  </P></p>

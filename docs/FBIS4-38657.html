			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 27, RIA -- A "moment of truth" is  approaching in the effort to settle the Karabakh conflict, where  all political forces and all participant states are expected to  decide whether they want to stop bloodshed and settle the  conflict by peaceful means, or they want to use the problems  engendered by the conflict for their own domestic and foreign  political ends, a RIA correspondent was told by Vladimir  Kazimirov, the Russian president's envoy in charge of  facilitating negotiations in order to attain political  settlement in Nagorny Karabakh [Nagorno- Karabakh].    On the current situation in the region, the Russian diplomat  said although the May 12 ceasefire agreement - which is valuable  - is being observed, the situation is fragile and insecure.  Kazimirov holds that what is needed is clear striving by all  parties to the conflict to turn the interval into a firm truce  and to settle all outstanding issues exclusively at the  negotiating table.    The diplomat said that Russia stands for an end to the armed  conflict, is making specific proposals, an unbiased intermediary  as she is, and is ready to back them up with specific deeds.  "We are open for practical cooperation with the aim of settling  the conflict with the involvement of the international  community, in particular the CIS, the CSCE and the UN,"  Kazimirov concluded.</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Failed deal shows gaps in US telecoms - Louise Kehoe examines the collapse of talks between Bell Atlantic and TCI When the proposed merger failed between two of the most ambitious companies in the US communications sector, Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications (TCI), it reflected a serious lag between regulatory changes and the restructuring of the industry. Bell Atlantic, the regional telephone company serving the the middle part of America's eastern seaboard, and TCI, the largest US cable television company, would have formed a formidable force in multi-media communications. But on Wednesday night, the companies announced they were abandoning their merger, worth more than Dollars 20bn. As Mr Raymond Smith, chairman and chief executive of Bell Atlantic, put it, 'The unsettled regulatory climate made it too difficult for the parties to value the future today.' Earlier in the week, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced regulations to force cable television operators to lower their prices. It was prompted by 1992 legislation addressing concerns that the cable industry was abusing local monopolies and raising its prices excessively. The planned Bell Atlantic-TCI merger was built on the premise that, in the not-too-distant future, such monopolies and those of regional telephone companies, will disappear. The FCC's move to lower cable TV prices appears to have been the last straw in the protracted negotiations between Bell Atlantic and TCI. The companies had twice extended the deadline for the completion of their merger talks, which began last October. Mr Smith said they had finally resolved their differences and were close to reaching a definitive agreement; but the FCC's actions 'made reaching a final agreement on the transaction impossible'. TCI issued a statement strongly criticising the FCC's action as 'unwarranted, excessively severe, and harmful both to the national telecommunications objectives promoted by the Clinton administration and, ultimately, to the interests of consumers'. The cable TV company said it will join others in legal challenges to the FCC actions. It also announced it will suspend Dollars 500m, or half of its planned capital spending for 1994, pending further clarification of the FCC's regulations. Bell Atlantic said the FCC action, requiring US cable TV companies to lower prices for basic services by 7 per cent, must have raised questions about the valuation placed on TCI in the talks. Mr James Cullen, president of Bell Atlantic, said: 'The FCC announcement reduced the price to the point where TCI did not feel it could recommend the transaction to its shareholders.' However, Mr Reed Hundt, FCC chairman, rejected suggestions that the agency's action had undermined the deal. He said the price cut 'did not in any way make the future of the cable industry more unsettled'. Another factor in the deal's collapse may have been weakness in Bell Atlantic's share price, which fell from Dollars 67 in mid-October when the deal was announced to close at Dollars 53 1/4 on Wednesday, before the companies announced the abortion of the merger. Whatever the reasons, the failure of the Bell Atlantic-TCI deal seems sure to cool the excitement surrounding the 'convergence' of the US communications, television, computer and entertainment industries to create nation-wide 'information superhighways'. The Bell Atlantic-TCI merger, creating what Mr Smith had boasted would be 'a model for communications companies in the next century', had become the symbol of a new era of unregulated communications. Such an environment would free technology companies to create multi-media communications services, ranging from desktop video conferencing to interactive television. The Clinton administration has made the creation of such advanced communication services an important element of its economic policy, with Vice-President Al Gore regularly promoting the social and economic benefits of the 'information superhighway'. Only a few weeks ago, the Vice-President assured industry leaders that 'this administration will not let existing regulatory structures impede or distort the evolution of the communications industry'. The collapse of the Bell Atlantic-TCI deal is therefore likely to reverberate in Washington, putting increased pressure on the administration to come up with an overdue legislative package to revamp communications regulations.</p>

			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXTRA REVENUE FOR PAY RAISES, MORE POLICE;  </P> <P> HUNTINGTON PARK IMPOSES 7% UTILITY TAX  </P> <P> Beginning this summer, residents and business owners will pay an additional 7%  charge on their telephone, electricity, natural gas and water bills.  </P> <P> The City Council voted unanimously last week to impose the utility tax to raise  about $2.74 million a year to fund additional police protection and other city  services, Huntington Park officials said. The tax takes effect July 1.  </P> <P> Without the new charge, officials said, Huntington Park would be forced to  forgo employee raises during the 1989-90 fiscal year, which begins July 1. It  would also have had to spend all but $10,000 of a $475,000 general fund reserve  and reduce spending in other areas, such as tree trimming, officials said. The  general fund pays for most city services, such as law enforcement and fire  protection.  </P> <P> "This is probably the single most difficult decision I've had to make on the  council," Councilman Herbert A. Hennes Jr. said. "This one here goes to the  heart of every citizen in town. I don't know any alternatives."  </P> <P> About 75 people attended a special hearing on the tax before the council voted  Monday night. About half of the speakers favored the new tax to put more police  officers on the street.  </P> <P> Resident George Fair told of the time he was tied up and robbed at his home in  1986. "It took 20 minutes for an officer to get to my house," Fair said. "I  hope it doesn't happen to someone else."  </P> <P> The Southeast Chapter of the United Neighborhoods Organization and the  Huntington Park Senior Citizens also supported the tax.  </P> <P> But Oscar Lopez said the tax would be a hardship once he, his wife and three  children move into a new Huntington Park home in the next several weeks. "I  think maybe you need to cut programs that are less important," Lopez said.  </P> <P> But the council members decided the financial sacrifice was warranted in light  of the proposed budget for 1989-90 that was presented recently by City  Administrative Officer Donald L. Jeffers. The spending plan, which did not  include revenue from the utility tax, was balanced but anticipated more than  $200,000 in cuts for tree trimming and other city maintenance. It also reduced  the budget for such items as Christmas decorations for Pacific Boulevard and a  subsidy for the Huntington Park Symphony Assn.  </P> <P> Raises for city employees were not included. Huntington Park employees received  a 4.2% raise for this fiscal year, which costs the city about $300,000  annually, Jeffers said.  </P> <P> Jeffers said the city is feeling the full effects of Proposition 13 now that  state and federal subsidies have been reduced or eliminated.  </P> <P> Without the new tax, revenues in the city's general fund in 1989-90 would have  been $9.7 million, about the same as 1987-88 revenues, according to the  preliminary budget.  </P> <P> The preliminary budget forecasts overall revenues and expenditures of $27.7  million. That includes money restricted to pay for public transportation, the  city retirement plan and other items in addition to direct daily operating  costs.  </P> <P> The Huntington Park Redevelopment Agency has also added to the city's financial  problems, city officials said.  </P> <P> The city's redevelopment program has failed to generate enough property-tax  income to meet the Redevelopment Agency's $4.4-million annual bond payments.  City officials said project delays, caused by high interest rates in the  mid-1980s, are responsible for the shortfall.  </P> <P> </P> <P> City Helps Make Payments  </P> <P> The Redevelopment Agency has relied on the city to help make the bond payments.  Sales tax revenue, which would otherwise go into the city's general fund, has  been loaned to the agency over the past several years.  </P> <P> The city loaned the Redevelopment Agency about $1.5 million during 1987-88.  That amount is expected to be reduced to about $800,000 this year, and to about  $500,000 in the next fiscal year as more projects are completed and generate  tax revenue for the agency, Jeffers said.  </P> <P> City officials said the loans were responsible for a cash-flow crisis in 1987  that forced the City Council to eliminate 13 positions and make other spending  cuts.  </P> <P> Resident Raul R. Perez, who ran unsuccessfully for City Council last year,  complained that city residents and businesses are now going to be taxed to  compensate for the money that is being funneled to the Redevelopment Agency.  Members of the City Council also serve as directors of the Redevelopment  Agency.  </P> <P> "It was poor management on their part," Perez said after the hearing. "Now they  want to get it from us."  </P> <P> Mayor William P. Cunningham said in an interview, "That might be true, but we  plan on getting (the loaned money) back."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Urgency Doubted  </P> <P> Cunningham said the city would have needed the additional revenue from the  utility tax to increase services, although it might not have been needed so  soon.  </P> <P> The council members and virtually all the residents who testified Monday agreed  that the city needs more police officers.  </P> <P> The number of officers in Huntington Park has remained fairly stable over the  past two decades -- about 56 officers in 1972, contrasted with 59 now,  officials said. But the population has grown from 33,744 in 1970 to about  52,000 now, according to the U.S. Census Bureau figures and population  projections.  </P> <P> "We can't continue with the same numbers we have," Councilman Thomas E. Jackson  said.  </P> <P> The Police Department suffered the brunt of the cutbacks in 1987, losing three  officer positions, and five clerical and support positions. The department is  authorized to have 59 sworn officers, but two officers are injured and two  positions are vacant, Police Chief Patrick M. Connolly said.  </P> <P> The preliminary budget includes money to restore one of the lost positions,  Connolly said. But the chief says he needs at least two more sergeants and 13  more officers to meet the law enforcement demands in Huntington Park. The  department also needs three more jailers, two dispatchers and two clerks,  Connolly said.  </P></p>

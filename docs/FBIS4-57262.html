			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 16 May (EFE) -- The Economy Ministry  corrected an announcement made by Economy Minister Domingo  Cavallo concerning the alleged three-month postponement of the  implementation of the Common Market of the South (Mercosur).    A mistake by an official seemingly misrepresented Cavallo's  remarks in the ROK, which had caused surprise in domestic  political, diplomatic, and economic spheres.    According to official information, Cavallo had announced in  Seoul that Mercosur would go into effect on 1 April 1995, with a  three-month delay in its original schedule.    When three hours had elapsed since the information's release  and after journalists' insistence on learning the reason why the  Argentine economy minister unilaterally announced the alleged  postponement, an Economy Ministry official acknowledged that he  made a mistake "when transcribing the tape" on which Cavallo's  remarks had been recorded.    Having met with the ROK's minister of the Economic Planning  Board, Chae-sok Chong, Cavallo commented that "Mercosur will  grow at a faster pace than NAFTA."    To support his statement, Cavallo noted that the Mercosur  member countries' economies are "undergoing tremendous growth,  as evinced by the Argentine case."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by GK: "Privatization: Looking Forward to the </F> Second Stage"]    [Text] While the first stage in privatization -- when  state property was distributed to citizens for investment  coupons -- is drawing to a close, the government has drafted two  new laws on privatization. These laws project the establishment  of two new institutions -- the Privatization Agency that would  handle the privatization of remaining state assets, and the  State Property Fund that would manage the remaining state assets  or their part in private enterprises. These two institutions  must be separated because the office that manages state property  will, certainly, not be interested in speeding up privatization  and bringing nearer its own natural breakup.    At a press conference yesterday, Andrew L. Baldwin and  Robert  Stone, leaders of the European Union program for assisting  privatization in the Baltic states, assessed the process of  privatization in our country and one-year results of the PHARE  [Poland and Hungary Action for Restructuring the Economy]. In  their opinion, privatization in Lithuania is successful in  comparison with other Baltic and East European countries.  Privatization for hard currency alone could be more effective.  They implied that the government had made a mistake by refusing  to sell the "Lietuva" hotel for $10 million.    The government pledges to extend privatization for  investment  coupons which has not been completed. In reply to a question  from TIESA as to whether the law on primary privatization was  worth changing, R. Stone reminded everyone that 187 amendments  have already been made to this law. In his opinion, however,  the law must be made more rational, primarily by reducing  privileges to workers at enterprises.</p>

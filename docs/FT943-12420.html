			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Fund charge puts PaineWebber in red PaineWebber incurred a net loss of Dollars 25.1m in the second quarter of 1994 after the US securities firm was forced to take a charge to cover the injection of Dollars 34m into one of its mutual funds to repay investors for losses on mortgage-backed securities. Last week, two executives at PaineWebber involved in the management of the troubled Dollars 1bn short-term government bond fund resigned over the matter, and the firm brought in an outside money management group, Pacific Investment Management, to act as a consultant in the running of the fund. Even without the cost of the fund bail-out, the second quarter was a difficult period for the firm, with pre-charge earnings of Dollars 9.1m falling well short of the Dollars 59.3m reported for the same quarter a year ago. The sharp drop in earnings during the quarter came against the background of a 15.7 per cent decline in revenues to Dollars 579m. Revenues fell because demand for PaineWebber's broking services from retail and institutional customers and for its underwriting services from companies and municipal authorities were either flat or substantially lower compared with the same quarter of 1993. Also, the firm earned considerably less in the period (Dollars 91.7m against Dollars 181.9m a year earlier) from the trading of its own capital on US and foreign securities markets. In this respect, PaineWebber was no different than other big Wall Street firms, which all saw their revenues and profits fall in the second quarter because of the slowdown in the once-booming securities industry.</p>

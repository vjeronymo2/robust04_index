			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Arts: The Comedy of Errors - New York Theatre 'Nothing succeeds like excess?' Maybe not. The New York Shakespeare Festival's production of The Comedy of Errors prompts a qualifying of Oscar Wilde's dictum which, quoted in a programme note, was clearly its inspiration. It's excess is excessive, and rarely successful. The temptation to gussy up The Comedy of Errors with lots of onstage business, as director Caca Rosset has done here, is understandable. It is, after all, the simplest of Shakespeare's plots: the Antipholus twins, separated at birth and unaware of each other's existence, show up in the same city with their twin servants, both named Dromio, and are mistaken for each other again and again. Rosset has made his one-joke wonder of a script into a sight-gag-aholics dream: no mugging is too shameless, no shot too cheap (yes, there's even a 'Dromio, Dromio' called down from a balcony window) to end up on Rosset's stage. The problem is that much of the business is sloppily executed, and what is supposed to be wackily funny often comes off as cringingly silly. Rosset's frantic staging does pay off with a few sublimely off-centre moments. Vide Karla Burns, built like the Tasmanian Devil and possessed of a similar energy, who bursts on stage and hurls herself into a gut-wrenching gospel anthem. That we have never seen this character before nor know what she is doing are concerns that are drowned out by Burns' mighty talent (as it transpires, she is Nell the maid). And the production takes on a wonderfully self-aware tone when, at a particularly frenzied moment, Antipholus of Syracuse calls a time-out American-style, hands forming a 'T' over his head, freezing the onstage action and bringing up the house lights, so that he can express his confusion directly to the audience. The Shakespeare Festival continues to cultivate its bad reputation for casting media stars regardless of their skills in speaking verse; Marisa Tomei's (My Cousin Vinny), Adriana substitutes shouting and gestures for interpreting the text. There are a few gems among the other performances, particularly John Michael Higgins' Antipholus of Ephesus and the Dromii, Peter Jacobson and Howard Samuelsohn. Whatever this production's indulgences, Free Shakespeare in the Park continues to be one of New York's most beloved summer traditions. That Joe Papp's dream of a public theatre lives on after his death last year is a fact that gives pleasure long after the bad-joke hangover from this Comedy has faded.</p>

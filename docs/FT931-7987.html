			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Privatising British Rail FRESH momentum is likely to be injected next month into the government's rail privatisation programme when British Rail expects to issue a memorandum of sale for its Red Star express parcels service, David Owen writes. The move will come eight months after the government announced its intention to sell the business. It made the announcement just before parliament rose for the 1992 summer recess. Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, told last year's Conservative party conference in Brighton that the government anticipated concluding a deal this year. The government is free to authorise the sale of Red Star without legislation because the unit is not part of BR's core business.</p>

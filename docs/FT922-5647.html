			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / The Property Market: Signs of stability The commercial property market is showing some signs of stabilising, according to the April figures from the Investment Property Databank, an independent research group. Property yields remained static at an all-time high of 9.7 per cent and the total return for the month was positive at 0.2 per cent. This indicates that high income returns are counteracting the negative impact of capital value decline, says IPD. Rental values continued to fall in all sectors, although the rate of decline is showing some signs of slowing for the first time this year. The figures for the year to April still show an improvement in total return, which now stands at 1.8 per cent. In spite of a slight recovery in its long term performance, the office sector continues to depress all property returns with a negative impact of -13.4 per cent. The return from the retail sector of 0.5 per cent outperformed that of industrials at 0.3 per cent. The capital and rental growth measures for industrial property declined by half a point in April but total return crept back up to 0.3 per cent, following a sudden downturn in February. In the long term, industrial property maintains its position as the market leader, with a total return of 8.4 per cent for the year to April, two percentage points above the annual return for retails.</p>

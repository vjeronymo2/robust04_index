			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Patten `Teaches' Us How To Understand Basic </F> Law"]    [Text] At the beginning of the year, a number of  enthusiastic social groups and figures have organized varied  activities one after another to introduce the Basic Law and  encourage residents to show concern for and understand the Basic  Law.    The Basic Law is the supreme statute of the Hong Kong  Special  Administrative Region [SAR], the legal guarantee for  implementing the policies of "one country, two systems" and  "Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong," and a code of conduct for  the vast number of Hong Kong people after 1997. For Hong Kong  people, once they have mastered the Basic Law, they will have  the future of Hong Kong and their destiny in their own hands.    Although the statute will go into effect commencing 1 July  1997, there are questions of political, economic, social, legal,  and cultural convergence with the Basic Law in the latter  transition period of three years or so, which will ensure Hong  Kong's prosperity, stability, and a smooth transition. For this  reason, we should understand and master the Basic Law now. The  closer we are to 1997, the more such an understanding will be  important. An increasing number of people have acknowledged  this point.    A large number of people will probably have to thank Patten.  Besides understanding the Basic Law during activities to  introduce the Basic Law, they have also realized the importance  of the Basic Law through the actions of Patten, who has served  as their teacher. Some of them said: "Patten has `taught' us  how to understand the Basic Law."    Upon his arrival in Hong Kong, Patten made use of the  weaknesses of some Hong Kong people, who lack an understanding  of the Basic Law, to carry out deceptive activities.    The first example: Patten used "democracy" to cheat the  public. He disguised himself as a "defender of democracy,"  attributing differences between China and Britain to "offering  democracy to Hong Kong people." Some people believed this at  first. A review of Hong Kong's history and the articles of the  Basic Law enabled them to understand that Hong Kong people would  enjoy more democracy after 1997 than in the period under British  colonial rule.    The second example: Patten also made an issue of "freedom."  He attempted to connect the case of the mainland's handling of  Han Dongfang and others according to the law with Hong Kong's  personal freedom, freedom of entry and exit, and freedom of the  press after 1997, which had nothing to do with each other,  saying that this would make Hong Kong people "worry" about their  freedom after 1997. It was a "worry" created by Patten. The  public felt relieved after reading the Basic Law and realizing  that they would enjoy freedom in dozens of fields after 1997,  which is rare compared with other parts of the world.    What Patten has done and said has profoundly educated Hong  Kong people: If they do not understand the Basic Law, they will  be easily led by others and bring trouble on themselves.  Despite the great impact on Hong Kong, one person said, he is  confident for the future because of the Basic Law. Only by  understanding the Basic Law can we be free of anxiety and panic.    The public has noticed that Patten and his ilk have recently  changed their tactics from the offensive to the defensive in  dealing with the Basic Law. It is clear that they are against  the Basic Law. Some of them even burnt the Basic Law and  described it as "leash" not long ago. However, they have  recently changed their position and have become "defenders" of  the Basic Law, occasionally blaming the Chinese side for "not  understanding the Basic Law," "violating the Basic Law," and  "usurping the power to interpret the Basic Law."    In order to attain the goal of letting the Legislative  Council [Legco] examine and adopt his "three violations"  constitutional package and continue the position of  confrontation with China, Patten intentionally confused the  essential differences between the current Legco and the future  legislature, applying the provisions of the Basic Law that the  legislature had the power to draft, revise, and revoke laws to  deny the fact that Legco is a consultative organ and to enhance  its status. He even made unfounded countercharges, saying that  "he who holds that the Legco has no right to make legislation  does not understand the Basic Law." As a matter of fact, people  with a little understanding of the Basic Law and the Royal  Instructions can easily see through the absurdity and motives of  Patten's remarks.    A spokesman for the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office made a statement last month, pointing out that  the terms of the three-tier councils of the British Hong Kong  Government will be terminated and they will have to be disbanded  along with the end of British rule. This is quite reasonable.  However, Patten labeled the statement as "undermining the Basic  Law," saying that "the statement runs counter to Article 160 of  the Basic Law" and "usurps the power of the National People's  Congress in interpreting the Basic Law." Those best qualified  to speak on the question, the legal experts, who participated in  the drafting of the Basic Law, said: "Article 160 involves a  legal issue while the statement of the Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office refers to principled questions of state  sovereignty, the British colonialists ending their  administration of Hong Kong, and the British Hong Kong  authorities having no right to extend their political framework  beyond 1997. Patten's accusation is irrelevant to the subject,  which only proves his ignorance of the Basic Law." Actually, it  was the British Hong Kong authorities which made an erroneous  interpretation of the Basic Law. Patten once tried to explain  Article 104 of the Basic Law on the oath of office by members of  the legislature and officials of the SAR government as objective  criterion for the through train [legislators serving beyond 30  June 1997]. This serves as an example.    Patten has given people another lesson: Only by  understanding the Basic Law can we dispel the mist spread by  Patten, see through the demarcation line between right and wrong  confused by him, and recognize his true features.    We do not know what tricks he will continue to play in  distorting and confronting the Basic Law. However, we believe  that after every trick played by him, Hong Kong people will have  a better understanding of the Basic Law. Patten is indeed a  rare teacher by negative example.</p>

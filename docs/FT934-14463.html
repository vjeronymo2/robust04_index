			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Metals take turns in the spotlight TIN AND nickel shared centre-stage at the London Metal Exchange yesterday, at the end of a week that saw the exchange's base metals contracts taking turns in the spotlight. Three month delivery tin began with a Dollars 120-a-tonne retracement following last week's rally but that had been fully recovered before the market moved ahead strongly yesterday. Dealers attributed the Dollars 70 rise to Dollars 4,812.50 a tonne to news that an output cut was being considered at Pitinga, Brazil's biggest tin mine, suggestions that the Association of Tin Producing Countries might keep its export control system going for another year and a report that the US was considering a Bolivian request for a halt to stockpile sales by its Defence Logistics Agency. 'It's a bit optimistic to hope for all this to happen, but you never know,' one trader told the Reuter news agency. The nickel market also started with the surrender of some of last week's gains, the three months position slipping more than Dollars 200 to Dollars 4,350 a tonne at one stage. As with tin, however, a subsequent recovery set the stage for a sharp advance yesterday. Encouraged by a slackening in the pace of arrivals from the former Soviet Union and a moderate fall in LME warehouse stocks, three months nickel closed at Dollars 4,775 a tonne, up Dollars 212.50 on the week and Dollars 745 above the 6 3/4 -year low reached a fortnight ago. The earlier fall had reflected growing doubts that other producers would follow up on the production cutting plans announced by Inco, the biggest nickel producer, at the end of last week. The Canadian company this week gave more details of the means by which it intended to reduce its output by 16 per cent next year. These included closure of the Ontario division for eight weeks from December and shutting the Manitoba operation for four weeks from December 17, after which operations would resume on a four-day work week. The moves follow a heavy fall in nickel prices from over Dollars 6,000 a tonne a year ago, which resulted in Inco losing USDollars 2.2m in the second quarter of this year. Early scenes in this week's LME action were stolen by sister metals lead and zinc. After edging higher on Monday as operators covered short positions, the three months lead price exploded into prominence on Tuesday with a gain of Dollars 24.75, or 6.3 per cent, to Dollars 413.50 a tonne. Dealers attributed the rise to a revival in consumer interest, trade buying and covering against earlier short sales. The price peaked next day at Dollars 418 after it was confirmed that the 72,000-tonnes-a-year Belledune smelter of Canada's Brunswick Mining and Smelting, a Noranda subsidiary, was to be closed for six weeks because of a shortage of concentrate feed. The gain was trimmed back, however, and the price ended with a net rise on the week of Dollars 20.25 at Dollars 405.25 a tonne. But that was still more than Dollars 35 up from last week's seven-year low. Zinc's big scene came on Wednesday, when rumours that announcements of European production cuts were imminent helped to push the three months quotation up by Dollars 38.75 to Dollars 968.50 a tonne. Dealers said the rise was also fuelled by investment fund covering against what were believed to be large short positions. With the production cut rumours remaining unconfirmed, however, the three months price subsided to Dollars 957.50 at yesterday's close, up Dollars 53 on the week. The aluminium market traded comparatively quietly until producer support buying and trade short-covering got prices rising in earnest on Thursday. The upturn was fed yesterday by reports of reduced smelter output in the ex-Soviet republic of Tajikistan, the near-trebling of energy costs at the Bratsk smelter in Siberia after Russian tariffs were raised to western levels from the beginning of this month, and plans for US officials to join talks in Moscow on the problem of huge Russian exports disrupting the market. By the LME close the three months price had risen another Dollars 14.50 to Dollars 1,142.75 a tonne, up Dollars 27 on the week. At the London bullion market the gold price re-established itself above Dollars 360 a troy ounce as investors formed a consensus that the recent downward 'correction' was over. The market remained nervous, however, and the price eased from Thursday's peak of Dollars 368.25 to close yesterday at Dollars 364.75 an ounce, up Dollars 7.50 on the week. The platinum price followed the same pattern, but its late fall was much sharper than gold's, with the result that its premium over the yellow metal shrank by another Dollars 2.50 to Dollars 2 an ounce - three week's ago it stood at Dollars 8.25. The London Commodity Exchange's cocoa and cocoa markets both staged tentative rallies but finished well off the highs. Dealers could offer no explanation for the upturn in the cocoa market, which took the March futures position to Pounds 962 a tonne at one point and left it at Pounds 944, up Pounds 31 on the week. 'There is very little volume in the market and that is the key for the moment,' one trader told Reuter yesterday. The coffee market seemed unimpressed by news that Brazil was shortly to begin its purchases under the producer retention scheme and the January contract ended at Dollars 1,192 a tonne, up Dollars 14 on the week, after reaching Dollars 1,208.  ----------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ----------------------------------------------------- Aluminium      +17,625    to    2,238,050 Copper          +5,350    to      601,250 Lead            +2,975    to      290,225 Nickel            -132    to      118,440 Zinc            -4,325    to      813,125 Tin               +160    to       20,665  -----------------------------------------------------</p>

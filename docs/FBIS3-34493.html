A statement issued at the conclusion of the  meetings held by the UINC and the Presidential Council in the  town of Salah-al-Din in northern Iraq criticized the  Syrian-Turkish-Iranian ministerial meeting held in Istanbul last  Saturday [5 February].    The Iraqi opposition's joint meetings were held 1-6 February  and were boycotted by the opposition's pan-Arab faction based in  Damascus. Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar', Turkish  Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, and Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali  Akbar Velayati had pledged to "confront any attempt to fragment  Iraq."    In a telephone statement from Salah-al-Din, Sami  'Abd-al-Rahman, member of the UINC Executive Council, said that  "the tone of the ministerial statement in reference to the  fragmentation of Iraq was the strongest" issued by al-Shar',  Cetin, and Velayati, "and it very much surprised the UINC in its  emphasis on this issue, for neither the Kurdistan Front nor the  UINC is calling for the division or partition of Iraq." He  added: "We do not know if these fears are a result of  dissatisfaction with the democratic experiment in Iraqi  Kurdistan." But he also said that "the ministerial statement  contained some positive points such as the call for an end to  the internal (Iraqi) blockade against Iraqi Kurdistan and the  south and for the restoration of the power supply to Dahuk,  asserting that it should be left to the Iraqi people to  determine their own future freely."    He drew attention to the Iraqi opposition's statement that  "the regime of (President) Saddam Husayn and its continuation  are the real threat to the country's unity. We Iraqis care most  about the unity of our people and homeland." In his view, there  was no connection between the Turkish raids on positions in  northern Iraq the day before yesterday and the results of the  Istanbul meeting. He stressed that "these raids will never  settle anything" as regards tackling the issue of the Kurdish  Workers Party which is waging a war against the Turkish state.    Sami 'Abd-al-Rahman emphasized that the opposition "is not  contemplating setting up an army to fight the Iraqi Army." He  said that the Salah-al-Din statement "renewed its appeal to the  military and to the members of the ruling Ba'th Party to join  the ranks of the people to escalate the struggle to overthrow  the regime." He added that over 300 figures took part in the  joint meetings, which were also attended by tripartite  Presidential Council Members Muhammad Bahr-al-'Ulum, Mas'ud  Barzani, and Major General Hasan al-Naqib and which "passed  resolutions dealing with all organizational and financial  problems." He said that the conferees also concentrated on ways  of handling the issue of the Kurdistan Islamic Movement [KIM]  after the clashes which broke out between its fighters and  fighters of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK], led by Jalal  Talabani. "The UINC's view is that the solutions should be  based on the principle of reconciliation and that the KIM should  be treated like any other party in accordance with the Kurdish  parliament's laws including the law prohibiting possession of  arms."    The opposition also renewed its call for "the expansion of  the air exclusion zone to include all Iraq and for the creation  of safe havens in the south." The statement of the UINC  Presidential Council and Executive Council "called for the  deployment of UN guards throughout all Iraq" and for the  dispatch of UN observers to "watch out for violations of human  rights, lift the internal blocade imposed on liberated Kurdistan  and southern areas, and exclude Kurdistan from the international  embargo to ease the people's suffering." It praised the  "steadfastness of our people in the south, the center, and the  rest of the country," and it "saluted the third anniversary of  the popular uprising" in southern Iraq which followed the Gulf  war. The conferees also discussed development of ties between  the UINC and the neighboring states and the Arab and Islamic  states.</p>

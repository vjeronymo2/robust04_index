Russian Defense  Ministry Expert Cautious in Forecasts"]    [Text] "A practical realization of the trilateral  understanding on the nuclear disarmament of Ukraine, reached by  the Presidents of the United States, Ukraine, and Russia in the  Kremlin on 14 January, has begun," advised a high official in  the Russian Federation Defense Ministry with the caution  acquired through many months of negotiating. Without naming,  for known reasons, the day the "operation" should begin, and  very roughly (several months) defining the length of time for  withdrawing nuclear warheads from Ukraine, the Defense Ministry  general noted that the leaders of the three states had also  specified the "equivalency" of exchange -- the minimal number  (200) of warheads for 100 tonnes of uranium fuel for Ukraine's  nuclear power engineering. The "transportation expenses" shall  be absorbed in equal portion by both sides -- the transportation  of the special cargo across the territory of Ukraine shall be  paid for by Kiev, the next part of the journey by Moscow. No  customs inspection has been envisioned (under the agreement  between Ukraine and Russia on the withdrawal of strategic  weapons of April 1992, the general said, transportation in a  special category with a special cargo is not subject to customs  inspection). The protection and security arrangements while the  "cargo" is in transit, the specialist vouched, are guaranteed by  a tough system of security that includes constant monitoring of  progress, provision of all types of communications facilities,  and a "cover" by competent organs along the train's route.    A participant in the Russo-Ukrainian talks, the Russian  Defense Ministry expert is rather cautious about prognoses  regarding the future of the nuclear disarmament process of the  Ukrainian state which, he remarked, has not so far added its  signature to the document on nonproliferation of nuclear weapons  -- which in itself does not rule out debates inside Ukraine, in  particular in its new parliament, on the question of Ukraine's  possessing its own nuclear potential. The "neatness" with which  the first stage of partial nuclear disarmament of the neighbors  has gotten under way, the expert underlined, evokes the  satisfaction of the Russian side.</p>

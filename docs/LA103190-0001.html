			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A.  </P> <P> A group called People for the American Way honored actress Kathleen Turner and  singer Don Henley in Beverly Hills the other night for their efforts in  preserving free expression and civil liberties.  </P> <P> Well, most free expression.  </P> <P> No still photographers or camera crews were permitted to record the event.  </P> <P> John Bonds may be the only motorist in the city who doesn't try to avoid  traffic jams. In fact, he seeks them out.  </P> <P> Bonds, 26, is the last of the city's paid, car-borne traffic reporters. (We're  not counting embarrassed helicopter reporters who are occasionally forced to  call in bulletins from their cars when they're late for work because of a  SigAlert.)  </P> <P> Bonds, who works for Metro Traffic in a Chevy Beretta, says his job "isn't as  bad as it sounds. At least, I'm doing radio reports while I'm stuck. And, this  is my way of breaking into the broadcasting business."  </P> <P> Also, he has an advantage during SigAlerts. The "Press" placard in his window  enables him to break out of traffic jams via freeway shoulders and medians.  </P> <P> It was back in '87 that Santa Monica first began attracting the homeless,  author Fred Basten points out. The "oceanfront attracted a group of squatters  who erected makeshift shanties on the sand," he wrote. That's from Basten's  book, "Santa Monica Bay: The First 100 Years."  </P> <P> He was referring to Eighteen Eighty-Seven.  </P> <P> Trick or Trash:  </P> <P> Employees of Laufer &amp; Associates will don costumes and go door to door in  the 18-floor Unisys Building in Westwood this afternoon, seeking recyclable  items.  </P> <P> "We're asking the tenants to separate aluminum, glass and paper and we'll put  them in bins, and take them to a recycling center," said spokesman Kent Cooper.  </P> <P> As a precaution, tenants in the building have been warned not to come to work  dressed as the Tin Man.  </P> <P> Ken Thim Sr. of Downey wonders if the glitch in several signs around Bell  Gardens City Hall renders them "unofficial" or, should we say, "unoffical."  </P> <P> Of course, no one's perfect. Dorothy Ross of West Hollywood wrote to say that a  recent Times story probably was referring to a small room when it mentioned  that the kitchen of a Beverly Hills home "has a butler's panty." At least, she  hopes so.  </P> <P> </P> <P> miscelLAny:  </P> <P> The nation's leading producer of parking lot tire-spikes -- the things  accompanied by signs warning of "Severe Tire Damage" -- is Delta Scientific of  Burbank.  </P></p>

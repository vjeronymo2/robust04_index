			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / World Trade News: Brussels to consult business on single market European businesses will be asked at a conference in Copenhagen at the end of May to present the European Commission with examples of how technical obstacles to trade continue to prevent the proper functioning of Europe's internal market. The conference is being held jointly by the European Commission, Denmark's industry ministry and the Federation of Danish Industries. The final date of the conference has yet to be fixed. The decision to hold the conference follows a report to the Commission in February by the Federation of Danish Industries, complaining that Brussels was not doing enough to ensure the functioning of the internal market. It also documented the continued existence of numerous technical barriers to the free movement of goods. 'The commissioners are still living with the illusion that the internal market is functioning satisfactorily, but they won't be able to any longer once they have attended this conference,' said Mr Soren Krohn, the Federation of Industries specialist on European policy.</p>

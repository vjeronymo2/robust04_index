			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ewa Kaszuba and Kazimierz Groblewski: "Who Will </F> Back Walesa, What Chances Does He Have? He Would Lose Today,  but..."]    [Text] If the elections were held today, Lech Walesa would  not win them. On this point, the politicians of the government  coalitions and the opposition fully agree. However, the  elections will be held in over a year, and a lot may happen,  they say.    According to them, whether or not Walesa will have greater  chances at that time than he does today depends on how he  fulfills his official duties during this last period.    Our interlocutors, both the members of the coalition and of  the opposition, predict that the presidential elections will not  yield final results in the first round, and another round will  be indispensable. In line with the Constitution, the second  round will be held if in the first round none of the candidates  obtains more than half of all of the votes cast. It would be a  competition between two persons with the largest numbers of  votes.    Today it is still not known how many candidates will  represent the "Solidarity side." Henryk Wujec of the Freedom  Union [UW] told us that his party will certainly field its own  candidate and will certainly not back Walesa in the first round.  Thus, it looks like, apart from Walesa, at least one more  Solidarity candidate will run in the first round. If the right  wing neither backs Walesa nor agrees on a joint candidate with  UW, there will be several candidates.    Politicians predict that in this situation Walesa may have  great difficulties passing to the second round. If he does  manage to do so, his chances in the second round will increase.  In that round, he will probably meet with a candidate of the  Polish Peasant Party [PSL] or the Democratic Left Alliance  [SLD]. In such a case, he may receive the support of  postsolidarity groupings.    Therefore, it looks like Walesa's chances to reach the  second  round will be largely decided by the first round. Today, only  the Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms [BBWR] declares that it  will support him. It is important how Solidarity behaves; the  way it acts will be followed by some of the rightist groupings.  The rating of Walesa in the union is rather low today. There  are rumors that the union may field its own candidate (the name  of Marian Krzaklewski is mentioned, even though he announced  several months ago that he would not run). It seems highly  unlikely that Walesa will be backed by one of the rightist  coalitions: Alliance for Poland [Przymierze dla Polski]  (Christian-National Union--ZChN, Center Accord--PC, Conservative  Coalition, Peasant Accord--PL, and Movement for the  Republic--RdR), or the alliance of the Union for Real  Politics--UPR, Christian-Peasant Party--SLCh, Party of Christian  Democrats--PChD, National Party--SN, and Conservative Party--PK.  It seems relatively most probable that Walesa might be backed  by the RdR and the PL from one coalition and by athe SLCh from  the other.    However, both within Solidarity and in the rightist parties,  there may be attempts at internal "pro-Walesa" coup d'etats  before the presidential elections. It is most likely that a  pro-Walesa policy will be adopted by the ZChN, and least likely  that such a policy will be pursued by the PC.    "It is not for the first time that President Walesa is  showing that he is a courageous man who is not afraid of taking  risks," believes Tomasz Nalecz of the Labor Union. However,  because he has antagonized many milieus (not keeping promises,  acting disloyally to aides, shifting of responsibility to  others, refusing to take on responsibility), it is difficult to  predict who might form an alliance with him. He believes that  Walesa might be seriously threatened only by a politician who  would guarantee to fulfill the fundamental role that should  today be fulfilled by the Polish president--the role of an  arbiter.    "Unfortunately, Lech Walesa resembles...  <H5>  A Child in a Sand Pit </H5>   ...who merely keeps throwing sand at his mates' eyes,  causing  conflicts and tensions. We need a peacemaking person, someone  who would ease tensions. If a grouping or a nonparty group  manages to find a generally respected person with an impeccable  past, a person who would defend his stance, it will place Lech  Walesa in a dead position," Nalecz says.    Two politicians of the governing coalition, the SLD's  Zbigniew Siemiatkowski and the PSL's Jan Bury, both agree that,  if the presidential elections were held in a few days, Walesa  would have slim chances of even getting to the second round.  According to Bury, these chances will increase in a year's  time; according to Siemiatkowski, "a lot may happen."    "The president will at any price want to...  <H5>  Stand at the Lead of the Disgruntled </H5>   Therefore, what should be expected are bows in the direction  of Solidarity, which is emerging as the main oppositional force  and the advocate of the way of thinking favoring demands. The  president will probably make himself heard again when the  enterprise tax on above-normative pays (popiwek) and the next  budget are discussed; he will try to present himself as the  defender of the prosocial policy. Another element of the  campaign, which is becoming increasingly clear today, are the  slogans of calling certain people to account, combating crime,  and corruption. Walesa will want to persuade the people that he  is the only one who has clean hands, claims Siemiatkowski. He  does not exclude the possibility of dramatic personnel changes  in the entourage of the president.    The president's decision did not come as a surprise to Jan  Bury. After the parliamentary elections, it became clear that  Walesa was the only person...  <H5>  Able To Attract </H5>   ...to himself the scattered postsolidarity groupings,  despite  all of the differences. Because, as he predicts, the first  round of the elections will not be final and in the second round  Walesa will compete most probably with a candidate of the left,  the forces of the Solidarity origin will not have much choice  and will back him. The church will not have much choice,  either. Because the president is known for his ability to  surprise everyone, Bury expects that, during the campaign, he  will submit so many new proposals that one of them will  certainly be catchy enough. He will be able to criticize any of  his countercandidates for not keeping promises.    Such criticism is also expected by Siemiatkowski, who claims  that we will have a black presidential campaign. This is why  serious candidates are not hurrying to make their intentions  known.    "Even the best candidate will not endure a full year and a  half of slander. He will wear out." He believes that the real  candidates will be known only next spring.    "The Confederation for an Independent Poland [KPN] will  almost certainly field its own candidate. Most probably, it  will be me," says KPN head Leszek Moczulski. He adds, however,  that an official decision has not yet been made. Moczulski  allows for the hypothetical possibility that the KPN would not  field its own candidate but would back Walesa--in a situation  when there would be fears that the second round might turn out  to be victorious for the candidate of the left.    "If the elections were held today, Pawlak would have the  greatest chance," Moczulski believes. If he met with Walesa in  the second round, he would win. However, today Walesa might  have trouble...  <H5>  Reaching the Second Round </H5>   However, we have so much time before the elections that  discussing them is like talking about the hair color of a child  that is to be born in a year and a half.    "I personally think it is rather unlikely, if not  impossible,  that our coalition and my grouping will support Walesa," says  Stanislaw Michalkiewicz of UPR, a party that makes up the  alliance along with the SLCh, the PChD, the PK, and the SN. The  issue has not been discussed yet. "I evaluate Lech Walesa's  presidency as a presidency of unused chances. For us to support  him, something would have to happen that I cannot even imagine  right now."    Michalkiewicz believes that most of the people who supported  Lech Walesa in 1990 are his firm opponents today.  <H5>  "I Cannot Really See... </H5>   ...anyone who would vote for him." According to him, if  Walesa gained any new supporters during his presidency, there  were not many of them, a fact that was proved by the electoral  result of the BBWR (in the last parliamentary elections, the  BBWR was backed by approximately 700,000 people--editor's note).    "Walesa's chances are slim; however, they exist. All of this  depends to a great extent on the further course of his  presidency," says UW's Henryk Wujec. "I do not think that the  new president will be known in the first round; the second round  will be decisive. It depends on who will reach it. He has  enhanced his chances by submitting his candidacy already. His  potential supporters may be already grouping around him. He  would not win the elections today, but, in a year's time...  <H5>  Things May Look Different </H5>   Walesa has a permanent group of supporters, which, I  believe,  is approximately 20-25 percent of the voters. It is a fairly  large group, but it is certainly too small to ensure him a  positive result. Today it does not look like any of the serious  postsolidarity groupings would be willing to back him. UW will  certainly not support him because it will field its own  candidate. I still do not know who it will be. I also think  that, if both our candidate and Walesa reach the second round,  many UW supporters will not back him because they are  disappointed with his presidency."    On 4 June, before his departure to Normandy, Lech Walesa was  asked to comment on the public opinion research, showing that  his popularity in on the wane. The president said that he is  convinced that he will win next year's presidential elections.  He believes that there is a chance to form a new "team."  "There is only one condition--obey Walesa," he stated.</p>

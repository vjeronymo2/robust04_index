			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Record Treasury receipts offset debt RECORD government receipts last month enabled Britain to repay Pounds 3.7bn of debt, against the trend of a steady deterioration in government finances largely because of the recession. The Treasury said yesterday that in the first 10 months of the 12 months to April this year Britain borrowed Pounds 6.6bn to finance public spending, compared with a repayment of Pounds 3bn in the equivalent period last year. The borrowing figure for the this fiscal year would have been higher but for receipts last month of Pounds 23.3bn - up from Pounds 15.3bn in December and Pounds 22.7bn in January last year. Over the past year, government tax receipts have been kept down by weak economic activity, while higher spending on unemployment pay and other social benefits has pushed up spending. At the same time, the government has become more relaxed about increasing public spending. It is considering tax cuts in next month's Budget which could further weaken the fiscal position. In the first 10 months of 1991-92, government receipts were Pounds 170.1bn, an increase of 3 per cent on the Pounds 165.5bn in the same period last year. Government cash outlays for the 10 months reached Pounds 176.2bn, up 9.5 per cent on last time's Pounds 160.7bn. Last month's receipts were helped by large payments by companies of corporation tax on previously reported profits, which are normal for this time of year. Corporation tax revenues for the month came to Pounds 5.6bn, down slightly on the Pounds 6bn in January last year. Income tax and Customs and Excise receipts pulled in Pounds 7.6bn and Pounds 4.5bn respectively, compared with Pounds 7.7bn and Pounds 3.7bn last time. Even with the record receipts, last month's net debt repayment - which was in line with City expectations - was smaller than the comparable figure of Pounds 5.1bn in January 1991. That was because government cash outlays last month totalled Pounds 19.5bn, well above the Pounds 17.4bn last time. For the whole of 1991-92, a public-sector borrowing requirement of about Pounds 12bn is expected, after the small net repayment in this fiscal year of Pounds 465m. Next year, many economists expect the PSBR to be about Pounds 24bn. Excluding privatisation proceeds, the PSBR in the first 10 months of 1991-92 was Pounds 13.7bn, against Pounds 0.6bn last time.

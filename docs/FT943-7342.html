			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Mexico's PRI to gain strong grip on Congress Mexico's ruling party is set to win large majorities in both houses of Congress after Sunday's elections, giving the incoming administration of Mr Ernesto Zedillo control over the legislature at least until the next congressional elections in 1997. The Institutional Revolutionary party had by yesterday afternoon won about 49 per cent of the presidential and legislative vote, with 75 per cent of polling booths counted. With votes still to be counted in many of the PRI's rural strongholds, its final vote is expected to climb towards or above 50 per cent. The PRI was ahead in over 270 of the 300 directly elected seats in the lower chamber, the House of Deputies. Under Mexico's electoral system, the PRI will be awarded enough indirectly elected seats to raise its representation to 300 of the total 500 seats in the lower house. The centre-right National Action party will be the second largest party in Congress. However, the PRI's 60 per cent majority in the lower house will not be sufficient to change the constitution without support from at least one of the main opposition parties. In the Senate the PRI was ahead of the opposition in 31 of the 32 states, including Mexico City, and behind the PAN in the state of Jalisco, with half the votes counted. The PAN was placed second in 22 states, and the leftist opposition Party of Democratic Revolution in nine. On these figures, the PRI would have 94 of the 128 Senate seats, the PAN 25, and the PRD 9. In Chiapas, the only state which held an election for governor, the PRI was set for victory. Financial markets continued to react positively to the PRI's victory, which unlike the 1988 presidential elections, has not been marred by reports of large-scale irregularities. By the close the market had edged down 0.1 per cent, giving up early morning gains. On Monday the financial markets a had reacted positively to the PRI's big victory. Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, presidential candidate of the PRD, has denounced the ruling party victory as illegitimate, but has yet to corroborate his claims of deliberate and widespread fraud. Mr Cardenas has called for a protest meeting in Mexico City's central square for this Saturday. On Monday he was joined by an estimated 15,000-20,000 supporters at a meeting denouncing the election, far fewer than he had hoped for. Editorial comment, Page 13</p>

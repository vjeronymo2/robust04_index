			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: IN BRIEF: ** 1/2 PATTY LOVELESS, "ON DOWN THE LINE," MCA. ALBUMS  ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> This is one woman's view of trying to get by in an all-too-loveless world, and  in the choice selection of material from a variety of writers, this Kentucky  wonder exudes a steely resolve that never gives in to self-pity. Instead, she  relies on a great sense of humor and an unflagging faith that things will get  better, even when disappointment strikes. As a singer, she may not plumb the  depths of the human soul as Emmylou Harris can, but she compensates with miles  and miles of heart. RANDY LEWIS  </P></p>

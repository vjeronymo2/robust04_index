			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: GFSA gold mines ahead 14.3% as production rises Gold Fields of South Africa reported that its gold mines increased after-tax profit by 14.3 per cent to R448m (Dollars 126.50m) for the September quarter, up from R392m the previous quarter. The increase was largely the result of improved overall production. In spite of a drop in the grade of ore milled, to 9.2 grammes/tonne from 9.3 grammes/tonne in the June quarter, gold production rose to 30,612kg from 29,721kg. This was due to a substantial rise in ore milled to 3.33m tonnes from 3.2m tonnes. Overall gold revenue rose to R1.37bn from R1.29bn while working profit advanced to R589m from R543m. However, working costs increased to R786m from R751m, mainly because of wage increases starting from the beginning of the quarter. Of the group's bigger individual mines, Driefontein boosted after-tax profits to R241.6m from R194.5m while Kloof increased after-tax earnings to R193.8m from R190m. Doornfontein, a marginal mine, reduced costs and raised revenue, reducing its pre-tax loss to R1.9m from the previous quarter's deficit of R8.8m. However, in spite of increased production, Deelkraal saw a drop in after-tax profit to R14.5m from R15.7m as it resumed paying tax following last quarter's R8m rebate.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Joy Gruta] </F>   [Excerpts] The Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabayan  [Revolutionary Nationalist Alliance -- RAM] is far from being a  weak and spent force as government alleges, said RAM leader  Gregorio Honasan, who added the RAM still possesses "significant  firepower," including light anti-tank weapons and other  high-powered firearms.    Honasan said the government does not know the real strength  and manpower of the movement. "No matter how the information  machinery and the AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines] tries to  dig on us, they still don't know who we are, how many we are,  and where we are." [passage omitted] Honasan said the RAM will  surrender its firearms only when the ongoing peace talks end in  a "comprehensive political settlement." He said RAM leaders have  given the peace talks another year before declaring them a  failure.</p>

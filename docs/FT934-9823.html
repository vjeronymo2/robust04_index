			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Arts: Whitbread finalists announced This is the book prize season. Tonight the winner of the Esquire-Volvo-Waterstone Non Fiction Award will receive Pounds 5,000. Next Tuesday the Sunday Express Book of the Year will make one writer Pounds 20,000 richer. Yesterday the finalists were annnounced for the Whitbread. Each of the five nominated authors received Pounds 2,000. On January 25 1994, one of them will get another Pounds 21,000 as winner of the Whitbread Book of the Year. The Whitbread covers the literary field, with a candidate for each section. They were: for biography, Andrew Motion for Philip Larkin, A Writer's Life; for a children's novel, Flour Babies by Anne Fine; for a first novel, Saving Agnes by Rachel Rusk; for a novel, Theory of War by Joan Brady; and for poetry, Carol Ann Duffy for her collection, Mean Time. The judges obviously have no prejudice against women. A feature of the Whitbread is that its chosen novel hardly ever appears on the Booker list. Theory of War tells of a white boy sold into what amounts to slavery in post-Civil War America. Brady is a former dancer with New York City Ballet who has lived in Devon for over 20 years.</p>

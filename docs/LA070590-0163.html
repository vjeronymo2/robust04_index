			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> SINGLES: SIERRA CLUB;  </P> <P> CROSSING PATHS;  </P> <P> A SUNDAY HIKING GROUP INTRODUCES PEOPLE TO THE WONDERS OF NATURE AND TO EACH  OTHER.  </P> <P> With a last dab of sunscreen and a swallow of water, they headed out. The path  was wide enough to allow walking in twos or threes, and conversation blended  with the sounds of the great outdoors.  </P> <P> It was the Sierra Singles Sunday afternoon hike. This particular one wound  nearly eight miles through Hobo Jungle and Emma Wood State Beach at the west  end of Ventura County -- an excellent choice for a warm June day.  </P> <P> "This is my favorite hike, especially when the tide is low and we can come back  on the beach," said Jan Lewison of Ventura, the hike leader. She's been hiking  every week for about 15 years and now leads outings once a month.  </P> <P> "I like the outdoors and that was the main thing when I joined the Sierra  Club," she said. "Now I'm interested in the environment too. I understand how  precious it is and how we need to protect it."  </P> <P> Maria Papalexis, also of Ventura, demonstrated her environmental concern by  picking up cans and litter as she walked along. She also enjoys these hikes for  the people she's met during her 12 years with the group.  </P> <P> For Carole Virden of Oxnard, this was her first Sierra Singles outing, although  she'd hiked locally once before with the Conejo group in the eastern part of  the county. "I like roughing it," she said. "I get tired of the city and like  to get into the country away from the traffic and congestion."  </P> <P> Virden was pleased to spot a squirrel close by the path. The group also  glimpsed a family of coots swimming on the Ventura River and stopped, too, to  observe native flora -- ice plant, wild roses, poison oak and hemlock.  </P> <P> Pausing under the shade of spreading Monterey cypress trees, Lewison explained  to the 13 hikers how Hobo Jungle got its name. "During the '30s and '40s, the  train used to stop in Ventura. So it was easy for the hobos to jump off there  and come back in here.  </P> <P> "There were plenty more trees then; you can see all the remnants of them. It  was a wonderful place to stay. Then they'd just go back a few blocks and catch  the train again," she said.  </P> <P> Later, on the beach, the group listened to Steve Noll of Ventura share a bit  more county history. "These are gun turrets from World War II. The Japanese did  attack the mainland U.S. in World War II, just north of here in an oil field.  </P> <P> "A submarine made it here and shelled the coast. It didn't do any damage but  you can bet it really scared some people and they put these two gun turrets  here and two more elsewhere," he said, noting how the cannon could rotate 360  degrees on a track and fire a 95-pound projectile 14 miles, either toward the  sea or inland. Now only the turrets remain.  </P> <P> Not only the history of the area, but the geography, too, attracts some hikers.  Les Kopel of Simi Valley was a geography major in college and enjoys tramping  through various terrains. He also comes to meet people.  </P> <P> "I've dated quite a few women I met through the Sierra Club," he said. "I spent  a couple of years with one lady." He likes the singles club because everyone  starts out with a common interest in the outdoors and that makes it easy to  "kibitz and jabber."  </P> <P> That's exactly what John Olson of Camarillo had in mind when he initiated  Sierra Singles 15 years ago. He'd been hiking in Santa Barbara with a similar  group but hated driving there. So he started a local club affiliated with the  Sespe group of the Sierra Club.  </P> <P> Activities are "our reason for being," Olson said of Sierra Singles. He noted  that an outing usually attracts between 15 and 20 hikers from their mid-20s up  to their 70s; most are single, but not all.  </P> <P> Dale Condra and Carolyn Briggs of Ventura met on a Sierra Singles hike in 1986,  when Condra was a hike leader and Briggs had just moved to the county from  Wisconsin.  </P> <P> "I didn't know a soul," she said. She chose to get involved with the Sierra  Club because it "would get me outdoors and I'd get a little exercise; I'd get a  chance to get acquainted with the geography of the area because I knew nothing  of Ventura County and meet some people because I didn't know anyone. It seemed  to fit the bill on several strokes," she said.  </P> <P> On her first hike, she met "a tall, blond, beautiful man," whom she dated a  short while. On her second, she met Dale, whom she married in 1988. They are  expecting a baby this month.  </P> <P> Thinking back on that first hike, she said: "I was impressed with Sierra  Singles. It wasn't a meat-market scene. No guys coming on to you. People were  friendly." She also enjoys seeing people she's met on hikes at concerts and  other social events. "We have this connection," she said.  </P> <P> Lately Briggs and Condra been doing less hiking. "I just don't move around as  much," Briggs said, referring to her pregnancy. But they plan to get back into  it soon. "The baby will go hiking. We have a sling and a backpack," she said.  </P> <P> Will they continue Sierra Singles hikes? "Well," said Condra, "the baby is  single."  </P> <P> * WHERE AND WHEN: The Los Padres chapter of the Sierra Club has two groups  within Ventura County: the Conejo (for information, 498-0958) and the Sespe  (484-7721).

The early recall -- at  his request -- of General Francis Briquemont, head of the "Blue  Helmets" in Bosnia-Herzegovina, is one of the clearest signs of  a state of mind which is rapidly spreading: Discouragement at  the glaring failure of any international initiative. Shortly  before the announcement of the Belgian general's departure, Jean  Cot, his immediate superior, had given in to a display of revolt  against the "humiliations" his men constantly have to endure.    The UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR], the "armed wing" of an  international community that has never been dazzling in its  coherence in the two years and six months the war in the former  Yugoslavia has lasted, has been tossed about by the  contradictory stances and false threats for which it suffers the  terrible consequences on the ground. People like General Cot or  General Briquemont can, with some legitimacy, wonder what they  are doing in the Yugoslav mess when they are deprived of the  means of ensuring respect for any Security Council resolution  and when all their requests for reinforcements are rejected.    The disquiet felt among the "Blue Helmets" can only  increase,  given the many admissions of failure by diplomats and the  statements referring more and more specifically to a forthcoming  withdrawal of the UNPROFOR if no progress is made in the  negotiations over the next two months -- as European mediator  David Owen has just stressed. And although the French political  officials have demonstrated splendid ambiguity on this subject,  the Canadians have been very clear in announcing that they  "would reexamine" their presence in Bosnia in April.    It is difficult to see how the western countries will  succeed  in extricating themselves from the deadlock in which they have  been caught. The alternative now facing them has no encouraging  aspect when every prospect of peace is receding: Either they  withdraw the "Blue Helmets" and henceforth take no interest in  the conflict and its victims, or they decide to provide  themselves with the means of a real intervention and run the  risk of a daunting ensnarement.    In both cases, moreover, Europe is likely to pay very dearly  for the political impotence it has shown since June 1991: by  extending the conflict in a region that has always been  explosive.</p>

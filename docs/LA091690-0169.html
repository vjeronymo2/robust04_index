			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHERE THEY ARE NOW  </P> <P> CHARLES H. KEATING, Jr.  </P> <P> S&amp;L owner  </P> <P> Recently rebuffed in his attempt to regain control of Lincoln Savings, Keating  quit last month as chief executive of American Continental, Lincoln's former  owner. The resignation came after a federal judge accused Keating of looting  the now-insolvent thrift. The 66-year-old financier, who lives in Phoenix, says  he's broke.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DON RAY DIXON  </P> <P> S&amp;L owner  </P> <P> Perhaps the highest of the high-fliers, Dixon, 50, was a real estate developer  who bought control of tiny Vernon Savings in north Texas in 1982 and used it to  finance a regal lifestyle. He pleaded not guilty to misusing thrift funds for  campaign contributions and prostitutes. Was last believed to be operating out  of a small office on Coast Highway in Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> </P> <P> RICHARD T. PRATT  </P> <P> Regulator  </P> <P> As Federal Home Loan Bank Board chairman from 1981 to 1983, he urged  deregulation and opened the way for questionable accounting methods that  disguised thrifts' true condition. Now says he regrets what he did on the  accounting front. Pratt, 53, is chairman of a mortgage capital subsidiary for  Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.  </P> <P> </P> <P> EDWIN J. GRAY  </P> <P> Regulator  </P> <P> Chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board from 1983 to 1987, Gray sounded  the alarm about the thrift crisis, but few listened. Viewed as a hero by some,  a bumbler by others. Gray, 55, is now president of a savings and loan in Miami.  </P> <P> </P> <P> M. DANNY WALL  </P> <P> Regulator  </P> <P> The last chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, Wall quit in March under  mounting criticism from Congress for his handling of the thrift crisis. Accused  of badly underestimating the scope of the S&amp;L crisis, Wall, 51, now works  out of his Virginia home as a consultant and speech-maker.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DONALD T. REGAN  </P> <P> Government official  </P> <P> Former treasury secretary and chief of staff under President Reagan, he was a  strong free-market advocate who cared little for the thrift industry. His  philosophy of deregulation for the S&amp;Ls prevailed. Regan, 71, has homes in  Virginia and Florida, and spends his time writing, lecturing and managing his  investments.  </P> <P> </P> <P> JIM WRIGHT  </P> <P> Politician  </P> <P> After 34 years in Congress, Wright resigned as House Speaker last year after  being accused of repeated ethics violations. Wright interceded with federal  regulators in an effort to delay a government seizure of Vernon Savings. A  resident of Ft. Worth, Wright, 67, is writing a book on Central America.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TONY COELHO  </P> <P> Politician  </P> <P> The former House majority whip abruptly resigned from Congress in 1989 after  failing to disclose a $50,000 loan from now-insolvent Columbia Savings in  Beverly Hills. He used the loan to purchase a junk bond. Coelho, 47, is now a  managing director of Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co., a New York investment-  </P> <P> banking firm.  </P></p>

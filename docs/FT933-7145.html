			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / World Trade News: ADollars 2.4bn Australian rail link proposed FRANCO-BRITISH engineering company GEC Alsthom NV wants to build a high-speed rail link between Sydney and Canberra, government officials said on Monday, Reuter reports from Canberra. Work would start on the ADollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.1bn) project in 1996 and Speedrail, as it is dubbed, would be running by 1999, according to the proposal. Industry minister Alan Griffiths wants to meet the developers, a government spokesman said. 'Obviously this a project of national significance - we'd like to discuss it further.' GEC Alsthom is half-owned by Britain's General Electric Co and Alcatel Alsthom SA of France, a spokeswoman for the company's Sydney subsidiary said. The trains, modelled on the Train a Grande Vitesse now operating in France, would travel at 350 km (217 miles) an hour and take 75 minutes to cover the distance between the nation's capital of Canberra and the country's most populous city. A second stage linking Melbourne, Adelaide and Brisbane with Sydney and Canberra is also being studied, the sources said. The developers have sent their proposal to the federal, New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory governments. GEC Alsthom would supply the rolling stock for the project, which would create up to 35,000 jobs, the sources said. A similar plan was proposed by a consortium led by Broken Hill Pty but shelved in 1991 after the federal government refused developers' request for tax breaks during the construction phase. The Speedrail proposal makes no such request. About 80 per cent of the projected cost is expected to be spent in Australia, the sources said. GEC Alsthom last week won a contract to help build a 400 km high-speed rail link in South Korea, a project expected to cost USDollars 13.2bn with completion in 2002.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, May 25 (XINHUA) -- Pudong New Area in  Shanghai has approved 364 overseas investment projects in the  first four months this year, involving an agreed overseas  capital of 1.28 billion U.S. dollars.    Officials from the new area administration said the amount  of  overseas investment is 121 percent higher than in the same  period last year.    Panama, Israel, Western Samoa, Bolivia and Puerto Rico  signed  their first investment in the new area in the first quarter,  said the officials.    By the end of April, 40 countries and regions worldwide had  launched 1992 projects in the new area, with contracted overseas  investment totalling 4.55 billion U.S. dollars, the officials  said.    Among the world's top 100 multinationals, about a quarter  now  have investments in Pudong, according to the officials.    A report from the new area's trade bureau says that quite a  lot of manufacturing businesses which came to Pudong when the  new area was launched in 1991, are already making a good profit.    Thanks to the support of overseas capital, the new area has  established a powerful high-tech industry, including high-grade  chemicals, telecommunications, bio-pharmaceuticals, computer  software, electronic products and new materials, said the  officials.</p>

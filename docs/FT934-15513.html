			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / FDP opposes Kohl choice ATTEMPTS by Chancellor Helmut Kohl to secure full government backing for his controversial presidential candidate, Mr Steffen Heitmann, were thrown into disarray yesterday. The Free Democrats, junior partner in the coalition, backed another candidate. Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister and head of the FDP, said he would support Mrs Hildegard Hamm-Brucker, a 73-year-old political scientist, and former state secretary at the foreign ministry, in next May's presidential election to choose a successor to Mr Richard von Weizsacker. His announcement ends weeks of speculation and internal debate about whether the FDP should support Mr Heitmann, or Mr Johannes Rau, the opposition Social Democrats' candidate. It also means that Saxony's justice minister - and Mr Kohl's personal choice - could lose, or be forced into a second round of voting. Mr Kinkel has opted for Mrs Hamm-Brucker largely because of the controversy surrounding Mr Heitmann, officials said yesterday. Last month, Mr Heitmann said in an interview that the Nazi era belonged to a period of German history which had closed following the end of the cold war. The World Jewish Congress has also urged opposition to his candidacy.</p>

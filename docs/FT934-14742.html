			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Gatt poker is turned into blame game - France's potentially scuppering tactics in Uruguay Round 'WE ARE in a poker game,' Mr Gerard Longuet, France's trade and industry minister, said of the Uruguay Round of world trade negotiations yesterday. 'Virtually everyone is agreed to finish the card game before the night is out, but nothing is definitive until the last trick is played.' This optimistic gloss still portrays the negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as a game of bluff and counterbluff between France and its fellow Europeans and the Americans. The deadline for the round will be respected through the talks somehow ending in agreement during the night of December 14-15. In an attempt to sneak a look at each other's hand and perhaps break the stalemate, Mr Longuet and Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, were due to meet in Brussels last night. But what German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Paris on Wednesday night called 'American inflexibility and French rigidity' looks just as much like genuine deadlock. Mr Kantor was giving Brussels a flat no to the French-inspired request for a revision of last year's transatlantic deal on farm trade at exactly the same time as French prime minister Edouard Balladur was getting a standing ovation from his massive parliamentary majority for refusing to accept it. Regardless of the change in government, the scene in the National Assembly was the same as a year ago. The prime minister calls for national unity in defence of French agriculture, he fails to get it only to the degree that the opposition criticises him for not being tough enough, and the parliament behaves - in the words of one deputy on Wednesday - 'like a convention of farmers'. The big difference this year, though, is the threat of a serious crisis within the EC if France is seen to be the wrecker of the entire Uruguay Round. This is why Mr Kohl came to Paris not only to warn France against protectionism but to offer to mediate between Paris and Washington. In fact, Mr Balladur is well aware of the European stakes that ride on his ability to finesse a Gatt accord. His chief Gatt expert is also in charge of EC policy. In addition, Mr Balladur convenes a weekly meeting of some seven ministers to decide the government's Gatt tactics. For what France is playing is a blame game with the US and Cairns group of farm produce-exporting countries. Each side wants to pin any responsibility for scuppering the entire Uruguay Round on the other. This explains Mr Balladur's semi-retreat this week from his ministers' suggestion for an interim Gatt deal by mid-December, leaving arguments about agriculture and culture to be settled later. But the idea was refused by the US, and (more important for France) criticised within the EC because it was seen to be too naked a way of reviving France's old demand for agriculture to be kept out of Gatt. France would love the US to propose an interim Gatt deal, shorn, of course, of agriculture. Mr Balladur told the National Assembly that France was ready to accept a partial deal, if 'certain partners were to propose it'. In an interview yesterday, Mr Longuet spelled out Paris's reasoning why it would be in US self-interest to take this initiative. 'We understand why the US might not be able to obtain its very important agreement on a North American Free Trade Agreement, and to reform its health system at home, while negotiating a full world trade agreement at the same time,' he said. 'The salami has to be eaten in slices.' The beauty of this Cartesian logic is clearly, however, not appreciated in Washington. What would Paris like to see in an interim Gatt accord? 'Some commitment to reforming Gatt into a proper multilateral trade organisation (MTO), the progress that has been made on market access (tariff cuts), and some concession on culture,' suggests Mr Longuet. How could an MTO be set up before a complete Gatt accord? And how could the world agree on trade disciplines and sanctions in an MTO before it had agreed on a new set of trade rules? 'If we can obtain the commitment, the procedure, then we can get agreement on the substance,' replies Mr Longuet, pointing to the way the EC itself has evolved. A growing number of France's politicians and businessmen are, in fact, ready to list in public the general advantages of a Gatt deal for the world's fourth biggest exporter. 'We have 6 per cent of world trade, but less than half that share in south-east Asia,' says Mr Longuet. 'We need, through Gatt, better access to these fast-growing markets.' But very few Frenchmen will concede in public that these advantages outweigh any costs to French farmers. One lone exception is Mr Patrick Devedjian, an RPR Gaullist deputy, but he had his report in support of free trade killed in committee this week. Yet, if Mr Devedjian is to gain any converts among his 576 fellow deputies, Washington will have to concede something on agriculture.</p>

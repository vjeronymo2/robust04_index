			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / UK Company News: The Temple plan moves into top gear - The man chosen to bring IBM UK out of recession THESE are dangerous times for top executives at International Business Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer. Their jobs are on the line if they fail to live up to the expectations of Mr John Akers, the group's beleaguered chairman. For encouragement, they have the example of Mr George Conrades, formerly general manager of US operations, who was shifted publicly and brutally last year out of line management as IBM's profitability continued to drain away. Spare a thought, then, for Mr Nick Temple, chosen last week to take over from Sir Anthony Cleaver as chief executive of International Business Machines' UK subsidiary. The job has changed out of all recognition since Sir Anthony, who retains the role of chairman, was appointed in 1986. Then IBM had a leading share in the general expansion in data processing investment which characterised the 1980s. However, the recession has resulted in the UK company's performance lagging behind IBM as a whole - poor as that has proved to be in 1991 with a loss of some Dollars 2.8bn (Pounds 1.56bn). UK figures have not yet been broken out separately but they will undoubtedly be dismal. Mr Temple's head will equally undoubtedly be on the block if his efforts to revitalise the company fail. His problems are made no easier by the fact that the UK is possibly the toughest computer market in the world - a natural cockpit for companies from the US, Japan and mainland Europe. Chief executive at IBM UK now means presiding over the most profound reorganisation the company has ever undergone as it attempts to come to terms with falling hardware prices, customer resistance and a bloated bureaucracy Mr Temple's appointment came as a surprise only in its timing. He has been the heir apparent since the beginning of 1991 when, with Sir Anthony's encouragement, he was appointed general manager of IBM UK with the specific responsibility of devising and implementing a plan to cut staff numbers and improve efficiency in the company's marketing operations. The two men are distinctly different in character and temperament. Sir Anthony, 53, who was knighted in the 1992 New Year Honours, is cool, private, a strategist who has 'put together 15 of the last 16 business plans for IBM UK'. A graduate of Trinity College, Oxford, he has maintained a life-long interest in education and training. Mr Temple, 44, is expansive and physically dominating; he is universally recognised as an energetic and capable manager with the determination to force through unpopular measures. He has held a number of senior jobs in IBM including responsibility for all aspects of IBM banking and retail business in Europe and responsibility for building IBM's trade with the newly emerging economies of the eastern bloc. Implementing the 'Temple plan' has meant enormous, frequently painful, change, but both Mr Temple and Sir Anthony say that what has been achieved in 1991 goes beyond their expectations. They agree, however, as Mr Temple says, that it is 'only the first leg of a long journey'. First, staff numbers have been cut through programmes of voluntary redundancy. Mr Temple had hoped that 1,000 jobs would go by 1993; in fact, 2,500 people left the company in 1991 reducing total numbers from 17,548 to 14,909. The cost of such an enormous exodus will inevitably be reflected in the annual figures, but Mr Temple argues that most restructuring charges have been taken last year leaving the company with a much more competitive structure for 1992. He does not expect staff numbers to fall much further. IBM's redundancy package is generous and, cynically, it could be argued that the numbers leaving reflect chiefly the state of morale within the company. Mr Temple argues against this thesis, pointing out that regular opinion polls indicate that staff have the measure of the changes and are reacting positively. Second, the proportion of staff having direct contact with customers has been increased from about 50 per cent to 70 per cent; this change is in line with the company's aim of switching to computer services as margins decline on hardware sales. Perhaps the most controversial move has been into consultancy where IBM faces competition from the likes of Andersen Consulting and Computer Sciences Corporation. Consultancy involves understanding a customer's data processing problems and making recommendations to solve them. For IBM, it has meant retraining staff on a large scale. Last year, the company spent Pounds 34m on education and training. Competitors argue that professional consultancy is a hard discipline and that IBM's attempts to break into the market using 'retreads' is sheer cynicism. 'A philosophy of despair,' one said. Incoming chief executives traditionally are allowed a honeymoon period. Mr Temple effectively had his in 1991: he will be judged by the quality of the results in 1992.</p>

One bullet pierced the glass of a window in the office of  Leonid Hrach, republic committee first secretary and candidate  for Crimean president. Fortunately, at the time the office's  usual occupant was in a carefully guarded republic radio studio,  where a live debate between the presidential candidates was in  progress. There were 15 minutes to go until the end of the  discussion....    An incident of a different kind took place around another  candidate -- Supreme Soviet Chairman Nikolay Bargov. As he was  coming of a hall in Yalta after addressing voters, a group of  women expressed their dislike of the candidate by attempting to  strike him. The security services came to the rescue.    The Crimean presidential elections are scheduled for 16  January. Six candidates have registered, all of whom are now  vigorously campaigning.    Crimea's law on the presidential elections prohibits local  mass media sources from publishing candidates' popularity  ratings, although the results of independent studies, which  coincide in many ways, are passed around from hand to hand and  by word of mouth. All observers note that the main rivalry has  developed between the two candidates with the highest chances of  victory. That is, current Crimean Supreme Soviet Chairman  Nikolay Bahrov and Communist Party Leader Leonid Hrach. Both  are experienced politicians -- however, at times their electoral  platforms are diametrically opposed. Leonid Hrach is supported  by structures of the renewed Communist Party, and Nikolay  Bahrov, although registered as an independent candidate, is also  supported by influential political forces like the Party for the  Economic Revival of Crimea, the Agrarian Party, the Party of  Interethnic Accord, and the Party of Social Guarantees.    Again, Bahrov's side is taken by the Crimean Tatar People's  Assembly, which adopted a decision to participate in the  elections. As Assembly Chairman Mustafa Dzhemilev [name as  transliterated] told IZVESTIYA's correspondent, the Assembly  members analyzed all the candidates' speeches and programs and  watched the exclusive interview with Nikolay Bahrov on the  Crimean Tatar television program "Ana Yurt" [as transliterated].  It was noted that all candidates apart from him are calling for  measures which will lead to a revision of borders, and this  means conflict in the Crimea. Therefore, the Assembly has urged  compatriots to vote against all candidates except Bahrov.    As election day draws nearer, political tension in the  Crimea  grows. Cities are covered with leaflets. Every weekend there  are several meetings, congresses, and rallies.    Vladimir Zhirinovskiy brought some quite unexpected tones to  the political battle between contenders for the presidency. He  decided to help one of the candidates, and appealed to the  people of the Crimea: "The LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia] considers the Russian Party of the Crimea [RPC] (leader,  S. Shuvaynikov) to be the only party in the Crimea capable of  defending the interests of Crimean or Russian people. Remember,  the LDPR will be with the RPC in fighting for your rights. We  will defend Russian people, wherever they may be."    Vladimir Volfovich's appeal proves that the Crimean party's  patron is simply out of touch. In fact, a scandal had occurred  in the Russian Party the day before: Sergey Shuvaynikov refused  to stand down in favor of a candidate from the "Russia" bloc and  even spoke out against joining the bloc itself. Furthermore, he  gathered together likeminded thinkers and they excluded those  behind the idea for an electoral bloc from the Russian Party.  In response, supporters of the bloc assembled their own  confederation and excluded the chairman himself from the Russian  Party -- that is, their own presidential candidate Sergey  Shuvaynikov, who, incidentally, has already succeeded in  proclaiming himself the Crimea's shadow prime minister. There  was a positively savage attack on Anatoliy Los, leader of the  Russian Society of the Crimea and the most fervent supporter of  the electoral bloc. Medics at the hospital gave him 30  stitches, while Shuvaynikov, who stands accused of this  terrorist act, issued his own statement on television, where he  announced that he is "switching to an unofficial position" and  requested protection from the security services and the  prosecutor's office.</p>

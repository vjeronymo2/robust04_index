			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLICE MAY HAVE SHOT ONE OF THEIR OWN DURING CHASE  </P> <P> A Los Angeles police officer who was critically wounded while chasing four  young men in a South Los Angeles neighborhood apparently was shot by other  officers firing at one of the fleeing suspects, authorities said Thursday.  </P> <P> Samuel Ward, a 31-year-old patrol officer, suffered bullet wounds to his back  and right leg Wednesday night while searching for a suspect in a back yard in  the 8000 block of Towne Avenue, according to LAPD spokesman Cmdr. William  Booth.  </P> <P> Ward was listed in critical condition Thursday at County-USC Medical Center  after surgery that removed a bullet lodged near his spine. Hospital officials  said they did not know if Ward, a 77th Street Division patrolman, would be  paralyzed.  </P> <P> Booth said investigators swept the neighborhood with metal detectors and found  no evidence that Ward was shot by any of the suspects, all of whom are in  custody.  </P> <P> "We have not been able to locate any weapons," Booth said. "The only shots we  can confirm were shots fired by officers."  </P> <P> He added, however, that investigators have not ruled out the possibility that  one of the suspects shot Ward.  </P> <P> Police initially believed Ward had been shot by Darrin Davis, 20, a suspect who  himself was wounded by police gunfire, according to Officer Neadie Moore, a  police spokeswoman. Davis was treated at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical  Center for two gunshot wounds in the upper thigh and was then turned over to  police.  </P> <P> The four suspects were booked on suspicion of attempted murder of a peace  officer, Moore said.  </P> <P> Moore identified the other suspects as Johnny Jacko, 19; Jason Johnson, 18, and  Johnson's 16-year-old brother, whose name was withheld because he is a minor.  </P> <P> The incident began at 7:45 p.m. Wednesday when officers from the Southeast  Division tried to stop the suspects' yellow Oldsmobile Cutlass for an alleged  speeding violation on the northbound Harbor Freeway, Moore said.  </P> <P> "When the officers attempted to stop the Oldsmobile, the driver accelerated to  about 100 m.p.h. and turned out his lights," Moore said, adding that an LAPD  helicopter joined the pursuit.  </P> <P> After the Oldsmobile left the freeway at Manchester Avenue, Booth said, it  crashed into a parked car in the 400 block of East 81st Street and the suspects  fled on foot.  </P> <P> Neighbors who claimed they watched the car careen down 81st Street said two of  the suspects leaped out just before the Oldsmobile hit the parked car. The  remaining two fled after the crash. The neighbors also insisted they did not  see the men carrying weapons.  </P> <P> After the crash, Booth said, Ward and several other officers from the 77th  Street Division arrived and joined in the search for the suspects.  </P> <P> Officers arrested Jacko, Johnson and the 16-year-old shortly after the search  began.  </P> <P> But Davis sprinted down an alley on Towne Avenue near 81st Street and scrambled  up a wooden fence, said Moore.  </P> <P> As Ward and his partner, Sgt. Michael O'Donnell, approached Davis from one  side, two other officers saw the suspect and ordered him to surrender.  </P> <P> Police spokesman said that when Davis motioned as if he had a gun, Raichel and  Kaleinick fired four shots each from their 9-millimeter pistols. About the same  time, Ward was shot as he was approaching Davis.  </P> <P> Thinking the suspect had shot his partner, O'Donnell fired at Davis but missed,  Moore said. Davis then jumped the fence and darted behind an old trailer.  </P> <P> Police said the suspect was then confronted by another officer, Frank Mendoza,  who fired three shots, hitting him twice.  </P> <P> "When Davis made a sudden turn in Officer Mendoza's direction, the officer,  believing that the suspect was going to shoot him, fired three rounds at  Davis," said Moore.  </P> <P> The official police account of the incident, however, conflicted at times with  a version given to 77th Street Division officers at roll call Thursday morning,  according to an officer who attended the meeting.  </P> <P> The officer, who asked not to be identified, told The Times that Ward's  colleagues were informed by supervisors that much of the confusion at the  shooting scene arose because the officers from the 77th Street and Southeast  stations were on different radio frequencies and could not communicate with  each other.  </P> <P> At the roll call, he said, supervisors said that Ward's partner had to "shoot  his way out of the yard" in order to get himself and the wounded officer out of  the line of fire. In doing so, he added, O'Donnell fired two shots, not knowing  at whom he was shooting.  </P> <P> Booth disagreed with the statements given by the unidentified officer, calling  them "rumors."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Andrea Ford contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Arizona floods buoy up vegetable prices in US YUMA COUNTY in south-west Arizona is best known for its dry heat and its productive agricultural land, but this week its residents are bracing themselves for a once-in-a-lifetime flood that threatens to put more than 30,000 acres of farmland out of production for a year or more. The county is the US's primary winter supplier of iceberg lettuce, and the second-largest vegetable growing region in the country, after central California. Yuma County growers last week hustled to harvest what remained of the winter lettuce, broccoli, and cauliflower crops. The flood has ruffled vegetable marketing channels. Arizona wholesale lettuce prices doubled last week, to Dollars 20 and Dollars 25 a 24-head carton, and were sharply above last year's Dollars 4.50 a carton. Wholesale prices in northern US cities followed the jump and supermarket produce managers say retail prices will rise to Dollars 1.50 per head, from about 49 to 69 cents this week. The immediate impact of the flood may only last a few weeks, as buyers shift toward spring supplies from central California. However, long-term damage in Yuma county may remain with the market. Mr Hank Giclas, spokesman for the Western Growers Association, which represents Arizona and California farmers, said it was too soon to estimate flood damages. 'One thing is sure. You will see significantly reduced supplies of winter vegetables this year, and of summer and fall vegetables next year.' The Gila River, which normally flows gently through Yuma county's flat lowlands, is swelled by record rains. The river is flooding uncontrolled over the spillways of the Painted Rock Dam, just south of Phoenix. Mr Clyde Gould, district manager for the Wellton-Mohawk Irrigation and Drainage District, expects the flood to peak sometime this week, leaving the Gila two miles wide. 'After the peak passes, the water could stand on the land for as much as two months,' Mr Gould said. 'I would expect production on that land would go out a minimum of one year.' Mr Keith Kelly, director of Arizona's Department of Agriculture, estimates that farmers will lose Dollars 10m in crops as the flood hits, and Dollars 75m in revenues next season.</p>

			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Market warms to SB move The market was pleased by news that SmithKline Beecham (SB) was buying Eastman Kodak's Sterling Health division for Dollars 2.9bn and the shares performed strongly on high turnover. In spite of the evident fit between the two groups, there was some surprise at the move as SmithKline had already made extensive use of its cheque book in May when it bought Diversified Pharmaceutical Services for Dollars 2.3bn. The latest deal leaves the company with exceptionally high gearing, but analysts said that was unlikely to worry investors as the group had interest cover of well above 10 times. Mr James Culverwell, pharmaceuticals specialist with Hoare Govett, commented enthusiastically: 'This was a strategic acquisition in the classic SmithKline mould. It makes outstanding sense at a realistic price.' Mr Paul Woodhouse at Smith New Court added: 'It fits both geographically and from a business perspective.' Dealers marked up SmithKline's shares before trading began and the stock held its price as the rest of the market slid back, the 'A' shares closing a net 6 1/2 higher at 465 1/2 p with 6.3m changing hands. The Units, which often reflect US interest, rose 10 to 421p on 6.7m traded. The news was a reminder to the market that Sterling's household products division was also up for sale, for between Dollars 1.7bn and Dollars 2bn.</p>

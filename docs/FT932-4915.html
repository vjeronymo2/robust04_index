			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Arts: Collection of dreams - Architecture Critics come in for quite a bashing in this year's Royal Academy Summer Exhibition illustrated catalogue. Tom Phillips has written a brave, fighting introduction in which he says: 'More sophisticated and more fearless than the critics (who annually wilt before abundance to become a feeble chorus of ritual complaint), the public enjoys the challenge of a show in which visitors can make their own selection and back their judgments against those of the pundits who, historically, have seldom been right.' I rather agree with him - about the public, and I also agree with him when he says almost every other venue of contemporary art has become a fashion house, and, 'an austere temple of orthodoxy'. Exactly the same things can be said when it comes to architecture. There is nowhere else in London where Quinlan Terry can rub shoulders with Richard Rogers, or where a visitor can have a good laugh at Peter Cook's old jokes while enjoying the silvered elegance of Norman Foster's work. There is nowhere else in the world which would give so much room to so much pedestrian work - simply because it is ploddingly made by elderly academicians all of whom have a right to be shown. But there is no doubt the RA Summer Show (apart from its natural bias towards its own members) is dogma-free. Which is more than can be said of most architectural schools, most architectural critics, the Arts Council and the Architecture Foundation. The architecture room in Gallery Six is crowded and clearly designed to make critics wilt at its richness. The most striking exhibit is a well selected work of the artist Ben Johnson. He is not an architect but an artist who is almost obsessed, in the best sense, by architecture ancient and modern. His large painting has a long title - 'Footfalls echo in the memory down the passage we did not take towards the door we never opened.' It is a reconstruction of Piero della Francesca's 'Ideal City' an exercise in architectural perspective and town planning. It is not a copy but an attempt to understand the geometric sources of the painting which hangs in the palace at Urbino. We know that Piero was a mathematician and scientist and that he achieved extraordinary architectural effects in the fifteenth century without the aid of computers. Ben Johnson has produced his pictorial analysis by working with a group known as the Alberti Group which made a three dimensional model of the Piero painting and used computers to see how the remarkable perspectives were achieved. It is, apart from being pleasing to look at, a very appropriate picture to hang above the mixed efforts of architects in the room as an inspiration and lesson. The recent past is also very present at the Academy. Two words crop up with depressing regularity - 'the late'. The loss of the artists Sir Sydney Nolan, Peter Greenham and Dame Elizabeth Frink is distressing indeed and it is hard to believe that the energy of architect Sir James Stirling is no longer in this world. There is a handsome tribute to him made more poignant by the life-like bronze bust of him by Celia Scott. His drawings are a very particular taste - strangely angled axonometrics that make his buildings look more like angular sculpture than places of habitation or work. I was prompted to think of Stirling as I looked at the drawing of the proposed extension to the Academy of Fine Arts by John Partridge of HKPA Architects. How tame it is when you think of the memorable wing that Stirling added to the Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart. Architectural originality is rare - and Stirling certainly didn't pull it off every time. His scheme for the City of London's Mappin and Webb site is exhibited again here and there can be no doubt it is looking dated before it is built. When it comes to dated buildings, how depressing it is to contemplate the British Library, which one day is planned to open at St. Pancras. It is not only dated looking but already a complete period piece. The architect, Colin St. John Wilson, exhibits - in all its blushing horror - a silkscreen print of the scarlet North elevation of the building and a model with a scarlet person in it of the proposed King's Library. The removal of the King's Library from the British Museum is an act of vandalism that is hard to forgive. To house it in this six storey glass bookcase, the design of which has clearly been based upon the rare books library at Yale University, is sacrilege. Everyone dreads the closure of the British Museum Reading Room - it is as bad as knocking down an irreplaceable cathedral - Mr Wilson's new library merely adds insult to the injury. It is good to see Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe's humane garden designs in the architecture room. His detailed drawing repays study. I was intrigued by Norman Foster's proposals for the Reichstag in Berlin - he puts a beautiful umbrella over the rebuilt ruin - a simple and moving idea. His silver models of other German projects are handsome and the one of the proposed City Hall for Marseilles should not be missed. It lurks in gallery one. When you have had enough of the motley collection of architects' dreams one thing the RA is always good for is that it recognises that the tradition of landscape painting continues to thrive in England. Michael Andrews's 'Oare, The Vale of Pewsey' and the glorious painting by David Inshaw, 'Chestnut Tree, Honey Street' are great paintings by any standards and calm reminders of things more perpetual than shifting architectural values and the confusion of the critical debate.</p>

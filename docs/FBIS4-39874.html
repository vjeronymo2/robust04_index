			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Albert Kochetkov and </F> Mikhail Shevtsov]    [Text] Tbilisi, June 10 (TASS) -- Russian Defense Minister  Pavel Grachev's mission on the settlement of the  Georgian-Abkhazian conflict has been a success. After holding  talks this morning with Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze and  receiving his consent for Russia to begin a peacekeeping  operation in Abkhazia, the minister left for Gudauta where he  met with Vladislav Ardzinba and achieved the same result.    Taking part in the talks in Gudauta along with the Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev were Ambassador of the Russian Federation  to Georgia Vladimir Semskiy and Commander of Airborne Troops of  the Russian Defense Ministry Colonel-General Gennadiy Podkolzin.    A final decision on the beginning of a peacekeeping  operation  will depend on the upper house of the Russian parliament. The  defense minister expressed the hope that a session of the  federation council scheduled for June 14 would approve Russian  President Boris Yeltsin's decree on the participation of Russian  peacekeepers in the settlement of the Georgian-Abkhazian  conflict.    According to the defense minister, a peacekeeping operation  in Abkhazia will begin three-five days after a political  decision is adopted. He expressed the hope that along with  Russia other Commonwealth countries would take part in the  operation, particularly states - parties to the treaty on  collective security.    In accordance with the worked out plan of the operation in  Abkhazia, the defense minister explained, the first to start it  will be units of the 345th Airborne Regiment stationed in  Gudauta, as well as three battalions from the group of Russian  troops in Transcaucasian region. The order on their formation  has been already given.    In the future, Pavel Grachev noted, it is planned to bring  into the zone of disengagement along the Inguri river the main  forces -- three battalions formed on the basis of peacekeeping  divisions from the Leningrad and Privolzhskiy military  districts. The personnel and materiel will be delivered by  military transport aircraft to airports in Sukhumi and Gudauta.    On his return from Gudauta tonight, Pavel Grachev told  journalists that a final calculation of all aspects of the  peacekeeping operation and all means and forces to be involved  in it would be made during this night. It is exactly with this  aim that from the Tbilisi airport he set for the headquarters of  the group of Russian troops in the Transcaucasian region where  all details of the oncoming beginning of the peacekeeping  operation will be discussed, according to informed sources from  the government circles in Tbilisi.</p>

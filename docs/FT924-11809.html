			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Beregovoy remarks tease Paris bourse BOURSES shed more of their enthusiasm, contemplating a sharp deterioration in economic expectations and the limited consolation of interest rate prospects, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS rose on remarks by the prime minister, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, that he hoped he would be able to cut French interest rates quite soon, but fell back when the central bank failed to deliver. After a high of 1,750.42 the CAC-40 index ended 8.50 higher at 1,730.74 in turnover of FFr2.6bn. The biggest moves came in Matra and Hachette, as Wednesday's merger terms appeared to favour Matra shareholders. Trading in both shares resumed yesterday and Matra rose FFr20.10 or 11.2 per cent to FFr198.90 while Hachette dropped FFr24.40 or 18.9 per cent to FFr104.60. Oil shares held on to their gains with Elf adding FFr3.80 to FFr349 and Total rising FFr4.80 to FFr235.80. Lafarge gained another FFr6.40 to FFr302.40 while Eurotunnel fell FFr1 or 3.2 per cent to FFr30.10. FRANKFURT saw the day's biggest price changes coming in second-line stocks. The DAX index rose 7.21 to 1,510.11 as turnover fell from DM6.3bn to DM5.7bn. Among senior blue chips, there was no consistency of performance. Lower down the order, KHD and Continental responded to job cutbacks, the engineer falling DM2.90 to DM87 and the tyremaker by DM7 to DM194. Retailers were mostly lower but Kaufhof put on another DM9 to DM439. Lufthansa rose DM6 to DM102.50. Mr Alex Magona of MAP Securities said that its recently announced cut of 400 pilots' jobs, from a total of 3,200, were probably keeping recovery prospects in mind after a more than halved share price at one point this year. AMSTERDAM saw another bad day for DAF and Philips, which led the CBS Tendency index 0.8 lower to 104.5. The truck maker announced it would defer paying a dividend this year on its convertible cumulative preference shares and they slipped to close Fl 1.80 lower at Fl 12.00 while the ordinaries lost Fl 2.00 or 14 per cent to Fl 11.50. Reports in the local press that Philips might seek wage cuts left the shares down Fl 1.00 at Fl 19.80. Earnings downgrades upset DSM and Akzo which fell Fl 1.50 and Fl 2.40 respectively to FL 87.00 and Fl 128.90 while rumours that Fokker was facing cash flow problems weakened the shares by 50 cents to FL 16.80. MILAN firmed further but trading was uneventful. The Comit index rose 3.74 to 412.42 in turnover estimated at around Wednesday's L155.9bn. Credito Italiano steadied after Wednesday's heavy fall, closing L10 higher at L2,035. Fiat, which announced production and jobs cutbacks, rose L43 to L4,293. MADRID's general index rose 1.38 to 200.05 as financials and utilities registered good gains. A fall in bond yields in the last few days also supported equities. STOCKHOLM registered its third consecutive gain, as lower interest rates continued to support the market. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 8.8 to 701.0 in turnover of SKr459m after SKr466m. B shares in SCA rose SKr2 to SKr73 in spite of a 96 per cent plunge in eight-month pre-tax profit. A forecast of break-even for the full year encouraged the market, which had been fearing a loss. COPENHAGEN put banks under pressure following reports of big losses at two regionals, Varde and Sydjyske, writes Hilary Barnes. Danske Bank fell DKr7 to DKr214 and Unidanmark by DKr2 to DKr102. The all-share index fell by 0.43 to 257.44. BRUSSELS closed firmer, but steel stocks fell on dividend cut fears, with Arbed losing BFr65 to BFr2,225. Glaverbel fell BFr250 to BFr3,490 on a report, denied by the company, that it would make a capital increase by year-end. The Bel-20 index inched 3.51 higher to 1,121.68. HELSINKI saw a 9.8 per cent rise in bank shares on the fall in domestic interest rates. The Hex index rose 14.1, or 2.1 per cent to 675.9.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- October 22                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            Open   11.30   12.00   13.00   14.00   15.00   16.00   Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack   100   1016.13 1019.16 1022.88 1023.54 1022.85 1021.72 1022.04 1021.53 FT-SE Eurotrack   200   1093.74 1095.76 1099.52 1099.80 1099.79 1096.47 1095.42 1095.16  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Oct 21    Oct 20    Oct 19    Oct 16    Oct 15  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1015.54   1021.70   1001.00    996.54    986.39 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1087.95   1090.40   1063.18   1066.23   1061.28  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1023.85; 200 - 1101.75 Low/day: 100 - 1016.13  200 - 1093.39  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

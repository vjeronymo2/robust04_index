			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 10 (KCNA) -- The International  Chuche Idea Seminar on Independence, Peace and Friendship opened  in New Delhi on April 8, at which Prof. and Dr. T.B. Mukherjee,  vice-director general of the International Institute of the  Chuche Idea [IICI] and president of the Asian Regional Institute  of the Chuche Idea, made a report entitled "The Chuche Idea Is a  Scientific Doctrine Indicating the Road of Independence, Peace  and Friendship".    The reporter said the universal truth of the chuche idea has  been more eloquently proved by the trend of the development of  history in which the desire of the popular masses to advance  towards independence has grown more intense than ever before  after the end of the Cold War.    "President Kim Il-song founded the chuche idea, the first  man- centred doctrine in history, which scientifically shows the  road of shaping the destiny of man, giving peoples high pride  and consciousness of being the masters of the world and their  own destinies and powerfully inspiring them to the building of  an independent, new world, the century-old desire of mankind,"  he stressed.    Referring to the historical inevitability of the downfall of  imperialism and the appearance of an independent, new world, he  said:    "If the imperialists persist in their policy of strength to  maintain and expand the old order of domination and subjugation,  taking advantage of the collapse of the balance of forces in the  world arena, they will not only face a strong resistance of the  anti-imperialist independent forces but also be forsaken by  their companions and meet their destruction in the long run.    "The downfall of imperialism is inevitable in the  development  of history but it will never quit the arena of history  voluntarily. In order to hasten its fall it is urgent to form a  broad anti-imperialist, anti-U.S. joint front. All the  countries of the world aspiring after independence and peace,  including the socialist countries and non-aligned nations, and  political parties, public organizations and international  organizations should join this front on a broad basis.    "Only when the developing countries realize regional  economic  cooperation under the banner of collective self-reliance is it  possible to jointly defend the regional economic interests from  the imperialist plunder and successfully ensure economic  exchange and development among nations.    "The material foundation of an independent world will be  laid  when the gap in wealth between the developed capitalist  countries and the developing countries is narrowed and  homogeneity is increased in economic development. If an  independent idea and culture are developed and the world  political order is democratized to correspond with this material  foundation, the knell of imperialism will be sounded and an  independent, new world will come into being".    Noting that independence, peace and friendship are the basic  idea of global independence, the reporter quoted respected  President Kim Il-song as saying:    "Independence, peace and friendship are the common ideals of  the progressive people of the world. The Cold War has ended and  the democratic and independent development of the international  community will be accelerated still faster.    The 21st century will be a new historic century in which the  people of all countries will enjoy welfare and prosperity in a  free and peaceful new world."    "The basic demand preferential in creating an independent,  new world is to apply the idea of independence," the reporter  said, and continued:    "Independence is the life not only of each man but also of  each country and nation and, furthermore, the common life of  mankind.    "Each nation must firmly maintain its independence and  respect other's independence.    "Defending the principle of independence in international  relations is not contradictory to internationalism but is the  basis of true internationalism.    "The main target of struggle in realizing the idea of  independence is the imperialist forces. This idea will be  realized on a full scale when the anti-imperialist independent  forces the world over check and frustrate the dominationist  moves of the imperialists by their united strength.    "It is an indispensable prerequisite to the building of an  independent, new world to prevent war and ensure peace of the  world. To this end, it is necessary to get rid of the  dominationist idea of power almighty favoring the settlement of  all issues by strength, which is a mode of thinking in the Cold  War.    "All the peaceloving forces should launch a vigorous  struggle  to check and frustrate the arms expansion by the imperialists,  remove their aggressive military bases in other countries, get  the aggressive military blocs dissolved, create nuclear-free,  peace zones in many regions of the world and realize a universal  and complete disarmament.    "It is an essential requisite to the building of an  independent, new world to develop friendly and cooperative  relations among peoples defending independence. An important  question in developing those relations at present is to destroy  the old international order and establish a new, fair one in all  spheres, politic, economic and cultural.    "Developing South-South cooperation is an important way of  ensuring friendship and cooperation among peoples and achieving  common prosperity of mankind".    Calling for active propaganda and dissemination of the  chuche  idea, the reporter said:    "It is the chuche idea which scientifically indicates the  main orientation and ways for the development of the present era  heading for an independent, new world. It is the demand of the  times and honorable duty to widely disseminate this idea.    "What is most important in propagandising and disseminating  the chuche idea is to make a deep study of works of Comrade Kim  Chong-il, the sagacious leader of the Korean people. His works  consummate the precious experiences of the Korean people in  successfully building anthropocentric socialism with a  singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses and  give profound answers to the important theoretical and practical  problems arising in the advance of mankind along the road of  independence in the present time. That is why his many works,  including `The Historical Lesson in Building Socialism and the  General Line of Our Party', `On the Fundamentals of  Revolutionary Party Building' and `Abuses of Socialism Are  Intolerable", have evoked a great sympathy among the progressive  people of the world today."    The reporter stressed the need to conduct the work of  disseminating the chuche idea among the broad masses of people  through various art activities based on the chuche view of life  and value and in combination with various socio-political  activities such as the movement for democracy, anti-war,  anti-nuke peace movement and environmental protection movement  in close link with progressive political parties.    He said each chuche idea study organization should conduct  the work of disseminating and applying the chuche idea by its  own efforts in conformity with the interests of its people and  specific conditions of its country and lead the popular masses  to be the masters in this work.    He called for an energetic effort for the dissemination of  the chuche idea to accelerate with redoubled vigor the building  of an independent, new world where the ideals of independence,  peace and friendship would be embodied.</p>

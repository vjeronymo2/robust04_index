			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Raimundo Lopez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 28 Feb (PL) -- Polls show that the  preliminary results on the consultations with workers on  measures to clean up domestic finances encourage optimism among  the population on Cuba's capacity to emerge from these adverse  economic moments.    A comparison study of two polls carried out in January and  February shows the trust Cubans have in the results of this  consultation process, said Dario Machado, director of the social  political studies center, in charge of the polls.    Preliminary data shows that the percentage of people who  responded positively to the question of whether the consultation  process has awakened enthusiasm among workers, climbed from 62  percent in January, to 80 percent in February.    Local authorities have put off taking any measures to reduce  the imbalance of domestic finances until the results of the  broad study made in factories and other work sectors are  received, including private farming, which began in January at  the initiative of the Cuban Workers Federation.    The official decision to face the difficult economic moment  (caused by the loss of the country's main partners, the former  Soviet-European socialist field) without changing principles of  social justice, encourage financial maladjustments or its  worsening, local sources indicate.    State Committee for Finance Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez  recently recalled that despite the situation, Cuba maintains  average employment and income levels, similar to 1989; in  addition, Cuba raised health and social security budgets 10  percent and 33 percent, respectively, compared to 1989.    President Fidel Castro said that to face the economic  difficulties, neoliberal mechanisms of dramatic consequences in  other countries would not be used, and no Cuban will be left  unprotected.    In the work site debates, popularly known as the workers'  parliament, workers suggest ideas to improve productive  efficiency in their direct activity, and immediately afterward,  they propose alternatives to solve the country's problems.    Results from the polls by the social economic center show  that the percentage of people who trust that this consultation  process will yield useful proposals, increased from 75 percent  in January to 84 percent in February.    Likewise, Machado reported, the number of those who believe  that this consultation process is worthwhile increased from 86  percent in January to 91 percent in February.    Conversely, the first poll showed that only 0.2 percent of  those polled called for a change in the economic system, 0.3  percent were concerned that workers' suggestions were not taken  into account, and 4.7 percent believed that these measures would  not be effective.    Work site meetings will last until 15 March and the workers'  proposals will be taken by the Cuban Workers Federation to the  country's highest levels, including the National Assembly of the  People's Government.    The parliament, which last year made a preliminary analysis  of the situation, plans to hold an extraordinary session -- date  has not been announced yet -- to consider the domestic financial  situation.</p>

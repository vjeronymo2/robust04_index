			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Technology: Checking up on speedier transactions Transax, the cheque guarantee company, has introduced an electronic system to speed up cheque authorisation. Use of the system at 150 retail outlets over a year showed authorisation times comparable with credit card processing times, according to Transax, which guarantees cheques for amounts over bank guaranteed limits. Clearance takes less than 20 seconds through a direct link between a cash register and the Transax computer if the retailer already has an integrated electronic till. The link can also be made through some credit card terminals, or via a Verifone unit, which connects to the till, telephone line, and electricity source. Details are keyed into a keypad and the response is made through the cash register. An optional 'cheque reader' which feeds the cheque details into the Verifone automatically costs Pounds 6.45 a month to rent. The Verifone, at Pounds 10.20 a month, takes 6 sq in of counter space. An alternative electronic service, the ChequeTone, operates on an ordinary tone-dial telephone. Cheque details and code numbers are keyed into the telephone and an electronic voice gives the response, authorising or rejecting the cheque. Clearance time is about 30 seconds. The computer assesses customers on the basis of their cheque-writing history. Transax also has access to a 'hot card' database of stolen cards, compiled by several of the main clearing banks. Last year, 3bn cheque payments were made in the UK, compared with 1.45bn paid by cards, including debit, credit, charge and store cards. Checkpoint Security Services has introduced Windows-compatible software for companies transmitting funds through the UK Bankers Automated Clearing Service. Winbacs costs Pounds 595 excluding VAT.</p>

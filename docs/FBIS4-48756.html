			<p>BFN     [Text] National Assembly May 25 SAPA -- Although the  Democratic Party [DP] was small in numbers at present, it stood  for values which were great, universal and eternal, DP acting  leader Mr Tony Leon said on Wednesday.    Speaking during debate on the president's address, Mr Leon,  elected as Dr. Zach de Beer's replacement last Sunday, said he  and his colleagues would "use all our resources to advance our  ideals and to unpack our value system so that it touches the  lives of all South Africans in all communities".    The DP supported the government's Reconstruction and  Development Programme [RDP], he said to applause from ANC  benches, provided it was sustainable, cost-effective and wide in  its reach.    The following "base-line" characteristics were needed for a  truly effective RDP:    -- a profound change in direction of previous government  expenditure, with more stability in fiscal and monetary policy;    -- recognition of the innovating stimulus of the free market  economy, without its indifference to unemployment;    -- sustainable job creation on a long-term basis;    -- acceptance of the broad line of division between public  and private sectors; and    -- the use of market forces to help achieve policy  objectives.    Mr Leon said although the DP was a small party, it  represented many of the critical interests of South Africa's  civil society: the professions, elements of the university  community, smaller and larger businesses, entrepreneurs,  investors and consumers.    He called on the government to lift the state of emergency  in  Natal, to ensure that the selection process for judges of the  constitutional court was open and to promote federalism.    Mr Leon paid tribute to Dr. de Beer as someone who had  represented decency in public life "even when flagrant  incivility and rhetorical excesses seemed the quickest route to  political power".</p>

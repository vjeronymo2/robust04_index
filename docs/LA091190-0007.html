			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MALATHION TESTS  </P> <P> From the Metro article (Aug. 29) on malathion: "In an interview, (Los Angeles  County health official Dr. Paul) Papanek said the urine testing is being done  to support the state's contention that the amount of malathion absorbed by the  body after spraying does not pose a health threat."  </P> <P> What kind of science is this? Bad, unscientific and a definite conflict of  interest. Self-monitoring or self-testing are no substitutes for independent  assessments.  </P> <P> Whether it's the self-monitoring by agencies of their sewage being discharged  into Santa Monica Bay or justifying a state policy to spray malathion over an  unwilling and vulnerable populace, we must insist on impartial, truly  scientific evaluations.  </P> <P> ELLEN STERN HARRIS  </P> <P> Executive Director  </P> <P> Fund for the Environment  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

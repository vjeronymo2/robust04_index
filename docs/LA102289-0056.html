			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIGHT RAIL FORUM DISPUTE SIMMERS  </P> <P> I had to laugh when I saw the letter from Susan Brown giving her lame defense  of the fairness of her so-called "Light Rail Forum." Here's my view of her  highly orchestrated non-event:  </P> <P> The "forum" was promoted only in the neighborhoods along the Exposition right  of way. Brightly colored posters lined the streets within a block or so of the  rail line. I also received a definitely one-sided sheet announcing the event  from her group, the Cheviot Hills Homeowners Assn. The notice presented none of  the alternative information available from other groups.  </P> <P> Especially ludicrous was her defense of the gathering as representing  alternative viewpoints. Yes, Neil Peterson, the executive director of the  county Transportation Commission was there. But he was asked to speak first.  Then the other five primary participants took turns lambasting him, his  presentation, the city of Santa Monica, and light rail.  </P> <P> This spectacle was followed by a videotape that made up in inflammatory  distortion what it lacked in technical competence. At this point you could have  taken the audience and goose-stepped it down to kick the tracks.  </P> <P> In her letter, Susan Brown asks the question: "What other responsible viewpoint  could there be?" Well, mine was there but was not welcome. I made 400 copies of  a letter to the community I drafted urging caution (and) asking residents to  beware of manipulation by both sides. It also asked if we should preserve the  right of way for other possible uses.  </P> <P> I asked Ms. Brown if I could leave the letter on the table with the other  literature which was all anti-rail.  </P> <P> She proceeded to yell, "Absolutely not," that this was "her meeting" and that  if I wanted to give them out I could go and organize my own meeting. Clearly,  according to Susan Brown, the only possible responsible viewpoint is her own.  </P> <P> My first concern is that the Exposition right of way should be preserved before  it is lost, regardless of whether it is found most useful for a strip park,  urban bike trail, jogging path, or any of the various possibilities for public  transportation. I now have the added concern that my neighbors and I are being  manipulated by demagogues whose only concern is for their own narrow agendas.  </P> <P> ROL MURROW  </P> <P> Rancho Park  </P></p>

On August 30, 1994, OPRA filed with the Commission a letter amendment revising the amendment to clarify that OPRA vendors who provide data control services to their data feed customers are not considered to be Control Service Providers required to enter into a Data Control Service Agreement or pay a Control Service Fee. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  The proposed amendment was published for comment in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  One comment letter was received.

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Recent developments in computer and communications technology have led an increasing number of OPRA subscribers to receive options information by means of high speed, data feed transmissions from vendors. Historically, OPRA vendors have provided a controlled and formatted transmission of options information to most subscribers, but have also provided an uncontrolled, bulk, data feed transmission to an increasing number of subscribers. As a result of the trend toward data feed transmission, a new type of service provider_the data control service provider_has appeared. Such a provider controls the access and entitlement of subscribers' devices in respect of market information received in the form of a data feed transmission. Unlike vendors, data control service providers are not currently subject to a contract with OPRA nor are they required to contribute toward OPRA's overall administrative costs, despite the fact that, like vendors, they are in the business of redistributing options information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Description  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed amendment establishes a Control Service Fee to be paid by persons other than vendors who provide a data control service to OPRA subscribers. The monthly fee of $2,800 is the same as that currently paid by vendors under their agreement with OPRA. The control service fee is intended to cover OPRA's additional administrative costs and to allocate a portion of OPRA's overall costs to those persons who utilize options market information for commercial purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The proposed amendment also establishes a Data Control Service Agreement that will serve as a contract between a Control Service Provider and OPRA. This agreement imposes requirements on Control Service Providers intended to assure the reliability and integrity of the services they provide. It will require Control Service Providers to provide OPRA with a complete description of the systems and procedures to be utilized by them in controlling subscribers' access to options information, as well as a current list of subscribers and their entitlements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The amendment also provides that OPRA's Subscriber Indirect Access Fee, which is payable by subscribers who receive uncontrolled data feed transmissions of options information from vendors, will not apply to subscribers whose receipt of a data feed transmission is under the control of a Control Service Provider.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Finally, the Indirect (Vendor Pass-Through) Circuit Connection Rider to OPRA's Subscriber Agreement would be amended to relieve controlled data feed subscribers of the obligation to report device counts to OPRA. Since vendors and Control Service Providers are or will be required to provide this information to OPRA, there is no need to obtain it from the subscribers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Summary of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted above, the Commission received one comment letter. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  Reuters, a vendor that distributes OPRA information, assumed that the purpose of the amendment was to replace the indirect access fee (paid by subscribers who receive an uncontrolled data feed of information from vendors) with a charge to vendors who control the data delivered to a subscriber. As the letter amendment (cited on page 2 of this order) makes clear, only data control service providers  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> who are not vendors <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  will be required to enter into a Data Control Service Agreement and pay the Control Service Fee. No new or additional fees are to be imposed on vendors under this amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter from Andrew McLean, Reuters, to Secretary, Commission (September 9, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Sinn Fein says cabinet was split on Ulster Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, said yesterday that it had received highly sensitive information earlier this year about a split in the British government over its negotiations with the organisation. Mr Martin McGuinness, the Sinn Fein official with the closest links to the IRA, said he had been informed earlier this year that Mr John Major was forced to defuse a cabinet split over government contacts with nationalists. According to Mr McGuinness, Mr Major met Sir Patrick Mayhew, Ulster secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and two civil servants on May 17 to discuss an IRA offer to call a 14-day ceasefire to enable talks to take place. The next day the group was expanded to include Mr Kenneth Clarke, then home secretary. Mr McGuinness claimed that Mr Clarke expressed concern that continuing dialogue with Sinn Fein was 'too risky with the government under siege'  - a possible reference to government difficulties ratifying the Maastricht treaty. By contrast, said Mr McGuinness, Sir Patrick was 'wobbling between pushing for acceptance and wanting a safer, longer period of cessation'. Downing Street last night reacted angrily to Mr McGuinness's claims about the meetings, saying that they were 'inaccurate'. It added that 'all the quotes are fabricated'. The claims, it said, were an attempt to distract attention from the fact that Sinn Fein had made the original overtures to Britain this year. However, the revelations looked set to further embarrass the government on the eve of peace talks between Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister. Sinn Fein further disconcerted the government by saying that it had also received copies of a briefing paper from the Northern Ireland Office which summarised talks conducted between Ulster's democratic parties last year under Sir Ninian Stephens, an Australian judge. According to the briefing paper, the British were exploring the possibility of setting up a power sharing assembly in Stormont, creating a series of cross-border executive agencies and agreeing a constitutional declaration on Ulster. The document showed that Sir Ninian had conducted the talks with constitutional parties between May and November last year. If this allegation is proved, it would give strength to claims that the British government has been involved in talks with the Irish nationalists for more than three years. British officials claimed earlier this week that Sinn Fein made initial enquiries about talks with the government in February.</p>

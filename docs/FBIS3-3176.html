			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 4 March (XINHUA) -- A national conference  on party school work opened here today. Speaking at the  conference, Hu Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the  CPC Central Committee Political Bureau, member of the  secretariat, and president of the Central Party School,  stressed: We must use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the  guidelines of the 14th National Party Congress and the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee as the guide  in studying new developments and problems in party school work  under the new circumstances, to achieve unity in understanding,  to strengthen leadership, and to comprehensively deepen  education reform in party schools to bring about a new stage in  party school education.    Hu Jintao discussed five issues: 1) further clarifying the  new situation and tasks facing party school work; 2)  persistently using the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics to guide party school work; 3) deepening party  school reform, and comprehensively raising the standards of  party school work; 4) building a contingent of better-qualified  teachers as the key to running party schools successfully; 5)  earnestly strengthening the party committee's leadership over  party school work.    Hu Jintao pointed out: In this crucial period of historical  development, and in the face of a new situation and new tasks,  we must, more than at any time in the past, attach greater  importance to the party's ideological and theoretical  construction; to using Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, and  especially Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics to arm the entire party; and to  train and improve the vast number of cadres and raise the  qualified personnel needed in our times. Hu Jintao said:  Training cadres requires the efforts of the entire party in  many areas, and party schools at all levels shoulder  particularly important responsibility in this regard. Closely  integrating the practice of reform, opening up, and socialist  modernization; arming leading cadres with Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics; bringing up a theoretical backbone force; and  conducting theoretical study and propaganda constitute the  fundamental tasks of the party school in the new situation.  They are also the basic requirements put forward by the party  central committee on party school work. We must carry out the  training, rotational or non-rotational, of leading cadres in  active service and strive to improve their skills in finding  solutions to basic political, economic, social, and cultural  issues in the new period and their ability to command the  overall situation, operate the socialist market economy, foster  material, cultural, and ideological progress, and handle  complicated contradictions. We must earnestly carry out the  training of young cadres, strengthen the training of theoretical  backbones, and do a good job of theoretical research and  propaganda.    Hu Jintao looked at, from 10 aspects, the guiding ideology,  basic requirements, and work principles needed to strengthen  cadres' education and theoretical work which were put forward by  Comrade Deng Xiaoping in light of the new situation facing the  party and the new tasks it shoulders. He pointed out: From  either the immediate or long-term perspective, Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's series of expositions is of extremely great  significance as a guide for us in successfully conducting party  school work in the new period. When we stress the strengthening  and improvement of party school work, we must first concentrate  our efforts on using the theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics to guide party school work.    Hu Jintao stressed: The key to raising the standards of  party school work lie in deepening reform. The general  requirements for party school reform are: Using the theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's  basic line as the guide; focusing on efforts to vigorously  improve teaching quality; strengthening scientific research and  using it as the foundation; more successfully upholding the  policy of integrating theory with practice; closely integrating  the practice of reform, opening up, and socialist modernization;  correctly understanding and grasping the law governing the work  of education for party cadres in the new period; gradually  establishing a sound party school education system, scientific  research system, and management system with Chinese  characteristics; further improving party school operations; and  more satisfactorily serving the need to train qualified leaders  for the party, the need for theoretical construction, the need  for scientific decisionmaking by party committees and  governments, and the need for reform, opening up, and socialist  modernization. Hu Jintao pointed out: To further improve party  schools, we must pay closer attention to and seriously  strengthen the building of a contingent of teachers. We must  make concrete and relentless efforts to build a contingent of  better- qualified teachers in sufficient numbers in accordance  with the requirement to raise their standards, improve their  makeup, maintain a stable backbone force, and train qualified  successors -- to build a contingent of teachers who are capable  of upholding the party's basic theory and line and upholding  unity between the emancipation of the minds and seeking truth  from facts, who are good at studying the new situation and  correctly answering new questions, and who possess strong party  spirit and Marxist study style and are worthy of the name of  teacher.    Hu Jintao concluded: To earnestly strengthen the party  committee's leadership over party school work, we must  concentrate on doing three tasks well: 1) The building of  leading bodies. We must select a group of comrades who have a  better grasp of Marxist theory, possess rich practical work  experience, and are enthusiastic about the role of party school  education in strengthening the leading bodies of party schools.  In addition, we must strengthen the building of ideology and  work style among the leading bodies. 2) We must ensure that  party schools are operated in the right direction. 3) We must  help party schools resolve major issues related to their work.  Hu Jintao fully affirmed the arduous efforts and important  accomplishments made by comrades on the party school education  front. He urged them to further pluck up their pioneering and  enterprising spirit and work hard to explore new paths of party  school education with Chinese characteristics to enable party  schools to play a greater role in the drive to build socialism  with Chinese characteristics.</p>

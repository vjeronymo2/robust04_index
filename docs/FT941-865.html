			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / International Company News: Recession hits Publicis profits The downturn in the French advertising industry last year triggered a fall in profits for Publicis, one of country's largest advertising agencies, which reported a 15 per cent reduction in net profits to FFr126.6m (Dollars 22m) from FFr145.6m in 1992. Publicis, like other French agencies, has been affected by the recession, which has prompted many companies to cut their marketing budgets, and by the destabilising effect of la loi Sapin, the former socialist government's reform of the media buying system. The group saw consolidated sales fall by 9 per cent to FFr18.2bn in 1993 from FFr19.8bn in 1992. However, on a strictly comparable basis the decline in sales was slightly smaller, at 4 per cent. Publicis said that the resilience of its operations outside France had helped to counter the pressures on its domestic business. However, in spite of the downturn, the group last year expanded its French advertising activities by taking control of FCA], which is one of the largest agencies in France and has interests in the US and other European countries.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Polish PM may face crisis: Row grows over calls for referendum on abortion GROWING pressure in Poland for a referendum on abortion is embarrassing Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka and threatening discord in the governing coalition. Strict laws banning abortion and bringing in prison sentences for both doctors and women who perform such operations are almost certain to win a majority in parliament in a forthcoming vote. However, a national committee led by Mr Zbigniew Bujak, a left-wing deputy and former Solidarity leader, is pressing for a referendum on the issue. A meeting of Ms Suchocka's Democratic Union (UD) party in Poznan voted to back a referendum, prompting the prime minister to say the vote was 'the greatest setback in the four months her government had been in existence'. 'This decision means that I have moved away from the Union,' she added, tearing up her delegate's ticket. Ms Suchocka is a supporter of the abortion ban and fears the political consequences of allowing the referendum go ahead. The UD is one of the main parties in Poland's governing coalition. A key coalition partner is the right-wing Catholic ZChN party which is a determined supporter of a strict abortion ban. Its alliance with the UD will be hard pressed to survive a bruising referendum campaign in which the Catholic church will battle fiercely to defend its version of the draft law.</p>

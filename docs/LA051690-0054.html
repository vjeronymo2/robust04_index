Arvie Sherman said the two men would be arraigned this morning in  Malibu Municipal Court on manslaughter charges in the April 14  alcohol-poisoning death of Leland Scovis, the youngest of a group of five  teen-age boys the brothers were chaperoning on a camping trip at Leo Carrillo  State Beach.  </P> <P> The brothers were each charged Monday with one count of involuntary  manslaughter, four counts of furnishing alcohol to a minor and four counts of  contributing to the delinquency of a minor.  </P> <P> Another chaperon, Priscilla Vernon, 21, of Newbury Park, surrendered with the  brothers. She has been charged with being an accessory to involuntary  manslaughter and contributing to the delinquency of a minor, Sherman said.  </P> <P> The three were being in lieu of $5,000 bail each.  </P> <P> Scovis collapsed about 15 minutes after he drank two to three inches of alcohol  left in a gallon jug of whiskey.

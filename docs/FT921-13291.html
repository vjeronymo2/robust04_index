			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Hyundai workers end occupation MILITANT workers ended their occupation of South Korea's largest car plant yesterday after police threatened to storm the Hyundai factory with helicopters, armoured vehicles and thousands of officers, AP reports from Ulsan. The workers took over the plant after it was closed by the company following a union strike vote. The workers were demanding special bonus payments, better working conditions and reinstatement of workers dismissed for union activity. Early yesterday, helicopters flew over the plant dropping leaflets informing workers of the dawn evacuation deadline and threatening an assault after 12,000 riot police massed around the factory compound. Some 3,000 to 4,000 car workers had been reinforcing towering barricades of trucks, cars dragged off assembly lines, vehicle parts, tyres and hijacked fire engines. Clusters of workers pounded the ground with steel pipes, keeping time with rousing pro-labour songs blasting out across a compound littered with broken car parts. South Korea's wages have doubled in four years because of union pressure. The government has asked companies to keep down pay rises to improve competitiveness.</p>

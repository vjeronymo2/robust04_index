			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (3): Buzzwords Readers who do not have a technological background may find useful the following explanations of some of the technical computing terms used in this issue of Software at Work: Fourth-generation language or 4GL is the name applied to software products for writing programs relatively quickly. Typically a 4GL program instruction, often in an English-like form, is translated by the computer into several lines of a traditional (third-generation) language such as Cobol. Computer-aided systems engineering (CASE) is the latest attempt to improve the speed and quality of system development. A CASE product set might include: a method for analysing users' needs; a database, (called a repository), holding program, report and screen specifications, plus project management information; products for analysing and restructuring existing programs for possible re-use in a new system (also known as re-engineering); a fourth-generation language; and a database management system. Unix is an operating system: the software that manages the internal working of the computer, organising the main memory, running applications programs, and handling security and other functions. Earlier, different manufacturers had their own operating systems, which tied users to their machines, but there is now a move towards enabling users to move applications software from one computer to another. nix is emerging as a standard operating system, running on different computers, which allows users to transfer software in this way. Fault-tolerant systems enable application programs to keep running even if part of the overall system develops a fault. There are two main specialist suppliers of fault-tolerant computers: Tandem links two or more computers which can each run different programs but constantly check that the others are working; if one fails the others take over. Stratus, which sells its products directly and through other manufacturers, including IBM, has a different approach: two processors handle the same programs and constantly compare results. Some traditional manufacturers, notably NCR, have launched fault-tolerant systems and others offer the possibility of running their computers together to provide fault-tolerant processing. Electronic data interchange (EDI) is the exchange of business documents, such as orders and invoices, electronically between traders' computers, usually through telecommunications services provided by computer bureaux, which direct incoming calls to the requested recipient. EDI speeds up the whole process and cuts human intervention and error. It is currently an area of fast growth.</p>

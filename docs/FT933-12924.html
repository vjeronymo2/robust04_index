			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Action on US urban aid THE Clinton administration yesterday sent its community banking proposals to Congress, asking lawmakers for Dollars 382m (Pounds 254.6m) funding over the next four years. The proposed Community Development Banking and Financing Institutions Fund is the administration's main programme for urban and rural aid. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, told the House banking committee 'distressed' communities needed a sustained and comprehensive financing mechanism to gain entry into 'mainstream America' in a manner 'devoid of long-term subsidy'. The fund will lend money to community development financial institutions, such as credit unions and neighbourhood banks, most of which must provide matching money. It may lend up to Dollars 5m per application to any insured local financing group, and up to Dollars 2m for uninsured institutions. Assistance from the fund may be used to develop or support commercial and community facilities that produce jobs; create or expand businesses; provide basic financial services to poor people; provide mortgage aid to the poor; and finance low-income housing. It may also provide technical assistance grants. Congressman Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the committee, said that although the proposal was 'a step in the right direction. . . it is not the elixir for our nation's dying communities.' He said many areas could not even absorb credit because they had so many unemployed and so few jobs. 'Enacting this bill does not excuse the federal government from implementing a more comprehensive urban policy that addresses the lack of housing, health care, educational and economic opportunities and the prevalence of crime, drugs and violence,' he said. The American Bankers Association also saw the funding request as only 'a good starting point'. It wants commercial banks brought into the programme to provide 'a huge pool of capital for community development'. As the administration's proposal now stands, only institutions 'principally engaged' in community development lending would qualify.</p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Japanese ink makers investigated for 'cartel' JAPAN'S Fair Trade Commission (FTC) yesterday said it was investigating the country's leading ink makers for allegedly forming a cartel to fix prices after the Gulf war led to higher costs for raw materials, Robert Thomson reports from Tokyo. The commission said investigators had raided some 40 offices of about 10 companies, including Toyo Ink Manufacturing and Dainippon Ink &amp; Chemicals, following allegations that representatives of the companies met in late 1990 to organise price increases. The FTC is expected to order the makers to disband the alleged cartel, though Dainippon Ink said the company had not yet received any such order. News of the investigation came as FTC officials told the Japanese parliament the government should support the commission's recommendations to increase fines for price or production cartels from Y5m (Pounds 22,300) to 'several hundred million yen'. The FTC has been in dispute with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party which wants the fines in new anti-monopoly legislation to be far lower than the FTC proposes.</p>

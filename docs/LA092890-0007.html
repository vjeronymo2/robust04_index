			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEN. THURMOND'S REMARKS  </P> <P> Kudos to The Times for your editorial "Lovely Ladies" (Sept. 23) regarding Sen.  Strom Thurmond's (R-S.C.) sneering sarcasm toward the five fabulous females  testifying at the Souter hearings.  </P> <P> When I opened the telephone lines at noon that day on my radio show (KGIL), I  was deluged with calls from women still reeling from the jolt of actually  seeing before their eyes the insidious, patronizing dismissal of accomplished,  articulate Americans testifying for their constitutional rights.  </P> <P> Ah, but the Good Ole Boy Strom did us festering females a fine favor. He jolted  us into renewed vigor in realizing that sexism is as nasty and pernicious as  racism. I would have liked to see the outcry had Thurmond called a panel of  black men lovely "boys."  </P> <P> CAROLE HEMINGWAY  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / BCCI liquidators secure Dollars 1.8bn from Abu Dhabi The liquidators of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International have moved a step further towards partial repayment to creditors by completing a formal agreement bringing in Dollars 1.8bn from the bank's main shareholder. The legal agreement with the government of Abu Dhabi requires approval from the BCCI creditor's committee and then ratification by courts in the UK, Cayman Islands and Luxembourg. The creditors committee is expected to meet this week. The latest proposal will see Abu Dhabi waiving rights to pursue Dollars 2.2bn of assets, which it says were stolen by the bank, and it will make a direct contribution of Dollars 1.8bn. In exchange it will win an agreement that the liquidators will not take any legal action against Abu Dhabi, while the government has given a similar assurance to the liquidators. The legal document was based on heads of agreement between the two parties last March. This is the second time that the liquidators have reached this stage. A previous agreement was blocked in the Luxembourg appeal court last October, on technical considerations. The earlier agreement gave only a range of compensation from Dollars 1.2bn to Dollars 2.2bn, which depends on the realisation of assets. Creditors were individually committed to signing agreements not to sue the leading shareholders and there was an agreement that the liquidators and Abu Dhabi would jointly pursue legal action against third parties, and share any proceeds. The latest document has removed these agreements.</p>

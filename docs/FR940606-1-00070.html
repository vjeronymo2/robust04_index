			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 14. Section 154.350 would be revised, as was the Gas Carrier Code, to waive the requirement for liquid leak detection for certain spaces in internal insulation cargo containment systems, provided that those spaces are completely filled with approved insulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. Section 154.407 would be revised to designate the liquid height as ``Z <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> B <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' and to clarify that the definition of Z <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> B <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  does not include small tank domes which are not considered part of the accepted total volume of the cargo tank. This amendment is consistent with the Gas Carrier Code. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. As discussed earlier, &sect;&sect;154.454 through 154.458 would be added to address the use of internal insulation tanks, as allowed by the amended Gas Carrier Code. The design of each of these tanks would be required to be approved by the Coast Guard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17. As stated earlier, table 3 in &sect;154.459 would be revised to include requirements for internal insulation tanks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 18. Under &sect;154.468, information on certain properties of the insulation material used in internal insulation tanks would be required to be submitted to the Coast Guard for approval. These properties were added to the list of insulation properties required to be tested for internal insulation tanks under the Gas Carrier Code. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 19. Section 154.519 would be revised to clarify that any cargo piping component capable of being isolated in the liquid full condition must be fitted with a relief valve. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20. Section 154.522 would be revised in accordance with the amended Gas Carrier Code to allow relaxations approved by the Commandant (G&hyph;MTH) of the minimum design temperature of open ended piping inside cargo tanks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 21. The table in &sect;154.610 would be revised to raise the required test temperature for material in the thickness range of 30 to 40mm from ^40  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C to ^20  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C, in accordance with the amended Gas Carrier Code. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 22. Section 154.630 would be revised to clarify that the minimum yield strength used in the specified calculations must be the yield strength of the aluminum alloy in the annealed condition. This section currently makes reference only to the minimum tensile strength. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 23. Section 154.901 would be revised to clearly state that the cargo tank atmosphere is never permitted to be in the flammable range. It is necessary to prevent a flammable atmosphere from developing on a liquefied gas vessel because there are no requirements prohibiting sources of ignition from being present. These vessels are designed and operated based on the assumption that a flammable atmosphere will never be present. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 24. Section 154.1110 would be revised to include storerooms containing high fire risk items in the area to be protected by the water spray system and to clarify that each area listed is required to be covered by at least two jets of water. These amendments are in line with the amended Gas Carrier Code. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 25. Section 154.1115 would be revised to include guidance for determining the required capacity of the water spray systems. This revision is based on amendments to the Gas Carrier Code. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 26. Section 154.1320 would be revised to indicate that the pressure referred to is the design vapor pressure and not the MARVS. This was also clarified in the amendments to the Gas Carrier Code. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 27. New &sect;154.1327 would provide a formula for determining the maximum acceptable shutdown time once the emergency shutdown valve is activated. This maximum would represent the time until the tank becomes liquid full. This is consistent with amendments to the Gas Carrier Code. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 28. Section 154.1343 would be added to require the installation of detectors, as required in the amended Gas Carrier Code, for determining when a leak has occurred in the primary barrier. The detectors need only indicate that there is a leak. They need not be able to pinpoint that leak. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 29. Existing &sect;154.1400 would be revised and &sect;&sect;154.1401 and 154.1402 added to clearly indicate the required safety equipment for all vessels and the additional equipment required for vessels carrying flammable and toxic cargoes. These revisions correspond to amendments to the Gas Carrier Code. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30. Section 154.1405 would be revised, as was the Gas Carrier Code, to clearly indicate that respiratory and eye protection equipment intended for use as emergency escape equipment be so marked and never be used for fire fighting or cargo handling. This section also would prohibit the use of filter-type respiratory equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 31. Section 154.1705 would be updated to include requirements for cargoes added to bring these regulations in line with the Gas Carrier Code. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

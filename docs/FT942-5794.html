			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (2): Japanese trade row clouds the future - More turbulence may lie ahead for the US currency in the short term After opening the year on a bullish note, supported by the US economy's strong performance and expectations of higher domestic interest rates, the dollar dropped sharply in April as short-term negative influences - an ill-conceived government dollar policy, deteriorating US-Japan trade relations, and political uncertainties at home and abroad (notably in Korea and Mexico) - overwhelmed the positive fundamentals. The situation deteriorated so quickly that by early May massive intervention by up to 17 central banks was required to halt the US currency's free fall. While the central banks' actions appeared to have set a short-term floor for the dollar around DM1.65 and Y104, the foreign exchange markets wonder what the next six to 12 months holds for the beleaguered greenback: further depreciation, or recovery? Although currency analysts warn that more turbulence may lie ahead in the short term, most feel that the outlook is brighter for the dollar, if only because the Clinton administration - after attempting to 'talk down' the dollar to narrow the trade gap with Japan - has finally changed the course of its policy. Allen Sinai, chief global economist at Lehman Brothers, says: 'We've seen the bottom in the dollar. The main reason is that the US administration has (realised) that allowing the perception to exist that the US has a dollar depreciation policy was a big mistake. It was clearly counter-productive, because (any benefit derived from) the opening of Japanese markets that might have come from using the dollar as a political club against Japan was much less than the political cost of the higher interest rates that come off a lower dollar.' Realising that it cannot afford, for political reasons, to allow a weaker dollar to pull long-term interest rates higher, the US government is now committed, in word and deed, to support the US currency against the yen and the D-Mark. John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, says: 'There were no magic wands waved by the intervention that will completely change the outlook for currencies. Yet, the G7's actions, and the change in US policy regarding the dollar . . . have truncated the downside risks for the dollar. The G7 is not trying to draw a line in the sand, or define a specific target band for currencies - but the message is clear. Additional dollar depreciation, especially in the context of weakening capital markets, will be resisted by the US authorities, with the co-operation of other central banks.' Analysts are confident that the foreign exchange market has got this message, because institutional investors and currency speculators realise that the central banks have the room within their domestic monetary frameworks to take whatever action is needed to protect the dollar. As Mr Lipsky puts it: 'There is no policy dilemma facing central banks in supporting the dollar,' because the needs of European and Japanese economies are likely to require further stimulation from easier monetary policy in the near future. The Bundesbank's decision to cut 50 basis points off German interest rates on May 11, for example, was taken with one eye fixed on the dollar. Although the Bundesbank explained the move in purely domestic economic terms, it was in its interests to provide the dollar with a much-needed lift, for a weak US currency was posing a danger to Germany's export recovery. The May cut in German rates should shift the interest rate differentials further in the US currency's favour if, as is expected, the Federal Reserve continues to tighten US monetary policy during the late spring and early summer. Much also depends on how US financial markets behave over the coming months. Declines in the price of US assets was one of the factors behind the dollar's recent slide. Anticipating trouble ahead for the inflation-obsessed US bond market, and for the vulnerable and US stock market, international investors steered clear of dollar-denominated assets during March and April. Ironically, further monetary tightening by the Fed - normally negative for bond and equity prices - might come to the US markets', and thus the dollar's, rescue. If, by raising rates a few more notches the Fed convinces the bond market that it will be able to stave off a resurgence of inflation, long-term bond yields should start to come down. This would breathe new life into US equities, and in the process make international investors more likely to buy dollars to purchase US financial assets. While the US administration's new dollar policy, improving interest rate differentials, and a possible strengthening in US financial markets are all factors in the dollar's favour over the coming months, there is one cloud hovering above the US currency that will not go away: US-Japanese trade relations. The failure of the new Japanese prime minister Tsutomu Hata to build a majority in parliament makes another general election likely, probably after the passage of the next fiscal budget in June. With so much uncertainty surrounding the political situation in Japan, an early resolution of the trade dispute between the US and Japan cannot be expected. Consequently, the dollar is likely to remain vulnerable in the near-term to speculative selling against the yen. Some analysts predict that the US currency could fall through the headline-grabbing Y100 level, albeit only temporarily. Over the longer-term, however, analysts feel confident that a gradual improvement in the US's trade balance with Japan, prompted by a strengthening US export sector and some modest opening up of Japanese markets to overseas goods, will allow the dollar to climb back from its lows against the yen. Mr Sinai at Lehman envisages the dollar reaching Y105 by midsummer, then appreciating to Y110 or more by the end of the year, while Mr Lipsky at Salomon makes a similar prediction, forecasting Y110 by the year end. As for the dollar/DM rate, analysts expect a widening differential between the two countries' interest rates and economic performance to boost the dollar to at least DM1.70 by the summer and DM1.75 by Christmas.</p>

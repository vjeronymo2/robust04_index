			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: DSM earnings fall sharply in third period DSM, the Dutch chemicals group, saw its profits fall by more than half in the third quarter under the combined influence of industry-wide overcapacity, the slowdown in economic growth, cheap imports from eastern Europe and the strength of the guilder against other currencies. The company cautioned that fourth-quarter results, excluding extraordinary items, were also expected to be lower. Net profit in the latest quarter dropped by 55 per cent to Fl 53m (Dollars 30.3m) from Fl 117m a year earlier. The sharply lower figures dragged results for the first nine months down to Fl 263m from Fl 451m in 1991. The figures, which were lower than predicted by most analysts, caused DSM's shares to fall by 9.2 per cent to close down Fl 7.80 at Fl 77.20. DSM said profit margins were hit hardest in its hydrocarbon, polymer, base chemicals and fertiliser businesses. By contrast, engineering plastics showed a slight improvement, it said, without giving details. Overall, operating profit was down 65 per cent at Fl 46m. The net profit figure of Fl 55m includes Fl 10m in extraordinary gains resulting from the disposal of Chem-Y in Germany. A year earlier, DSM's results had been lifted by Fl 15m in extraordinary gains. Third-quarter turnover fell by 6 per cent to Fl 2.1bn. Although DSM's sales volume was down just 2 per cent, turnover showed a larger drop because of an average 5 per cent decline in selling prices and because of the weakness of the dollar against the guilder. The fall in sales volume was attributed mainly to a downturn in fertilisers and in cracker products.</p>

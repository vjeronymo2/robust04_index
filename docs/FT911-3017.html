			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (5): The changes at a glance Value Added Tax Payable on most goods, rose by 2.5 points to 17.5 per cent - the first rise since Sir Geoffrey Howe nearly doubled VAT in 1979. Poll Tax Pounds 140 cut from the level previously announced for 1991-92 for every local authority in Britain; though some did not experience the full benefit, because they would otherwise have received a rebate. No poll tax is payable until the new bills have been sent out. Mortgage-interest tax relief Abolished at the top rate of 40 per cent. Top-rate taxpayers still receive basic-rate relief of 25 per cent on the first Pounds 30,000 of a loan - a threshold unaltered since 1983. Income Tax Basic rate (25 per cent) and the top rate at (40 per cent) unchanged. Personal allowances increased 9.8 per cent, in line with inflation. The only real change was to the threshold before the top rate tax is payable: it rose by 14.5 per cent, from Pounds 20,700 to Pounds 23,700,to soothe those who lost on the reduction in mortgage relief. Personal equity plans From January, investors will be able to take out a Pep of up to Pounds 3,000 in a single company, in addition to the Pounds 6,000 plan already allowed. The restriction that at least half of all Pep investments must be in UK equities will change some time later in the year. Thereafter, half of your investment must be in the EC. A Pep can now hold Pounds 9,000 of shares in non-UK companies. Share-ownership schemes discount on executive share-ownership schemes, if they introduce a share-ownership scheme for their employees. The scope for profit-sharing schemes and profit-related pay will also increase. Offshore trusts to clamp down on these tax shelters. Assets from existing onshore trusts are now liable to a tax charge when transferred offshore, and the settlor to a trust is liable to capital gains tax if he, or any of his family or his companies, is a beneficiary. Capital Gains Tax The threshold before tax is payable on gains increased 10 per cent to Pounds 5,500 for individuals. Trustees are immune from tax on their first Pounds 2,750 in gains (another 10 per cent increase). Allowable gains from letting rooms were doubled to Pounds 40,000. Retirement relief (when an individual surrenders an interest in a business following retirement) was increased from Pounds 125,000 to Pounds 150,000,and is now claimable at the age of 55, not 60. Inheritance Tax An indexed increase in the threshold before IHT is payable,from Pounds 128,000 to Pounds 140,000, was made. High-street shares Submissions have been invited for a plan to sell shares from high-street retail outlets. If a good offer is forthcoming,the sell-off of the government's remaining holding in British Telecom may be handled this way.</p>

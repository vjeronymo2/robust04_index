			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tory associations criticise Fowler THE Tory leadership faces an embarrassing row with party activists later this week over its refusal to give local constituency associations a direct role in the running of party headquarters. Supporters of the Party Reform Steering Committee - a pressure group seeking democratic accountability within the party organisation - have tabled a rare motion of censure condemning the management reforms unveiled last month by Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman. The motion, which will be debated on Friday at a meeting of the Conservatives' policy-making Central Council, has the support of at least 50 local party associations. It underlines the rumbling discontent among activists over the autocratic style of the party's Smith Square headquarters and the debt of nearly Pounds 20m it has accumulated in recent years. Many associations are refusing to hand over funds to the national party organisation. The council, which meets once a year, brings together the various wings of the party including MPs, MEPs, local associations and councillors. Public debate of censure motions is highly unusual. Moved by the Brentford and Isleworth association, the motion condemns the refusal of the party's National Union to call a special meeting to examine proposals for a radical overhaul of the party machine. The steering committee wanted the council to establish a party executive committee - with at least half its members elected by a postal ballot - to take over responsibility for the administration of Conservative Central Office and the party's central funds. But Sir Norman blocked the attempt by questioning the credentials of some of the 50 local associations supporting the demand. Some of the associations were alleged not to have paid their subscriptions. The party chairman then unveiled his alternative plan for a new, appointed board of management under his chairmanship to bring together the different wings of the party. In parallel, the party chairman announced more than 60 job losses as part of an economy drive designed to reduce the debt. But Mr Michael Normington, the chairman of the pressure group, yesterday condemned the new board as having 'no constitutional basis'. He said that it could be changed or scrapped by Sir Norman at any time and would not provide any democratic accountability for party members. Mr Normington also attacked the procedures under which party headquarters hoped to have his blueprint endorsed by the central council. Sir Norman's plan will be debated at a special session on Friday morning, before many party activists have arrived in Harrogate for the council's formal opening session later that afternoon.</p>

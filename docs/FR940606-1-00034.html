			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Total nationwide costs, taking into account both the savings and costs detailed above, are estimated to be a savings of $20 million. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sources subject to the proposed rule would be required to perform certain monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting tasks. These information collection requirements will create a burden on the affected sources in terms of resources needed to comply with these requirements (see section VI.D.). The total nationwide costs of the manpower requirements to complete these tasks are estimated to be $36.7 million. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Total nationwide costs are estimated to be $16.7 million, which is the sum of the annualized costs (a total nationwide savings of $20 million) and the costs due to monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements (a total nationwide cost of $36.7 million). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. New Facilities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the aerospace industry, no net growth is expected over the next five years; therefore, no net costs (or savings) due to new facilities are anticipated during this period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Economic Impacts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Due to the low total compliance costs associated with the proposed regulation, the discussion of the economic impacts is presented in a qualitative manner. The low costs of the proposed regulation are in a large part due to cost savings expected to be achieved by some model plants. The economic impact analysis discussed in a qualitative manner the primary impacts (the direction of price and output changes in the aerospace industry), as well as secondary impacts (the direction of changes in the demands for inputs such as coatings) associated with the proposed regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cost estimates indicate that the total annual compliance costs are approximately $16.7 million. In 1990, revenue for this industry equalled approximately $118.9 billion. Using revenue data as a proxy for production costs, the costs of the proposed regulation are only 0.01 percent of the total production costs for the industry. This increase in production cost is expected to have minimal impact on the current prices and outputs of the aerospace industry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secondary impacts refer to changes in factor demand by all aerospace producers. For example, while the primary impact of the regulation on spray gun cleaning is a decrease in the cost of performing this task, the actual cause of the decrease in the cost is a reduction in the use of methyl ethyl ketone and other solvents. Although compliance with the proposed regulation is expected to reduce consumption of coatings and solvents in general and, therefore, negatively impact the producers of these products, compliance with the proposed regulation is also expected to increase product substitution so that demand for non-HAP strippers, waterborne maskants, and low vapor pressure solvents will increase. Lack of economic data on a product-specific basis prevents quantification of the indicated impacts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Process Descriptions and Control Technologies <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Process Descriptions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Aerospace manufacturing and rework operations consist of the following basic operations: Chemical milling maskant application, chemical milling, adhesive bonding, cleaning (e.g., hand-wipe, spray equipment, and flush), metal finishing, electrodeposition, coating application (e.g., primers, topcoats, sealants, and specialty coatings), depainting, and composite processing. In addition, most aerospace manufacturing and rework facilities generate waste and wastewater, and some facilities have storage tanks for hand-wipe cleaning solvents. An aerospace facility may conduct all of these processes in its operations, such as an OEM facility that produces the entire aircraft. However, an aerospace facility may conduct only a subset of these operations, such as a facility that produces a single component or assembly, or a facility that provides a service such as chemical milling. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Chemical Milling Maskant Application and Chemical Milling <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Chemical milling uses etchant solutions to reduce the thickness of selected areas of metal parts in order to reduce weight. The process is typically used when the size or shape of the part precludes mechanical milling or when chemical milling is advantageous due to shorter processing time or its batch capability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chemical milling maskants are typically rubber- or polymeric-based coatings applied to an entire part or subassembly by brushing, dipping, spraying, or flow coating. After the chemical milling maskant is cured, it is removed from selected areas of the part where metal is to be removed during the chemical milling process. The chemical milling maskant remaining on the part protects those areas from the etchant solution. Chemical milling maskants typically contain either a toluene/xylene mixture or perchloroethylene as its solvent constituents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

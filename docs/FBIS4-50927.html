			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Strong Public Opinion Urges Renewal of China's </F> Most-Favored-Nation Trading Status"]    [Text] The renewal of China's most-favored-nation [MFN]  trading status, an issue between the United States and China,  has reached a decisive stage this week. The mutually beneficial  trade between the two countries should have developed  unceasingly. In recent years, however, thare has been political  controversy every year between spring and summer, and the reason  does not lie on the Chinese side. The original purpose of the  U.S. linkage of human rights to China's MFN trading status was  to exert pressure on China. But China was not overwhelmed by  such pressure. Conversely, the United States became caught in a  dilemma designed by itself. There are now strong criticisms of  the erroneous U.S. policy from within the United States; Asia,  including Hong Kong; and even traditional U.S. allies in Europe.  If the United States revokes China's MFN trading status, it  will have to pay a huge political and economic price.    To extricate itself from the embarrassment caused by the  linkage, the Clinton administration, following Secretary of  State Christopher's visit to China in March this year, recently  sent Michael Armacost to Beijing as the President's special  envoy, to seek a way out with Chinese cooperation. China's  sincerity in this regard is beyond question. It wants to  steadily develop friendly ties with the United States, promote  cooperation, and reduce difficulties. Nevertheless, China  cannot abandon its sovereignty or sacrifice social stability to  meet U.S. demands.    The differences in human rights concepts between China and  the United States are quite natural. Human rights, which  involves value judgments, belongs to the category of ideology.  The late political leaders of the two countries, Mao Zedong and  Nixon, could facilitate Sino-U.S. diplomatic ties precisely  because they proceeded from a strategic height, surpassing their  ideological differences, seeking common ground while reserving  differences, and reaching cooperation based on mutual benefit.  More than 20 years have elapsed since Nixon's world-shaking  visit to China. If the ideological differences on human rights  today lead to a retrogression in Sino-U.S. ties, it will be an  adverse current in history. Despite the adverse current, we  believe that the historical tide will continue to surge forward.  It is noticeable that while talking about China's MFN recently,  U.S. President Clinton also stressed the importance of U.S.-PRC  economic and strategic cooperation.    Following the Beijing political disturbance in 1989, the  U.S.  administration linked the question of human rights with China's  MFN. Apparently, the "linkage" policy proceeded from a mistaken  estimate. Five years have passed and China's political situation  is more stable and its pace of reform and opening up has been  steadier and quicker. As stated by President Jiang Zemin last  week, "a bad thing has turned into a good one." If we had  failed to adopt resolute measures five years ago, the steady  situation in China today would be impossible. During an  interview given to the U.S. "FOREIGN AFFAIRS," Singaporean  statesman Lee Kuan-yew also pointed out: "Anyone who attempts to  set up another government in China cannot be steadier than the  current Beijing regime. Just imagine what would have happened  if the students in Tiananmen Square could have attained their  goal and formed their government. These Tiananmen students went  to France and the United States later. They have never ceased  quarreling there. What would China be like if these students  were in power? The situation would be worse than that in the  Soviet Union. China is a huge and complicated country and it  needs a powerful central government."    The development of events has proved that the United States'  "linkage" policy is on the verge of bankruptcy. International  observers have noted that it will be impossible for the U.S.  Government to use the MFN issue to pressure China into accepting  its human rights concept. If the United States revokes China's  MFN trading status and fights a trade war, it will lose China's  huge and potential market. In the current sharp economic  competition between the developed nations, it is unlikely that  the United States could bear the consequences. Information from  Washington shows that the Clinton administration is considering  a readjustment of this policy. It is now time to change its  course. Many countries in the world have supported China's  resumption of its status as a GATT signatory. Once China's  status as a signatory of GATT is resumed, it should naturally be  granted MFN trading status. If the United States wants to  fundamentally change its policy, it should not obstruct China's  reentry to GATT.    Whether the question of MFN is settled or not, the  difference  of views between China and the United States on human rights  will exist for a long time to come. This should not hinder  cooperation between the two countries. The Chinese Government  has held discussions and exchanges with a number of foreign  governments on the question of human rights. Last year, China  set up a nongovernmental China Human Rights Society, which  probed Chinese and foreign theory and practice on human rights,  maintained contacts with foreign human rights organizations, and  participated in international human rights conferences. When  the question of human rights is "separated" from trade, China  can similarly carry out fruitful exchanges with the United  States in this field, based on mutual respect, equality, and  justice, so as to constantly improve the situation of human  rights.</p>

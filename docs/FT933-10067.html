			<p>930806 FT  06 AUG 93 / Mexican retreat on housing rights THE MEXICAN government has sought to quell rising protests at a law which eliminates rent controls and curbs tenants' rights in Mexico City. It has promised to protect existing tenants from the law's impact for five years. The law, passed by Congress last month, removes ceilings on rent increases, eliminates the one-year minimum for a housing contract, and simplifies the legal eviction of a tenant. The aim was for the law to stimulate investment in Mexico City's housing market, widely believed to have been depressed by the rent controls and tenants' rights. However, citizens' groups, unions and opposition parties bitterly opposed the law, and led street protests against it. President Carlos Salinas has partly bowed to this by promising to postpone application of the legislation to existing tenants for five years. He will also propose measures to stimulate housing investment. The new law will apply to all new tenants, though, so citizens' groups are to continue their protests.</p>

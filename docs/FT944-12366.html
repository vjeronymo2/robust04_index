			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Salinas defends political record President Carlos Salinas of Mexico delivered his last state of the union address yesterday, offering a robust defence of his six years in office one month before he hands over to his successor, Mr Ernesto Zedillo. Mr Salinas sought to answer criticisms that his government had put economic reform before political change, arguing that democracy could not flourish when financial disorder, deficits and inflation were exacerbated. He said 'experience shows that abrupt political changes promoted from above without the consensus of parties and the support of society merely lead to a break with the old without consolidating the new.' Nevertheless, Mr Salinas said significant democratic progress had been made during his administration. The high turnout and generally trouble-free August presidential elections 'mark our passage towards a better democracy'. He accepted some responsibility for the New Year's uprising in the southern state of Chiapas, referring to 'excessive caution' in not taking preventative security measures.</p>

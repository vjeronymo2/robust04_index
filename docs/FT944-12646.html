			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Fayed renews attack on Aitken Mr Mohamed Fayed yesterday renewed his onslaught on Mr Jonathan Aitken, the chief secretary to the Treasury, by alleging that there were 'discrepancies' in Mr Aitken's account of how he settled his Fr8010.90 bill for a weekend at the Ritz Hotel in Paris. Mr Aitken last week faced allegations in The Guardian newspaper that he had allowed a businessman, Mr Said Ayas, to pay just under half the cost of his stay, without declaring this alleged gift. He then attempted to defuse the allegations by saying that the bill had been settled in full, but in two stages. An initial payment of Fr4257.00 in cash had been made by his wife, who had not been staying with him at the Ritz, when Mr Aitken checked out of the hotel on September 19. She had paid less than the full Fr8010.90 because of a billing error, Mr Aitken said. The balance was then settled by Mr Ayas, to whose hotel bill the costs of Mr Aitken's stay had been transferred. Mr Aitken said that once he realised that his wife had paid too little, he paid Mr Ayas what he owed him. Mr Fayed, who owns the Ritz and is conducting a campaign to destabilise the government, yesterday attempted to pick holes in Mr Aitken's explanation in two respects. He said he had checked with the cashier at the Ritz and had been told that the 'brunette lady' who settled Mr Ayas's bill with a cheque for Fr117,008 'was the same person who paid the cash sum Mr Aitken says was paid by his wife'. This 'brunette lady' also said to the cashier that she had been paying 'other bills at the George V and the Intercontinental'. Mr Fayed added 'Unless Mrs Aitken was also paying the other cheques to the other hotels, the brunette in question was working on Mr Ayas' staff'. Mr Michael Cole, speaking for Mr Fayed, said there were also peculiarities about the documentation Mr Aitken had produced as evidence that he had paid the balance to Mr Ayas. Last Friday Mr Aitken reproduced copies of a cheque for Pounds 426.88, roughly the amount owed, which was made out to Mr Abdul Rahman, an associate of Mr Ayas. The details on the cheque did not, however, appear to be a perfect match with details on Mr Rahman's bank statement, which was reproduced in the Daily Mail last Saturday. The statement of Mr Rahman's account at the Arab Bank (Switzerland) says that a cheque 'du 31.3.94' was paid in to Mr Rahman's account. This seems to imply that the cheque was dated '31.3.94', though Mr Aitken's cheque is in fact dated '21.2.1994'. The statement also apparently says that the amount deposited was Pounds 426.80 - though the final '0' is unclear on the reproduction - compared with the Pounds 426.88 of the cheque.</p>

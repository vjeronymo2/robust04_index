			<p>BFN     [Text] In its 23 April communique, the Rwandan Patriotic  Front [RPF] declared unilaterally that it would stop fighting in  all the areas it has liberated, from midnight last night,  depending however, on the fulfillment of all its conditions.    It is worth recalling that the unilateral cease-fire comes  at  a time when RPF fighters have been doing well. The new  positions taken together with the former neutral zone represent  an area twice as big as the area which the RPF previously  controlled before the resumption of the war this month. The RPF  fighters have hugely increased the territory under their  control, having added to it the area from which they had  previously withdrawn.    There is a current lull in the fighting. The entire Mutara  region and the entire Kibungo Prefecture are in RPF hands.  Radio Rwanda has confirmed an Army Headquarters report that  there is no fighting in these areas, and the Army Headquarters  has also confirmed this by saying there is no fighting in  Byumba. Indeed, the entire prefecture and town of Byumba were  under RPF control by the time of the unilateral cease-fire. The  same applies to most parts of Ruhengeri Prefecture. The  cease-fire comes at a time when the whole prefecture is under  RPF control. The same applies to the town of Kigali. By the  time the cease-fire was declared, RPF fighters maintained  control of the liberated areas, while remaining vigilant. The  government forces had tried in vain to push them out of these  areas.    That, in brief, was the situation as of yesterday, when the  RPF and its fighters declared a unilateral cease-fire while at  the same time remaining vigilant.    As you have just heard in our war front news, the RPF  fighters have gone further than temporarily taking control of  communes. They have also added the area from which they had  previously withdrawn to their territory. In two weeks and four  days -- that is 18 days -- the RPF fighters have gained control  of the entire Mutara and Buganza regions. They have moved away  from controlling only communes, and now control entire  prefectures and their towns. Examples are Byumba Prefecture and  its town and Kibungo and its town, which are in RPF hands.    Apart from that, the RPF fighters have displayed exceptional  courage. The fighting which stopped last night had even moved  into the capital where the RPF is in control of strategic  military positions. We support the RPF fighters and are  encouraged by the selflessness and courage that they continue to  exhibit in the liberation of Rwanda, while protecting innocent  people, as decided by the RPF.</p>

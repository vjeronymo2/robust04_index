			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa at his </F> official Tokyo residence with unidentified domestic  correspondents -- live]    [Text] [Dean of press corps] The prime minister's office  has asked that we limit this news conference to about 20  minutes. However, I think it could last longer depending on the  questions. Mr. Prime Minister, I would like to ask you if that  is all right?    [Hosokawa] Yes.    [Dean of press corps] As dean of the press corps, I would  first like to ask three questions. Following that the other  reporters will have a chance.    [Hosokawa] Before I field any questions may I say something?    [Dean of press corps] Please, go ahead.    [Hosokawa] In response to an agreement reached at a meeting  of representatives of the ruling coalition parties this morning,  leaders of the government and the ruling coalition parties held  a meeting at midday to make a final decision on the tax issue in  which people are greatly interested. Before outlining the  agreement, I would like to point out that the national welfare  tax that I announced, together with our policymaking process,  have been publicly criticized and I would like to offer my frank  apology to the people for this.    I would like to outline the agreement. The first point is  that income tax cuts amounting to 6 trillion yen will be  implemented ahead of a tax rise in fiscal year 1994. The second  is that a consultative body will be set up within the ruling  coalition to discuss tax reform. The consultative body is  mandated to discuss how to fashion a vision of a welfare  society, how the people should share the burden of a society of  senior citizens, and how the current tax system should be  reformed. The consultative body is also mandated to discuss  ways to cut taxes and secure financial resources to make up for  a fiscal shortfall arising from the tax cuts. Relevant laws  will be enacted at a Diet session within this year upon  agreement among the ruling coalition parties. I have recently  proposed a draft of the tax reform on the basis of discussions  held by the Government Tax System Research Council since last  autumn, and on a series of lively consultations between the  government and ruling coalition parties. But a ruling partner  has raised an objection to the tax reform draft. In response, I  have asked the ruling coalition parties to coordinate their  views again and they reached agreement today. With the ruling  coalition parties reaching the agreement, a bill on cutting  income tax by 6 trillion yen will be introduced to the Diet  during its current session. I understand that a clear path has  been drawn toward drastic tax system reform. Discussion will be  conducted by the consultative body, which will take into account  the ideas I have proposed. I intend to work out a draft of the  government's plan for reform of the tax system based on a  proposal to be drawn up by the ruling coalition parties.    [Dean of the press corps] Mr. Prime Minister, you said a  while ago that you apologize to the people. The national  welfare tax that you announced has been scrapped. That means  your decision has been overturned. Mr. Prime Minister, how are  you going to take responsibility for that? I think you are  politically responsible for the public criticism. Mr. Prime  Minister, would you explain what you have apologized about?    [Hosokawa] I believe the biggest issue is our policy  decision process. Of course, people have talked about various  aspects of the national welfare tax. Among other things, they  have pointed out that the policymaking process was overly hasty.  I have to apologize to the people for creating that impression.    The policymaking process of the ruling coalition parties is  one of interparty negotiations and I believe this kind of  process has its limitations. As a result, the outcome of  interparty discussions are prone to be leaked. I think the  process probably creates the impression that the ruling  coalition parties are in disarray over policy. As for the  importance of my remarks as prime minister, I have always kept  that in mind. I believe that I will undergo a process of trial  and error in the course of making policy decisions. If there is  something I need to correct, I will not hesitate to correct it.    [Dean of the press corps] At one time there existed a  situation wherein it was questionable which side would formulate  a compromise plan between the government and the ruling  coalition parties. Some have pointed out that such a situation  was created by the ambiguity of the prime minister's  instructions and his lack of leadership. Prime Minister, what  do you think of this criticism?    [Hosokawa] Since the tax issue is important, I have asked  the ruling coalition parties to engage in full discussions of  the issue. My proposal for the national welfare tax was rejected  by one of the ruling coalition parties, and the expression  scrapping has been used. Nonetheless, I have asked the meeting  of the representatives of the ruling coalition parties to again  discuss in detail the tax issue, and this morning the ruling  coalition parties reached the agreement I mentioned at this news  conference.    [Dean of the press corps] Prime minister, you have said the  ruling coalition parties will discuss the reform of the current  tax system and the securing of financial resources to make up  for a fiscal shortfall incurred from future tax cuts. Prime  Minister, would you explain through what process the ruling  coalition parties will discuss them? Prime Minister, you said  you have asked the ruling coalition parties to discuss reforming  the current tax system, taking your proposal into account.  Prime Minister, some feel your proposal has been scrapped.  What do you think of this?    [Hosokawa] The ruling coalition parties will discuss ways to  reform the current tax system. As for your question about  through what process the ruling coalition parties hold  discussions, I do not know. However, they will draw a  conclusion within this year on the issue of securing financial  resources to make up for the financial shortfalls arising from  tax cuts. I hope they will work on drawing a conclusion to the  issue at the earliest date.    [Dean of the press corps] Then, please, ask questions.    [Correspondent] My question concerns how the tax cuts will  spur the economy. According to an estimate, a salaried  household with two children and an annual income of 5 million  yen will benefit only about 40,000 yen a year from the tax cuts.  A salaried household with two children and an annual income of  8 million yen will benefit only 160,000 yen a year from the tax  cuts. Given these tax benefits, I wonder if the tax cuts will  generate the desired effect of stimulating the economy. Prime  Minister, what do you think?    [Hosokawa] It is very hard for me to explain the effect of  the tax cuts in numerical and quantitative terms. However, we  need to put our nation's economy on a path to full-fledged  recovery. To that end, we should adopt various policies, and  our adoption of those policies has been strongly demanded by  foreign nations and our own people. The reductions in the  income tax will spur personal spending and investments in  equipment and plants, bringing the pervasive effect to the  entire economy. My view is that the cuts in the income tax will  contribute to a recovery of the economy.    [Correspondent] Prime Minister, you have just expressed your  apology and have pointed out that the policy decision process is  at issue. Given the last week of political vacuum, I would like  to ask you, how do you plan to change the process in the future?    [Hosokawa] My answer may be a repetition of what I have just  said. Various discussions held by the coalition government have  been made public, and this is a good aspect of it. As I just  mentioned a while ago, the ruling coalition parties have given  the impression that they delayed in making a final decision  prior to making the decision public. They present these two  aspects. Now, the ruling coalition parties hold the meeting of  their secretaries in charge of the policy affairs, the meeting  of secretaries in charge of the tax affairs, and the meeting of  their representatives. The government and the ruling coalition  parties hold their meetings. Major issues are decided at those  meetings. I intend to work to prevent a recurrence of the  latest situation in the future. I believe I will have to keep  that point in mind.    [Correspondent] What about the issue of who is responsible?    [Hosokawa] As I have said, I think this has proved a very  difficult issue. It has not only involved negotiation among the  ruling parties on the issue itself, but discussion about what  the coalition administration ought to be like. As this is our  first, fully fledged coalition administration and it is still  new, I would hope people will understand that we are bound to  have some trial and error. The ruling coalition parties will  work to prevent a recurrence of such a situation, and they will  concede to each other when they need to do so. I intend to work  hard to keep the coalition government functioning smoothly.    [Correspondent] You made similar remarks when you met  reporters on Friday. But I am sure you did not offer such an  apology at that time. Have you changed your mind over the past  few days in now making an apology?    [Hosokawa] Of course I had such feelings when I met  reporters a few days ago, but the issue was not resolved at the  time. I intended to express my views concerning the current  confusion when the issue was resolved and the prospects for the  tax issue were clearer.    [Correspondent] Do you still believe the idea of introducing  a national welfare tax is right?    [Hosokawa] Since last fall, from about 3 September when I  attended a meeting of the Tax Commission, I have expressed my  views about how the taxation system should be changed to reflect  the fact that society will have to deal with increasing numbers  of senior citizens. There is also the issue of how tax cuts  should be implemented to deal with the current economic  recession. The Tax Commission discussed these issues for more  than two months to try to seek a way to satisfy these two  factors. After that, discussion has been held at policymaking  meetings of secretaries general of the ruling coalition parties,  meetings of their economic consultative body, and meetings of  representatives of the coalition. I have repeatedly stated my  views at Diet sessions since last September. I also asked the  Tax Commission to discuss the tax issue in line with my view  that unless a well-balanced taxation system of income,  consumption, and property taxes is established, Japan cannot  prepare for the future aging of society. This basic view has  not changed.    [Correspondent] Do you mean that you want the ruling  coalition parties to discuss the tax issue based on the idea,  which you recently announced, of introducing a 7 percent tax in  three years?    [Hosokawa] No, I do not. I hope that the consultative body  of the ruling coalition will hold discussions in the future  based on my basic view. At present, though, I am not sticking  to the tax rate or anything.    [Correspondent] I repeat a question about the national  welfare tax. The proposal to introduce the national welfare tax  has been killed. Do you refuse to withdraw or give up your  proposal, and do you intend to maintain the need for a national  welfare tax in the future?    [Hosokawa] No, I do not. I announced earlier that the  proposal was politically frozen. After it was frozen, a new  decision was made at a meeting of representatives of the ruling  coalition. As I stated earlier, I think that they will probably  discuss the tax issue while keeping my view in mind.    [Correspondent] Prime Minister, you are holding this news  conference to apologize to the people for what you have done.  Prime Minister, you have said that it is inevitable for the  coalition government to undergo a process of trial and error,  while repeatedly saying you are aware of your political  responsibility. I wonder if you are really reflecting on what  you have done? This is my frank feeling. Prime Minister, you  called a news conference to explicitly say to the people that  you plan to adopt the national welfare tax. The people see the  reversal of your plan to adopt the tax system as inconceivable.  This is what the people frankly feel. At this news conference,  I wonder if you feel political responsibility. What do you  think of your political responsibility?    [Hosokawa] I think your question is very tough and  forthright. As Japan moves toward a society of senior citizens,  Japanese should share their due burden for society. I have said  as much to that effect at the Diet. I also made that statement  when I announced the government's vision of a welfare society.  I have consistently thought of measures to be taken for a  society of senior citizens. Certainly, though, I will not deny  that the national welfare tax was announced in a sudden and  hasty manner. I am tasked with tentatively deciding on the  fiscal 1994 budget and compiling the third supplementary budget.  I also have to announce the government's fiscal measures for  local governments. And I have to prepare for Japan-U.S. summit  talks. I made a decision on the national welfare tax under very  difficult circumstances. I do not deny I was hasty in making  the decision. I frankly apologize for my haste. I hope the  people will understand such circumstances.    [Correspondent] Prime Minister, you have repeatedly said  that the process is what is at issue. What is at issue is not  the process. Prime Minister, what you announced to the people  has been reversed, and I think that as the top official in  charge of our nation, you are responsible for that reversal.  Prime Minister, my feeling is you cannot be released from  responsibility by simply saying the process is at issue. Prime  Minister, do you not share my feelings?    [Hosokawa] I have said I will constantly keep the weight of  my remarks as prime minister in mind. Although I am sorry for  repeating my statement, my coalition government is the first  full-fledged coalition government Japan has had. There have  been various discussions. I announced the national welfare tax  not as the coalition government's proposal, but as my own  proposal. My proposal has not been accepted by the ruling  coalition parties and I would like to offer my frank apology on  that point. I intend to resolve the tax issue on the basis of  the agreement reached among the ruling coalition parties.    [Correspondent] As the Japan-U.S. summit meeting is to be  held on 11 February, do you think the United States will rate  the tax cut plan highly even though the legislation on the  6-trillion-yen tax cut will be effective for only one year?    [Hosokawa] I think the United States will rate the tax cut  plan highly.    [Correspondent] It seems from what has been said so far that  you admit the previous decisionmaking process was faulty, but  feel this was an issue which required the approval of the ruling  coalition parties. Contradicting what you have said since you  referred the tax issue to the Tax Commission, you eventually  came up with the idea of the national welfare tax. As we look  at the problem, it seems questionable whether thorough  discussion has actually ever been held among the ruling  coalition parties, considering the course of events that lead to  your making such an announcement. For example, even Chief  Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who happens to be here,  said he was unaware of your decision until the last minute. Do  you intend to change this manner of decisionmaking? This is the  first question, and here is another. It has been revealed the  tax cuts will be not be permanent. I feel the truth is that the  real problem has been shelved because the legislation is  effective for only one year. Anyhow, as there will be a  6-trillion-yen revenue shortfall due to the planned tax cut, you  say that necessary steps will be taken to secure a definite  source of revenue to make up such shortfalls and that a drastic  reform of the tax system will be implemented by the year-end.  Are we to understand that you intend to sincerely stake your  political future on carrying this out by the year-end to fulfill  your responsibility to the people?    [Hosokawa] I shall answer the latter question first. The  government and the ruling coalition parties will make concerted  efforts to reform the current tax system. I believe the passage  of tax system reform legislation, within the period I have  promised to the public, is the fulfillment of my most important  political responsibility. As for what I think of the  decisionmaking process, I must frankly admit that this is a  rather difficult matter. Even yesterday, as a result of the  situation, I held discussions on the tax issue with the chief  cabinet minister and others. Getting down to business, we asked  each other what steps could be taken. In form, there are  various forums, such as a meeting of secretaries general on  policy affairs. However, we have here five secretaries general.  This is different from the situation in which a single party is  in power: Then there is only one secretary general, one general  council chairman, and one policy research council chairman. In  our case, there are five policy research council chairmen, five  general council chairmen, and five secretaries general. Matters  must be cleared at these various levels. I am amazed by the  difficulties we face. Frankly speaking, I realize we must  correct these problems as much as possible.    [Correspondent] You mentioned the term political  responsibility. I would like to confirm that this means you  intend to resign from your post as prime minister?    [Hosokawa] No, I did not say that. I said that for the  government and ruling coalition parties to try to their utmost  to fulfill their roles constitutes fulfillment of political  responsibility.    [Correspondent] Is this what you refer to as the prime  minister's responsibility?    [Hosokawa] As I have just said, it is nothing more than  that. I believe that to put all our efforts into this and get  tax measures implemented would satisfy the expectations of the  people.    [Correspondent] The Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]  has taken quite a hard-line stance on the tax issue, even  threatening to break away from the coalition government. As the  breakaway failed to materialize this time, does it mean that in  the future no party within the coalition will ever take steps  toward this end?    [Hosokawa] I do not know about that. We cannot tell what  kind of problems may arise in the future, nor what kind of  approach each party will take on the various problems. In each  case, parties will have to make self-sacrifices. I believe the  ruling coalition parties will make every effort to hold  themselves together in the future. It is my earnest desire that  we all try to do this.    [Correspondent] Prime Minister, ever since your  inauguration you have advocated consumer-oriented policies and  politics geared toward the people. However, this time we have  the impression you have been turning your attention to  Nagata-cho [a district in Tokyo where the Diet building is  located] and Kasumigaseki [a district in Tokyo where government  ministries and agencies are located]. Does this not run  contrary to your principles?    [Hosokawa] I feel taxes are certainly an issue that draws  strong public interest. However, as I have repeatedly said, I  question whether it is correct to maintain a tax system which  deprives people of their desire to work while in the prime of  their lives. In order to construct an aging society which is  full of vitality, I think everyone of us needs to share  necessary burdens. Otherwise society as such will cease to exist  in the future. In this regard, we have to say things which  people do not want to hear, though of course it is true that  sovereignty resides with the people. We must all have a common  understanding and determination to construct a new society. I  believe politicians should say this to the people in a  straightforward manner.    [Correspondent] Do you not think that a willingness to  discuss this with the people is important?    [Hosokawa] That is correct.    [Correspondent] Do you not think that the people disapproved  of your unilateral announcement, and that the manner in which  you made the announcement was the issue of debate?    [Hosokawa] Regarding that point, as I have said before, I  feel a thorough discussion has not been held. However, the tax  commission is an organization which consists of experts  representing the people. I asked the tax commission in early  September -- 3 September -- to study how to establish a tax  system that is well-balanced regarding consumer capital and  income. Moreover, I had parties hold discussions on the issue  within their respective intraparty organizations. Therefore, I  feel a certain amount of time has been spent on studying the  issue. However, I also agree that more time should be spent on  it.    [Correspondent] Looking back at recent movements, we get  the impression that the Ministry of Finance holds strong power  within the government. You have launched various reform plans,  and now it seems you will have to start changing the ministries  and agencies. We are uncertain about your reform plans.    [Hosokawa] I often hear that. However, it is not correct.  Needless to say, the financial authorities have their own ideas.  But even during the recent events, the financial authorities  have hardly had a chance to talk to me directly, except  yesterday or the day before when I asked the minister of finance  and other financial authorities to come to the official  residence. I instructed them to listen to the opinions of the  coalition parties and cooperate with them in ironing out our  differences. The Ministry of Finance did not insist on their  demands or try to steamroll us. In a sense, it is natural for  them to say no to what they cannot accept; their stance is  natural. Otherwise they cannot fulfill their responsibilities  as financial authorities. I think the important thing is for  politicians to take the lead or give guidance to the financial  authorities, while also giving consideration to their opinions.    [Correspondent] You have mentioned several times the  government's Tax System Research Council as an example that you  have spent enough time on discussions. But the Tax System  Research Council is a government organization, and its members  were not elected by the people. When it came to tax issues  while it was in power, the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] spent  forever on discussions with the party. To the bureaucrats, it  might have appeared a very inefficient process of flattering and  pacifying the voters by merely listening to their complaints.  However, this time the process of discussion was reported by  the media, so the people were able to pinpoint the problems.  They were able to think along with the politicians. Prime  Minister, do you think the LDP's endless discussions within the  party were inefficient?    [Hosokawa] Well, I do not know. As I said earlier, the  coalition administration is still in the stage of trial and  error, and is trying to find an ideal way of carrying out  discussions not only on the tax issue but also on other matters  as well. I also said there may be many points which we need to  continue to improve. The Policy Board is studying the tax  system. We are also talking about the possibility of forming an  organ which is similar to the LDP's Tax System Research Council.  We will try to form such an organ after reaching a consensus  among the coalition parties.    Any more questions?    [Dean of Press Corps] Do you have any more questions?</p>

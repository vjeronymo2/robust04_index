Shapiro, who  performed the operation at Sherman Oaks Community Hospital.  </P> <P> "He faces a period of rehabilitation. Although it is too soon to comment on his  return, Ed is highly motivated and we believe it is possible for him to play  basketball again," Shapiro said.  </P> <P> The 6-foot-8 O'Bannon suffered the injury during a pickup game at UCLA on Oct.  9.  </P> <P> He is expected to be sidelined for at least a year.  </P></p>

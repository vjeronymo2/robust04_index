			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Philippines plans more state sell-offs THE Philippine government plans to auction off a majority stake in two more large state groups - National Steel Corporation and Duty-Free Philippines. This follows the success of its recent privatisation projects, involving Philippine Airlines (PAL) and Philippine National Bank. Mr Jesus Estanislao, the finance secretary, disclosed that the government planned to sell 51 per cent of National Steel Corporation and Duty-Free Philippines before the administration of President Corazon Aquino ends its term of office on June 30. An estimated 4bn pesos (Pounds 96m) could be generated from the sale of National Steel, which is controlled by the state National Development Company. Another 1bn pesos could be generated from Duty-Free Philippines. The possibility of selling off Manila Hotel is also being considered, according to Mr Estanislao. The five-star hotel is owned by the Government Service Insurance System, a state-run retirement and welfare fund for public-sector employees. The government last week turned over majority ownership of PAL to PR Holdings, a consortium of local business groups.</p>

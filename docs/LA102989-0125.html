			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: A FEW OF HER DAD'S UNFAVORITE THINGS  </P> <P> My father has always been hard to buy for.  </P> <P> If anyone in the family even has a clue as to what to get for his birthday or  Christmas, we guard it like the last soft cream in a Whitman's Sampler.  </P> <P> When he became less active, the choices became fewer and fewer. I was down to  peanut brittle, a subscription to TV Guide and cute coffee mugs when I came up  with the idea of a canary to keep him company. I knew it would bring joy to his  passive life.  </P> <P> The bird drove him nuts. According to my father, it chirped and dropped  disgusting things from its body on a paper all day. I told him the bird did not  demand an audience to evaluate it and applaud every minute.  </P> <P> Then one day the bird stopped chirping and that drove him up the wall too. My  father said he knew it was something he did. It only sang when "Santa Barbara"  came on, and annoyed my mother.  </P> <P> Somehow, I thought the zap gun for bugs was a winner. I saw it in the drugstore  and figured it was a marriage made in heaven. My dad hates crickets, and he  hates to get out of his chair to swat them. This was a little plastic gun with  a string and a cork attached so that when you pulled the trigger, it zapped  anything two or three feet away.  </P> <P> For the first few months, my dad shouted, "Make my day!" and let loose with his  new secret weapon with regularity. But eventually the novelty of the toy wore  off.  </P> <P> Recently, I entered a store and saw before me a field of dancing flowers  (batteries not included). They were activated by sound . . . preferably a loud  rock 'n' roll beat. Aloud, I said: "My father needs this."  </P> <P> When he took it out of the box, he looked at the 12-inch potted blossom wearing  sunglasses and clutching a saxophone in its leaves and said, "That's nice." I  said, "Wait a minute! It dances!" Call me crazy, but as I watched him stare at  the flower gyrating, I had the feeling this pastime would never replace the  Chicago Cubs.  </P> <P> The challenge to present him with a gift that will get his attention goes on.  I'll come up with something. I always do. As I dried the dishes after the  flower fiasco, one of my kids wandered into the kitchen and picked up a mug I  had given my dad last Christmas. It showed a pregnant girl saying, "I forgot my  pill." I explained to my son that when I gave it to his grandfather, it had a  special meaning for him. My son just looked at me. Maybe it was a bit of a  stretch.  </P></p>

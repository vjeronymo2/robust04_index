			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / International Company News: Merck executive to head Upjohn Mr John Zabriskie, executive vice-president and head of manufacturing at the US drugs group Merck, is leaving the company to take over as chairman and chief executive of Upjohn, a chief rival. The appointment ends the search for a new Upjohn chief executive that began last April, when the previous chairman and chief executive, Mr Theodore Cooper, died of cancer. The company said last night Mr Ley Smith, Upjohn chief operating officer, would continue to serve as interim chief executive until the 54-year-old Mr Zabriskie assumed his duties in the new year. Mr Zabriskie said yesterday he was sad to leave Merck after 28 years, but that the 'opportunity to lead a company in my own right became an irresistible challenge'. News of the appointment was warmly received by investors and analysts, and Upjohn's shares rose Dollars  5/8 to close at Dollars 31 1/8 on the New York Stock Exchange. Mr Joseph Riccardo, an analyst with the Wall Street broking house Bear Stearns, hailed Upjohn's choice. 'John Zabriskie is a seasoned pharmaceuticals executive who had a very good career at Merck. He is a good manager and leader and will be a valuable asset to Upjohn.' Mr Zabriskie's main challenge at Upjohn will be to steer the company through what could be a difficult transition. Although it has some promising products under development, Upjohn faces the expiration of US patents on several of its leading drugs; new legislation affecting the tax charge for its Puerto Rican manufacturing facilities; and a healthcare environment that President Clinton's planned reforms have turned increasingly hostile. The departure of Mr Zabriskie, meanwhile, clouds the issue of who will succeed Mr Roy Vagelos as chairman and chief executive of the world's largest drugs group when he retires next year.</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / ICL and Fujitsu form three joint ventures FUJITSU operations in the US and Europe will come under the direct control of ICL, the Japanese electronics group's UK-based subsidiary, when the two companies establish three joint ventures later this year. The move, the result of an ICL initiative, marks a deepening of the trust between the two companies which began with a technology agreement in 1981 and progressed to Fujitsu taking an 80 per cent stake in ICL in 1990. Establishment of the new companies is also being interpreted as a way of underlining ICL's managerial independence from its majority shareholder as it moves towards flotation on the London market. Fujitsu is expected to reduce its shareholding to 51 per cent within three years as a result of the flotation; ICL is expected to announce its choice of bankers and financial advisers this quarter. Fujitsu and ICL are planning to launch on April 1 this year: Fujitsu-ICL Systems in North America. The company will be owned 80 per cent by ICL, 20 per cent by Fujitsu and will be under ICL's management. It will comprise ICL's existing North and South American retail systems business and Fujitsu's retail systems, automated teller machines and hand-held terminals operations together with Fujitsu's customer service business. The company, based in Dallas, will have about 2,000 employees and sales of Dollars 350m (Pounds 200m). ICL Inc, the separate US operation, will continue to sell industry standard systems to legal and federal government customers. Fujitsu Systems Business - Europe. The Bracknell-based company, which will be wholly-owned by ICL and under ICL's control, will support European customers for Fujitsu's large mainframes and supercomputers. Most of these are subsidiaries of Japanese companies. Fujitsu Australia, under Fujitsu management, will combine all that region's operations of Fujitsu and ICL. Fujitsu will have 80 per cent of the equity and it will have a turnover of about Dollars 300m. There will be about 1,900 employees. ICL has worldwide revenues of about Dollars 4bn and has been the only consistently profitable European computer manufacturer over the past few years. Fujitsu's sales now total more than Dollars 21bn making it second to IBM among information technology companies.</p>

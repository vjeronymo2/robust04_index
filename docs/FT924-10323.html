			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Consumer demand likely to weaken even further: The Economy JAPAN'S consumer spending, already weak, may fall further according to government figures published yesterday which show the labour market's health is deteriorating. Employers' demand for labour is falling fast with job offers barely matching the number of applicants. The ratio of job offers to job seekers fell to 1.01 in September, which means that for every 100 people looking for a job there were 101 vacancies. Officials expect the index, which peaked at 1.47 in March last year, could fall to as low as 0.90 as the economic downturn takes its toll on employment. The gathering slowdown in the job market is likely to depress personal income and consumption over the next year, putting additional pressure on the government to consider an income tax cut in the 1993 budget. Overtime working at companies which employ more than 30 people fell by 16.5 per cent to 11.7 hours in September, the largest fall since June 1975 when the economy was in the midst of a recession provoked by the rise in world oil prices. Overtime pay fell by 11.6 per cent and bonuses awarded between June and August rose by only 2.2 per cent. Bonuses account for more than a quarter of the average pay packet. The government was cheered by a 10.4 per cent rise in housing starts in September to 123,224 units. This second monthly increase, after a 12 per cent rise in September, reflects the efforts of the public sector Housing Loan Corporation to revive the market. However the property market remains depressed, particularly in urban areas, with starts on condominium blocks down 26.3 per cent. Orders placed with the top 50 construction companies fell by 15.6 per cent to Y11,493bn in the six months to September, the worst fall since 1975. The government will be encouraged by signs that inflation is falling, adding weight to calls for further interest rate cuts. Consumer prices in Tokyo rose at an annual rate of only 1.1 per cent last month, down from 2.2 per cent in September.</p>

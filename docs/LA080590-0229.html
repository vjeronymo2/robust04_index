			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> U.S. PROMINENCE IN WORLD AGRICULTURE MARKET EBBING;  </P> <P> TRADE: IN THE GLOBAL FOOD ARENA, EXPERTS SAY, THE COUNTRY HAS LOST ITS CORNER  ON TECHNOLOGY AND KNOWLEDGE.  </P> <P> Technology has been a major reason for the United States' success in the world  agriculture market, but this country risks losing its prominence, experts said  recently at a conference.  </P> <P> "The day has passed when American agriculture had a lock on the world  marketplace for food," U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter said.  </P> <P> He joined international food experts, scholars and businessmen in Indianapolis  recently to discuss global food trends during the 1990s at a conference  sponsored by the conservative think tank Hudson Institute.  </P> <P> The United States held 35% of the value of world trade in bulk agriculture  commodities in 1988, Yeutter said, but in intermediate products such as flours  and vegetable fats, the U.S. share dropped to 18%. Among consumer-oriented  agriculture products, such as processed fruits, cut flowers and bakery  products, American farmers have less than a 6% stake.  </P> <P> In the past year, Eastern Europe has begun moving toward free market systems.  That won't help American farmers, but it may be a windfall for food processors,  one analyst said.  </P> <P> Richard Judy, a Soviet specialist at the Hudson Institute, said there will be a  demand for companies involved in food processing and marketing.  </P> <P> One of them is Central Soya, based in Ft. Wayne, Ind. Since January, it has  formed joint ventures with Hungary's state-owned agribusiness concern to  produce livestock feed and with a Yugoslav company to produce soybean  concentrates used in meat processing.  </P> <P> Bioprocessing represents another opportunity. Genetically engineered  microorganisms will be used to produce food, fuel, industrial feedstocks and  commodity chemicals from corn, sugar cane and other crops, said John R.  Campbell, president of Oklahoma State University.  </P> <P> However, such products may meet with resistance, including consumer fears.  </P> <P> "Technology has been one of the major reasons for the success in American  agriculture," said John Urbanchek, senior vice president for economics in the  Washington office of consulting firm Hill and Knowlton Inc.  </P> <P> "The problem is that the contribution of current technology is being rapidly  exhausted and must be replaced if the United States is to retain its prominence  as an agricultural producer and exporter, and to continue to supply American  consumers with high-quality, safe and reasonably priced food," he said.  </P></p>

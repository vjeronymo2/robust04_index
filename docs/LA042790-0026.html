			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE LITTLE LIBRARY THAT COULD  </P> <P> It is comforting to know that residents of one mid-city Los Angeles  neighborhood are arguing vehemently with City Hall because of a library.  </P> <P> The city proposes building a new library because the area's 64-year-old  Washington Irving branch, a historic Romanesque Revival-style building, does  not meet earthquake standards.  </P> <P> Yet the city must satisfy conflicting neighborhood interests in deciding  whether to upgrade the old library or build a new one. As more old buildings  fail to meet safety codes, it's a decision the city will face repeatedly.  </P> <P> To many, the Washington Irving branch library on Arlington Avenue is a place  that nurtures an all-too-rare neighborhood feeling. It provides a stabilizing  influence. Residents of the slowly gentrifying West Adams area might not always  agree on such contentious issues as whether a spacious Craftsman house should  be restored as a one-family dwelling or, more pragmatically, used to house  several families. But neighborhood differences get left at the door of a  library, where all types of people go in peaceful and learned pursuits.  </P> <P> It's thus not surprising that some residents want the branch building to be  renovated and remain a library. But city administrators rightly point out that  more space is needed in order to accommodate more books and computers.  Otherwise the library named for the author of "Rip Van Winkle" might find that  it, too, is years behind the times.  </P> <P> The city proposes a more complete and modern library that would be just 13  blocks away, currently the site of a carwash. This makes sense. So would  upgrading the historic building that houses the present branch, perhaps as a  community center -- where that "neighborhood" feeling it now encourages would  continue to be nurtured.  </P></p>

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Arts: Today's Television Complaints that the BBC is going downmarket with its classical music policy in order to compete with Classic FM, the new commercial radio network, look a bit odd in the light of tonight's broadcasting. At 7.00 in Proms 1992 Radio 3 begins a live relay from the Albert Hall of a concert which includes Handel and Beethoven concertos, and in the second half music by Schnittke and Mozart. At 10.00, again live from the Albert Hall on Radio 3, the BBC offers one of its late Proms. Then at 10.20, in Proms On One, BBC television shows a recording from last Sunday's Prom with violinist Dmitry Sitkovetsky and cellist Mischa Maisky playing the Brahms Double Concerto. We shall be fortunate indeed on the day that commercial broadcasters organise three concerts like that. Radio 4 also offers a live programme: Call To Account (8.05) in which Sir John Quinton, chairman of Barclays, Peter Ellwood, chief executive of TSB, Kevin Newman, chief executive of First Direct, and Tony FitzSimons, chief executive of Bristol and West, respond to questions and complaints about high street banking from an audience in the Victoria Rooms, Bristol.</p>

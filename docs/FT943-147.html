			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / UK Company News: S African leak in ConsGold bid run-up - DTI says majority of dealings in call options were 'wholly abnormal' Leaked information from South Africa led to insider trading in options on Consolidated Gold Fields shares ahead of the Pounds 2.9bn bid from Minorco in 1988. That is one of the main conclusions of the Department of Trade and Industry report on the ownership of Consolidated Gold Fields, published yesterday. The report, which runs to more than 600 pages before hitting lengthy appendices, and weighs almost 2 kilogrammes, finds nothing wrong with dealings in the shares. But it says that 'the majority of dealings in ConsGold call options were wholly abnormal' in the run-up to the fiercely resisted bid from Minorco, 60 per cent owned by Mr Harry Oppenheimer's Anglo American Corporation-De Beers group. By September 21, 1988, when the bid was launched, 81 per cent of the effective long position in call options was held by five investor groups. The inspectors - Philip Heslop QC and Richard Lewis, chartered accountant - 'are in no doubt' that a leak about the bid took place in South Africa in mid-June at the latest. Dealings on the London traded options market followed, first from Johannesburg, and then from London itself and elsewhere. The five investor groups made profits of Pounds 11m on an initial outlay of about Pounds 5.5m. By far the biggest group, with 56 per cent of the call options in question, is known in the report as The Foundations. This group operated via a Liechtenstein bank which placed its business through Savory Milln, a subsidiary of Swiss Bank Corporation - the lead financier to Minorco's bid. It made Pounds 4.26m from the options dealings, which were described by one expert as 'kamikaze trading.' After inquiries which ranged round the world, including offshore banking centres such as the Cayman and Channel Islands, the inspectors were unable to identify the owners of The Foundations. But they are convinced that South African interests were closely involved. 'We consider that the South African authorities are best placed and perhaps the only people who can identify the beneficiaries of The Foundations' traded options deals,' they conclude. However, the report finds no evidence to suggest that the original leak was deliberate so far as Minorco, Anglo American, De Beers or the interests of the Oppenheimer family were concerned. Minorco, which already owned 29.9 per cent of ConsGold ahead of the bid, is also found not to have had any undisclosed interests in its target. Neither was it under any obligation to make any disclosure under company law. The inspectors assert that they have probably been able to ascertain more about the Oppenheimer family's interests, which they describe as historically 'shrouded in mystery,' than any previous inquiry. While they were unable to verify the full extent of the interests, there was no evidence of any build up in ConsGold shares between December 1987 and May 1989, nor of 'any destabilisation of ConsGold's share register which could be attributed directly or in-directly to the Oppenheimer interests.' The inquiry was originally prompted by ConsGold's public statement that the possible outcome of the bid had been crucially affected by the destabilisation of its share register, a month ahead of the bid.</p>

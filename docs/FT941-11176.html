			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / International Company News: Telmex profits disappoint Telefonos de Mexico, Mexico's largest private company, lifted net profits by 4.5 per cent in real terms last year, to 9bn pesos (Dollars 2.9bn), writes David Luhnow in Mexico City. But the results of the telephone monopoly failed to meet analysts' expectations, largely because of a fourth-wuarter 250m-peso write-off on obsolete equipment. Analysts estimated the company's earnings were about Dollars 1.40 per American depositary receipt for the fourth quarter, and Dollars 5.47 a share for the year, against Dollars 4.84 for 1992. Net sales were 24.6bn pesos during 1993, up 10 per cent from 22.4bn pesos in 1992. Operating income amounted to 10.28bn pesos for the year, also up 10 per cent.</p>

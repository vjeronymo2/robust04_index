			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Roger Cowe report: "Buoyant BP Plans British Gas Link-up"] </F>   [Text] The oil company, BP, is contemplating international  exploration joint ventures with British Gas. The BP chief  executive, David Simon, said yesterday that under its new  leadership British Gas was more open to new ideas, including  joint investment in new ventures.    He said the gas company had excellent pipeline technology  which would fit well with BP's exploration expertise. "It's high  time we worked together."    He added that he knew the British Gas chairman Sir Richard  Giordano well, because they were both members of the Grand  Metropolitan board.    Mr Simon was commenting after announcing a surprise leap in  profits and a shock dividend increase for the first quarter of  the year.    On the normal historic cost basis, pre-tax profits fell from  700 million pounds in the first quarter last year to 577 million  pounds. But this was due to losses on oil stocks because of the  fall in oil prices. On a replacement cost basis excluding these  stock factors, the operating profits rose from 585 million  pounds to 601 million pounds.    Lower interest costs following the heavy debt reduction  programme also helped to stimulate cash flows, which showed a  net inflow of 461 million pounds, including more than 100  million pounds from selling businesses.    Encouraged by the recovery in profits and cash flows despite  the low oil price, the BP board decided to increase the dividend  for the first time since it was cut dramatically in the summer  of 1992. A 20 per cent increase pleased investors, and the  company's share price rose by 16.5p [pence] during the day.    Mr Simon was keen to stress that this rate of increase could  not be expected in future quarters, however. "It has been an  encouraging quarter," he said. He denied that BP had been under  pressure from shareholding institutions to increase the dividend.    BP's surprisingly buoyant results were due to a spectacular  leap in profits from its UK operations, due partly to higher  production of gas from the company's UK fields. UK profits, on  the replacement cost basis, soared from 105 million pounds in  the first quarter of last year, to 306 mi11ion pounds this time.    Most of this profit came from oil and gas production, but UK  refining and marketing moved from a small loss to profit of 41  pounds million. The chemical operations reversed a 19 million  loss to a profit of the same amount.    U.S. production profit slumped because of maintenance work  on  Alaskan wells, but U.S. refining and marketing moved into profit.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nasir Shararah] </F>   [Excerpt] According to well-informed political sources,  Samir Ja'ja' [commander of the defunct Lebanese Forces] will be  served with an arrest warrant within two weeks.    Legally an arrest warrant is no proof of guilt. But in this  particular case such a warrant will indicate that the judiciary  is virtually convinced of Ja'ja''s involvement in the bombing of  Sayyidat al-Najat Church.    The fact that no warrant has been served on Ja'Ja' yet, the  sources say, does not mean that his name did not come up during  the investigations or that there are no grounds for indicting  him.    The reason that no such warrant has been issued, the sources  add, is because of the technical and security peculiarities of  the case, as well as certain political and psychological  considerations.    While mere suspicion would normally suffice for serving  arrest warrants, both the judiciary and the Lebanese state are  hesitant to issue such a warrant in this case without backing it  with conclusive evidence, according to the same sources.

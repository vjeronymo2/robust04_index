			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sophon Wichitkon, president of the textile group of  the Thai Industries Council, says the increase in the minimum  wage for Bangkok and surrounding areas from 125 to 132 baht, or  5.6 percent, will have an impact on the apparel industry, which  uses a lot of manual labor. He anticipates that investors who  were planning to move production bases to Vietnam and China will  implement their moves quickly. The current daily wage in China  is about 40 baht, about the same as in Vietnam.    Sophon said the new wage may force small apparel factories  to  close. The medium-sized plants may have to replace their work  force with machines. He said only factories catering to lower  markets will be forced to consider moving their bases.  Factories catering to higher markets use a skilled work force  and will therefore remain in Thailand.    Sophon said: "The new wage increase does not mean that the  price of clothes will follow suit. The factories will have to  bear the burden and try to cut costs to compete in foreign  markets."    Krungthep Thopha Factory manager Phongsak Atsakun says every  industry will be affected by the new wage increase, particularly  industries that are labor-intensive. They will be forced to  move to countries with lower wages or replace their work force  with machines. The textile industry now employs about 1 million  workers.    Kanyong Electric Company manager Praphat Phoworakun said the  electric appliance industry is not likely to be affected by the  new wage because its work force is not big. He feels that the  new minimum wage suits the current economy, though, and notes  that the new wage increase will impact differently on different  industries.</p>

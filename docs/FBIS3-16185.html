			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Riga, Mar 12, BNS -- The Latvian Popular Front and  the Homeland and Freedom association staged a rally Saturday [12  March] at the Doms square in Riga protesting against the  temporary operation of the former Soviet military radar  installation at Skrunda.    The round of Latvian-Russian interstate talks, scheduled for  March 14, can turn out to be the last meeting on troop  withdrawal, speakers said.    The delegations are expected to sign an interstate treaty  according to which Russia withdraws its troops from Latvia by  Aug. 31 but Latvia allows it control the Skrunda radar for five  and a half years.    The Popular Front has sent the government several  resolutions  urging to not to agree with Russia on such conditions. The  front's stance is shared by all nationally-oriented political  organizations, said its Deputy Chairman Juris Kokins.    Kokins described the rally as the last means that his  organization uses to attain quicker dismantling of the radar  station.    In the opinion of the front's specialists, Russia needs the  radar not as a technical installation but as a military base  where it could keep its troops and what could be used for  various political purposes, Kokins said.    The existence of a like military base on the Latvian soil is  unacceptable to the international public opinion. In accordance  with U.N. resolutions, Russia must get its troops out of Latvia  speedily, orderly and completely.    Kokins conceded that the rally could serve to raise the  front's political prestige what is important in view of the  coming local government elections. The front, however, does not  cherish great hopes for successful performance in the election,  Kokins said.    The rally was attended by around 1,000 people holding  slogans, like "Russia -- the World's Greatest Racketeer -- Wants  to Abduct Latvia" and "Skrunda is Occupation Military Base."</p>

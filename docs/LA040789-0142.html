			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BORDER PATROL FINDS 249 KILOS OF COCAINE IN CAR  </P> <P> U.S. Border Patrol agents at the San Onofre checkpoint south of San Clemente  opened the trunk of 1982 Oldsmobile on Thursday and found it filled to the brim  with nearly pure cocaine -- 249 kilograms of it.  </P> <P> "It filled the trunk. The lid was down, but there was no cover over it at all,"  said Harold Ezell, western regional commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and  Naturalization Service. Ezell said the value of the cocaine was estimated at $4  million, with an estimated street value of up to $35 million. The cocaine is  cut before street sale to increase its value.  </P> <P> The driver, identified as Felipe Santiago Moran-Pallan, 22, of Huntington Park,  was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to distribute illegal  drugs. Ezell said the suspect was being held at Metropolitan Correction Center  in San Diego.  </P> <P> Dale Cozart, chief patrol agent of San Diego sector of U.S. Border Patrol, said  three agents were involved in the arrest.  </P> <P> "It was a very hot day at this checkpoint, almost 100 degrees," Cozart said.  "We're very pleased these agents were able to put the heat on this narcotics  smuggler. They did an excellent job."  </P></p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mali hopes for return of golden age - One of the great unexplored gold prospects GOLD MADE the ancient empire of Mali one of the richest in the world. And now, six centuries later, West Africa is seen by mining companies as one of the world's great unexplored gold prospects. Carbon dating of pottery fragments found in ancient workings at Syama in the far south of Mali, near the border with the Ivory Coast, indicate that oxide ore was worked 740-400 years ago. BHP Minerals International, the first major exploration and production company to establish a presence in the region's gold fields, is negotiating with the Malian government before making a final decision on an additional Dollars 70m investment in Syama. Syama will yield 2.5 tonnes of gold this year and is expected to produce 3 tonnes for the next two years. Then, the company, which up to now has been shifting dirt, will hit hard rock. The new investment will extend the life of the main open cast mine, 1 km long and 330 metres across, by up to 20 years, while exploratory drills at a further half a dozen satellite sites have indicated promising reserves. Total reserves at Syama have been estimated at 80 tonnes. The Australian-based multinational is investing a further Dollars 5.5m a year on minerals exploration in West Africa as a whole, and in Mali, Ghana and the Ivory Coast in particular. BHP, among the world's largest minerals companies, has already invested Dollars 40m in the pit in the three years since the signing of the exploration agreement. The initial lease covered an area of 1,500 sq km, now slightly reduced. The production agreement covers 20 sq km. The average concentration of gold is currently 3.1 grams per tonne of ore. But each day 13,000 tonnes of dirt is excavated from the main pit, of which only 3,000 tonnes is processed through the mill. 'To justify our investment in management and infrastructure in West Africa, BHP has to plan for a series of productive sites in the region,' says Mr Daniel Johnson, mine manager at Syama. 'Syama is of huge significance for Mali as its first, and so far only, large scale commercial venture into gold mining using modern techniques. But for BHP it has to be seen in the context of a turnover last year of Dollars 10bn.' Syama by itself is also small in a regional context. For Mali, it represents 6 per cent of GDP. In Ghana, it would be considered a small to medium-sized operation. Nevertheless, Mali is believed to have considerable, as yet unexplored potential, similar to that of Ghana. Mali has been bypassed by the major exploration companies, partly because of the difficulties of detecting deposits, generally covered by thick layers of laterite. Its poor infrastructure has been another factor  - for example, industrial consumers pay 5 cents per kw hour for electricity in Ghana compared with 25 cents in Mali. The gold has to be transported long distances as Mali is landlocked  - BHP flys it first to Bamako, then to Brussels, and finally to Geneva. Mali's government ministries have been considered to be among the least well-informed in the region. But things are changing. The United Nations Development Programme recently completed an Dollars 8m, 12-year project to give the country its own centre of expertise in minerals. UNDP's first involvement in Mali's mineral sector dates back to 1979, when it located early traces of mining. That provided the justification for heavier involvement in exploration, and training of Malians. It was during this phase that the Syama deposit was uncovered. During the follow up, UNDP and the UN Department for Technical Co-operation for Development, helped the Malian government negotiate and finalise the agreement with BHP. The Malians struck what appears to be a favourable deal at Syama, and it is one they are already starting to tighten up. In future, the government is expected to take 6 per cent royalties, and a 20 per cent stake. Taxation on profits will be levied at 45 per cent. UNDP soon realised that the Malians themselves could take care of some exploration at least. It financed teams to provide on-the-job training, equipment for a geochemical laboratory and assistance with drilling. PDRM  - the Programme pour le Developement de Resources Minerales  - has already carried out contracts for analytical work, drilling, digging shafts and the analysis of geological samples. Minerals experts believe that Mali will now benefit considerably from an aerial geophysical data set for the south and west of the country as a back-up to surface mapping carried out by the Belgians, French and the UN, much of it from the 1960s. BHP is itself concerned to transfer as much expertise as possible to Malians. For example, it already has ten West African exploration geologists working in the region. The company expects to start making a net return on its Syama investment by the end of this next year. Operating costs at Syama are thought to be in the range of Dollars 200 to Dollars 250 a troy ounce, while the gold price has fallen from over Dollars 400 to Dollars 340 an ounce since Syama went into full scale production last year. The feasibility study, on which the Syama investment was based, assumed a price of Dollars 400 an ounce at 1988 exchange rates. Elsewhere in Mali, the French Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres has a concession on a deposit at Loulo, the west of the country. Here it is negotiating a joint venture with the government and an as yet undisclosed third party. These beds contain some 30 tonnes of gold to a depth of 100 metres, with between five and 10 grams of gold to every tonne of ore. Mali will be hoping that it turns out to be more successful than its first joint venture. The Kalana mine, which has gold reserves of 30 tonnes, and the first large scale deposit to be exploited, was opened in 1984 and mined with Soviet assistance. Officially, it was producing about 2 tonnes of gold a year. It has just closed, amid rumours that much of the production bypassed official channels and was shared out by the country's now disgraced former president, Moussa Traore, ousted in a coup in March last year, and the Soviets. Most of what was left is said to have been exchanged by the government for Soviet military hardware, much of it now useless with no-one to service it or provide spare parts since the end of Soviet expansionism in Africa.</p>

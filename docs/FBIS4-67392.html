			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Janni Andreassen: "Green Taxes Will Hit the </F> Gluttons"]    [Text] Environment: Industry will get an increasing share  of green taxes. Seen from an economic point of view, this is not  a catastrophe, according to a lecturer in social economics.    Green taxes will change attitudes toward consumption and  resources. It will be expensive to use unnecessary energy. Seen  in another way, if Mr. and Mrs. Jensen absolutely must lie in a  heated water bed, then they must pay more than the rest of us  who remain on a mattress and slats.    With the government's tax reform of the summer of 1993 it  will be the housekeepers who will notice the green taxes.    Now a committee across party lines is sitting to put the  finishing touches on the details of a proposal in which it will  be industry's turn to pay taxes that will provide an income of  about 3 billion kroner over a period of a few years.    All industry has been against the tax, arguing that the  medicine can be so strong that it knocks the patient for a loop.    "But seen from an economic point of view, green taxes are  not  a catastrophe for industry," Jesper Jespersen, a lecturer in  social economics at Roskilde University Center, says.    "What industry can fear is that the government may rapidly  introduce higher taxes without any form of repayment to  industrial firms. This would create problems. Therefore I also  think that the government's signal to industry should have been  clearer so that everyone would understand that the introduction  of green taxes is something that is coming but that at the same  time requires a long-run strategy."  <H5>  Green Success </H5>   Japan is the history of a green success. But it didn't look  like this 20 years ago, when the country was about to choke in  environmental problems. The energy crisis in the 1970's came to  Japan's rescue. Instead of letting the gas-guzzler stay in the  garage and riding a bicycle to the baker, the Japanese developed  the technology for a small, environmentally friendly, compact  car.    Today the Japanese have overcome their problems in resources  and environment with very tough taxes. This has not meant any  economic catastrophe. On the contrary, Japan has reduced its  energy consumption to a third of that of the United States,  which means that they are three times more energy efficient.    "In the Danish industrial cost picture, energy makes up  today  about 3 percent. Therefore, for example, a doubling of the price  will not be an cost catastrophe."    ``But industry must have the necessary time for the change  so  that in its investment plans it can take into account that  energy has become more expensive, that to a greater extent than  before more must be invested in energy-saving machines and in  the necessary preparation for production."    ``If in addition, political care is taken to connect the  green proceeds to the development of resource and energy saving  technologies, this will contribute to an increase in the rate of  industrial change so that in reality businesses will not be  particularly burdened economically. They will simply have some  earlier costs that would have come anyway and that they would  have had to pay just the same.''  <H5>  Question of Style </H5>   Will green taxes primarily be used to change attitudes and  conduct?    "Green taxes are primarily environmentally regulating. They  must not be used to fill up the national coffers. They are to  hit marginal consumption -- extreme consumption -- both in  industry and in housekeeping. And not, for example, like carbon  dioxide emission, which is screwed together completely  backwards. If you are a little pig in the environment, you must  pay 50 kroner per ton in taxes. If you are a somewhat smaller  pig, you only pay 25 kroner. And if you pig out in high style,  you may have to pay according to the environmental provisions of  industry.    ``One does not get a better environment free."    ``Today most of the environmental taxes are imposed upon  total consumption." That is, we pay the same 50 ore in taxes for  the first and the last kilowatt hour [kwh]."    ``This is falling between two stools. The first kwh that is  used in a company or in a house is a necessity. Without it, we  cannot survive economically or physically. Therefore the tax on  the first part of the consumption is not conduct-regulating,  either. But at the other end it can become so, when you use kwh  to warm up the water bed -- or you don't close the chimney or  replace the energy-consuming bulb with an energy-saving one in  the factory."    ``Fifty ore in tax for the last kwh does not push people  much  in a conduct-regulating direction. But it produces perhaps five  kroner in five years."    ``The important thing is to make people understand the  saving  percentages and green taxes in good time. In five years things  will work fine. In a few years industry can adapt its activity  either by lowering the temperature, rationalizing production, or  by carrying out energy savings. The point is that it must be  expensive not to save where it is possible to do so.''  <H5>  Repayment </H5>   Shall industry have a direct share in the repayment of  profits from the green taxes?    "The ideal competitively would be to give the money back to  the individual businesses. But some companies are more locked  into their methods of production. Even if they get a part of the  profit, it is not certain that they will be able to use it to  save energy. Therefore I would much prefer to give it back on a  branch level, so that the firms that have the possibility of  changing their production structure can have some of the money."    ``In repaying on a branch level, there is always the danger  of being cost-neutral, even if this is not completely correct,  because the moneys originally came from the businesses  themselves. But this must be seen in the light that one is  getting a cleaner environment and possibly also products and  production processes that will be more competitive when energy  prices rise."    ``It is a gamble. But one of the gambles that is less  uncertain."    ``Finally, there is an important difference in the way one  measures the environmental effect. The choice is between  administrative regulation and a market one. In their report of  May of last year, the wise men concluded unanimously that it is  up to seven times cheaper to use the economic instruments,  because they can be adapted to the businesses that can most  easily change their production structure."    ``Whereas if one forces a uniform regulation onto all  businesses, then one forces a costly task upon the ones that  have difficulties in changing.''  <H5>  Danish Solitary Path </H5>   Is the Danish solitary path useful in the environmental  area?    "As far as value growth and consumption possibilities are  concerned, it does not make a lot of difference whether Denmark  alone introduces the carbon dioxide tax or whether it is made  into part of a larger common European action. This is also in  the wise men's report. A coordinated effort will give a little  minus in value growth of 0.3 percent, while an isolated Danish  effort will give a minus of 0.4 percent."    ``It would be a little harder on private consumption, where  a  coordinated effort leads to a fall of 0.3 percent, while an  isolated Danish effort gives a minus of 1.0 percent."    ``Where one considers that consumption is rising by 3  percent  a year at the moment, it is only a third of one single year's  consumption rise that we lose by going our own way."    ``But this is not the impression one gets when one hears  comments from industry and political organizations. They have  simply not digested the results. This is too bad for the wise  men, and it is too bad for the debate.''  <H5>  National Coffers </H5>   What do you think the finance minister means by  conduct-regulating green taxes?    "Conduct-regulating taxes can lead to a cleaner environment  and a less energy-dependent production and consumption. But it  can also be done in a way that makes the finance minister happy."    ``What there is a lot of, namely labor, will be made  cheaper.  And what there is little of, resources, will be made more  expensive."    ``There are not many wage taxes left in Denmark to regulate.  But the gross tax and the earmarked labor market taxes are in  reality the gearshift the finance minister can back up with."    ``He can also use the gearshift to back up with the  withholding tax by saying that the businesses that change their  cost structures do not have to pay all the withheld amount of  worker taxes if they in turn are willing to have resource  consumption be taxed by a corresponding amount."    ``And what's the trick? Well, the finance minister gets just  as much money in his coffers. He eases the tax on the use of  labor and increases it on the resource side."    ``There may be businesses that will have difficulties in  managing a change. Therefore such an arrangement can be done  voluntarily at first."    ``With the great unemployment we have, we must now work on  the environmental sector. This is enough to work on.''</p>

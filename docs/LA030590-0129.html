			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> WILLIS IS 'TALKING' BIG MONEY  </P> <P> Bruce Willis makes a better deal than Donald Trump.  </P> <P> Willis put in only three or four days of work in providing the voice for the  baby in the movie "Look Who's Talking," but it's going to earn him about $10  million even though he's never seen in the film, according to Premiere  magazine.  </P> <P> Instead of a flat salary, Willis agreed to take a percentage of the movie's  gross, and when "Look Who's Talking" became a surprise hit, he reaped a  windfall that's double what he earned for starring in "Die Hard." Premiere says  Willis' take exceeds what it cost to make the movie and is more than the  producers will make.  </P></p>

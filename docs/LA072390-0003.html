			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. NEIL SOLOMON: INTESTINAL DISORDERS  </P> <P> Question: Sometimes the people who write health articles assume the average  reader knows more than he actually does. I've just finished an article about  ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and I can't decide whether they are  different names for the same disease or entirely different diseases.  </P> <P> If they're different, in what way?  </P> <P> Answer: Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are separate disorders.  Ulcerative colitis is a disease that is limited to the colon or large bowel.  Crohn's disease may affect any part of the intestinal tract; however, it often  involves the small bowel. You may occasionally hear Crohn's disease referred to  as ileitis because the ileum (the end of the small intestine) is a common site  of inflammation.  </P> <P> If you have a medical question, write to Dr. Solomon, P.O. Box 36184,  Baltimore, Md. 21285-6184. He cannot give personal replies but will answer as  many questions as possible in his column.  </P></p>

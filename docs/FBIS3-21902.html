			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alvaro Ayala; from the "24 Hours Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff has not let  recent statements by U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno upset him.  Today he indicated that the United States is too thin-skinned  when it comes to legalizing drugs. The prosecutor general said  that U.S. diplomatic officials visited his office and that he  had answered U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno. [Begin recording]    De Greiff: No, no, it was not a matter of them  providing support. It was just to exchange opinions.    Unidentified reporter: Mr. Prosecutor, one last  question. It would seem that your WASHINGTON POST article has  caused quite a frenzy in the United States.    De Greiff: That is correct. I am very sorry that  this has been the case. It would seem that the Americans are  very thin-skinned. [end recording]</p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Forward Technology losses double to Pounds 1.2m EFFECTS OF rationalisation pushed losses at Forward Technology Industries up from Pounds 539,000 to Pounds 1.23m pre-tax for the half-year to June 30. Measures taken were related to the continental European recession, which had affected French and German markets. Those markets account for 50 per cent of group sales. Mr Brian Chilver, chairman, said the company had taken extensive remedial action to reduce costs and personnel and had charged Pounds 800,000 against the opening half's results - the total exceptional costs anticipated for the 1993 year. He pointed out that recession was slowing progress towards 'satisfactory profits' and that this would be inevitably reflected in full-year results. Group turnover for the half-year rose to Pounds 20.1m (Pounds 17.7m). Electronics accounted for Pounds 16.1m, of which Pounds 2.1m (Pounds 13m) related to currency changes. Electronics returned profits of Pounds 223,000 (losses Pounds 53,000) but sound and vision incurred losses of Pounds 58,000 (profits Pounds 132,000). Losses per share widened from 1.6p to 3.6p.</p>

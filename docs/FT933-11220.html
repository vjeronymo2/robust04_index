			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Observer: Sweetened pills Martin Wygod, who is selling his Medco pill distribution business to Merck, is one of the shrewdest financial promoters around. He has also become a fly in the ointment for US pharmaceuticals companies so it's no surprise that Merck has had to pay Dollars 6bn to catch him and his business. By standing up to the drugs companies on behalf of some of the biggest buyers of pharmaceuticals, Medco won discounts of up to 25 per cent. Hence it was unnerving for big drugs purchasers to see Wygod canoodling with Merck, the biggest drugs producer. For Wygod, at least, it is good news. He will get Dollars 61m in Merck shares, have options over another Dollars 37m, and plans to buy another Dollars 30m or so of Merck paper. And he promises Medco will remain fiercely independent, buying only the best and cheapest drugs around, regardless of whether they have the Merck stamp on them. The deal also throws up another interesting name. Richard Braddock, 50, ex-president of Citicorp, only took over from 53-year-old Wygod as Medco's chief executive last December. Given that Richard Markham, Merck's heir apparent, resigned a fortnight ago, will Braddock now be a contender for the top job at Merck? Or will he return to banking? His name was mentioned when American Express was looking for a replacement for Jimmy Robinson. So perhaps he could be a candidate to fill the chief executive slot at Barclays. It certainly seems to be taking a long time to find someone.</p>

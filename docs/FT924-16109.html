			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / World Trade News: West looks to fly-away growth of east Asia  -A region fast establishing itself as the hub of international airline business SINGAPORE couples often hold their wedding receptions in the air conditioned splendour of the city state's Changi airport, then hop on an aircraft. These days there are plenty of honeymoon destinations to choose from. There are newly opened routes to Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, to Phnom Penh in Cambodia, to numerous destinations in China or in the Indonesian archipelago. Further afield, new routes have been opened to North America and Europe. It is the same story in virtually every city in east Asia. While recession has kept the airline business in North America and Europe down in the clouds, in east Asia it is experiencing fly-away growth. The region's rapidly growing economies, more tourist traffic and the lifting of travel restrictions in some countries, notably Taiwan and Korea, have resulted in more passengers. Throughout the region airlines are expanding operations or new airline companies are being formed. And the western aircraft manufacturers are all scrambling to form joint ventures with Asian partners to position themselves strongly in what remains the most promising sector of the hard-pressed civil aviation industry. British Aerospace has now set its sights on Taiwan to help revive its flagging fortunes in the regional aircraft business. It hopes its proposed Dollars 500m joint venture with Taiwan Aerospace to manufacture regional jets will ensure a continued strong British presence in the fiercely competitive regional jet market. Philippine Airlines is newly privatised and has orders and options for 16 new wide-bodies aircraft. Even the smaller carriers such as the reorganised Vietnam Airlines are enjoying robust growth. Vietnam Airlines says it is achieving an 80 per cent payload on its recently established flights to and from Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. A recent report by the International Air Transport Association (Iata) forecast that airline passenger numbers in the Asia Pacific region will double over the next six years. By 2000, the region will account for nearly 40 per cent of worldwide passenger traffic, by the year 2010 that figure will be more than 50 per cent - representing 375m passengers. In south -east Asia, Iata predicts that passenger traffic will grow by more than 9 per cent in each of the next three years, compared to an annual growth of 3.9 per cent in Europe and 5 per cent in North America. Airport overcrowding and various infrastructure bottlenecks threaten to hold up expansion. While Tokyo and other Japanese cities face the most serious airport problems Hong Kong, Bangkok, Seoul and Kuala Lumpur are already operating at or near full capacity. Iata says only two of the main air traffic 'hubs' in the region - Taipei and Singapore - have the facilities to cope with the expected growth. Mr Karmjit Singh, assistant director for corporate affairs at Singapore Airlines, says runway space shortages, a lack of sufficient parking at airports and inadequate terminal facilities are some of the more serious constraints on growth. 'Airlines, airport authorities and governments have to get together to deal with these problems,' said Mr Singh. Airports are either being expanded or built at Tokyo and Osaka in Japan and at Seoul in Korea. Hong Kong still hopes to open its new airport by 1997 and Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur also have plans to build new airports. The trouble is that if Iata growth projections are proved correct many of these new facilities will be operating at virtually maximum capacity from the day they open and increasing air cargo is going to add to the problem. Asia's airlines face other challenges. Maintenance facilities in the region are already solidly booked. While congestion problems are still not as serious as in Europe or on routes across the Atlantic, air traffic control systems in the Asia region need updating and co-ordinating. Many airlines in the region have been forced to recruit expatriate pilots. Pilot shortage is particularly acute in Singapore and Hong Kong. Aircraft manufacturers and leasing companies have been falling over themselves to cultivate connections in the Asian market. Boeing estimates that by 2005 the region will need nearly 2,000 new aircraft, almost 50 per cent of that number the large, long range types. New airlines such as EVA in Taiwan and Asiana in South Korea have become important customers for the aerospace and leasing companies. Most airlines in the region agree that the future lies not so much in Europe/Asia flights as in trans Pacific connections. Growing trade links across the Pacific plus a considerable population shift to the western American seaboard from Asia guarantees passenger growth in the years ahead. Apart from developing ties with Asian partners in the regional airline business, the big aerospace companies are also seeking alliances in Asia in order to develop the airliner of the future - the 600-700 seat super jumbo capable of flying non stop across the Pacific, from Hong Kong or Singapore or Bangkok to Los Angeles. Before too long those couples at Changi should be able to finish their airport wedding meal and fly direct to their honeymoon in San Francisco.</p>

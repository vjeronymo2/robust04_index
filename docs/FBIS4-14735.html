			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By UKRINFORM correspondent Lev Ryabchikov for TASS] </F>   [Text] Simferopol March 31 TASS -- By supporting the Rossia  Bloc's programme in the Crimean plebiscite, residents confirmed  the outcome of the recent presidential elections in the  peninsula, newly-elected president Yuriy Meshkov told today's  news conference on the results of the people's vote and Crimean  parliamentary polls.    According to official results, over one million Crimean  residents came to the polls, of which 78 per cent spoke in  favour of restoring the provision of the 1992 Crimean  Constitution stipulating that relationship between the Crimean  republic and Ukraine should be regulated on the basis of a  treaty and an agreement. Nearly 83 per cent of those casting  their ballots in the plebiscite backed the idea of dual  citizenship.    When asked about his further steps, Meshkov said the point  at  issue was not Crimea's independence but its economic autonomy.</p>

"There is a lot of trepidation to say the least," said one  officer. "It is a very major, in-depth review and will impact  dramatically on all serving personnel." Servicemen fear their  military status may mean that, unlike the police, they have no  redress.    The review, announced at the weekend by the Chief of the  Defence Staff, will take about a year, starting in the spring.  It will be conducted by an independent chairman and up to five  independent members, yet to be named. It is described by the  Ministry of Defence as a major review of "service career and  manpower structures, and terms and conditions of service." This  is taken to include such issues as the extent of unaccompanied  service for married men -- for example in Northern Ireland --  overseas allowances and subsidised schooling.    The review has been launched in the context of a three-year  efficiency drive to meet Treasury demands for further cuts in  the defence budget.</p>

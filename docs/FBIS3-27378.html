Now there are more than 60,000 households  specialized in animal husbandry, of which 44,000 households each  can produce more than 10 head of cattle annually. Last year the  province's total output value for animal husbandry amounted to  6.6 billion yuan, a major industry, second only to the planting  of crops.    In the last few years, price increases in animal husbandry  products, as well as market demand, have encouraged peasants to  develop animal husbandry. They have broken away from old  conventions, expanded the breeding scale, reduced production  costs, and improved product quality. Governments at all levels  also have formulated preferential policies and measures, built a  large number of animal husbandry production bases, and provided  priority treatment for specialized households, thus creating  conditions for the development of animal husbandry.    Animal husbandry scientific and technological departments  have exercised an economic contract responsibility system and  other methods. In the rural areas, they have introduced good  breeds of livestock, mixed fodder, medical treatment, and  preventive medicine. They have introduced a fine breed of pigs  to pig breeding bases, as well as grass planting methods and  refined fodder to mountainous areas, thus increasing livestock  production and improving economic results.</p>

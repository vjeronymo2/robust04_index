			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: MacSharry warns on CAP plan THE European Commission's plan to reform the Common Agricultural Policy would require 'additional budgetary resources', Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, said yesterday. Last month he warned the European Parliament that there would be 'serious political difficulties' unless there was 'a substantial level of compensation' to farmers for the severe price cuts envisaged in the plan, but this is the first time Mr MacSharry has said that the new policy would be more expensive. Beyond compensating farmers, extra funds would be needed for 'the greatest challenge' of wider rural development, he said. Final details of the commission plan are due in July, but it advocates moving a large part of CAP spending from subsidised producer prices to direct payments to farmers. This would be achieved through heavy price cuts, with small farmers wholly compensated and larger farmers reimbursed if they set aside land. The extent to which big, efficient farmers are to be compensated is at the centre of the debate, begun when details of the commission's plan leaked in January. The leaked version foresaw only partial compensation, but two other commission blueprints envisaged more generous, and even full refund of the price cuts. Mr MacSharry told a conference on CAP reform organised by the Club de Bruxelles think-tank that the EC was raising farm spending by 30 per cent this year only to depress farm incomes, because the price support mechanism merely added to the stockpiles of food overhanging the market. 'The basic question is whether we should now provide more resources for the existing mechanisms which, without improving the position of producers, are likely to lead to bigger stocks, bigger exports, bigger expenditure and greater intensity of production,' he said. The alternative was to pursue a new approach that would lead to less production but which could still guarantee a vibrant community agriculture.</p>

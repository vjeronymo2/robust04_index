			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Treuhand coal deal faces late challenge THE Anglo-American utilities consortium which is negotiating the purchase of Mibrag, one of eastern Germany's giant brown coal fields, is facing a late challenge by the company's management. The consortium, led by Britain's PowerGen, and the Minneapolis-based NRG, wants to use Mibrag to establish a foothold in eastern Germany's highly regulated utilities sector. The consortium has sole negotiating rights with the Treuhand, the agency charged with privatising eastern German industry, and which owns Mibrag. These rights were extended from July 31, until later this month. The negotiations are focusing on the price of the mines and other Mibrag divisions. A consortium negotiator yesterday said that a valuation of Migrab done for the Treuhand was 'wildly over-estimated', and inflated capital costs have been built into the valuation. The consortium is expected to invest at least DM650m in Mibrag, depending on the assets they actually purchase. The dispute over the sale price coincides with moves by Mibrag's board to set up a 'kind of management buy-out', according to Mr Willi Wessel, a board member. He said that under the proposal ownership would remain with the Treuhand until Mibrag was restructured. He added that this option would slow the pace of job losses as well as effectively postpone Mibrag's privatisation until 1996. The final price of Mibrag could influence the price of Laubag, the other lignite field which the Treuhand is also trying to privatise, a factor which explains in part the Treuhand's increasingly tough negotiating position with the consortium. But under pressure from Bonn, it is also anxious to sell Mibrag to the Anglo-Americans as a means of introducing competition into the region's energy sector. Some observers believe the proposed management buyout may be a way of putting pressure on the consortium to buy Mibrag at an inflated price. But utility experts said it was also an attempt by some members of the Mibrag management to keep out the Anglo-Americans in order to keep out competition and to maintain the high cost structure of the industry. Mr Wessel repeated this week that the management buy-out option was 'serious'. The move has already been discussed with Mr Klaus Murmann, head of Germany's federation of employers, a board member of Mibrag. 'We want to privatise but at the same time save jobs' said Mr Frank Wienke, a senior official at the federation.</p>

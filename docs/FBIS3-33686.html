			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Standing Committee of the General People's  Congress [GPC] today held an extraordinary session under brother  Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the  Presidential Council and GPC secretary general. During this  session, the Standing Committee examined several issues and  developments on the national scene, particularly the recent  developments in our country in light of the finalization of the  document of pledge and accord by the Political Forces Dialogue  Committee to overcome the crisis and build the Yemeni state as  well as the positive supportive stand declared toward this  document by the GPC.    The conferees also discussed a number of organizational  issues as well as the missions and tasks the GPC will undertake  during the forthcoming phase.    The session was opened by Koranic recitations. Brother Lt.  Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council  and GPC secretary general, then delivered a speech, noting the  importance of this extraordinary session of the GPC Standing  Committee, and highlighting the critical issues it is examining,  chief among which is the accord document initialed by the  parties to the Political Forces Dialogue Committee. He said  that our people are currently on the threshold of an important  historical phase after the realization of their great  accomplishment on 22 May 1990. He added: Right now, we are  meeting while our people are looking forward, with strong hopes  and great confidence, to ending the regrettable crisis which  surfaced on 19 August 1993, and which we never sought in the  first place. This crisis has caused immense devastation. It  has been a terrible nightmare that weighed heavily on the minds  of the people, who have been caused a great deal of suffering,  the brother Presidential Council chairman maintained.    The chairman of the Presidential Council and the GPC  secretary general added: When unity was achieved, we agreed to  follow the best way in our experiment to build a new Yemen. We  also agreed to follow positive courses in this experiment. He  added: The crises are not part of these positive courses.    There were many good mechanisms that could have been  followed  in the fields of development, administration, and building the  individual. Also, there are many positive courses that could be  followed in building streets, establishing the basic structures  of development, founding educational academies, and exploiting  resources.    Salih said: What calls for pride is that the GPC has always  championed these mechanisms and has played a prominent role in  achieving many of the achievements witnessed by all Yemenis.  The mechanism of the GPC was that of building and construction,  promoting the standards of individuals, safeguarding the  people's blood and rights, and respecting their rights, Salih  maintained. The GPC has always shown love and tolerance to all  out of its concern for the higher interests of the homeland and  people. It also cooperated with the honest and good national  forces to build Yemen's prosperous future.    Salih added that the GPC has a clear record full of good  intentions and sacrifices for the homeland, and full of  tolerance and amity among its members and with others. The GPC  has embodied the strong commitment to democracy within its ranks  and in dealing with others, and has pioneered the entrenching of  political pluralism within the party's framework. The party has  provided a national umbrella for all to work for a secure,  unified, and prosperous homeland.    The brother president said: The crisis and all its  repercussions--the likes of which the homeland had never  witnessed throughout its contemporary history--constituted a  clear circumvention of constitutional legitimacy and the results  of the parliamentary elections held on 27 April 1993, which  represented the shining image of the great unity achievement.  However, we hope that the document of pledge and accord will be  the means for resolving the crisis and deterring those who want  to harm the homeland, its unity, and democratic march. We have  to begin a new stage in which everyone shoulders his  responsibilities concerning the practical implementation of the  document, and everyone devotes himself to construction and  development rather than continuing these repeated crises, the  reasons for which we all know, as well as those responsible for  them.    President Salih said: Sanaa, the political capital of united  Yemen, which embraced all the Yemeni homeland's sons throughout  the stages of national struggle for liberation from British  tyranny and colonialism, will continue to be the city of peace  and steadfastness, and will continue to embrace unity. Sanaa  will also embrace all parties, the same as it embraced the  revolution and the republican system and protected them in the  face of all challenges and all hostile attacks launched by the  revolution's enemies in the 1960's and 1970's.    He said: On 22 May 1990 we began a new stage, and we should  eliminate the consequences of the past mentality and the  remnants of the totalitarian regime. We should never allow the  mentality of conspiracy, bloody coups, and ideological and  political terrorism to return or dominate our new life. Today,  we call on GPC cadres and supporters to prepare to be--as our  people have known them to be--at the forefront of the national  fold, shouldering their responsibilities efficiently and  sincerely to safeguard unity and democracy, and to grasp and  interact with the facts and all national and international  changes in a manner that meets our people's aspirations for  progress and prosperity. They should always be the strong  defenders of unity and democracy.    He said: We highly appreciate the efforts made by the  Political Forces Dialogue Committee, and applaud the role played  by the GPC representative within the framework of the committee.  We hope that the political forces, led by the GPC, the Yemeni  Socialist Party, and the Yemeni Reform Grouping, will intensify  their efforts to implement the document. This is the real test  of credibility and intentions, and this requires unity of  political will and collective efforts by all constitutional  establishments to shoulder their duties in an effective manner  in order to implement the document.    The brother president said: We call on all political forces,  social figures, intellectuals, and all the homeland's sons to  comprehend well the dangers facing the homeland, and to be  united in the face of all those who try to divide the national  fold or endanger our national and homeland's unity. We should  move to the stage of construction rather than harmful political  disputes. He who calls for sectarianism is not one of us  because we are a united Yemeni people and all of us shoulder the  responsibility for maintaining the unity of the ranks and  homeland.    The Standing Committee discussed several important national  and organizational issues on its agenda, as well as developments  relating to the political crisis. The committee will continue  its discussions tomorrow, Monday.</p>

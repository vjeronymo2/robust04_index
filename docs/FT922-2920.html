			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Two Russian servicemen killed in fighting Two Russian servicemen were killed in an all-night battle with Georgian national guardsmen who demanded that their ex-Soviet army base hand over weapons Two Russian servicemen were killed in an all-night battle with Georgian national guardsmen who demanded that their ex-Soviet army base hand over weapons and military equipment. A third soldier later died in hospital, Reuter reports from Moscow. Russia's Radio Mayak said yesterday three soldiers, one woman and a six-year-old child were also injured in the attack on a tank regiment headquarters in the town of Gori. Itar-Tass news agency reported that the national guardsmen seized two hostages, including the mayor of Gori, to press their claim. They opened fire when the garrison commander refused to give in to their demands. The commander retaliated by using helicopters to repulse the attack, Radio Mayak reported, killing 12 and injuring 28 of the attackers.</p>

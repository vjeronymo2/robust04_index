			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Lloyd's short on information for Names Sir, I think Lex (May 4) is somewhat premature in congratulating Lloyd's on its proposals for a market in syndicate participations. In order to have an efficient market, all the participants must have access to the relevant information. If Names are denied information on their trading, then we shall have a false market. At the moment, for instance, only a limited number of syndicates issue interim reports, and some of them only produce them after the year is over. To add insult to injury my agent informs me - in the nicest possible way - that I have no right to see the interim reports, such as they are, and that he only sends them to me (when he can find the time) out of the goodness of his heart. From time to time - and particularly about now - one hears or reads in the press that syndicates have issued profit warnings. The individual Name is not sent these warnings, but has to wait for his agent to send the annual consolidated statement. It is all very reminiscent of the situation of the small investor in the stock market 40 years ago. No, Lloyds has got a long, long way to go yet] Finally, it is intriguing, is it not, to see that (single) corporate syndicates will be allowed one-year accounting. So it can be done after all? R. Ian Wood, Greystones, Great Rollright, Chipping Norton, Oxon</p>

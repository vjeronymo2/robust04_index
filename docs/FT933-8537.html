			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Surfeit of a good thing - Champagne is in crisis, with falling prices and over-production. What does it mean for the consumer? THERE IS much confusion about champagne. Is it as good as it used to be? Is it too expensive - especially the well-known brands? In general, the quality is higher, thanks to more stringent regulations in the trade and competition outside. In the boom years, up to 1989, when demand threatened to exceed supply of grapes, just about anything sold - including champagne made from low-quality, immature grapes. Today, new and improved presses have raised the quality of the must, the third pressing has been eliminated, and the inclusion of the second pressing may be suspended while crops are so large and sales reduced. Also, the minimum legal bottle age before it is released for sale may be increased from 12 to 15 or 18 months, while cash-flow problems may delay replanting and increase the average age of the vines in some vineyards. The combination of three exceptionally large crops - with a fourth likely this year - and the recession that began in 1990, has led to the highest age-level of stocks for nearly 20 years, when the excess quantities were much smaller. They have now reached the equivalent of nearly a billion bottles in cask, still wine and bottle. This is nearly five years' worth of saleable champagne, rather than the traditional three. And the interest charged on an extra year's stock in densely-packed cellars is formidable. Hit particularly hard have been those growers (cultivateurs-manipulants) who market their own wines, mostly to private clients and the co-ops, which are obliged to buy their members' wines. Although there are excellent growers who sell privately to clients all over France, the majority do so on what is called a premier prix basis: as soon as possible after the minimum one-year ageing in bottle is past. Such growers have been hit by supermarkets which sell champagne at prices as low as FFr50 (Pounds 5.69) a bottle and, at special times of the year, as low as FFr40. One might have a regular petit fournisseur down in the Vallee du Marne but, rather than buying a couple of cases occasionally and paying the freight, in difficult times it is more convenient to drop into a French supermarket and pick up a couple of bottles. Champagne is expensive because the grapes and the method of production are costly. If, as is suggested, the price of grapes is reduced this coming vintage from FFr24 to FFr20 for the top village wines, it will be FFr16 for the lowest. It takes 1.2 kilos of grapes a bottle and, after materials, labour and interest charges, the total will exceed FFr43 without overheads or depreciation. One of the largest, most-respected manipulants, with holdings in top-quality Cote des Blanc vineyards and selling 200,000 bottles a year, told me: 'We cannot live on FFr50 a bottle]' They sell it for more to the British high street wine merchant Oddbins, which now retails the 1989 Blanc de Blanc for Pounds 16.75. If grape prices were to fall further, the merchants would secure fewer grapes, as the growers would sell to the co-ops, and improved quality would be at risk. Worse, many more growers might start to make their own champagne without the necessary know-how, the sophisticated equipment or the marketing experience. The overall picture today shows that, for large-scale selling, there are two fairly distinct quality/price levels of champagne: the variable quality, low-price ones, retailing in the UK from below Pounds 10 a bottle up to Pounds 12; and the should-be-reliable, non-vintage at grande marque level that dominates the international trade, costing between Pounds 17 and Pounds 22. Additionally, there are the vintage and prestige cuvees, sales of which  -apart from Dom Perignon and Roederer Cristal - are small at up to Pounds 50 a bottle. So, what to get? For low-price champagnes, you should buy selectively, almost certainly not at the lowest prices and avoiding those with fancy label names. Such champagnes could be bargains but, as with some I have tried, they may be coarse and short in bouquet and taste. The best way is to test them by buying single bottles of several brands. Supermarkets' own labels may be the best. Champagne needs some ageing and, for this, the grandes marques have a great advantage. The average age of their non-vintage stocks may be approaching five years and should be flavoursome and rounded, with an attractive bouquet. Their prices have come down, too, if only - in Britain - because of sterling's devaluation. But all Champagne is in crisis, with few of the houses making a profit. There is plenty of reason to buy now.</p>

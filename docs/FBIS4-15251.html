			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 6 TASS -- Russian counterintelligence  officers have arrested a defence industry employee who tried to  trade state secrets to foreigners, said Boris Miroshnikov,  deputy head of the counterintelligence operations department of  the Russian Counterintelligence Service.    In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday, Miroshnikov  said  that the number of such cases has grown lately. People offering  "spy service" to foreigners justify their behaviour by their  "desire to be paid according to their intellect."    Miroshnikov expressed concern about the fact that foreign  intelligence services have stepped up their activity in Russia  under the cover of various foundations and joint ventures.  Russian business people and industrialists seeking credits or  equipment for their businesses sometimes sell secrets to foreign  emissaries or those who act legally and openly under the cover  of firms and companies, he said.    Taking advantage of Russia's weakened administrative and  legal system, foreign spies penetrate all spheres of activity.  Their neutralisation forces Russia's counterintelligence to  look for new ways and methods of intelligence warfare and to  conduct systematic analytical work.    The situation is compounded by the fact that foreign states  have set up intelligence centres in some republics of the former  Soviet Union and, in fact, have taken over the local  intelligence services. They wage active intelligence work  against Russia, using politically unstable areas, trouble spots,  the Islamic factor and aggressive nationalism, Miroshnikov  concluded.</p>

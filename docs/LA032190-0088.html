			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'NERD HERD' OF SEPULVEDA WINS BATTLE OF THE BRAINS  </P> <P> The "Nerd Herd" has taken top honors in this year's Los Angeles Unified School  District's Academic Pentathlon.  </P> <P> The nine-member team from Sepulveda Junior High School -- which bestowed the  moniker on itself during training last fall -- finished ahead of Porter Junior  High School of Granada Hills and 78 other schools in the seventh annual battle  of the brains, district officials said Tuesday. The Los Angeles Center for  Enriched Studies, a district magnet school, finished third.  </P> <P> "It was a lot of work, but it was worth it because we won," said Jason Chen,  14, of Van Nuys.  </P> <P> It was the second consecutive first-place finish for the Sepulveda team.  </P> <P> The Feb. 24 competition, which drew more than 700 participants from 80 schools  throughout the Los Angeles Unified School District, tested students in math,  science, history and essay writing. The fifth event, called the Super Quiz,  required students to answer questions about a John Steinbeck book, "The Red  Pony."  </P> <P> "I had students who read that book four or five times, right up to the night  before the competition," said team coach Kathy Floor, a health and science  teacher.  </P> <P> The Sepulveda school, which has 2,000 students, has finished no worse than  third place since the district began the academic competition in 1984. The  school team finished first last year, as well as in 1987.  </P> <P> The Sepulveda team members, who by contest rules are divided evenly among A, B  and C students, also include Katie Unterman, Gabriel White, Miriam Kim, Teja  Fox, Jonathan Kirzner, Shawn Park, Chris Allen and Kimberly Burr.  </P> <P> The school board is scheduled to honor the team during an April 2 reception.  </P> <P> The Sepulveda school is a finalist for designation by the state as a  distinguished school, Principal Wilbert Whitaker said.  </P> <P> El Camino Real High School in Woodland Hills earlier this month finished second  in the statewide Academic Decathlon competition for high school students. There  is no statewide event for junior high school students.  </P></p>

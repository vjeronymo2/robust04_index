			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / International Company News: Minneapolis bank buys rival in Dollars 750m deal First Bank System, a fast-growing Minneapolis-based bank, capped a string of recent acquisitions with an agreed takeover of local rival Metropolitan Financial in a deal valued at Dollars 750m. The acquisition in part signals the growing pace of US bank mergers ahead of interstate banking legislation expected this year. 'We think the pace of consolidation will accelerate - that has had an effect on our acquisition strategy,' First Bank said. Metropolitan strengthens First Bank's position in the central corridor of the country, adding to its network in states like Minnesota, North and South Dakota and Wisconsin while extending its reach into additional states such as Nebraska, Kansas and Wyoming. The all-share deal values Metropolitan at between 1.6 and 1.7 times book value, depending on the final terms. Based on its assessment that the merger will result in cost savings of 35 per cent at Metropolitan, First Bank said the deal would add marginally to its earnings per share in 1995 and 1996. First Bank has made four acquisitions in the past 18 months to bring it additional assets of Dollars 9bn, taking its total to Dollars 25.6bn. Metropolitan will bring a further Dollars 8bn of assets. Like other regional bank mergers, the transaction is intended to bring down overall costs by reducing combined overheads and applying common technology, while extending a broader range of products to the combined customer base. Metropolitan, a savings bank, has traditionally relied on domestic mortgages, although it has expanded recently into consumer lending, which now accounts for Dollars 1.6bn of its Dollars 5.5bn of loans.</p>

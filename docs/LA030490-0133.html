			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WCC TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> WAVES HOLD OFF ST. MARY'S, 94-83  </P> <P> Before the West Coast Conference tournament began, Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury  said he hoped his team wouldn't be caught looking past anybody.  </P> <P> The second-seeded Waves were almost caught gazing ahead by seventh-seeded St.  Mary's Saturday night.  </P> <P> The Gaels got Pepperdine's attention with torrid first-half shooting and by  making 11 of 33 three-point baskets. St. Mary's tied school and conference  tournament records for three-point baskets and broke WCC and school records for  attempts.  </P> <P> The Waves weathered the storm of three-pointers and held off St. Mary's, 94-83,  in the first round of the conference tournament at Loyola Marymount. They will  play San Diego -- an 80-74 winner over San Francisco Saturday -- tonight at 7  in the tournament semifinals.  </P> <P> The Gaels (7-20) surprised Pepperdine by making eight of their first nine  shots, senior forward James Dailey -- who wasn't supposed to play -- making  three of them.  </P> <P> Dailey had missed all but one of his team's last seven games -- and had made  only a brief appearance in that -- because of a back injury. He started, played  31 minutes and scored 23 points on eight-of-15 shooting.  </P> <P> Dailey's three early baskets sparked his team to a 22-12 lead in the first 6  1/2 minutes.  </P> <P> Pepperdine (17-11) took its first lead when Rex Manu made two free throws for a  31-30 edge with 6:01 left in the half.  </P> <P> After that, Pepperdine went on a 19-4 run and led at halftime, 50-34.  </P> <P> St. Mary's, which made only three of 12 three-point attempts in the first half,  made eight of 21 in the second. Gael guard Mike Vontoure made three of his five  three-pointers in the second half, and St. Mary's twice pulled to within seven  points.  </P> <P> Vontoure, who finished with a game-high 26 points, cut Pepperdine's advantage  to 79-73 with five minutes to play. But the Gaels began to tire, and Pepperdine  began to pull away.  </P> <P> St. Mary's Coach Paul Landreaux said he thought his team had "a chance to win  the game down the stretch, but we missed some big three-point shots that would  have kept us in (it)."  </P> <P> Asbury said his team had played well at times, "but I think we got a little  comfortable in the second half and started coasting."  </P> <P> Dexter Howard led Pepperdine with 24 points and 16 rebounds and Tom Lewis added  21 points.  </P></p>

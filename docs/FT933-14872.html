			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Debt talks set to resume at O&amp;Y USA OLYMPIA &amp; York USA is close to resuming debt-relief talks with creditors after reaching agreement on a number of disputes relating to it's board of directors and other issues of corporate governance. Negotiations to restructure O&amp;Y USA's USDollars 5.3bn debt have been at a standstill since March following disagreements between the company and its Canadian parent, Olympia &amp; York Developments (OYDL). The Reichmann family, which retained a 20 per cent interest in O&amp;Y USA in the restructuring of OYDL earlier this year, also raised concerns about the possible dilution of their stake. According to a lawyer involved in the case, some minor points of disagreement remain between the Reichmanns and O&amp;Y USA. But these are expected to be cleared up early this week in time for a New York bankruptcy court judge to grant an order next Thursday approving the new arrangements. The debt-restructuring talks are expected to drag on for at least six months,and perhaps much longer. But the corporate-governance pact has raised hopes the talks will succeed without O&amp;Y USA following its parent into bankruptcy protection. The agreement, which was hammered out under the auspices of former US secretary of state Mr Cyrus Vance, gives O&amp;Y USA substantial autonomy from OYDL, which is now under the control of a court-appointed administrator. A new nine-person board will include a group of seven independent directors, whose stature would be the envy of most companies. They include Mr Willard Butcher, former president of Chase Manhattan Bank; Mr John Whitehead, co-chairman of Goldman Sachs and a former US deputy-secretary of state; Mr Richard Ravitch, a prominent New Yorker who once headed the city's transportation authority; and Mr William Davis, former premier of Ontario. A source close to O&amp;Y said that most of the new directors have accepted their position as a public service in the interests of the New York real estate market. O&amp;Y USA is the city's biggest office landlord and the single largest contributor of commercial property taxes. Its collapse would have a chilling effect on the entire market.</p>

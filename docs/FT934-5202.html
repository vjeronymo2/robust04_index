			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Potato quotas to cease The 60-year-old potato marketing scheme, which attempts to match supply and demand by setting quotas for producers, is to be abolished in 1997, Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, announced yesterday. The move will conclude the de-regulation of agricultural commodity marketing in the UK. The Milk Marketing Board, the compulsory purchasing scheme, is due to be replaced by a voluntary producers' co-operative next April. Mrs Shephard's decision on potatoes is in line with European Commission policy to encourage greater competition in agricultural commodity markets. 'We are convinced this will be the best way of attacking the large and increasing trade gap in processed potatoes, by giving our producers the opportunity to be more responsive to market forces,' Mrs Shephard told the Potato Marketing Board's annual lunch. She said she was adopting proposals by the board and the National Farmers' Union to ease the country's 16,000 registered potato growers through the three-year transition towards a free market. Farmers, who earn a total of Pounds 500m a year from the UK potato crop, feared that an overnight switch to open competition would destabilise prices. They were worried that price volatility would cut consumption. Mr David Naish, NFU president, welcomed the three-year 'breathing space' and said this would give the union a chance to campaign for a strong regulatory framework to continue beyond 1997. The potato marketing scheme will continue in modified form until the end of 1996-97, and the government will review the position before consulting the industry on final abolition. During the transition, Mrs Shephard proposed that the quota system be made more flexible, to free the market, allowing producers to grow 5 per cent more or fewer potatoes than their limit without facing penalties. Intervention buying of potatoes by the board, funded by producers, will end. Until now, the board has been obliged to buy surplus potatoes, which it sells at a loss as animal feed. About 1,300 growers will be exempted from the need to register in order to reduce regulation and paperwork.</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Blow for Berlin rebuilding Plans for rebuilding Berlin as the fitting capital of a united Germany have been sharply curtailed by the parliament's budget committee, Reuter reports from Bonn. The committee agreed on Wednesday evening that all ministries should be housed in existing buildings, either former east German ministries or military headquarters left behind by departing Allied forces. Only the new chancellery and government press office, due to be constructed near the old Reichstag parliament building, were not mentioned in the resolution. This implied they would be built, committee members said. Union membership in Germany fell again last year, with members grouped under the German federation of unions down by 6.3 per cent, to 10.3m, Reuter reports from Dusseldorf.</p>

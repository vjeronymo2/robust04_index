			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Bock wins upper hand at Lonrho Mr Dieter Bock yesterday won his most important victory in the battle against fellow chief executive Mr Tiny Rowland for control of the Lonrho board room when the company announced that four of Mr Rowland's closest board room allies would retire. The group also disclosed that profits from continuing operations had more than doubled in the year to September 30 from Pounds 39m to Pounds 79m. It confirmed, however, that there had been a Pounds 186m fall in the value of its two-thirds shareholding in the Metropole hotels, which represents a reduction of more than 50 per cent on the value put on the business two years ago when Lonrho sold one third of it to Libya. As Mr Bock's victory was disclosed, Mr Rowland said hostilities had ended. 'There are no differences between Mr Bock and me. . . We will be acting as one,' Mr Rowland said. 'I could not be happier.' Mr Bock said: 'I look forward to at least another two years of our working closely together.' Mr Rowland said the relationship between Mr Bock and himself would be similar to that between Lord White and Lord Hanson at the conglomerate Hanson. 'My area is principally Africa (where Lonrho has many businesses). We meet and decide which opportunities we should put to the board.' Mr Rowland disclosed that Lonrho had recently considered acquiring a shareholding of 15-18 per cent in the hotels and leisure group, Ladbroke, when its share price fell. Mr Bock said they had decided against the move because such a minority stake would not have allowed them to exercise enough influence on Ladbroke. However, he said Lonrho, having made a series of disposals last year, was now planning to make acquisitions - though more asset sales might still be made. One of the retiring directors is Mr Rene Leclezio, the chairman, who is 74 and has worked for Lonrho for 29 years. Mr Bock said that he would be replaced by a non-executive chairman, who might come from outside the group or from one of the three non-executive directors, Mr Stephen Walls, Mr Peter Harper and Sir John Leahy, recently recruited to the board. Last year the company also offered seats on the board to Sir Alastair Morton, joint chairman of Eurotunnel, Mr Alistair Ross Goobey, chief executive of Postel, the UK's biggest pension fund, and Mr Brian Pearse, retiring chief executive of Midland. They declined, though are thought not to have dismissed the suggestion completely. The retiring directors will receive payments equivalent to two years' salary, which will have to be approved by shareholders at the annual meeting at the end of March. The group's pre-tax profit, including gains on disposals, was Pounds 172m, up from Pounds 114m, on sales of Pounds 2.7bn, compared with Pounds 3.93bn. Earnings per share were 15.1p, against 6.4p, before exceptional items, or 2.4p against a loss of 0.9p afterwards. A final dividend of 2p makes an unchanged total of 4p. Net interest costs fell from Pounds 100m to Pounds 70m. Lex, Page 22 Observer, Page 21</p>

In  these battles, one combatant of the Bosnian Serb Army was  killed, and two others were lightly wounded.    The Kupres plateau is militarily very important, because  strategically important roads go from the Adriatic coast towards  central and western Bosnia via this plateau.    The issued statement says Serb defenders have so far  re-gained about 80 percent of the territory which Moslem  extremists from Bugojno seized few days ago. The Moslem forces  on Monday attacked the Serb positions between Cajnice, Foca and  Gorazde (southeast Bosnia) but all attacks have been repelled  with no losses among the Serb troops, these sources said on  Monday.    The Moslems continued attempting infiltrating terrorist and  sabotage groups behind the Serb lines. One such group was  detected Sunday afternoon in the area between Cajnice and  Gorazde and their attempt was thwarted on time. Another  terrorist and sabotage group suffered the same fate near Teslic  (northern Bosnia).    In the wider region of Doboj (northern Bosnia), the Moslem  forces continued with usual provocations. The strongest  provocations by the Moslem forces were reported near Mt Ozren,  whereas re-grouping of Moslem forces was observed in the valleys  of the Rivers Bosna and Spreca.</p>

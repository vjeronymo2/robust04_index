			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Money Markets: UK futures rise sharply THE SLIGHTLY easier tone in European money markets continued yesterday, with French and German futures all extending their recent rises, writes James Blitz. In the UK market, short-dated futures rose after the release of figures showing increased savings by Britons in the third quarter. This clouded hopes of a quick economic recovery led by consumer spending and raised new hopes that the government might have to ease monetary policy further to stimulate a recovery. As the holiday approaches, the market continues to be swayed by the Christmas cheer delivered on Tuesday by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president. He said German inflation could be as low as 3 per cent by the year-end. However, Mr Schlesinger's forecast was slightly overshadowed yesterday by poor preliminary figures for German inflation in December. The cost of living rose 0.2 per cent in December from November, and was 3.8 per cent higher compared to December 1991 levels. There was, nevertheless, a rise in short-dated Euromark futures, with the March contract up another 2 basis points to close at 92.22. German call money rates retreated as the market found itself with sufficient liquidity after the passing of a major tax deadline. Traders quoted call money at 8.70-8.85 per cent, down from 8.80-8.90 per cent on Tuesday. In the French cash market, three-month money dropped sharply from the 12 1/4 per cent level seen on Tuesday, partly because it is assumed that a concerted attack on the French franc will not take place before the new year. Three-month money fell to 11 1/2 per cent. The March French franc futures contract advanced 7 basis points to a close of 90.71. Yesterday's increase in the savings ratio, which measures the percentage of disposable income that people save, partly explains the 6 basis-point rise in the March short sterling contract, to a close of 93.35. Dealers believe sluggish consumer spending could force the UK to reduce base rates again soon. Three-month money firmed slightly to 7 1/4 per cent, having hovered around 7 3/16 per cent for most of the week. The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.2bn at the start of operations, with no late assistance.</p>

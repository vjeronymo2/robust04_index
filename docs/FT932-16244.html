			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Postponement to Clinton economic package allows Senate to clear up critical piece of legislation Agreement to postpone President Bill Clinton's Dollars 16bn economic stimulus package allowed the Senate to clear up one critical piece of legislation that had been held up by the Republican filibuster: a measure to raise the legal ceiling on US federal debt to Dollars 4,370bn. The US Treasury, which had been forced to delay debt sales to avoid breaching the previous ceiling of Dollars 4,145bn, yesterday held a Dollars 14.25bn sale of 52-week bills and announced another Dollars 22.4bn auction of 13 and 26-week bills for today.</p>

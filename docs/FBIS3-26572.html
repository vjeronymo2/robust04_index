Before the signing ceremony, Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing  met with representatives of the five overseas firms: the Italian  Agip, the French Elf, the Japanese Energy Corporation, the  Japanese Petroleum Exploration Company and Texaco of the U.S.A.    The contract is the second one on petroleum prospecting and  exploration in the Tarim Basin. It is also the second one in  China's world-wide public tendering for cooperation in  exploiting China's land oil.    Under the new contract, the foreign firms will for the next  eight years shoulder all the expenses and risks in prospecting;  when oil and gas fields are found, the two sides will jointly  invest in exploration and production, and share the crude oil in  proportions laid down by the contract.    It is learned that since March 1 last year, when the China  National Petroleum Corporation opened the first round of public  tendering for the project, 68 corporations from 17 countries had  applied for the tendering documents and 54 of them had sent  representatives to Beijing to study relevant materials.    The south-eastern area of the Tarim Basin open for  cooperation consists of five sectors covered mainly by sand.</p>

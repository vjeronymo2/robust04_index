			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Enlarged Nestor-BNA rises to Pounds 2m INTERIM pre-tax profits at Nestor-BNA rose from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 2m, flattered by costs booked in the first half of last year relating to a near-20 per cent stake in a UK weight-loss joint venture. Nutri/System UK was closed after the company's US partner suffered adverse publicity. Total operating profits were static at Pounds 2.74m for the 24 weeks to June 18 on turnover up at Pounds 49.3m (Pounds 44.7m). Mr Michael Rogers, chairman, said: 'Our UK healthcare businesses are responding well to the changes in their markets.' However, he said the outlook for its large US health care business was 'difficult to predict' because of uncertainty over reforms. In the UK, new legislation 'has given us opportunities to supply nurses and carers to the frail elderly in their own homes. From a standing start this now accounts for 4 per cent of our UK nursing agency business,' Mr Rogers said. In the nursing homes and hospitals division the company has been doing an increasing amount of work under contract to local authorities and health authorities. The acquisition in March of BUPA Nursing Services helped lift revenue in the UK nursing agencies division to Pounds 24.5m (Pounds 20.6m) and operating profits to Pounds 862,000 (Pounds 571,000). Mr Clive Chapman, finance director, said it was impossible to gauge the contribution of the acquisition for Pounds 400,000 cash and the assumption of Pounds 1.8m in debt. The acquisition was paying its own interest charges, he added. Net borrowings rose to Pounds 17.7m (Pounds 13.2m), leaving the company with gearing of 334 per cent (116 per cent) at the half way stage. Shareholders funds fell to Pounds 5.3m compared with Pounds 7.4m at the start of the year, following the write-off of goodwill on BNSL. A maintained 1.15p interim dividend is being paid out of earnings per share up at 1.93p (0.88p).</p>

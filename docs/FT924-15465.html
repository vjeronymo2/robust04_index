			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / BAOR becomes ARRC THE fighting part of Britain's Rhine Army yesterday donned a new identity as the leading element of Nato's new, multinational rapid reaction corps. The corps, involving forces from 12 of the 16 allies, is the centrepiece of a new strategy designed to retain Nato's relevance after the Cold War. The corps is to be fully formed by 1995 and able to deploy up to about 80,000 troops. Its purpose is to keep a nucleus of soldiers at a state of readiness similar to that of Nato forces previously. Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, spoke of the corps at its inauguration as the 'strong arm' of Nato. Although its primary function was to defend Nato territory, parts of it could in future be used further afield, for instance in peace-keeping. At yesterday's ceremony, the 1st (British) Corps - based in Bielefeld for the last 39 years - was placed in 'suspended animation'. Its last commander, Lt-Gen Sir Jeremy Mackenzie, takes over as first commander of the new Nato corps, known as the ARRC. The strains of Deutschland uber Alles played by a German army band echoed across the parade ground of a one-time Wehrmacht camp lined with contingents from Nato's variegated armies - kilted Highlanders, pith-helmeted English bandsmen, lance-carrying Italians and blond-haired Danes. Even the noises betrayed national distinctions - the near-silence of German soldiers marching in rubber boots, contrasting with the thundering footfall of a platoon of exceptionally tall and forbidding Turks. The British Army, which is making the biggest contribution to the corps and will account for 60 per cent of its 300-strong headquarters staff, sees the corps as a means of keeping itself in the military front rank. With the inauguration of the new formation, the British army sheds many of the connotations of an occupying force, which have lingered on since the 1944 invasion. In early 1994, the Nato corps is due to transfer to the present headquarters of the British Army of the Rhine at Rheindahlen, 100 miles to the south-west. The BAOR will then cease to exist and become instead UK Support Command (Germany). 'It doesn't exactly trip off the tongue, does it?' commented a senior British officer.</p>

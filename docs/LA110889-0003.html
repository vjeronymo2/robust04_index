			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CORONADO COOL TO PROPOSAL THAT IT TAKE OVER TROUBLED IMPERIAL BEACH;  </P> <P> BROKE: MAYOR OF NEARLY BANKRUPT CITY GETS LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT IN VISIT TO  RICHER NEIGHBOR.  </P> <P> Coronado Mayor Mary Herron reacted coolly Tuesday to an idea by Imperial Beach  Mayor Henry Smith that Coronado take over nearly bankrupt Imperial Beach.  </P> <P> "It is time for us to seriously investigate our future options. One of the  options is the city of Coronado," Smith said in a letter he read to the  Coronado City Council. "All that I would like to do today is to begin the  process of our staff looking at the city of Coronado and assessing whether it  is a viable option to consider our consolidation with your city."  </P> <P> Imperial Beach officials have warned that the city will not be able to pay its  bills in January, unless new revenue sources are found. To that end, a measure  to raise $450,000 annually with a 5% tax on each utility bill was put to  voters, but was defeated, Tuesday.  </P> <P> But even that wouldn't have guaranteed financial viability for the ailing beach  town, Smith said, and officials would still seek to merge with Coronado.  </P> <P> If Imperial Beach goes bankrupt, it might be forced to disincorporate, thereby  coming under county control. Smith and the City Council have also discussed  consolidating with San Diego.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Herron made it clear that Coronado officials are not enthusiastic  about annexing Imperial Beach.  </P> <P> "We would feel very cautious," Herron said. "Coronado has worked long and hard  to be where we are. It may be more of an undertaking than we can envision."  </P> <P> Imperial Beach, a city of about 25,000 residents, is the only beach city in the  county that has not developed its beachfront. Many of its residents are  apartment dwellers, and it has a limited tax base. For almost a decade, the  city was forced to dip into its reserves to continue providing services, and  the reserve is now exhausted.  </P> <P> In contrast, Coronado, with its upper-middle-class community, has long  cherished its exclusiveness and is well-known for the many Navy admirals who  have retired there. The average cost of a home is $406,000 in Coronado, which  has a population of about 20,000; the average cost of a home is $174,000 in  Imperial Beach. The two cities are joined by the Silver Strand.  </P> <P> Herron expressed concern that Coronado's resources would be strained if it were  required to provide services such as police and fire protection to Imperial  Beach, which is served by the sheriff and has a tiny fire department.  </P> <P> "I don't know what the outcome will be. But no mayor will want to be faced with  the condition you find yourself in," Herron said to Smith.  </P> <P> Although Smith requested that Herron allow Coronado's city manager to meet with  Imperial Beach's city manager to discuss the proposed merger, Herron did not  make a commitment to the talks.  </P> <P> "They're not going to jump into this, are they? All I ask for is exactly what  the letter said," Smith said after his brief appearance before the Coronado  City Council.  </P> <P> In an interview with The Times last month, Coronado City Manager Homer Bludau  said there is no incentive for Coronado to consolidate with Imperial Beach.  </P> <P> San Diego City Manager John Lockwood said that San Diego city officials would  be willing to discuss consolidation with Imperial Beach, but he added that  there were no immediate plans by San Diego to annex Imperial Beach.  </P> <P> San Diego County Supervisor Brian Bilbray has argued that the best alternative  available to Imperial Beach is to consolidate with the county. Bilbray, a  former Imperial Beach mayor, said the county would become Imperial Beach's  trustee for three years, then voters would have an opportunity to vote on  incorporation again.  </P> <P> However, Smith and the majority of the Imperial Beach City Council favor  consolidating with either Coronado or San Diego.  </P></p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Food retailers busy Leading food stocks were heavily traded as they received long-term support from SG Warburg, which announced a Pounds 202m warrant issue, representing a basket of shares in Tesco, J. Sainsbury, Argyll and William Morrison Supermarkets. The 20m warrants involved give investors the option to receive the cash value of the shares at any time between now and November next year. They provide a geared play into a sector which Warburg believes is 'severely under-valued.' Sainsbury, which Warburg sees as the pick of the four, added a half-penny at 389 1/2 p, while Argyll and Morrison picked up a penny each to 253p and 126p but Tesco shed 2 to 233 1/2 p. The progress report from Rank Organisation was given a cool response by the market, where Rank shares, trading at 424p immediately the report was announced, fell away to close 15 weaker at 403p after good turnover of 3.6m. The slide in Rank shares was said to have been largely triggered by a BZW profits downgrade. The broker chopped its current year profits forecast by Pounds 10m to Pounds 322m pre-exceptional items. Mr Peter Hilliar, leisure specialist at BZW, said the broker had shifted its stance on Rank from buy to hold principally because of the stock's strong performance in recent months. There was more heavy activity in Lasmo shares following persistent stories that a cash alternative to Enterprise Oil's all-paper offer is now imminent. Any new bid will have to be pitched around the 160p level, dealers said. Analysts insisted, however, that Enterprise would not take any action until Lasmo's defence document is published. The document, which has to be made public by Monday under the takeover code, is expected this morning. Lasmo shares, helped by news of an oil discovery in Algeria, edged up 2 to 156p in turnover of 10m. Enterprise Oil, on the other hand, came under sustained selling pressure, sliding to 425p before settling 11 off at 429p. Mercury Asset Management, one of the UK's leading institutions, revealed it had sold a block of 206,000 shares, and there were hints of US selling of Enterprise after the visit to US institutions by Mr Graham Hearn, Enterprise's chairman and chief executive. The gas discovery in Pakistan helped British Gas edge up 1 1/2 to 298 1/2 p but had a much greater impact on Tullow Oil, which has a 15 per cent stake in the find. Tullow rose 4 to 31 1/2 p on 6.1m shares dealt. An SG Warburg Securities buy note helped to lift National Power by 14 to 430p and PowerGen by 5 to 464p. A badly handled selling order unsettled Sun Alliance shares, which fell 12 to 321p on 3.6m traded. Media conglomerate and Financial Times owner Pearson climbed 18 to 678p ahead of the company's annual meeting today. Publisher Euromoney advanced 125p to 1825p, responding to a jump in half-year profits to Pounds 9m from Pounds 5.9m. The company also announced that it is raising Pounds 20m through a 1.2m-share placing. Metal Bulletin moved forward 10 to 460p as it was announced that magazine publisher Emap had increased its stake to 20.59 per cent. Emap receded 7 to 378p. Defence and industrial giant British Aerospace broke through the 500p barrier to close 11 ahead at 510p after a positive two-day analysts' visit to the group's defence operations. Mr Chris Avery at Paribas, who went on the tour, has put the stock on his buy list and said: 'BAe's defence business shows near-term stability and long-term potential despite declining world spending on equipment.' Volume was 5.2m. Negative whispers concerning Siebe's accounting policies resurfaced and hit the shares, leaving them trailing 11 to 569p after trade of 3.8m. The group reports figures next month.</p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Italy stands alone in bearish week Italy stood alone last week, the only component of the FT-Actuaries World Index to show a positive trend as it continued to attract favourable brokers' recommendations. Kleinwort Benson reflects the optimism currently surrounding the market, forecasting that it is likely to be among Europe's top performers in 1994. Mr Enrico Ponzone of Kleinwort remarks that foreign investors, particularly from the US, have already prepared themselves for a victory by the left-wing Progressive Alliance in next month's general elections. 'In discounting a left-wing victory, the market seems to be accepting the lesser of two evils - given the dangers presented by some of the policies put forward by both the League and the neo-fascists, not to mention Berlusconi's questionable credentials,' he says. The media magnate formed the Forza Italia in an attempt to counter the possibility of a left-wing victory. Goldman Sachs is also bullish, recommending a 'moderately positive stance' because of falling interest rates, a competitive lira, and subdued inflationary pressures. Other European bourses reacted during the week less to the tightening of US monetary policy than to worries over the possible delay in a further easing of domestic rates, although both the UK and Belgium moved modestly in that direction. Switzerland was the heaviest faller. Here, technical factors were a major influence. Mr Hans Kaufmann at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich noted that small and medium sized companies had escaped the correction, however, with many still showing 5-6 per cent rises in their prices since the start of the year. He added that government bond yields had picked up during the week from 4.02 per cent to 4.19 per cent, 'not a big movement but it makes the market nervous'. Much of the week's selling was by institutions, while foreign sales had swelled trading volumes as investors took profits and booked currency gains. Ireland also declined, but, says Mr Adrian O'Carroll at Dillon Read, this needs to be taken in context with the market's strong performance since January. 'There was some profit-taking', he says, 'and I would expect the market to track UK equities quite closely in the short term.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                    % change   % change                  % change in local currency*      sterling* in US Dlrs*             ------------------------------------------------------------              1 Week  4 Weeks    1 Year  Start of   Start of   Start of                                             1993       1993       1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      -2.62     -1.24    +40.06    +43.05     +35.91     +31.62 Belgium      -1.02     +1.44    +24.80    +34.36     +27.56     +23.54 Denmark      -1.44     +1.06    +39.76    +54.02     +46.05     +41.45 Finland      -3.53     +3.67   +105.66   +129.51    +118.45    +111.59 France       -2.37     +0.88    +25.52    +29.84     +24.40     +20.48 Germany      -1.92     -1.49    +25.44    +35.10     +28.98     +24.90 Ireland      -4.18     -3.55    +51.46    +61.55     +44.36     +39.81 Italy        +1.40    +14.14    +45.02    +61.11     +45.02     +40.44 Netherlands  -0.07     +2.39    +37.63    +45.56     +39.23     +34.84 Norway       -3.46     +2.72    +45.41    +54.44     +45.76     +41.17 Spain        -2.41     +3.15    +41.16    +58.99     +31.95     +22.78 Sweden       -4.99     -0.67    +42.20    +46.44     +32.27     +28.01 Switzerland  -5.74     -0.17    +41.22    +45.26     +48.92     +44.22 UK           -2.64     -0.38    +21.16    +21.54     +21.54     +17.71 EUROPE       -2.47     +0.70    +28.54    +33.24     +29.17     +25.10  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia    -3.75     +2.23    +35.57    +39.45     +50.00     +45.27 Hong Kong    -5.36     +5.24    +98.79   +110.11    +116.70    +109.87 Japan        -0.34     +5.29    +24.08    +23.01     +46.96     +42.33 Malaysia     -3.05     -1.16    +97.74   +104.78    +100.27     +93.96 New Zealand  -3.49     +4.96    +50.76    +54.84     +78.38     +72.74 Singapore    -1.77     +1.53    +55.68    +60.07     +71.06     +65.68  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada       -1.36     -2.65    +21.08    +23.70     +20.85     +17.04 USA          -0.01     -1.06     +4.52     +7.30     +10.80      +7.30 Mexico       -0.18    +11.04    +67.91    +56.66     +62.53     +57.41  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa -4.99     -2.11    +42.21    +55.59     +70.39     +65.01  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX  -1.08     +1.41    +18.86    +21.30     +28.59     +24.54  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Based on February 11th 1994.

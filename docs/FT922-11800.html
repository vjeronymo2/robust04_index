			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Observer: Pitman's risk It's a touch ironic for the chairman of the Hongkong Bank to be warning Lloyds Bank not to try to disrupt his cosy bid for the Midland. After all, it wasn't long ago that his immediate predecessor, Sir Michael Sandberg, upset the Bank of England by launching an unwelcome bid for the Royal Bank of Scotland. Had it not been for Sandberg's impetuous intervention, the Royal Bank would now be happily married to Standard Chartered, and Britain's banking system would be a much tidier place. The net result was that the Monopolies and Mergers Commission turned down both bids rather than risk snubbing the Old Lady's governor by allowing Sandberg to win a hostile auction. Although the days when a UK bank could look to the Bank of England to shoo away an unwelcome predator are almost certainly over, personalities could play just as big a role in the current shadow-boxing over Midland's future. Lloyds' chief executive Brian Pitman is not cast in the same mould as the headstrong Sandberg, who went on to advise Alan Bond and sit on the board of Polly Peck after retiring from Hongkong and Shanghai. True, Pitman is a bit of a maverick and normally gets what he wants. But he is not in as powerful a position as Sandberg was at the time of the RBS bid. Moreover, since he doesn't have the same dominance over his board, he'll need to present his case very forcefully to convince a majority of the non-executive directors led by Sir Jeremy Morse, one of the ablest bankers around. If Pitman fails to win the battle, will the firing squad be called?</p>

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Electra lifts pay-out in 'difficult year' ELECTRA Investment Trust, the largest trust in the venture capital sector, announced a 6.3 per cent increase in its final dividend, despite suffering a fall in its net assets over the year to September 30. Mr Michael Stoddart, chairman, said 'It has been a particularly difficult year for organisations such as Electra whose investment strategy has been to invest in small and medium-sized listed and unlisted companies. These in the main have borne the brunt of the worst recession since the 1930s.' In recent years, recession has forced a number of trusts in the venture capital sector, such as Drayton Consolidated and Ensign, to make substantial write-downs on their unquoted holdings. This has aroused considerable disquiet among investors about the way that trust managers value their unquoted holdings - as a result, venture capital trust shares stand at substantial discounts to their asset values. Fully diluted net assets per share fell to 277.87p from 304.53p at end-September 1991. Mr Stoddart said 'there was an increase in the value of the North American unlisted portfolio, which has been offset by a further deterioration of our UK unlisted portfolio and a substantial reduction in the value of our unlisted portfolio.' He would not give details of the size of these shifts, but said they would be given in the trust's annual report and accounts. During the year, Dollars 40m (Pounds 26.3m) of promissory notes were converted into ordinary shares, substantially reducing gearing. Earnings per share rose from 7.351p to 7.526p and the final dividend is increased to 3.4p, making a total of 6.7p (6.4p).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reports by Josep Gisbert, Ramon Sune, and Antonia de la </F> Fuente: "Pujol Asks Gonzalez for Firmness To End Corruption"]    [Text] Barcelona -- Jordi Pujol warned Felipe Gonzalez  Wednesday [13 April] evening, in the course of a meeting that  they held secretly at the Moncloa Palace, that the corruption  cases could create deep distrust among the public, and asked  that, in order to avoid this, the government act firmly and  courageously to "nip them in the bud," in an allusion to the  scandals uncovered concerning former Bank of Spain Governor  Mariano Rubio and former Civil Guard Director General Luis  Roldan.    In an interview broadcast by TV3 yesterday evening, the  Generalitat [Catalan autonomous government] president gave his  assurance that CiU [Convergence and Union] will continue to  support the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] in Spain's  governability, provided that the government fulfills two  conditions: Continue with the current economic policy and  "convincingly nip in the bud" all the corruption cases.  According to Pujol, who came out in favor of avoiding actions  that could lead to dissolving the Cortes and bringing forward  elections, "because we have never behaved opportunistically,"  the government's activity to this effect should follow two  paths: the judicial path, which, in his opinion, could be the  most effective, and that of a parliamentary committee of enquiry.    Both at the end of a meeting with the CiU deputies in the  Congress of Deputies held in Arenys de Mar to prepare for the  general policy debate that begins next Tuesday [19 April], and  in the television interview, the Generalitat president asserted  that it is the government itself that must resolve the  corruption cases, although he specified that his group will  support the Felipe Gonzalez cabinet's initiatives aimed at  clarifying the scandals at issue and maintained that "it is the  Socialists and the prime minister who must take the decision to  clean up their house," because "we cannot clean up other  people's houses."    The meeting between the prime minister and the Generalitat  president -- a private dinner arranged by the two men by  telephone a few days earlier -- was described by official  circles at the Generalitat president's office as "just another  meeting -- because it is normal that in this legislative term  they should see each other more often than they used to, in view  of the greater cooperation that exists -- at which matters  connected with the negotiation on the impetus for autonomy and  the change of economic policy were reviewed," and at which it is  not denied that the corruption cases were also discussed.  Nevertheless, the same sources specify that the meeting -- at  which, according to Pujol, economic matters took priority --  took place in a "very good" atmosphere, and "was not prompted by  the Rubio case."    However, CiU sectors close to the Generalitat president  believe the meeting "is of a somewhat special nature" --  especially since it is only two months since the last official  meeting, 10 February, also at the Moncloa Palace -- prompted by  the political situation in which Spain currently finds itself.  The analysis that Jordi Pujol has made privately over the past  few days with those closest to him is that although CiU is  prepared to support a stable government, as the cabinet headed  by Felipe Gonzalez has thus far been since the last election, it  is not prepared to do so with a government weakened by the  latest corruption scandals. Within this framework, the  Generalitat president believes that for stability to remain  guaranteed in Spain, the prime minister must tackle the  situation resolutely, internally and externally, and act firmly  in order to restore confidence in the government and its  credibility.  <H5>  "To the Bitter End" </H5>   In fact, the approach is one that Pujol reportedly explained  personally to Gonzalez, who, for his part, reportedly wished to  learn from his interlocutor what stance CiU intends to maintain  at an especially delicate moment with respect to the support it  gives the government. During his television appearance, Jordi  Pujol appeared hopeful that the government will adopt urgent  measures and will know how to react "against this cancer that  must be thoroughly and rapidly eradicated," since Felipe  Gonzalez assured him that he intends to go "to the bitter end"  in clarifying all the matters reported. This led him to  maintain that "we can avoid the Italian phenomenon," because "we  are not too late."    The Generalitat president denied -- following the lunch with  CiU deputies in Madrid, Antonia de la Fuente reports -- that the  prime minister asked him for any kind of special support, and  asserted that he does not believe that CiU could pay dearly for  supporting the PSOE in the current circumstances, since "we are  supporting not the government but an economic policy that we  believe is the one needed in order to emerge from the crisis."  Pujol added that he deems it very unlikely that a censure  motion against Gonzalez could be submitted, because this "should  be constructive, and the current situation is not sufficient for  that," and, in any event, he concluded that "if anyone wants to  submit a motion of censure or no confidence, he will, and we  will see."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg, June 19 (XINHUA) -- South African  Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad has said his country is  intending to establish diplomatic ties with China, according to  THE SUNDAY TIMES here today.    The largest circulation newspaper carried the deputy foreign  minister's interview with its political correspondent Edyth  Bulbring on South Africa's foreign policy.    Pahad said the People's Republic of China is important for  South Africa not only because of the enormous trade potential,  but also because it is a permanent member of the United Nations  Security Council.    He pointed out that should South Africa establish diplomatic  ties with China, it would have to forgo the long-established  diplomatic ties with Taiwan.    However, he stated, Taiwan is one of South Africa's largest  trading partners.    "In the final analysis, our decision will be determined by  our interests and international precedents."    Pahad said given South Africa's sanctions-battered past, the  focus will be to increase favorable economic relations with its  traditional trading partners -- the United States and the  European Union.    But, he said his country will also be looking beyond  traditional partners to expand economic relations with, among  others, Canada, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, India, the People's  Republic of China and Latin America.    Another area where links were unexplored is the Middle East,  not only for trade, investment and tourism but for oil, he said.</p>

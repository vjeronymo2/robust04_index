			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Markets: Profit hopes flourish in a cold climate - London The pre-Easter flood of company news has suddenly turned into a drought. This dearth did not help and may have contributed to an unsettled mood in the City of London, where climatic conditions alternated with bewildering speed between sunshine and hail. Market sentiment remains, likewise, poised uneasily between fears of a further tightening of US interest rates and hopes that the UK recovery is sufficiently well established to shrug off handicaps such as this week's steep rise in personal taxation. Bears have been in the driving seat since the beginning of February, when the market FTSE 100 peaked at 3520. Dealers were in fearful mood when they returned to their desks on Tuesday after a wintry Bank Holiday weekend, knowing that Wall Street had fallen sharply the previous day. Having marked shares down sharply at the start, traders were wrongfooted when Wall Street rallied sharply and they were left scrambling for stock. The Footsie closed last night 34.4 points higher on the week - but still 11 per cent below its February high. Hoare Govett was one of several stockbrokers to suggest that the pessimism had been overdone, arguing that recent talk of a 1987-style crash in equities could not be more ill-founded, both in terms of valuations and, more importantly, the UK's position in the economic cycle. The broker said: 'By far the most important difference between now and 1987 is that they represent almost opposite points in the economic cycle. 1987 was the sixth consecutive year of rising GDP and profits. 1994 will be the second. Inflation in 1987 was 4 per cent, going on 10 per cent, and gilts were poor value. Inflation is now 2 per cent, going on 4 per cent, and gilts are reasonable value.' James Capel, one of the City's largest brokers, suggested analysts - including its own - had been underestimating the scope for profits and sales recovery from UK industrial companies over the next two years. Capel's market strategy team compiled the accompanying chart, which shows that analysts tend to miss most of the major turning points in the economic cycle. Comparing analysts' expectations with what actually happened, it suggests analysts underestimate how much profits will fall in a recession - but then also understate how far they rebound in a recovery. The report says: 'An understandable psychological motivation might explain the tendency of forecasters to underestimate if they have been too optimistic in the recent past.' Capel believes there is substantial scope for an earnings surprise in UK industrial stocks, pointing to recent experience in the US, where corporate earnings have been on average 3 per cent better than expected over the past year. BZW, another large broker, said that in the last few weeks its analysts had made more upgrades than downgrades to their earnings estimates - the first time this has happened in nine months. While the most rapid growth will be seen in 1994-95, Capel reckons it may well be another three to four years before this cycle peaks. Over the next five years the UK should be able to sustain average profit growth of 11.5 per cent, taking profits' share of GDP back to levels last seen in the early 1960s. The bullish forecasts are based partly on the prediction of low growth in input costs, such as raw materials, utility prices and labour, compared with manufacturers' prices, together with continued productivity improvements. Capel accepts that substantial profits recovery is already in the price of many shares, but says its analysis reinforces the case for a range of cyclical sectors, such as extractive industries, building and construction, media and transport. The week's main corporate development was the announcement by Eurotunnel, the company which will operate train services through the Channel tunnel, that it had settled settled a long-running dispute with Transmanche Link (TML), the Anglo-French the construction consortium. The bad news for Eurotunnel's shareholders was that it had agreed to pay TML an additional Pounds 70m-Pounds 85m in a settlement covering the tunnel's fixed equipment. This brings the total it has paid TML to Pounds 1.14bn, nearly twice the Pounds 620m original contract price. The good news is that this is considerably less than the Pounds 1.95bn which the contractors had sought. The deal settles the final claim outstanding against Eurotunnel, although it still has a Pounds 1bn claim against the British and French railways. A Eurotunnel rights issue, planned for mid-May, is now expected to raise between Pounds 600m and Pounds 750m. The agreement was marked by a spat between Eurotunnel, its financial advisers and Swiss Bank Corporation. This led to a senior SBC executive being banned from taking part in the forthcoming rights issue after he got on the wrong side of Sir Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel's famously combative co-chairman. The SBC executive was supposedly being punished for indicating that the rights issue might be as large as Pounds 750m. However, the sub-text was that SBC's aggressive behaviour has offended the City establishment on several occasions in recent years. It forced BZW to trim the margins on its enhanced scrip dividend wheeze and challenged the flat-rate 2 per cent fee for underwriting rights issues. Eurotunnel's advisers, Morgan Grenfell, Banque Indosuez and SG Warburg Securities, had been irritated by what they saw as exaggeration of SBC's role in the rights issue. There was considerable satisfaction that Sir Alistair had wielded the big stick at this brash newcomer - even if SBC will still play an important role in the fundraising exercise.</p>

			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Letter: Fallacy and geography in banking competition (2) Sir, As the political and legal barriers recede throughout the European Community, it is still mystifying that in some quarters the UK is not considered part of Europe. Your eminent correspondent, Prof Bain, appears to highlight this perfectly when he states that a bid for Midland Bank from a 'European bank' would avoid the competition concerns that would accompany a bid from Lloyds. To think of UK banks (and for that matter UK companies) in terms of being non-European and to consider the effects of takeovers purely in terms of the domestic market will not help British banks (or companies) to compete on an equal footing with their French, German, Swiss and Spanish counterparts, both in Europe and at a global level. I am sure that many people consider Lloyds Bank to be a European bank and indeed, no doubt, at some point, a senior official from Lloyds may point out to Prof Bain that Lloyds has more representation in Germany and Spain than it does in Scotland, where Prof Bain resides. Russell Longmuir, 668 Greenwich Street, Apt 819, New York, NY 10014, US</p>

			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / 'EC will meet Danish concerns ' THE British government voiced confidence yesterday that the European Community would respond quickly to Danish concerns over Maastricht with a declaration committing the 12 to decentralisation and the protection of national identities. As the Copenhagen government set out the options to persuade its electorate to reverse its rejection of Maastricht, senior British officials preparing next week's Birmingham summit said the drafting of the statement planned by EC leaders was now well advanced. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary and current president of the council of ministers, will discuss the text at a meeting later today with Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president. That will follow Mr Hurd's talks last night with Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, and discussions earlier this week with his Spanish and Portuguese counterparts. The Bonn government has already indicated its strong support for the statement and French President Francois Mitterrand has told British Prime Minister John Major that it will receive French backing. The officials said the declaration would provide the framework for subsequent, more detailed, commitments this year to ensure that EC decisions were based on the principle of subsidiarity. The framework next week would include an outline of mechanisms for the Council of Ministers to ensure that all Commission documents met the principle of subsidiarity, rules to ensure national enforcement of agreed directives, and examples of the areas where decision-making would be returned to national governments from Brussels. The Birmingham statement would also set out the basis on which the Community could seek to allay fears that the concept of union citizenship enshrined in Maastricht threatens national identities. It would stress that EC citizenship was an adjunct rather than a substitute for national citizenship and would emphasise the sovereignty of national parliaments. The British presidency expects the statement will give it a mandate to prepare more formal texts which could be attached to the Maastricht treaty at the Edinburgh summit in December. It acknowledges, however, that the legal status of such documents at this stage remains uncertain and that Denmark will also require further assurances over monetary union and defence policy.</p>

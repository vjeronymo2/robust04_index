			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WAIVERS BACKFIRE AS COLTS GRAB HERRMANN;  </P> <P> RAMS: ROBINSON WILL GO WITH TWO QUARTERBACKS. MICKEY SUTTON IS PICKED UP FROM  THE BILLS.  </P> <P> The Rams, who have spent much of the summer watching their schemes scrambled by  injuries, saw yet another plan go awry Tuesday when the Indianapolis Colts  claimed veteran quarterback Mark Herrmann off the waiver wire.  </P> <P> The Rams did, however, use the wire to improve their situation at cornerback,  picking up veteran Mickey Sutton from Buffalo.  </P> <P> Coach John Robinson had intended to keep three quarterbacks, with Herrmann and  Chuck Long backing up starter Jim Everett. But injuries reduced his flexibility  in trimming the roster to 47, and the Rams waived Herrmann, in the hope he  would slip through and they could re-sign him Tuesday.  </P> <P> "It's very disappointing to us," Robinson said. "We hated to lose Mark. He's a  great guy and was really in tune with the timing part of our game. But we  didn't have a lot of options available to us (because of injuries) and felt it  was the area that would least impact our team.  </P> <P> "I'm surprised, frankly, that the Colts would take him, since they have two  quarterbacks (rookie Jeff George and veteran Jack Trudeau). So, we'll go with  two quarterbacks and begin to look at disaster quarterbacks."  </P> <P> Herrmann wasn't exactly happy with the way things worked out, but he does live  in Indianapolis and, as he pointed out Tuesday, "At least I still have a job."  </P> <P> He said that when the Rams traded for Long, he thought he might be out of work  and decided the best he could do was try to make cutting him a difficult  decision. In fact, he played so well during the exhibition season -- completing  16 of 30 passes for 212 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions -- that  he probably hurt his chances of going unclaimed.  </P> <P> "The Rams gave me a fair chance, and I think I played well enough to be the  backup," Herrmann said. "I talked to Coach Robinson, and he felt the same way.  He just felt I had a better chance of getting through waivers than Chuck did.  </P> <P> "I'm a little surprised I was picked up, but the Colts wanted a No. 3 guy with  experience who could jump in and play."  </P> <P> The Rams are now without that experienced No. 3. Herrmann said he thinks they  are taking a risk.  </P> <P> "With this system, it takes a while," he said. "And we didn't even scratch the  surface in training camp. Chuck has some ability, that's obvious, but you can't  just jump in and feel comfortable."  </P> <P> Robinson, however, is feeling considerably more comfortable with his secondary  and special teams, thanks to the addition of Sutton and the news that  cornerback Alfred Jackson's injured groin should keep him out of action only  one week, instead of a month or more as was originally thought.  </P> <P> Either Sutton, who played with the Rams for three seasons, 1986-88, or safety  Anthony Newman will start at left corner in Sunday's opener against Green Bay.  Sutton will also return punts.  </P> <P> "We know Mickey and we know what kind of a person he is," Robinson said. "He  will help us. He will definitely play in the nickel (defense) and we'll wait  and see who opens at left corner."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> The Rams' roster has 46 players, so they will be looking over the waiver wire  for a special teams player. . . . As expected, cornerback Jerry Gray,  linebacker Larry Kelm and cornerback Darryl Henley were put on injured reserve  Tuesday, Gray and Kelm with knee injuries, Henley with a hip problem. They will  be eligible to return in four weeks. . . . Tackle Jackie Slater, who dislocated  his big toe Friday night against Washington, will be outfitted with a toe plate  in an effort to relieve some of the stress and pain. John Robinson said Slater  is doubtful for Sunday's game in Green Bay. . . . Guard Joe Milinichik had a  pin inserted in his thumb, but will probably play, wearing a cast, Sunday.  </P> <P> Tailback Cleveland Gary, who has missed most of the last month because of  lower-back pain, has declared himself ready for the season opener. "I think  he'll be surprised when I don't start him," Robinson said, laughing. "But he's  got a little work to do before he's ready. We'll try to get him some action in  the game, but that's hard to do when we don't feel he's prepared."  </P> <P> Robinson's assessment of his starting wide receivers, both of whom are  recovering from hamstring injuries: "Henry Ellard is OK and Flipper Anderson is  almost OK." . . . Robinson was asked why he chose to protect fourth tight end  Jim Price, a rookie from Stanford who has a hamstring injury and will probably  go on injured reserve this week, instead of Herrmann. "We think Price is a  prospect and unless he makes the 47, you're going to lose him," Robinson said.  "It was decision about the future."  </P> <P> Kevin Greene has practiced for only one day, but says he thinks stamina will  not be a problem Sunday. Robinson, however, said he intends to make sure Greene  does not get too tired against the Packers. "I fear injury a little because he  plays very hard," he said. "There's a fanaticism to his play. He's out there  slightly over the edge."  </P></p>

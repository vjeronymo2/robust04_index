			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rises on hopes of one more rate cut Wall Street US SHARE prices rose yesterday on continued speculation that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates one more time in the wake of last Friday's bad unemployment news, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 19.68 up at 3,245.08, near its high for the session. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 put on 2.68 to 413.77. The Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks, however, ran into sustained selling and finished 0.82 off at 634.13. New York SE turnover was light by recent standards at 188m shares. Disappointment on Friday that the Fed did not ease following worse than expected employment data had faded by the time the market opened yesterday, and hopes remained high that the authorities would lower interest rates to boost the economy. Investors were uncertain, however, about the timing, and equity price rises were restrained by the consensus opinion that the Fed will not move until the completion of the big Treasury auctions this week. Time Warner lost Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 93 1/8 in active trading after the entertainment group reported fourth-quarter profits of Dollars 45m, compared to a loss of Dollars 34m a year ago. Included within the figures, which did not surprise the market, were a decline in earnings from the publishing operations but record profits from the film and Home Box Office divisions. Security Pacific slipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 32 1/2 and BankAmerica shed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 39 3/4 amid continued concern among investors that the banking groups' planned merger could be scuttled by challenges from Washington state legislators. Motorola advanced Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 81 and Northern Telecom moved forward Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 47 5/8 after the two groups announced the formation of a cellular telecommunications joint venture. American Cyanamid fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 58 7/8 in turnover of 1m shares on the news that the Justice Department is investigating allegations that a company official tampered with drug data. Hercules rose Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 48 1/8 after Merrill Lynch raised its investment rating on the chemical group's stock and increased its profits forecast for 1992. On the over-the-counter market, MGI Pharmaceutical plummeted Dollars 10 3/4 to Dollars 11 5/8 after the company halted phase three clinical trials of MGI 136, its protective agent used for chemotherapy treatment. Argonaut climbed Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 27 1/2 in the wake of reports that some industry analysts believe the insurance group's stock is undervalued. Software Technologies declined Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 6 3/4 after reporting fiscal third-quarter net income of just 5 cents a share, well below the 15 cents a share expected by the consensus of analysts' forecasts. Canada TORONTO ended moderately firmer but in quiet trade as investors stayed cautious ahead of this week's US Treasury refunding and Friday's US producer price index. Canadian biotechnology stocks ended stronger, escaping from profit-taking of their US counterparts after a press article said the sector may be due for a correction. The composite index gained 12.2 at 3,608.5. Advancing issues led declines by 305 to 278 after volume of 21.9m shares valued at CDollars 216.24m. CCL Industries reported a loss of CDollars 1.1m in the fourth quarter, against a profit of CDollars 400,000 a year ago. The 'B' shares were off CDollars  1/4 at CDollars 8 3/4 .</p>

He said it was now important that nobody try with  provocations to shatter a positive process which is the result  of the initiative of Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who  already approved it three weeks ago. The essence of the  initiative lies mainly in strengthening the security zone around  Sarajevo but also in other Bosnian regions. Now this initiative  crystalised in a clear and concrete form, Kozyrev said.    He said that currently there existed the possibility for  returning from unilateral to joint actions of the whole world  community. He said Yeltsin was in direct contact with leading  representatives of many states especially with German Chancellor  Helmut Kohl with whom he had another detailed conversation  today. Constant contacts are being preserved also with the  foreign ministers, especially of Britain, the United States and  Germany, Kozyrev said.    He said that the possibility of joining some other countries  is also being considered so that the chance offered by the  Russian initiative is utilised. The process is not to be  shattered by any provocations in the interests of strengthening  it through far-reaching agreements on Sarajevo and on the whole  of Bosnia.    "At the beginning of the next week meetings of  representatives of the foreign ministries or possibly foreign  ministers themselves are being planned. Then it will be seen  what to do next," Kozyrev said.</p>

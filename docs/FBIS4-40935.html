			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Parliamentary Diary" by Vladimir Isakov: "1937 Again?"] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Law of Revolution [subhead]    The gloomy forecast that "insignificant deviations from the  law" and "individual violations of the Constitution" will sooner  or later lead to repressions against people is beginning to come  true even early than expected. The president's 14 June 1994  edict no. 1226 "on urgent measures to protect the population  from banditry and other manifestations of organized crime" opens  up a tragic new page in Russian history in that sense.    The edict stipulates in particular that when there is  "sufficient information" (who will determine this?) that a  person belongs to a gang or other organized group, "by agreement  with the prosecutor" (but without sanction) before criminal  proceedings are instituted reviews and other investigatory  actions can be undertaken with regard to the suspects, their  relations, acquaintances, corporate bodies, and PUBLIC  ASSOCIATIONS.    An undertaking not to change address, personal surety,  surety  from public organizations, and bail are not applied with regard  those suspects and accused of these crimes, they can be arrested  without charge for a period of up to 30 days.    Representatives of the internal affairs and  counterintelligence organs have received the right to search at  any time the premises of enterprises, organizations, and  institutions and also transport facilities and their drivers and  passengers and on any pretext and not only in connection with  suspicion of having committed a crime.    At first glance there is nothing frightening in the edict --  no prison, camps, or firing squad. But we should have no  illusions: The edict is a heavy brick thrown in the window of  legality and human rights. The window has been smashed to  smithereens and it will not be long before the firing squad....    I shall not tiresomely enumerate the articles of the  Constitution, Criminal Code, and Criminal Procedure Code  violated by the president's edict -- the lawlessness lies  "heavily, crudely, and visibly" on the surface and no one is  trying to hide it. Something else is more important: The edict  DOES NOT HAVE A LEGAL MECHANISM OF IMPLEMENTATION. Any lawyer  will tell you that in a situation where he has to choose between  a law and an edict, a judge, prosecutor, or investigator must  unfailingly FOLLOW THE LAW -- he is obliged to do so by his  duty, by the law, and by the Constitution which, incidentally,  no one has formally repealed.    The president's edict gives a wonderful opportunity for  playing cat and mouse with jurisprudence and speculating on the  fact that "the evidence has been obtained by illegal means" and  that the suspect is "the victim of tyranny and illegal  repressions." This "loophole" will be used unfailingly by those  against whom the edict is allegedly aimed -- inveterate, well  prepared criminal elements with the opportunity for hiring a  reliable attorney. In proclaiming the intensification of the  struggle against crime the edict in fact weakens and  disorganizes it. It is that which puts us on our guard: Why  then was it published?    I venture to suggest that in fact the edict has nothing to  do  with the struggle against crime, it is pursuing completely  different -- political -- aims.    First: dragging the Duma into a confrontation with the  president.    To someone who has lived through the defeat of the Supreme  Soviet it is as clear as daylight. In just the same way a year  ago the Supreme Soviet was drawn into confrontation by lawless  edicts on privatization and was taunted with "decoy ducks" in  the budget. And they achieved their end -- first the Supreme  Soviet was discredited and then it was destroyed completely. A  year later we can see that the Supreme Soviet was right in many  waYS: The budget collapsed, privatization has discredited  itself, but who remembers that the Supreme Soviet was right?    For several months now a similar game has been under way  against the State Duma. The first round was the amnesty  (initiated by the president let me remind you) which  ended in the Duma's favor. The deputies were not split and did  not quarrel -- on the contrary, they adopted a decision which  eased the pitch of political confrontation in society and  compelled the president to invent the "social accord treaty" to  capture the political initiative....    The second round -- the budget round -- is ending in a draw.  Yes, it is the case that the Duma did not gain any political  dividends from the budget but there are no grounds for  discrediting it -- it simply took and without lengthy  discussions approved the budget submitted by the government. If  there is something wrong then it is all the complaints against  the government and president.    Next in line is the third and probably last round. Having  violated the Constitution and the laws and cancelled out draft  laws on the struggle against crime on which the Duma is working,  the president has issued an edict which most grossly flouts  human and civil rights. The aim is to provoke an outburst of  anger among the deputies and the public and perhaps to retreat  and then to put all the blame on the deputies for the collapse  of the economy and the catastrophic increase in crime. A well  known, cliched, and base trick which has been used many times:  "The worse, the better, we shall find the culprits!"    The second reason: To remove the "taboo" on the criminal and  criminal procedure codes and to accustom people to the idea that  they can be replaced by the president's edicts. To force  workers in the law enforcement organs to transgress the oath  which obliges them to serve the people and to obey the laws.    How exactly do the organs protecting law and order differ  from any armed gang? The use of violence? Both use violence.  Technical equipping? The mafiosi and racketeers have perhaps a  higher degree of technical equipment. There is one difference  and it is the main one: the attitude toward the law. According  to this indicator it has always been believed that they are on  different sides of the barricades. The president's edict erodes  that difference. Law enforcement organs which do not base their  activity on the law are transformed from a tool in the struggle  against crime into the largest mafioso gang backing up the power  and interests of their "godfather."    I would not be surprised if with time it emerges that the  series of murders and acts of terrorism which swept the capital  immediately after the edict was adopted were a "special order"  from some high-ranking gentleman. After all it is so important  that photographs of bloodstained, lacerated bodies should appear  in newspapers and television reports next to items from the  State Duma "which is preventing the president from struggling  against crime." So why not push someone toward vigorous actions?  We are used to the acts of provocation of our sovereigns and  the moral standard of all the present authorities leaves us with  no illusions.    The third reason is the need for preemptive measures before  the fall which promises to be "hot." Despite all the assurances  and promises, the catastrophic decline in industry has not been  overcome and stoppages of enterprises continue. Readiness for  bringing in the harvest is 50 percent even compared with last  year, which was far from a record-breaking one. However patient  the Russian peasant is, betrayed and slandered by everyone, cut  down by market "reforms," even his patience will finally  break.... And it is here that the president's "storm  detachments" will be needed, detachments which do not consider  any laws.    Nonetheless the edict is having no "triumphal progress." Of  famous political leaders only two -- Zhirinovskiy and Travkin --  have openly supported it. The former because the edict fully  complies with his own ideas of the struggle against crime (that  is how he intends to act when he comes to power) and the latter  most likely because he is burdened with the portfolios of a  "minister without portfolio" in the present government cabinet.    The edict has met with a sharply negative response even  from pro-president groups of deputies and many lawyers, and  former human rights champions who understand very well what kind  of a hopeless quagmire the country can be led into by the  president's "experiments" with the criminal code. Having sensed  a smell of burning the "democratic press" has started to scurry  about and become perturbed.... And it has reason: The first to  come under the axe of illegal repressions are opponents, next  are unreliable supporters, and then all the rest, without number  and indiscriminately. After all, that is the "law of  revolution...."</p>

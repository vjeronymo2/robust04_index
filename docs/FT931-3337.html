			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Retailer seeks Chapter 11 protection after sale A GROUP of US investors yesterday completed the purchase of Herman's, the US sporting goods retailer, from Britain's Isosceles group - and promptly sought protection for it from creditors under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code. Herman's bankruptcy filing was made in Trenton, New Jersey. It was accompanied by a prediction that the 253-store US chain would lose more than Dollars 18.5m this financial year. Isosceles's sale of Herman's was announced last month, but no price was disclosed. The investors include Taggart/Fasola, a New Jersey management group, and two New York investment firms, Whitman Heffernan Rhein &amp; Co and Carl Marks &amp; Co. They said the Chapter 11 filing would enable Herman's to restructure its finances and operations. The US company, with around 6,700 employees in about 40 states, has obtained a Dollars 40m loan facility from Chemical Bank. It is being made available as debtor-in-possession financing - a form of temporary funding common in bankruptcy situations. It allows the lender to rank at the forefront of the creditors' queue should the borrower eventually cease operations. Yesterday, the investors said they expected to close or sell a 'significant number of stores' and concentrate on core markets in the north- east.</p>

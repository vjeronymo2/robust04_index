			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- The coalition parties agreed  Tuesday [8 February] to appropriate funds in the 1994 draft  budget to buy Patriot surface-to-air missiles and two more  Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) electronic  surveillance planes, informed sources said.    A policy reversal by the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of  Japan -- SDPJ] made the decision possible and the sources said  the items are now likely to be included in the draft budget for  fiscal 1994 starting in April.    The Finance Ministry is scheduled to announce the 1994 draft  budget plan Thursday.    The Defense Agency has pushed for four AWACS planes to boost  its information gathering capability and has already concluded  contracts to obtain two from the United States in its 1993  budget.    The AWACS is a surveillance system which uses aircraft with  radar and sophisticated communications equipment to detect  airborne and seaborne targets and control weapons systems  attacking such targets.    A single AWACS plane costs 55.4 billion yen but since the  1994 appropriation is for 550 million yen, the remaining sum  will be covered by subsequent budgets.    The Patriot missiles, which will cost a total of 35.2  billion  yen, will boost Japan's capacity to oppose an airborne or  missile attack. The 1994 budget allocates 140 million yen for  their purchase.    The SDP, which espouses a policy of disarmament, had  strongly  opposed the purchase of the AWACS.    But since the majority of the coalition favors their  purchase, the sources said the party's leaders have expressed a  desire not to further destabilize the coalition at a time when  it is trying to survive a threat to its existence caused by  disagreement over a proposed tax reform package.    The sources said the SDP has decided instead to push for a  reduction in the rate of increase in the defense budget compared  with the previous year's rate.    The SDP has also released a statement in which it said it  will consider the issue of the AWACS and missiles within the  context of a revision of the overall defense plan.    The decision is consistent with the previous Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) government's defense policy, which  included the purchase of two AWACS planes in the budget for the  1993 fiscal year as part of the midterm defense buildup program.    Despite a cabinet decision in December to approve a cut of  580 billion yen in the 1991-95 defense buildup program, the  then-LDP cabinet allowed the agency to proceed with its original  plan to purchase the AWACS system.    The midterm defense buildup program, with a total  expenditure  of 22.75 trillion yen, includes provisions for the purchase of  four AWACS planes.</p>

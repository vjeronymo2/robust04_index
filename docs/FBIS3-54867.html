			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Kril: "A Specter of Communism, Which </F> Haunted the Lvov Region for a Long Time, Has Been Dispersed by  Authorities"]    [Text] A special resolution adopted by the Lvov Oblast  Council has deemed as subversive the activities of the  reconstituted and illegally registered Communist Party of  Ukraine. The resolution imposes a ban on issuing permits for  staging mass communist rallies, as well as granting communist  organizations facilities and telephone lines for their  activities. Communist publications must not be circulated.  Communists must not act as official co-organizers of any  undertakings.    Thus, communists are being ruled with a rod of iron.  Although there is no information regarding any punishments for  violating the ban, from now on communists can hardly be expected  to hold open party meetings. They have no choice but to  continue their activities underground. Had it not been for the  Oblast Council attack of rage, communists could have been kept  under the authorities' watchful eye.</p>

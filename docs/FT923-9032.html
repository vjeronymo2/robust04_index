			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Doubts raised on Cadbury proposals SERIOUS DOUBTS over the effectiveness of the Cadbury report on corporate governance were raised yesterday after two leading bodies representing accountants and auditors questioned how far its code of conduct could be enforced. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales warned in a submission to the Cadbury committee that it had 'serious misgivings' about auditors certifying that companies had followed the code. Separately, the Auditing Practices Board, which sets auditing standards, dismissed as impracticable the use of auditors to check compliance with the qualitative aspects of the code. The concerns raise questions over the effectiveness of the Cadbury recommendations, which have a voluntary code as their centrepiece. The institute's financial reporting and auditing group said aspects of the code would be impossible for auditors to verify, such as determining whether non-executive directors were bringing independent judgment to bear on issues of strategy and performance. The Auditing Practices Board said auditors could only verify the objective parts of the code. It suggested that a company's audit committee might better certify compliance.</p>

Model 369 and OH&hyph;6A series helicopters equipped with certain main rotor (M/R) blade assemblies or certain M/R hub lead-lag assemblies, that currently requires repetitive inspections and checks for cracks. This action would require the same inspections as the superseded AD, but would eliminate pilot checks, expand the areas of inspection, and require the application of slippage marks on each M/R blade root fitting lug and related bushings to detect movement. This proposal is prompted by additional reports of cracks in the M/R blade root fittings, lugs, and adjacent blade skin, and movement of the root fitting bushings. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of a M/R blade assembly or a M/R hub lead-lag link assembly, loss of a M/R blade, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by September 6, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;SW&hyph;05&hyph;AD, 2601 Meacham Blvd., Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas 76137&hyph;4298.

That action was prompted by two incidents involving a cracked M/R blade root fitting lug (root fitting lug). Bushing movement in the M/R blade lead-lag link lugs may have caused fatigue cracks in the lead lag link assemblies. The lead lag link assembly attaches to the M/R blade. Any cracks in the lead lag link assembly, the M/R blade, the MR blade root fitting, or any movement of the bushing, could create an unsafe condition. That condition, if not corrected, could result in failure of a M/R blade assembly or a M/R hub lead-lag link assembly, loss of a M/R blade, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the issuance of that AD, additional incidents of cracks in the M/R blade root fitting (root fitting), and M/R blade skin have been reported. Additionally, the manufacturer has discovered that in some M/R blade assemblies, the M/R blade root fitting bushing (bushing) can loosen and contribute to fretting-induced fatigue cracking in the root fitting lug. The root fittings and M/R blade skins are parts of the M/R blade assembly. Therefore, McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Company issued a revised Service Information Notice No. HN&hyph;211.4, DN&hyph;51.6, EN&hyph;42.4, and FN&hyph;31.4 (SIN), dated January 27, 1993, that requested operators mark each root fitting lug and bushing with a slippage mark and thereafter inspect for slippage on each root fitting lug and bushing. The revised SIN, dated January 27, 1993, includes the M/R blade assembly and M/R hub lead-lag link assembly inspections contained in the preceding versions of the SIN, dated August 5, 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The government refuses to clarify the mysterious  manner in which Edgar Fernandez Lazcano, assistant to Isaac Oso  Chavarria, traveled to Costa Rica to be questioned by the DEA.    Justice Minister Rene Blattman says he has no information  about this case, which is being investigated by the Ministry of  Government. He also does not know whether or not Edgar  Fernandez Lazcano was forbidden to leave the country. The  minister said, however, this is not very important, as anyone in  Bolivia can disobey the prohibition on leaving the country and  get out of Bolivia. The migration under secretary certainly did  not like Blattman's statement.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified migration under secretary]  Did the justice minister say that? Well, he must send me a list  of the names of people who left the country during my  administration in defiance of an order to remain.    [Unidentified corresponedent] Was Fernandez Lazcano  prohibited from leaving the country?    [Under secretary] Fernandez Lazcano? No, he received no  order prohibiting him from leaving the country. Until the  moment he left -- because it is not known when he left the  country -- there was no order prohibiting him from leaving the  country. [end recording]    If Fernandez Lazcano was not forbidden from leaving the  country, he could have left the country legally, with a  passport. The migration office says he did not use it:    [Begin under secretary recording] I can tell you that his  departure was not registered in any airport controlled by the  Migration Undersecretariat. The only thing I can tell you is  that if he left the country he may have left using one of the  many methods used by people linked to drug trafficking, through  clandestine air strips or by land. [end recording]    Meanwhile, the president of the Republic has met with  several  ministers to discuss this subject, and it has been reported that  in the next few hours a communique will be released to the  public explaining how Edgar Fernandez Lazcano left Bolivia.    In turn, the DEA was criticized in political circles for  kidnapping Edgar Fernandez Lazcano to question him in Costa  Rica. Bolivian congressmen agree that the DEA owes an  explanation to Bolivia.    [Begin Deputy Fernando Kieffer Guzman recording] Yes, of  course, I think they acted excessively and arbitrarily, which  must be countered as soon as possible; otherwise, this will  unnecessarily affect U.S.-Bolivian relations, as there was no  real reason for this action. The two objectives sought by the  DEA in this case could have been met: that Fernandez Lazcano be  a witness in court, and also in the lawsuits that are being  followed in the United States. Right? Yet this was a  precipitate, clumsy action. It was an abuse. [end recording]    MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] Deputy Fernando  Campero said that in the case of Edgar Fernandez Lazcano,  Bolivian sovereignty is being trampled upon.    [Begin Campero recording] The amendment approved some time  ago by the U.S. Congress, which authorizes the kidnapping of  individuals linked to drug trafficking even without the  knowledge or coordination with the officials of the foreign  country, represents an offense to the dignity of our countries.  I think that in this joint struggle carried out by the United  States and all the countries against this scourge of drug  trafficking, we should seek mechanisms of coordination and  mutual respect. [end recording]    So far, neither the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nor the  Ministry of Government have made statements on this sensitive  subject.</p>

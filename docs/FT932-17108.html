			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / London action is latest in series: As commuters across Britain face widespread disruption, FT writers assess the strategies of the unions TODAY'S 24-hour bus strike is the latest in a series of stoppages prompted by government moves to privatise London Buses. Unions say the action has been triggered by management cost cuts following the government's decision to change the system of grants paid to London Buses ahead of next year's privatisation and deregulation. The 11 subsidiaries of London Buses share a government block grant of about Pounds 120m a year. From yesterday all routes that receive a grant were put on minimum subsidy contracts, under which bus operators estimate cash fares and the proportion of 'off-bus income' and then bid for a minimum subsidy to cover the gap. London Buses, anxious not to lose more routes to independent operators, has hinted to its subsidiaries that it does not want to agree contracts at costs significantly higher than those of private companies. Of London's 28 operators, 17 are in private hands and all expect to run services today in spite of the stoppage. London Buses' subsidiaries, aware of the growing private sector competition, have told their employees that changes in terms and conditions are essential to avoid job losses. The 12,800 employees at the subsidiaries have been asked to sign new employment contracts agreeing to changes in conditions involving cuts of Pounds 30 to Pounds 60 a week on basic gross pay. In addition, staff were asked to work between three and five extra hours a week. Those not complying with the new contracts would be sacked. Managers have also warned that pensions would be frozen with privatisation and it would be up to individual operators to make new arrangements. The TGWU general union initially recommended that staff should not sign the new contracts. Mr Ken Fuller, TGWU district officer for buses, said staff started to sign them because they feared losing their jobs. The union then recommended that if members accepted the contracts they should attach a disclaimer saying they wanted to keep their jobs but on terms negotiated by their union. Ninety-nine per cent of bus drivers have accepted the new contracts. On February 19 a ballot resulted in two thirds agreeing to industrial action. Mr Fuller said: 'People signed the acceptance forms to protect themselves as individuals but they have taken a collective decision to resist them.'</p>

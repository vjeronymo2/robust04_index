			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WAY OF COMMAS  </P> <P> I must acknowledge that those portions of my book, "The Way of the Hunter,"  that Schuyler Ingle (Book Review, Dec. 4) did not find too tiresome a chore to  read, he did seem begrudgingly to enjoy; and I do appreciate that. It is  regrettable, though, that he found so much of the rest of it such "convoluted  slogging." It's a shame that the proper use of grammar forced me to "scatter"  all those commas through the text, as he so coyly put it, "like thousands of  little kisses." It's a pity I was unable to convey complex ideas in as  simplistic a fashion as he would have liked.  </P> <P>  It just might be, though, that there are other readers at large who would not  find the task nearly so grueling.  </P> <P> I would also like to note that the book, rather than the 180 pages in length  that Ingle indicated, is with bibliography and index actually 223 pages long,  and contains more than 60 photo illustrations.  </P> <P> THOMAS McINTYRE  </P> <P> Hunting Editor  </P> <P> Sports Afield  </P> <P> magazine  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STUDY AUTHORIZED ON USE OF RIVERBEDS FOR  HIGHWAY  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission Wednesday authorized a  $100,000 study of the feasibility of allowing car pools, buses and trucks to  travel the beds of the Los Angeles River and the Tujunga Wash in order to  relieve congestion.  </P> <P> The six-month study will consider a proposal by Assemblyman Richard Katz  (D-Sepulveda) to use the riverbed as a highway during rush hours on days when  there is no threat of flooding.  </P> <P> The commission voted to oppose a bill by state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles)  that would require the state to plan the river as a park and would ban the  commission from studying it for transportation.  </P> <P> Torres and some environmentalists contend the river should be a verdant park,  but Katz and others see it as a roadway that could be used as a park on  evenings and weekends.  </P></p>

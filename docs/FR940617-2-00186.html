The complete application is available for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicant's Representations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicant, a Massachusetts business trust, registered as an open-end, diversified management investment company on August 12, 1981, by filing a notification of registration on Form N&hyph;8A pursuant to section 8(a) of the Act. On the same date, applicant filed a registration statement on Form N&hyph;1A under the Securities Act of 1933 and pursuant to section 8(b) of the Act. The registration statement was declared effective on March 12, 1982. Applicant's public offering commenced soon thereafter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. On January 19, 1994, the board of trustees of applicant, including a majority of trustees who were not interested persons of applicant, approved a plan of reorganization (the ``Plan''). The Plan provided that applicant would transfer all its assets and stated liabilities to the Wright Managed U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund (``Treasury Fund''), a series of The Wright Managed Income Trust (a Massachusetts business trust), in exchange for shares of Treasury Fund. Pursuant to rule 17a&hyph;8, applicant's trustees determined that the sale of applicant's assets to Treasury Fund was in the best interests of applicant's shareholders, and that the interests of the existing shareholders would not be diluted as a result. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Applicant and Treasury Fund may be deemed to be affiliated persons of each other by reason of having a common investment adviser. Although purchases and sales between affiliated persons generally are prohibited by section 17(a) of the Act, rule 17a&hyph;8 provides an exemption for certain purchases and sales among investment companies that are affiliated persons of each other solely by reason of having a common investment adviser, common directors, and/or common officers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Preliminary copies of proxy materials to solicit shareholder approval of the reorganization were filed with the SEC on January 28, 1994. Definitive proxy materials were distributed to applicant's shareholders of record as of February 28, 1994, and filed with the SEC on March 10, 1994. At a meeting of shareholders of applicant held on March 28, 1994, applicant's shareholders approved the Plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. On March 31, 1994, the reorganization was consummated. Applicant transferred all its assets to Treasury Fund in exchange for shares of beneficial interest in Treasury Fund and the assumption by Treasury Fund of the stated liabilities of applicant. The exchanges were made at net asset value determined as of the close of business on March 30, 1994. As of such date, applicant had an aggregate net asset value of $16,978,270.79. Each of applicant's shareholders received shares of Treasury Fund that represented the same aggregate net asset value as the shares of applicant owned by such shareholder immediately before the reorganization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Applicant and Treasury Fund assumed their own expenses in connection with the reorganization. Applicant incurred legal, accounting, and printing and mailing expenses in the approximate amounts of $12,200, $2,500, and $1,300, respectively. Treasury Fund incurred reorganization expenses for legal and accounting services of $12,200 and $2,500, respectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6.

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Daf workers accept pay freeze to 1995 THE workforce at the Leyland Daf truck assembly plant at Leyland, Lancashire, has accepted a pay freeze to the end of 1994 and a package of far-reaching reforms in working practices in support of the management bid to rescue the plant. The management buy-out team, led by Mr John Gilchrist, the managing director, is the frontrunner to take over the Leyland Daf truck operations, which went into administrative receivership in February as part of the financial collapse of Daf, the Anglo-Dutch commercial vehicle maker. About 700 jobs at the truck assembly plant would be saved by the proposed management buy-out. The buy-out bid does not include a further 350 Leyland Daf jobs at the nearby components plant, technical centre and test track, for which a separate management buy-out is being planned. The truck plant management said yesterday that the workforce had voted unanimously to back the pay and conditions deal. Under the terms of the deal the truck plant would adopt team-working and there would be 'totally flexible working arrangements' with no demarcation lines. All employees would be classed as staff, and there would be 'single-table bargaining' with the trade unions. 'These arrangements and ways of working are at the leading edge of European manufacturing practices,' Mr Gilchrist said last night. The unions had made clear that 'the agreements reached are on offer only to the MBO team and are a clear sign of their support for the buy-out team,' he said. The deal on working practices incorporates many of the reforms already introduced or sought by other vehicle makers in the UK. There will be no clocking in and out, there will be a single-status car park, and salary payments will be made 13 times a year direct to employees' bank accounts. The deal on flexibility over working hours is expected to set a new standard in the UK motor industry, with agreement for hours to be varied by up to 20 per cent a week - without overtime compensation. The working week has been set at 37 hours, but hours worked up to 45 a week would also be paid at standard time without any overtime pay. If weekly hours were reduced to 29 hours, workers would receive a day off at basic pay. Pay was last increased at the plant by 3.5 per cent in January, the first increase since September 1990. The new pay freeze will apply to the beginning of 1995.</p>

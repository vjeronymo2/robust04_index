			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (15): Attractive traffic rights - Lloyd Aereo Boliviano state airline Lloyd Aereo Boliviano (LAB), the state airline, may not be the first, or the largest, state industry to be capitalised, but it may well be the most controversial. Repeated strikes have indicated labour opposition to the planned sale of shares and transfer of management of the 69-year-old enterprise - one of the oldest airlines in the world. Perhaps more interesting than the airline's assets - the average age of its nine fully-owned aircraft is more than 21 years - are its attractive traffic rights throughout the hemisphere. LAB presently serves its immediate neighbours as well as the US. Venezuela, Panama, Uruguay and Mexico. Other international routes not in use include those to Germany, Spain, Holland, Cuba, Colombia and Ecuador. LAB had total assets in 1993 of Dollars 153m, yet booked total long-term liabilities of Dollars 56m. The company's 1991 net profit of Dollars 2.5m dropped to a net loss of Dollars 11.8m and Dollars 13.3m in 1992 and 1993 respectively, largely due to big spending on marketing. The state holds 97.83 per cent of the shares in LAB, with American Airlines owning 1 per cent and a nominal labour participation equalling 0.1 per cent. By mid-November the Ministry of Capitalisation will have chosen an investment bank and a regulatory adviser. The final bid on an expected 49 per cent share in LAB is to be made between March and May 31 of next year. According to Mr Javier Burgos, secretary of capitalisation and investment, potential buyers will have no interest in a majority share because they would lose the usual benefits conferred to a national airline both domestically as well as in international air traffic agreements. A rather innovative aspect of the LAB capitalisation programme is the variety of investment options given to the prospective buyer. Besides making a cash offer, investors can bid in form of goods or services, such as aircraft or reservation systems. 'With this added benefit we hope to attract even more potential investors,' says Javier Burgos. Unlike the other state enterprises on offer, LAB's sale does not require any additional legislation. Due to competition by the private Aerosur, which inaugurated service two years ago, LAB's privatisation would not violate existing anti-monopoly legislation. LAB holds a 65 per cent share of Bolivia's international airline market ahead of American Airlines and Brazil's Varig. In the domestic market, LAB has been losing ground to Aerosur but still holds a 59 per cent share. Government officials further underscore the carrier's low labour costs, its highly trained technical staff, and its potential to improve aircraft utilisation. With Bolivia's strategic location in the centre of South America, its promoters envision the under-employed airport of Santa Cruz becoming a type of regional hub. President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada says 'it would be a natural hub,' but admits, 'we don't generate enough of our own traffic.' He adds: 'We have this Dollars 250m airport in Santa Cruz, which only operates 15 minutes per day.' A previous attempt to sell LAB in 1992 failed, due to what the government deemed was an unacceptable offer by Iberia. The Spanish carrier had allegedly offered Dollars 20m for LAB with an option to withdraw from the deal within a two-year trial period. A recent government invitation to interested buyers to attend a 'brain-storming session' found little response and had to be cancelled. Yet Mr Edgar Saravia, senior official at the ministry of capitalisation, says the problem is not LAB, but rather that many European airlines are busy themselves in restructuring their operations, while others are simply cash-strapped. 'In January we will aggressively hit the campaign trail, perhaps having to offer other finance options or a management contract combined with a lower stake in the company.'</p>

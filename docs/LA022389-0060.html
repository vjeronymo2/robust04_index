			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> WHEATCROFT AND CSUN SUBMERGE WAVES, 5-4  </P> <P> Right-handed pitcher Wayne Helm of Pepperdine was the featured attraction for  professional scouts, but Robert Wheatcroft of Cal State Northridge all but  stole his show Wednesday in Malibu.  </P> <P> Wheatcroft, a senior right-hander, pitched Northridge to a 5-4 nonconference  victory over the Division I Waves and earned high marks from two Baltimore  Orioles scouts who were in attendance.  </P> <P> Helm (1-2) and Wheatcroft (4-0) dueled until the ninth inning, when Chae-Ho  Chong hit a two-run home run to cap a four-run rally that gave CSUN a 5-2 lead.  </P> <P> The Waves (4-6) closed to within a run on Richard Barnwell's two-run homer to  left in the ninth, but Wheatcroft retired the next two batters to seal the win.  </P> <P> "Pepperdine is a legitimate Division I team and we are not going to play better  teams than this," CSUN Coach Bill Kernen said. "This is the biggest win for  this team by far this year."  </P> <P> Northridge (7-1) has won three consecutive games against Division I opponents  going into its California Collegiate Athletic Assn. opener at Cal State Los  Angeles on Friday.

In doing so it has not  sought the approval of the Saudi telecommunication authorities  and annexed frequencies earmarked for the country's public  portable telephone service.    The network, constructed in only three weeks, was first used  for the December meeting of the Gulf Co-operation Council in  Riyadh, where each delegate was presented, on arrival, with a  portable GSM [Global System for Mobile Communications]  telephone. The GSM standard has been adopted by European  countries for the next generation of portable phones.    Siemens confirmed that the system had been constructed for  the Royal Palace and that its technicians were extending the  network to 30,000 lines covering Riyadh, Jeddah, Dammam and  other Saudi Arabian cities.    Mr Helmut Muller, the German group's director of  international sales for mobile networks, said the intention was  to spread use of the system to groups outside the Royal Family.  The whole system would be completed by April this year.    He rejected suggestions that the network would cost between  $40 and $50 million but would not be drawn on the price. A  50,000 line system built for Kuwait cost $30 million, according  to industry analysts; that suggests that if $40 million was  close to the real price for the Saudi system then the royal  family paid heavily for the speed and secrecy with which the  system was constructed.    The royal network was uncovered last week by a journalist  specialising in telecommunications. Mr Damian Peachey happened  to switch on his mobile phone while staying in Riyadh and was  puzzled to see a message on the screen that the network was live  but he was forbidden to use it. He knew Saudi Arabia had no  public mobile phone network, but the message suggested there  must be a cellular radio system operating in Riyadh on the GSM  standard.    Telecommunications, particularly mobile telephone systems,  is  a touchy subject in Saudi Arabia where the demand for mobile  telephones is huge. There is a mobile network of sorts, based  on obsolete analogue technology and extending to only 20,000  lines, 4,000 of which are reserved for the exclusive use of the  Royal Family. The only way to obtain a mobile line is to buy  one from another user at prices said to reach SR [Saudi riyals]  130,000 (28,500 pounds).    GSM, based on computer technology where messages are  transmitted as a series of electronic pulses, is the technology  of choice for the Gulf states. Users can "roam" freely and use  their phones across national boundaries. Siemens has installed  GSM systems in Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and Morocco.    There is a general shortage of telephone lines in Saudi  Arabia. Saudi Telecom is asking for bids for a further 500,000  lines of which 100,000 will be GSM. The contract is expected to  be announced in May and a consortium of Ericsson of Sweden and  NEC of Japan is thought to be in the lead.</p>

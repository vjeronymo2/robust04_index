			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Best buys for top-up pensions Few employees in company schemes retire on a full pension, yet only one in 10 takes advantage of a tax-efficient method of topping up their benefits - additional voluntary contributions (AVCs). But those who do pay AVCs may not be aware of the stark contrast in returns available from different providers. A survey* by actuary Bacon &amp; Woodrow shows that if you had invested Pounds 50 a month over 10 years to last December 31 in the most popular type of AVC fund, the final payout could be anything from Pounds 11,500 to Pounds 15,250 depending on the chosen provider. Over five years, Pounds 50 monthly could have achieved annual returns as high as 20 per cent or as low as 6.4 per cent. An AVC is a company pension arrangement set up by the employer to run in conjunction with the main scheme and to allow members to boost their benefits. All employers with standard pension schemes must offer an AVC facility. Most AVC schemes are run by life offices and building societies. AVCs are as tax-efficient as the main company scheme. There is full relief on contributions, tax-free growth of the fund and, in some cases, a tax-free cash lump sum at retirement (depending on when you started payments). As with the main scheme, the pension itself is taxed as income. Company AVCs are normally chosen by the trustees of the main scheme. But Nigel O'Sullivan, senior investment consultant with Bacon &amp; Woodrow, says: 'Trustees often neglect to review the performance of the AVC scheme. Nor do they always check to see if there is a financial penalty for scheme members who stop regular payments due to early retirement.' In the past, schemes offered AVCs to employees only when they were close to retiring. Now, though, you can pay however much you want whenever you want provided you stick to overall Revenue limits - up to 15 per cent of salary for main scheme and AVC contributions combined (restricted for some higher earners). But you must belong to a company scheme to take advantage of AVCs and only employees can contribute, not employers. Most AVCs operate on a money-purchase basis. This means that although the main scheme pension might be linked to salary, the AVC scheme invests your contributions to provide a fund which is used at retirement to buy an annuity from a life office. This annuity provides a guaranteed income for life, but its value depends mainly on the investment performance of the chosen AVC fund. There are three main investment options under AVCs, although schemes do not have to offer a choice. Deposit accounts are similar to normal building society savings accounts. With-profit funds bring some of the risks and rewards of stock market investment, and unit-linked funds more of both. Free-standing AVCs (FSAVCs) are similar to company AVCs but the employee has an individual contract with the provider. One disadvantage, however, is that the employee must bear the cost of the provider's charges. With company AVCs, these charges often are borne by the employer. With 100 FSAVC plans on offer, it is essential to seek independent advice to get the best value for money. *Available from Bacon &amp; Woodrow, St Olaf House, London Bridge City, London SE1 2PE.

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report GOLD fell to fresh six-year lows in early trading on the London bullion market before recovering on bargain hunting and short covering after Comex opened. The Comex June gold futures contract was at midday holding above lifetime lows struck earlier, but dealers said the market was still vulnerable. New York analysts believe Dollars 335 a troy ounce is an important support point for bullion, and peg next support at Dollars 333, then Dollars 330. Should bullion fall below those levels nearby Comex gold will drop to Dollars 320, they predict. Some see a fall to Dollars 300. Tame inflation, the recession and a lack of investor interest continue to weigh on sentiment. London COFFEE and COCOA ended another loss-laden day with little sign of an imminent turnaround in the current bearish trend, traders said. Cocoa ended near the day's lows, while coffee trimmed losses slightly but showed no conviction to rally into the plus column. Origin sales, particularly from the Ivory Coast, continued to be cited as the reasons behind the current slide in both markets to historical lows. The nearby July cocoa contract closed at Pounds 586 a tonne, down Pounds 12 on the day but above the new 16 1/2 -year low of Pounds 581. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>   [Text] Patriarch Deng Xiaoping is likely to spend the  Lunar New Year in Shanghai, where he is expected to give another  series of instructions on reform.    However, a major theme of Mr Deng's instructions will be  "party construction", or strengthening the authority of  Communist Party organizations.    The patriarch will also lend his prestige to fighting  regionalism, which has affected the ability of central  authorities to implement market reforms.    Aside from Mr Deng such senior cadres as premier Li Peng and  the former member of the Politburo Standing Committee -- Song  Ping, have recently emphasized strengthening the role of the  party.    As reported in the SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST last week, Mr  Deng went to the Shanghai region this month to hear briefings on  the economic situation by local leaders.    Two Hong Kong publications yesterday reported that the  patriarch had also gone to cities and resorts near Shanghai  including Nanjing and Wuxi.    Moreover, on his way to the south, Mr Deng had passed  through  Jinan and talked to leaders of Shandong.    The 89-year-old patriarch also received medical attention at  a military hospital at Taihu Lake near Wuxi.    The publications said Mr Deng discussed improving party  organizations and "reforming the thinking" of leading party  cadres.    Chinese sources said yesterday Mr Deng had spearheaded  another round of a crusade centred on party construction,  campaigns related to which have been waged almost every year  since the Tiananmen Square crackdown.    "Comrade Xiaoping is worried that party organizations are  crumbling because of the craze of doing business," an informed  source said.    "Moreover, central party leadership is faltering and the  patriarch fears that radical reforms cannot be implemented  without a strong centre."    While in Shanghai in mid-December, Mr Deng had spoken out on  the need to "remove all obstacles on the path of reform" as well  as "cutting down on regionalism and individualism".    The patriarch also had sessions with party bosses from  neighboring cities including Nanjing, Suzhou Wuxi, Xuzhou and  Lianyungang.    Following his practice of the past three years, Mr Deng is  expected to stay in Shanghai until the Lunar New Year.    Meanwhile, the national press yesterday quoted premier Li as  calling for improved party organizations more obedience to  central edicts.    "Party organizations of all levels must see to it that they  bring into full play their role as a powerful fighting force and  that party members play a role as vanguards and models in their  work," Mr Li said.    "We must unify our thinking, and act in keeping with the  party Central Committee."    XINHUA (the New China News Agency) reported that this week,  Mr Song, a conservative elder, toured Guangdong with a view to  promoting "the construction of spiritual civilization and the  party."</p>

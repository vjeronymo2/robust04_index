			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Economics Notebook: G7 winces as Brady revives a bad memory POLITICIANS are blessed with short memories. For how else can one explain the insistence of Mr Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary, that Germany should reduce its interest rates? The days leading up to yesterday's Washington meeting of officials from the Group of Seven leading industrial countries have been horribly reminiscent of events around the time of the 1987 annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. A similar row then between Germany and the US over high German interest rates unsettled financial markets and helped pave the way for the October 1987 stock market crash. However, last week's exchanges between the US Treasury and the German authorities might not be as threatening as the 1987 row (between Mr James Baker, Mr Brady's predecessor as Treasury secretary, and Mr Gerhard Stoltenberg, then German finance minister). Mr Brady, even when he says unpalatable things, is a model of US old-money courtesy. And despite last week's 53.21 point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average, current stock market values are not so exaggeratedly high as at that time. But the US Treasury's high profile campaign for lower rates has unsettled officials from the other G7 countries who are dismayed at the way in which Mr Brady has broken the group's unwritten rule of verbal discipline. To understand Mr Brady's action it is necessary to look at the G7 through a political prism. The differences between the US and Germany focus on domestic politics rather than economic theories. They are a useful reminder that high-flown talk of international policy co-ordination counts for little when a politician's survival is at stake. The politician in question is President George Bush, who does not face re-election until late next year, but is sufficiently concerned about the US recession to push hard for growth. It is Mr Brady's job to deliver that growth for his president. The approach of yesterday's G7 meeting has, therefore, seen the US expressing dark fears about global capital needs and high real interest rates, especially in Europe, while ignoring the advice of institutions such as the IMF about how best to combat these perils. Whereas the IMF has urged tough fiscal policies on deficit countries such as the US to rebuild national savings, Washington has called instead for lower interest rates. The political impossibility of the US getting to grips with its budget deficit or raising taxes to boost national savings explains its use of the interest rate argument. Its demands have allowed the US administration to demonstrate that it is doing something to help recession-hit businesses and families by putting pressure on the Federal Reserve and other central banks to ease policy. But not only is the policy risky in terms of financial markets, it is also unlikely to succeed. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, will have the recent defeat of the German Christian Democrat Party in the Rhineland Palatinate election firmly in his mind. That defeat was a revolt by an electorate that is having to pay more taxes for German unification. Mr Waigel, like Mr Brady, cannot take fiscal action to reduce interest rates. Behind him stands the powerful figure of Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the Bundesbank president, who is not going to compromise the central bank's counter-inflation stance. Mr Pohl also rejects the US argument that easier money would ease a global savings shortage. Looking further ahead, Mr Pohl will not want to compromise his plan for an independent European central bank by demonstrating that the Bundesbank can bend to political pressure. It remains to be seen whether the differences over interest rates blow over or whether they upset the financial markets. But the controversy has brought to mind the ad hoc nature of the G7 and how difficult it is to co-ordinate policies. **** Political considerations of a different sort seem to lie behind Japan's sudden decision to support a new allocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDR). This is the reserve asset issued and managed by the IMF. An SDR allocation has long been supported by many developing countries and a few industrialised nations, such as France, to provide financial resources to the Third World. But the more powerful IMF members, including the US, the UK and Germany, have considered such ideas for pumping additional reserve assets into the global economy as unnecessary. They argue that there is no shortage of liquidity in the world. Money is available, although expensive. To allocate SDRs - a basket currency made up of the US dollar, yen, D-Mark, sterling and French franc - would do nothing to reduce the cost of international funds, as they cost interest. Because SDRs are allocated unconditionally, an issue could damage efforts to ensure that financial support for Third World countries is linked to economic policy conditions. So why has Japan stuck its neck out in favour of such a move? One thought is that the proposal could deflect pressure on Japan to take on more of the financial burden of creating a new post-Gulf war order. According to the IMF World Economic Outlook, Japan will be the only G7 country to run a substantial current account surplus this year. In view of large demands for capital in eastern Europe, the Middle East and Latin America, Japan could find itself under increasing pressure, from the US among others, to contribute more financial support to the global economy. The Japanese plan has also put Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, in something of a pickle. He has welcomed the move, not least because one of the objectives of the IMF is to promote the SDR. But Mr Camdessus would like to see any additional resources targeted on needy countries rather than distributed to all IMF members. There are also fears that an SDR allocation could hinder ratification of last year's agreement to boost IMF resources through a 50 per cent increase to around Dollars 180bn (Pounds 107bn) in the Fund's quotas or membership subscriptions. Ever the diplomat, Mr Camdessus has already indicated how he expects to resolve this dilemma. He has called for an in-depth study of the SDR. This could delay Japan's plans and result in a reserve asset that differs considerably from the present SDR.</p>

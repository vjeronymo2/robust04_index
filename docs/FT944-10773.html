			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Small business management Policymakers frequently trot out the view that public support is needed if managers in the UK's smaller companies are to be competitive. Unfortunately, neither the government, nor consultants in the training-and-advice game, have dared ask whether such support actually works. That failure should be remedied by investigating what benefit, if any, this subsidised consultancy is providing. In a refreshing departure from its previous position, the Confederation of British Industry acknowledged this on Monday by questioning whether government spending on management development is being wisely focused. Picking up on research carried out by Warwick Business School earlier this year, the CBI warned that nobody knows whether taxpayers' money is well spent in this area. The point is not that there is proof that spending on management development does not work, but rather that the opposite presumption is unfounded. The warning is timely. Each year, the government indirectly spends more than Pounds 100m on management support - business counselling, export support, the Investors in People programme and a host of other schemes - mainly for owner-managed businesses. Most of this is from the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department for Employment and is delivered via Training and Enterprise Councils and Business Links - the network of one-stop advice shops being put in place across the country. The skills these organisations are trying to enhance are doubtless lacking in many smaller businesses. Some companies recognise this and pay a full market rate to consultants to help solve the problem. But when government peddles subsidised services, there is a danger companies are being encouraged to use programmes that do not work to tackle management issues that are not important. In that case, both the subsidy and the companies' own costs are all wasted. The CBI's questioning of management development spending is particularly timely given the advance of the Business Link network. Later this month, when London's application is approved, the government will be more than half way towards its goal of opening 80 Business Links in England. These new organisations may be keener to meet their targets for providing services - hours of consultancy given and numbers of companies supported - than they are to evaluate the benefits their customers derive. The CBI should be congratulated on questioning the worth of public support in this area. This is so quite apart from the potential for waste and economic distortion. Medium-sized companies increasingly provide the jobs big business is shedding. For this reason, they need to be helped in the most effective possible ways. More effort should be devoted to determining what kind of state-aided support for management development works best. Only then could taxpayers and medium-sized companies feel confident that the most effective possible assistance is on offer.</p>

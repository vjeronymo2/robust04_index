			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Chips with everything - New technology is transforming the traditional kitchen Scene 1: A London restaurant. The customer gives his order to the waitress who enters it on a hand-held computer. Thirty seconds later the customer changes his mind but the waitress replies 'I'm sorry, sir, the order is already in the kitchen.' Scene 2: Late at night in the chef's office. Having placed all his orders for tomorrow's deliveries by fax, the chef sits down to finalise plans for a special gastronomic dinner. He plugs into CompuServe and seeks advice on recipes from fellow chefs around the world. Scene 3: takes place wherever food and wine lovers have a computer and electronic mail. Looking for the most romantic restaurant in St Louis? Want to trade some Chateau Margaux? Forgotten the name of that wonderful Australian Pinot Noir you drank recently and need to find a retailer? The world of food and wine, always international, has gone electronic. Until the late 1980s most restaurants could not justify such investment. Computers were introduced slowly and proved themselves by legibly transmitting recipes around the kitchen. Then came fax machines to make ordering from suppliers easier (it is always worth taking a restaurant's fax number to confirm that important lunch). But the need to cut labour costs, maximise efficiency, monitor stock controls and improve accounting information has changed all that. Now even the Ritz's dining room, possibly London's most elegant, boasts an electronic point-of-sale terminal, albeit neatly encased in marble. One restaurant made possible by today's technology is Wagamama, WC1 (tel: 071-580 9365). This basement restaurant serves the most interesting inexpensive Japanese food in town and takes no bookings. It seats 104 but feeds 1,200 customers a day. It manages to do so because when it opened in 1992 it paid Pounds 25,000 for a Remanco ordering system (today's far more advanced version costs Pounds 15,000). These begin with the electronic order pad (they cost Pounds 990 each) which can be programmed with everything a restaurant can offer - size of steak, how it should be cooked, even whether the customer qualifies for an incentive scheme such as a happy hour. When the order is complete, the waitress presses the 'send' button and the order is transmitted by radio signals to a computer which stores all the information, backs it up and sends the separate elements to the various sections of the kitchen. Seconds later the order is printed out. At Wagamama small strips of paper spew out at the bar, noodle station, wok station and the station that prepares the side orders. The chefs pick these up and get to work. The advantage is not just speed of service but accuracy. Fewer specialist order takers have to be trained and there is a much lower risk of customers being served with a dish they did not order or being charged for something they never received. The system can fail. Twice in the past hectic 30 months Wagamama's system has gone down and the restaurant has had to resort to pen and paper. It is linked by modem to Remanco's headquarters so that a failure can be tracked down and corrected remotely. More fundamental are human oversights. One kitchen thought lunch was quiet when at 1.15pm it was still waiting for its first order. The printer had run out of paper. This type of electronic ordering generates huge amounts of management information: how much money each seat generates, how many customers each waiter serves, a breakdown of all the dishes sold and whether new dishes on the menu sell or not. And it is flexible. At Wagamama the philosophy is to deliver as quickly as possible and keep turning the tables. At other restaurants which want their staff to try and maximise a customer's spend, known in the trade as 'upselling', other ploys are introduced. When the waiter asks the console for the bill it responds 'Have you offered cigars and liqueurs?' At Rules, WC2, (071-836 5314) the chef can communicate to all the waiting staff just how many grouse, partridge or pheasant, are left and save the embarrassment of having to ask the customer for a reorder. One wonderful piece of technology I saw in action in the US over the summer was shown for the first time in the UK at this week's Restaurant Show. It is the Silent Paging System. When you arrive at a restaurant and find either that there is no table or your table is not ready, the receptionist hands you a small disc which you put in your pocket. When your table is clear the waiter sends a radio signal to the receptionist and she in turn presses a button which starts the disc vibrating in your pocket. Having enjoyed a short stroll, a drink in the bar or done some shopping, you walk back to find your table ready and waiting.</p>

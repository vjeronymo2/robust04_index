			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania  [UDMR] last week sent an aide memoire to the Council of Europe  regarding observance of the recommendations made by the Council  of Europe when Romania was admitted as a full member. This aide  memoire has been signed by UDMR President Bela Marko and  Executive President Csaba Takacs, the UDMR press bureau reports.    The document emphasizes that the UDMR supports, without  reservation, the recommendations made by the Council of Europe,  which it views as mandatory in the democratic transformation  process that is taking place in Romanian society. The aide  memoire sent to the rapporteurs for Romania in the Council of  Europe divides the recommendations into four categories to which  Romania has pledged to abide, but in the implementation of which  certain political forces -- that is Romania's Government -- do  not manifest the necessary political will: the signing and  ratification of certain international accords; problems  regarding rights of ethnic minorities; legislative problems; and  the law-governed state.    Without claiming to exhaust all problems, the document lists  those problems that, according to the UDMR, are expected to be  solved: Use of the mother tongue in the administration,  justice, and education of all grades; use of bilingual  inscriptions; ensuring equal chances for the assertion in the  economy, especially in the area of privatization; adoption of  the law on ethnic minorities and of the education law;  separation of the powers in the state; the independence of the  judicial power; decentralization; restitution of nationalized  church properties; the genuine independence of the audiovisual  media; the urgent solution of the situation of those who have  been sentenced on ethnic grounds; and so forth.    The UDMR believes that the solution of these problems is  indispensable for Romania's integration into European structures  and expresses the hope that the international body -- the  Council of Europe -- which has shown trust in Romania by  admitting it as a member with full rights will seek more  efficient ways and means to enable it to support our country, so  that Romania can be integrated in European structures, the UDMR  emphasizes, as cited by ROMPRES.</p>

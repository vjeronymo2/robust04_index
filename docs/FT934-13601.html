			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / London Motor Show at Earls Court THE NEW Saab 900, one of more than 30 models making their UK debut, was unveiled yesterday at the preview day for the London Motor Show at Earls Court, where makers and dealers again clashed, John Griffiths writes. Mr Alan Pulham, director of the National Franchised Dealers Association, which has 6,000 members, claimed 'phantom' sales reported by some leading carmakers were increasingly sending false signals to the government about the strength of the recovery in the new-car market. He also called for legislation to ban deeply discounted sales deals negotiated directly between manufacturers and large fleet customers, claiming that this could cut list prices of new cars by 5 per cent.

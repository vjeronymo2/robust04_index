			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Serhiy Zhurets, NARODNA ARMIYA commentator, </F> under the rubric "Point of View": "Is Sevastopol Not Doomed To  Share the Fate of Guantanamo?"]    [Text] The meeting of the  heads of state and heads of government of the CIS countries that  was held in Moscow is now behind us. In terms of results, two  aspects of the meeting will be of special significance to  Ukraine.    The first is that Ukraine has joined the economic union as  an  associate ember and signed all the economic agreements without  exception -- a fact that will significantly affect future  relations with all the members of the CIS.    The second is the attempt to untie the "Black Sea knot,"  which primarily affects relations between Ukraine and Russia,  which worsened following the incident in Odessa. Yet another  agreement was reached in Moscow on the division of the Black Sea  Fleet and on creating a Russian military base on Ukrainian  territory.    What are Kiev's prospects in light of this second aspect  following the Moscow meeting of the presidents of Ukraine and  Russia? Let us turn to Leonid Kravchuk's own words. And so...    Let us put it this way, what is ours and what is not  ours?    All the bases that are now located in Ukraine--Odessa,  Ochakiv, Izmayil, etc.--are on our land and they are seemingly  not at issue. As to ships, Ukraine will take as many as she  requires to meet her military strategic needs as outlined in her  military doctrine. (According to the Russian media, Ukraine lays  claim to 15-20 percent of the ships of the Black Sea Fleet.)    Where will the base of the Russian Navy be located?    We will know in ten days' time. This matter is to be decided  by a team of Ukrainian and Russian experts. Nonetheless, Leonid  Kravchuk showed his hand, as he put it, saying that although it  would be better not to locate this base in Sevastopol for  patriotic reasons, it is necessary to reckon with realities. And  the realities are that a significant portion of the Black Sea  Fleet will be Russian, and if the base of the Russian fleet is  located elsewhere, the Russian military will need to be provided  with living quarters, their children with schools, and their  wives with jobs. Given the financial capabilities of Ukraine, it  is unlikely that these could be made available in another city.    A Russian base on Ukrainian territory--is this to last  forever?    Based on what the president says, it is apparently only a  matter of leasing, and leases have expiration dates.  Consequently, the situation should not be dramatized.    How much will the ships of the Black Sea Fleet, which  will be handed over to Russia, cost, and what will be the price  tag on the lease of Ukrainian territory to be used as a Russian  military base?    According to the president, the cost of these ships still  needs to be added up. As far as the cost of the lease for basing  Russian ships is concerned, there are international rules and  principles for computing the price of such arrangements. We will  not be inventing something new. We will propose whatever these  calculations show the amount to be.    What will be the status of this Russian base?    After Ukraine takes her portion of ships from the Black Sea  Fleet and Russia takes hers, we will immediately have Russian  troops on Ukrainian territory, rather than the joint troops we  had up to now. And once the troops are Russian, their status  will need to be defined.    But the president's decision on this issue is not final.  This  decision has to be ratified by the Supreme Council.    ...Let me explain that this is what the president thinks,  but  the final decision regarding the fate of the Russian base will  depend, as Leonid Kravchuk noted, on the Supreme Council, whose  present numerical composition does not allow it to pass  legislation.    All of this is somewhat reminiscent of the second round at  Massandra. That was the first occasion on which Leonid Kravchuk  speculated about how profitable it would be for Ukraine to lease  the Sevastopol naval base to Russia. That is also when the first  calculations by independent experts appeared, in which the value  of the Black Sea Fleet was assessed at 30 billion dollars. (It  will be interesting to see what figure is presented this time.)  After Massandra, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev declared  the need for a military and political union between Moscow and  Kiev.    But all that was in the past. Yet the fact that the problem  of the Black Sea Fleet in the relations between Ukraine and  Russia is being raised over and over again leads one to give the  matter serious thought. These reflections indicate clearly that  even after last week's meeting in Moscow of the presidents of  Russia and Ukraine, it is premature to believe that this matter  has finally been resolved. Is there anyone who still fails to  understand that what is at stake is not only the fate of the  Black Sea Fleet? Is there anyone who still fails to understand  that behind the numerous recent promises by Russian  leaders--both military and civilian--to protect Ukraine from all  enemies from the south with an indivisible Black Sea Fleet, lies  a defining of global military policy issues that are of extreme  importance to Russia and which by no means exclude a military  and political union between Moscow and Kiev, even though today  this notion strikes us as absolutely impossible.    Yet who can say for certain today what will happen tomorrow?  And is the creation of a Russian base on the territory of  Ukraine a step that should be interpreted as giving in on a  smaller issue in order to protect what is of greater importance?  I do not know, I am not sure, especially as, unfortunately, we  are drawing no lessons from the past. And yet, there was plenty  to reflect upon: The outcome of the division of the foreign  assets of the former USSR; the still standing decree of the  Supreme Soviet of Russia (the soviet is gone, but the decree  remains) on the status of Sevastopol; Russia's position with  respect to nuclear disarmament in general and in the Odessa  incident in particular, which both sides recognize as over, even  though each side continues to believe its position to have been  correct.    What next?..    Even before the ink had dried on the documents signed by the  presidents in Moscow, a storm of accusations began to rage. The  very next day after the signing of the agreement, Vyacheslav  Kostikov, the Russian president's press secretary, issued a  statement concerning the Ukrainian reaction to the signing of  the agreement on dividing the Black Sea Fleet. It states that  following the meeting on settling the problems of the Black Sea  Fleet in stages, the Ukrainian side began to interpret this  agreement in a one-sided manner. Even before the negotiations  provided for by the agreement had begun, continues the  statement, the Ukrainian side began to put foward its own  formulas pertaining to the leasing, dates, and location for  basing the Russian Black Sea Fleet. The Russian side is forced  to remind [Ukraine] of the harsh realities and urgent tasks that  constitute the basis of the signed agreement.    I was particularly struck by the assertion: "Reckless words  and unbecoming acts with respect to something as sacred to the  [Russian] ation as the Black Sea Fleet."    Thus, even before the experts on the Black Sea Fleet picked  up their pencils and began their calculations, Vyacheslav  Kostikov gave an appealing demonstration that he is both  efficient and knowledgeable. It is quite clear who is speaking  through the press secretary. And when the Black Sea Fleet, which  was no more than a fleet only yesterday, suddenly becomes  "sacred to the Russian nation," we are well aware what arguments  are used to defend and protect those things that are sacred to a  nation. Thus the mention of harsh realities does not appear to  be entirely out of place. This, however, leads to the inevitable  conclusion that it is premature to speak of unravelling the  "Black Sea knot" anytime soon, especially with the prospect of a  foreign military base along the lines of Guantanamo appearing on  Ukrainian soil.</p>

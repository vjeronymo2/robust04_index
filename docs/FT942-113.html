			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Swedish buy doubles Charter's size: UK group offers Pounds 390m for Esab - Shares jump / Rights issue to raise Pounds 93m Shares in Charter jumped 51p to 714p after the UK diversified industrial group made a recommended offer worth Pounds 390m for Esab, the Swedish company that makes welding products. The acquisition, which would more than double the size of the UK group, is the culmination of a restructuring by Charter, which last year unwound its links with Anglo American Corporation, the South African mining group. Charter is offering Pounds 260m in cash for Esab and will assume Pounds 130m in debt. The offer is being funded from Charter's cash pile of Pounds 156m, plus the Pounds 93m proceeds of one-for-four rights issue at 560p per share. The UK's group's offer has already been accepted by Incentive, the industrial and investment group controlled by the Sweden's powerful Wallenberg family. Incentive owns 43 per cent of Esab's shares and 49 per cent of its voting rights. The sale is the latest step in an extensive reshuffle of the Wallenberg industrial holdings. Mr Jeffrey Herbert, chief executive of Charter, said: 'I understand that the other shareholders think it is a reasonable bid.' Esab, founded in 1904, has annual sales of Pounds 600m and employs 7,000 people in 27 countries. Charter said it was the world market leader in welding products, with a strong presence in all major industrial countries except Japan. Although recession has cut Esab's operating profits from Pounds 40m in 1989 to Pounds 7m last year, they are forecast to recover to Pounds 27m this year and Pounds 40m in 1995. Mr JeffreyHerbert said the acquisition would be earnings enhancing for Charter. This was partly because the investment offered a better return on the cash that Charter accumulated last year, after it won its independence by selling its stake in Johnson Matthey and then buying out Minorco's holding. Charter said the consumption of welding products closely followed the economic cycle, and the market was forecast to grow significantly over the next few years. Esab has reduced its west European workforce by 35 per cent over the past three years, and embarked on a product rationalisation programme. The UK group is likely to continue the restructuring, as well as looking at ways of using more of Esab's low-cost production capacity in Eastern Europe. Charter made the rights issue to bolster its balance sheet, given the assumption of Esab's debt and a Pounds 190m goodwill write-off. Post-acquisition, it will have gearing of about 49 per cent.

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Chile (5): Regulation inhibits ambition - Banking CHILE'S banks are not short of ambition. Some in the industry are pressing for the lifting of curbs on their domestic and international activities, with the aim of becoming a regional banking centre on the Swiss model. Whether the government will allow the banks to fulfil these ambitions is another question - not least because the central bank is still left with a tab of almost Dollars 4bn from bailing out the banking system a decade ago. Chile's banks feel they are at a disadvantage in the region, because of the restrictions that banking regulators place on their ownership of other companies, and on the setting up of branches and issuing of loans abroad. 'Our natural sphere of influence is Latin America,' says Mr Hernan Sommerville, vice-chairman of the Chilean Association of Banks. 'We want to go international. But we are allowing other banks in the region to position themselves at our expense. Every day that goes by is a wasted day,' he adds. 'The crisis of the 1980s has made our regulators cautious. But we came out of that crisis with a very solid banking system. If Chilectra and other industrial companies can buy companies in Argentina, then why can't we?' asks Mr Sommerville. On the domestic side, the banks want a share of the lucrative pensions and insurance businesses, and to undertake activities such as factoring and securitisation. Banks are allowed to sell pensions and insurance only through subsidiaries. The real prize for them would be the freedom to sell such products directly through their extensive branch networks. The banks are also facing challenges from other financial institutions on their own turf, with customers able to open savings accounts through the pension funds. The majority of Chile's 14 domestic banks, including the two biggest, Banco de Chile and Banco de Santiago, are still indebted to the central bank. Imprudent lending, particularly complex networks of inter-group loans, pushed the financial system over the brink in 1983. The central bank was forced to assume the banks' non-performing loans as the price for keeping it going. Debtor banks are now constrained to hand over 70 per cent of after-tax profits to pay off this so-called subordinated debt, which produced a total payment to the central bank of about Dollars 209m last year. 'The present situation on the subordinated debt creates a disincentive to make profits,' said a Santiago diplomat. 'If a bank has to hand over most of its profits to the central bank, then it's tempting to find something else to do with the money - such as building a state-of-the-art executive gym. At present payment rates, some banks may never clear their debts.' The central bank is also left bearing the bulk of the risk of indebted banks. The quandary for the government is: Should it allow banks to widen their field of activities while the subordinated debt issue is unresolved? Or should it use the prospect of liberalisation to pressure banks on the debt? In an election year with a busy legislative timetable, it may prove tempting to leave the dilemma for the next administration. 'An initiative to deal with the subordinated debt is really just waiting on political backing,' says Mr Joaquin Vial, chief economist at the finance ministry. Chile's banks, which experienced decreasing profitability after posting strong gains from non-operational activities such as debt-equity swaps in the late 1980s, bounced back last year. Net profits, after payment of subordinated debt obligations, grew by 23 per cent in real terms to 94bn pesos (Dollars 250m). Consumer loan business was particularly strong, growing at a rate of 50 per cent. With figures like these, it is hard to argue that the health of the system is at risk unless the banks are freed from their shackles. 'Other banks can grow, so the financing needs of the country can be met,' says Mr Daniel Tapia, adviser to the board of Banco BICE, a small boutique bank which did not sell its debt on to the central bank. 'The system is working so that I don't see why we can't go on like this for the next 50 years.' One suggestion is for healthy banks to take over the indebted ones in exchange for writedowns. Some banks may already be positioning themselves to benefit from such an outcome. In March this year, Banco O'Higgins, a small bank which has cleared its obligations to the central bank, merged with Banco CentroHispano, the Chilean subsidiary of Banco Central Hispanoamericano of Spain, to create Chile's third-largest banking group, with share capital of Dollars 140m. Banco O'Higgins is controlled by the Luksic group, a Chilean holding company owned by businessman Mr Andronico Luksic, which in turn owns 20 per cent of Banco de Santiago, the second-biggest bank. An initiative on the subordinated debt problem could set the stage for a further merger. But in the meantime Banco O'Higgins benefits from economies of scale - the combined operation is expected to reduce its total workforce by 15-20 per cent to around 2,000. It can also take advantage of its new partner's links with Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil, and its presence in the domestic pensions and insurance business. Chilean banks may find further consolidation a way of attaining at least some of their goals, even if more liberal banking laws and a subordinated debt initiative have to wait.</p>

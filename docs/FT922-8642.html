			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Rocket row ban on India, Russia THE US has announced limited trade sanctions against Russia and India in protest at the sale of Russian rocket technology to the Indian space authority, George Graham reports from Washington. The two-year ban covers sales of US goods needing an export licence, to Russia's space institute Glavkosmos or the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro). US imports from, or government orders with, Glavkosmos and Isro come under the same ban. A US official said Missile Technology Control Regime members had tried to dissuade Russia from selling the rocket motors to India; they believe it violates MTCR rules against missile technology proliferation. Technology for peaceful satellite launchers and ballistic missiles was almost indistinguishable; US sanctions applied where a rocket system could deliver a 500kg payload for 300km.</p>

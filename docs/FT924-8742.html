			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Lebanese PM vows to free south LEBANON'S billionaire prime minister declared war on corruption, inflation and illegal speculation yesterday and promised to push for an Israeli withdrawal from the south, Reuter reports from Beirut. Mr Rafik al-Hariri, a banking and construction tycoon with Saudi royal links, told MPs the main goals of his new government were to free the south and a return to prosperity. He said the cabinet was intent on 'liberating the land from occupation, liberating the state from the aftermath of the war, liberating the administration from corruption and the citizens from the effects of chaos' following 15 years of civil war. Mr Hariri, whose Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.5bn) fortune puts him among the world's 100 richest men, is expected to win a vote of confidence in parliament for his government by a landslide later this week. Speaking after pro-Iranian guerrillas had fired rockets into Israel and its 'security zone' in south Lebanon, Mr Hariri endorsed the right of the Lebanese to fight Israel's occupation by all means.</p>

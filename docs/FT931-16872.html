			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Only Ronald strides the frontiers  -McDonald's McDONALD'S customers might expect the same menu at any branch of the ubiquitous restaurant chain. But while Big Macs, quarter pounders with cheese and hot apple pies can be found everywhere, the chain does make concessions to cultural differences. Diners in Norway are served with MacLaks - a salmon sandwich invented to suit Norwegian tastes. In Italy, where the demand for fresh foods is strong, there are salad bars - the only place in Europe where McDonald's operates this service. Such differences mean that even in 1993 McDonald's does not believe in a 'European consumer'. Mr Martin Campiche, a Swiss now in London as McDonald's European communications director, says: 'For us, there is no such thing as the single European market.' This is reflected in the way the company is managed. McDonald's selects local business people to be its franchise holders in each country, and its products are manufactured by local suppliers. There is little cross-border movement of products. So, Mr Campiche says the removal of tariffs and customs controls will have limited impact for the company. 'We are an international company operating across Europe and we do business regardless of whether there is a single market or not.' One element common to all European promotions is Ronald McDonald, the company's clown mascot. Other than Ronald, advertising and marketing is organised on a local basis. 'Our marketing approach is always local. There is no single advertising campaign across Europe,' adds Mr Campiche. This is determined not only by cultural differences, but by operational ones. 'It depends on the media available. In France there are not so many billboards as there are in the UK, for example, so the focus of our advertising is different.'</p>

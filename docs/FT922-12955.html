			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Retail sales fall raises doubts over US recovery US retail sales fell 0.4 per cent last month, raising doubts about the momentum of the economic recovery. The decline was the first since October and the largest for seven months. It followed two months of surprisingly robust sales growth, which had raised hopes that the economy was emerging decisively from recession. Early estimates of car sales in April were also disappointing. In the first 10 days of the month, sales were estimated to be running at a rate of 5.8m units a year, down from 6.1m units at the end of March which analysts expected to hold steady. Many analysts now view March as a period of renewed sluggishness of demand and output. Employment hardly grew, and data for industrial production and housing starts due later this week are expected to be weak. Most forecasters, however, continue to expect a moderate economic recovery in the second quarter. The renewed signs of economic weakness - including a drop in the money supply - prompted the Federal reserve last week to signal an unexpected quarter point cut in short-term interest rates to 3.75 per cent. Last month's decline in sales appears to have been broadly based. Excluding cars - often a volatile component  - sales were down 0.6 per cent; department store sales fell 3.1 per cent and those of building materials and hardware declined 1.4 per cent. Sales of home furnishings, however, were up 2.1 per cent. The sales decline in March only partially offset a sharp recovery in consumer demand in January and February. For the first quarter as a whole, sales were 2.9 per cent higher than in the 1991 final quarter and 4.5 per cent higher than in the same period last year, which was artificially depressed by the Gulf war. The figures are adjusted for seasonal fluctuations but not for inflation. Analysts remain concerned by weak employment trends. Without an increase in jobs, personal incomes are likely to remain subdued, making a sustained increase in consumption hard to finance.</p>

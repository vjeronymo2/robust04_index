			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Arts: Pauk and Kirshbaum - Recital Radio 3's Monday lunchtime broadcasts, live from St John's, Smith Square, have long served us as reminders that serious concerts need not submit to the standard two-hours-plus format. Monday's recital by the violinist Gyorgy Pauk and the cellist Ralph Kirshbaum was a rewarding case in point. Here we had a piquant pairing: a near Old Master, as Pauk certainly is, known equally for his objective musical penetration and his virtuoso finesse - and a much younger, ultra-sincere American whose musicianly intimacies are his great trump. There is no violin-and-cello repertoire but the duo-sonatas of Ravel and Kodaly; but instead of doing the obvious and playing both those duo-sonatas, or exhuming some forgotten duo for the sake of variety, Pauk and Kirshbaum began with expansive unaccompanied solo works. The violinist chose neither lofty Bach or Bartok, nor brilliant Paganini or Ysaye, but old Prokofiev's Sonata op. 115 (1947) - designed for performance by student violins in unison, posthumously published and still virtually unknown. Prokofiev must have had senior students in mind, for his writing presupposes quite advanced technique and confident bravura attack. Under Pauk's bow it sprang to tough, pungent, wholly characteristic life: we can no longer count this as a negligible work. Kirshbaum opted for Bach's Suite no. 1 in G, and addressed it with as much authority as he invested it with personal, moment-to-moment feeling. These performances prepared the way superbly for Ravel's 1922 duo-sonata. Though it used to be thought dismayingly astringent, its stern merits have lodged it in the repertoire willy-nilly. Nothing could introduce it better than Prokofiev's robust, linear wit and Bach's leanly expressive patterns. Ravel's instrumental pair afforded him room for more exposed contrapuntal friction than he had previously dared, and Pauk and Kirshbaum gave the music full value without any mollifying gloss. The muscular shifts of tone in all the quicker tempi were stark, unlubricated, compelling. The scherzo suggested a properly baleful subtext - and yet the slow movement was wistful enough to betray a clear echo of the Andantino of Debussy's long-honoured string quartet.</p>

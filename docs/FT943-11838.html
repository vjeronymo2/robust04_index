			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Major's soliloquy The prime minister stood like Hamlet last night and proclaimed, in effect, 'T B or not T B: that is the question'. Tony Blair or not Tony Blair is the topic of today's British political discourse. The new Labour leader has pilfered some of the Conservatives' best thoughts, such as respect for the family, toughness on crime, and a willingness to embrace a dynamic market economy. He has added others, notably the notion that individuals benefit from strengthening the community. Although not stated to be such, last night's lecture to the European Policy Forum constituted Mr Major's considered response to Mr Blair. It was pedestrian. Mr Major recounted his government's record and listed its policies. The theme was that Conservatives favour limited government. He did not mention Mr Blair, who seeks to persuade us that more government would be beneficial. Conservatives, Mr Major intimated, regarded economic growth as an opportunity to reduce taxation. 'Others' (aka Blair) talked of using growth to pay for their pledges. This meant 'expropriating the benefits of growth from those who created it'. Mr Major will expand the 20 per cent income tax band one day. A better way of helping low earners would be to raise tax thresholds. Hamlet differs in another important respect from the Prince of Denmark. Mr Major rejects constitutional reform. Mr Blair promises an assembly for Scotland, and the ejection of hereditary peers from the Lords. The Labour leader would abolish the quango state, returning powers to elected authorities; Mr Major would expand the network of appointed boards that has sprung up since 1979. There is a genuine difference between those who regard the proliferation of health service trusts, grant-maintained schools and the like as decentralisation and those who regard the making of all these appointments by the central government as an enhancement of undemocratic central control. Since the finance is centralised, the Blair argument has strength. Somewhat petulantly, Mr Major reminded us that in the 1992 election campaign he repeatedly spoke of a welfare state that gave a 'hand up' rather than a 'hand out'. That is precisely Mr Blair's policy today; maddeningly for the prime minister, the leader of the opposition is the more famous for it. The same might be said of the aspiration to expand nursery education, when resources permit. This is a bipartisan slice of pie in the sky. Mr Major recalled Conservative successes, such as privatisation, sales of council houses, the Citizen's Charter, deregulation, and the drive to bring private finance into public projects. All were originally opposed by Labour; it is questionable whether any will be when the party is modernised by Mr Blair. In truth there are distinct differences between the two principal actors on the UK's political stage, but the audience may be forgiven for mixing them up.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with A.Ya. Livshits, leader of Russian Federation </F> president's group of experts, by ITAR-TASS observer Tamara  Zamyatina; place and date not given: "The Political Pendulum  Might Swing to the Left, But There Are Still Lots of Things for  Conservative Governments To Do in the Country, Aleksandr  Livshits, Leader of the Russian Federation President's Group of  Experts, Believes"]    [Text] [Zamyatina] Aleksandr Yakovlevich, the mutual  influence of politics and economics is an obvious concept.  Proceeding from this, how do you rate the unification of the  monetary systems of Russia and Belorussia [Belarus]?    [Livshits] I believe that Russia will lose nothing as a  result of this unification, if three conditions are fulfilled.  First, monetary and credit emission must be carried out only by  the Central Bank of the Russian Federation. Second, the Central  Bank must act on the basis of Russian legislation and be guided  by the maintenance of a weak inflationary regime on the  territories of both countries. The third condition is that  Belorussian money must be exchanged for rubles at the market  rate, not at one "hare" [Belarusian currency] to the ruble.    The first condition is provided for in the agreement which  has been concluded. There is no clarity with regard to the  second condition. The third has not been abided by. This means  that potential harm to Russia's economic interests cannot be  ruled out. Therefore changes to Belorussia's legislation are  needed for the real unification of the monetary systems.    [Zamyatina] What do you think: Will the union of monetary  systems with Belorussia promote the political integration of the  CIS states?    [Livshits] It is only in this case that it makes sense. If  politicians show signs of moving toward a confederation -- signs  equally strong as in the majority of citizens -- they will be  supported by the population. But political rapprochement is  something for the future, and national interests must not be  waived either in the future or in the present.    [Zamyatina] Since you do not rule out harm to Russia's  economic interests because of the political decisions being  adopted by our leaders, what is your forecast of the state of  the Russian Federation economy in the immediate future?    [Livshits] April and early May are a time for adopting  urgent decisions on the reform. The economy can no longer drag  the load of enterprises without prospects and hopeless debtors.  It will strain itself. Unlike 1992, an attempt to save them by  inflationary means will cost a monthly increase in prices at the  level of 40-50 percent. This would be a real disaster. We have  approached the threshold of crucial decisions comparable with  those made at the end of 1991. We must cross it within the next  few months: the implementation of the bankruptcy procedure, the  organization of promissory note circulation, the new stage of  privatization, the activation of Russian investors from the  private sector, the reinstatement of the management of state  enterprises, tough measures to strengthen financial discipline.    At present we are keeping monthly inflation down to 8-10  percent. By the yardsticks of developed countries, this is very  high. But by CIS yardsticks it is a record. Russia is now the  only CIS state where the population's incomes grew faster than  prices in the first quarter of 1994. The position of Russians  as a whole is also better in terms of the absolute standard of  living. In February 1994 it was possible to buy twice as much  meat in Moscow on the average monthly Russian wage as on the  average Belorussian wage in Minsk, and 32 times more than on the  average Armenian wage in Yerevan. So there.    [Zamyatina] Preparations are under way in Russia for the  parade of political forces scheduled for 1996. How do you rate  the chances of the aspirants to the post of leader of the state?    [Livshits] If you were to ask the question, which of them is  to be trusted, I would say: not those who covet power but those  who know what to do with it later and how to turn it into  something good for the country.    It cannot be ruled out that the political pendulum will move  to the left. Not just because of miscalculations by reformers,  who gave little thought to the costs of market transformations.  The point is that there has always been a great reserve of  social discontent in Russia. It still exists. Many people will  be found who believe that the market processes are not going the  way they should and result in unfair inequality. They will look  for reasons and explanations. Not within themselves but in the  social system and in bad power structures. This is the national  tradition, and it will not be possible to break it.    The wave of discontent which raised up right-wingers in  1991-1992 could well raise left-wingers in 1996.    This will be no tragedy if the reform of the economic  mechanism makes serious progress in the next two years and the  situation stabilizes. Maybe influential left-wing parties which  have nothing to do with the CPSU will be formed during this  time, and the voter will at last see that every communist is a  left-winger, but not every left-winger is a communist.    At present there are still lots of things for conservative  governments to do in the country. Only they are capable of  completing the edifice of a market economy. When it is ready  and starts to be filled with property, the time will come for  some internal replanning. Left-wingers will have nothing to do  at the summit of power until that which they will later share  has been accumulated -- share in fairness or according to some  other principle.    World practice unequivocally attests that the most  intelligent socialist, if, of course, he firmly follows his own  convictions, knows how to fight inflation far worse than the  shabbiest conservative.    While there is no stability, the country needs a strong  democratic power and a conservative, deideologized, professional  government. Everything else is only harmful.</p>

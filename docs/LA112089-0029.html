			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BATTLE OF GANDHIS HEATS UP IN HEARTLAND;  </P> <P> INDIA: THEY SHARE THE SAME LAST NAME AND A LEGACY AS GRANDSONS OF NATIONAL  HEROES. BUT RAJIV AND RAJMOHAN SHARE LITTLE ELSE ON CAMPAIGN TRAIL.  </P> <P> Not far from the billion-dollar fertilizer factory and the hi-tech jet  simulators at the Indira Gandhi Flying Academy -- indeed, just a few miles off  the paved roads that Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi has lavished on his celebrated  electoral district -- Rajmohan Gandhi stood in a clearing near the broken-down  village well, surrounded by the poorest of India's poor.  </P> <P> This was the other India, the wide-eyed farmers and shepherds were told by  Rajmohan's campaign workers, the real India that the prime minister's largess  has left behind.  </P> <P> And this rumpled and quixotic candidate wearing a simple garland of marigolds  and white cloth, they were told, was the other Gandhi -- the real Gandhi.  </P> <P> When at last he spoke through a crude, battery-powered megaphone, Rajmohan  Gandhi, grandson of India's legendary champion of freedom, Mohandas K. Gandhi,  made it clear why the Indian nation had dubbed this crucial race, "Gandhi vs.  Gandhi: The battle of the grandsons."  </P> <P> "The values that Mahatma Gandhi stood for have been flouted," he told the  dirt-poor villagers. "The values that Jawaharlal Nehru stood for also have been  flouted. And it is Nehru's own grandson, Rajiv Gandhi, who has done this to us.  </P> <P> "If we are to attain these ideals, Rajiv Gandhi must go. He has hurt the honor  of the nation by his involvement in corruption. He has hurt the democratic  institutions. He has gathered power in his own hands," he added. "I do not  compare myself to my grandfather. He was a saint and a revolutionary, and I am  just an ordinary man. But I have chosen to walk his road."  </P> <P> The course Rajmohan Gandhi has chosen is no less than a frontal assault on  India's beleaguered prime minister right in his own citadel, Rajiv Gandhi's  parliamentary constituency. The prime minister must win this parliamentary seat  during three days of national voting that begins next week if he is to hope to  continue governing what is widely hailed as the largest democracy on Earth.  </P> <P> And for most of the Indian nation, the battle for this 100-square-mile slice of  the Indian heartland called Amethi has become symbolic of the key issues in the  nation's most hotly contested general election ever -- Rajiv Gandhi's five-year  record versus the opposition's charge that the government he inherited from his  murdered mother in a 1984 wave of sympathy is now corrupt, inept and  far-removed from the realities of today's grass-roots India.  </P> <P> For Vishwanath Pratap Singh, Rajiv Gandhi's former defense minister who now  heads the increasingly popular National Front coalition of opposition parties,  the race in Amethi is an allegory, a staged confrontation between the  old-fashioned Gandhian morality of the Mahatma and the big-money, hi-tech power  of India's long-ruling Nehru dynasty. The Nehru dynasty is unrelated to the  Mahatma and acquired the Gandhi surname only after Nehru's daughter, Indira,  married an obscure politician named Firoze Gandhi.  </P> <P> "It is the real Gandhi versus the fake Gandhi," Singh said. "Rajmohan is the  best symbol of our struggle to restore the values of dignity to the country,  values which have gotten eroded under this government."  </P> <P> Independent analysts have gone a step further.  </P> <P> "We're saying the Amethi election is symbolic of the entire struggle for  democracy," said Rajni Kothari, a prominent Indian political analyst who, like  most of India's intellectuals, believes the time has come to end the rule of  one of the modern world's longest-lived family dynasties.  </P> <P> "Here you have Rajmohan Gandhi, a dedicated human-rights worker, going up  against a prime minister with a foreign wife and an alien government, which is  running a campaign of money power under a cloud of corruption."  </P> <P> Echoing the analysts, India's prestigious English-language daily newspapers  also have turned against Gandhi and his ruling Congress-I party, most of them  giving wide coverage to charges that the prime minister personally profited  from tens of millions of dollars in commissions paid in a $1.3-billion arms  deal with the Swedish armaments firm, Bofors.  </P> <P> Commenting on the Amethi race, the prestigious national daily, the Times of  India, ran a front-page cartoon recently depicting the ghosts of Mahatma Gandhi  and former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru sitting on two clouds in heaven.  </P> <P> "I hear my grandson is fighting to save the country," the Mahatma tells Nehru.  "And yours?"  </P> <P> "Just fighting," Nehru replies.  </P> <P> Clearly, Rajiv Gandhi and his ruling Congress-I party are fighting for their  political lives in what already is the most sophisticated and costly election  campaign in Indian history. By any account, Gandhi's party is spending tens of  millions of dollars on its nationwide fight to win a majority of India's 545  parliamentary seats.  </P> <P> And nowhere is that largess more visible than in Amethi, where Rajiv Gandhi  buttons, posters, flags, calendars and other slick paraphernalia are being  doled out by the thousands.  </P> <P> Every day, scores of factory-new jeeps, all fluttering the green, saffron and  white of the Congress-I flag, zip around the roads and dusty tracks of the  sprawling district, blaring Rajiv campaign slogans through state-of-the-art  audio systems.  </P> <P> To woo the vote, the ruling party has given away hundreds of campaign  videocassettes and, the opposition charges, even free television sets.  </P> <P> Such gifts are not new to Amethi, which has received more government  pork-barrel projects than any other district in the nation since 1981, when  Rajiv Gandhi won the seat that had been held by his brother Sanjay before his  death in a plane crash.  </P> <P> There is the $1-billion fertilizer plant, which provides 6,000 jobs. There are  now 15 large and 1,231 small-to-medium factories, and there's the Indira Gandhi  Flying Academy, India's only world-standard civilian facility for  commercial-pilot training, which is located inexplicably amid villages that  lack basic electricity.  </P> <P> "How can Amethi possibly vote against Rajiv Gandhi after all he has given  them?" asked retired Indian Airlines pilot Capt. Satish Sharma, a close friend  of Rajiv, himself a former pilot, and the man Gandhi has selected to run his  Amethi campaign.  </P> <P> "But it's not just all this development," Sharma added. "It's the rapport that  Rajiv has built up with these villagers. You know, in these remote villages,  they call him Rajiv Bhaiya -- elder brother Rajiv.  </P> <P> "And don't believe all this bad press about Sonia Gandhi, either. Here they  treat his wife as part of the family, also."  </P> <P> Indeed, it is Gandhi's Italian wife, Sonia, and their 17-year-old daughter,  Priyanka, who have shouldered the bulk of the village-to-village campaigning in  Amethi for the prime minister, who has been far too busy with a dizzying  schedule of helicopter, jet and limousine campaign tours for his party's  candidates around the nation.  </P> <P> Despite Sharma's boastful confidence, it remains unclear just how effective he  and the Gandhi women have been as campaigners. And, in spite of analysts'  consistent predictions that Rajmohan's austere campaign will never overcome  Rajiv's massive largess, Amethi's peasants themselves are questioning just how  secure the prime minister actually is in his own constituency.  </P> <P> Ram Bahadu Sarooj is a typical example. He is the sarpanch, or village head  man, of Digha, a hamlet of mud-and-straw huts 10 miles from any semblance of a  road and home to about 900 peasant farmers.  </P> <P> It is in such remote villages that most of Amethi's 900,000 voters live. And it  is here that Rajiv Gandhi's campaign manager, Sharma, said one must look "to  see what Amethi really thinks of Rajiv."  </P> <P> But Sarooj, a member of Hinduism's long-oppressed Untouchable caste that is a  traditional Congress-I vote bank, didn't really think much at all about Rajiv.  </P> <P> "We don't know him here," Sarooj said through a translator. "Sonia Gandhi came  here yesterday. She spoke some few words to us. She gave us these calendars and  campaign buttons. Then she left."  </P> <P> On the morning after, though, the First Lady's gifts appeared as alien to  Amethi as the sophisticated Indira Gandhi Flying Academy. Several Rajiv  calendars were hanging upside down on mud walls and mothers had used the slick  campaign buttons to close rips in their children's ragged shirts.  </P> <P> It was just down the road from Digha that Rajmohan Gandhi was touring that day.  In fact some of the children at his small, public meetings were wearing the  buttons that Sonia Gandhi had doled out the day before -- most of them upside  down.  </P> <P> "In the times of the British, when the colonial powers got their foothold, they  used mirrors and beads to dazzle us into following them blindly," Mahatma  Gandhi's grandson shouted through his jerry-built sound system. "Today, these  glossy posters and fancy buttons are the mirrors and beads of this day and age  -- the trinkets Rajiv is using to gain his foothold here."  </P> <P> In an interview beside the broken village well after his speech ended, the  "other" Gandhi insisted he does have a chance against Rajiv and Congress-I's  millions.  </P> <P> "Ferdinand Marcos also lavished largess on his followers, but in the end Marcos  failed," he said, referring to the late Philippine leader who was ousted in  1986. "Largess only succeeds for some time. And the Marcos example is very much  valid here. You see all these buttons and posters, but there isn't a single  high school for 15 miles around this place."  </P> <P> Back in Digha, outside sarpanch Sarooj's hut, there was independent evidence  that Rajmohan may well be right.  </P> <P> Asked what the prime minister has done for Digha, which has no power, no  schools, no paved roads and, in short, resembles most of rural Amethi, the  sarpanch smiled and said: "You can see what is the condition of my village. And  it has always looked this way."  </P></p>

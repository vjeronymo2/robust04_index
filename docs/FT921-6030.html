			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Other ways to cut charges IT IS possible to reduce the initial charge you pay on unit trusts without relying solely on the fund management expertise of Murray Johnstone, writes Philip Coggan. Investors with substantial sums have long been able to negotiate reduced charges from companies, and larger IFAs have used financial 'muscle' to get lower spreads for clients. A new group of fee-charging advisers is also emerging. Some will advise on unit trusts as part of an overall package; the price you pay will depend on the work and the time involved. It is important not to believe that you are paying 'extra' by writing a separate cheque for a fee; commission also comes from your pocket, only in a less obvious manner. Other fee-based advisers are offering execution-only services; for example, Chamberlain de Broe (071-235-5999) charges a flat fee of Pounds 50 and Boyton Financial Services (0787-61919) Pounds 60. Such services are cheaper than paying 3 per cent commission if one is investing more than Pounds 2,000. Execution-only services are designed for those who have already made their mind up about unit trust selection. Those who need advice will have to pay for it; one could argue that a 3 per cent commission is not an unreasonable charge to pay for good advice. The snag is whether 'good advice' is what will be received. Efficient market theory would assume that the average IFA selects trusts with an average performance. The trick is to select the above average IFA, and that could be as difficult as selecting an above average unit trust.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Israel and the PLO have reached an understanding on  the agricultural section of the economic talks being held in  Paris. Our correspondent Ya'aqov Balsenboim reports that the  understanding provides for open borders between Israel and the  autonomy subject to tight control by Israeli security, customs,  and veterinary officials. The Palestinians will be allowed to  export poultry, eggs, and produce to Israel.    Industry and Trade Minister Mikha Harish conferred last  night  with Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'], the PLO representative to the  Paris talks, and explained to him the circumstances which led to  the closure imposed on the territories in the wake of the murder  in 'Afula and other terror attacks.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A provincial radio and television propaganda work  conference concluded in Xining not long ago. The conference was  held at the same time as a provincial propaganda and ideological  work conference.    The radio and television propaganda work conference was  attended by nearly 30 people, including autonomous prefectural,  prefectural, and city radio and television bureau chiefs;  persons in charge of the Qinghai People's Radio Station, the  Qinghai Television Station, and the Qinghai Provincial Radio and  Television Department; as well as the individuals in charge of  the other departments concerned.    Wang Huiru, provincial radio and television department  director, delivered a speech entitled Clearly View the  Situation, Emancipate the Mind, Seek Truth from Facts, Live a  Plain Life, Work Hard, and Strive To Promote the Continued  Development of Radio and Television Undertakings. Director Wang  Huiru reviewed the basic situation of Qinghai's radio and  television work over the past few years, relayed the spirit of a  recently concluded national radio and television propaganda work  conference, called for implementing to the letter the spirit of  a recently concluded national propaganda and ideological work  conference and the spirit of the ongoing provincial propaganda  and ideological work conference, and spelled out some new tasks  and goals for Qinghai's radio and television work.    After conducting study and discussion, the conference  participants unanimously said: Now that we have clear-cut  principles and policies to follow with regard to propaganda and  ideological work, we should strive to unify ideology, heighten  understanding, conscientiously implement the relevant principles  and policies to the letter, and carry out work in a  down-to-earth manner in light of Qinghai's actual conditions.    The conference participants also reached consensus on a  number of major issues and called on all comrades concerned to  view, from the high plain of the proletarian party spirit, the  importance and necessity of successfully relaying the central  and provincial radio and television programs. They also urged  that every effort be made to ensure that the central and  provincial radio and television programs are relayed in their  entirety.    In view of the fact that there are some areas in the  province  where people are still unable to watch radio or television  programs, the conference called for making redoubled efforts to  build more radio and television relay networks; sticking to the  correct public opinion orientation; creating public opinion  favorable to reform, opening up, socialist market economic  structure, and socialist productive forces; whipping up public  opinion that is conducive to urging people to live a plain life,  work hard, and strive to build a strong and prosperous country;  improving the people's livelihood, pushing forward social  progress; and creating public opinion that is conducive to  national reunification, nationality solidarity, ease of mind  among the people, and social and political stability.    The conference stated: The propaganda departments should  strengthen management by focusing on such key links as  announcers, programs, and the like; should take resolute  measures to wipe out substandard programs; should set a limit on  the number of foreign movies and programs, especially in prime  time; should conscientiously implement the spirit of advocating  the main theme and airing varied programs; should ensure  efficient information supply and satellite television programs  reception; should strengthen, consolidate, and develop radio  broadcasting networks in rural areas; should develop cable  television networks in a planned and efficient manner, and  should conscientiously implement all legal documents promulgated  by the State Council and the ministry of radio, film, and  television.    The participants also exchanged experiences during the  conference.</p>

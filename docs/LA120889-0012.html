			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARSON HOPES TO KEEP HISTORY FROM REPEATING ITSELF IN SEMIFINAL  </P> <P> Carson is the top-rated high school football team in the City Section, the  defending 4-A Division champion, and is taking a 9-1 record into tonight's  semifinal game against Crenshaw at Veterans Stadium in Long Beach.  </P> <P> In last Friday's 31-0 victory over Granada Hills Kennedy, quarterback Armin  Youngblood threw for three touchdown passes to set a school record for a single  season with 27.  </P> <P> Despite all that, Coach Gene Vollnogle is worried. Five times since 1978,  Carson has lost the division championship to a team it had beaten during the  regular season.  </P> <P> So what makes Vollnogle nervous is that on Nov. 17, Carson defeated Pacific  League rival Crenshaw, 39-12.  </P> <P> "They have a very good team," Vollnogle said of Crenshaw (8-4). "They have two  excellent athletes in running back Kevin Hicks and quarterback Derrick  Williams."  </P> <P> Crenshaw Co-Coach Robert Garrett believes that the Cougars can win.  </P> <P> "Carson can be had," he said. "We just have to worry about Crenshaw and not be  overly concerned with what Carson does."  </P> <P> In the other 4-A Division semifinal game, El Camino Real (6-5) which began the  playoffs under .500, hopes to keep the magic going against Dorsey (8-3) at  Jackie Robinson Stadium.  </P> <P> In one 3-A Division semifinal, Locke (6-3-2) and Garfield (9-1-1) play in a  Southeastern Conference rematch at East Los Angeles College. Garfield defeated  the Saints, 27-20, during the regular season. In the other semifinal, South  Gate (10-0-1), the defending champion, and Franklin (11-1) meet at Wilson High  School. Both games begin at 7:30 p.m. LONNIE WHITE  </P></p>

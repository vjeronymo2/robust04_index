			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / International Company News: Alps Electric plunges to Y1.95bn ALPS Electric, which supplies parts to consumer and other electronics manufacturers, saw pre-tax profits fall to Y1.95bn (Dollars 17.5m) for the year to March 1993. This compared with Y7.02bn in the previous year, and was due to the fall in both corporate and consumer spending. The company expected difficult conditions to continue and forecast that it would only break even at the pre-tax level and fall into net loss in the current year. The decline came largely as a result of the weakness in the Japanese and European markets, Alps said. In Japan, production in the electronics industry fell by 12 per cent, according to industry estimates. Alps' sales fell 14 per cent to Y292bn from Y339bn while net profits are expected to fall 78 per cent to Y600m. Sales of electronic parts to colour TV and VTR manufacturers were particularly weak, falling 25 per cent, followed by a 21 per cent fall in sales to audio manufacturers. Sales to the information and telecommunications industries were depressed at home but it was helped by increased sales to the US and saw overall sales decline just 1.7 per cent. Alps said that while the electronics industry's inventory adjustments had been more or less completed, full-scale recovery was not likely in the near future as consumer spending was still at a low level. The pressures of the yen's appreciation were also expected to impact negatively on this year's earnings. The company is forecasting a 4 per cent decline in sales to Y280bn and a net loss of Y1.5bn in the current year. Taiyo Fishery, the large fishing company, forecast an increase in pre-tax profits for the year to Y1bn against a Y1.8bn loss in the previous year.</p>

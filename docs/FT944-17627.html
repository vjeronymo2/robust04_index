			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Littlechild favours sell-off of nuclear power industry Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, favours privatising the nuclear power industry, but believes power stations should be redistributed among the two state-owned companies, Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, in order to improve competition. Prof Littlechild says in his submission to the government's nuclear review: 'There would be benefits in ensuring that all market participants throughout Britain are fully exposed to private-sector financial disciplines. This would maintain continuing pressure for increased efficiency.' Prof Littlechild expresses two concerns, however. One is that all financial aid should be removed from nuclear power. At the moment both companies are subsidised either by electricity consumers or the taxpayer, and this is creating market distortions. The second is that the two companies each have strong market positions which could inhibit competition. Prof Littlechild proposes that the bigger company, Nuclear Electric, hand a number of power stations to Scottish Nuclear. This would weaken Nuclear Electric's market position in England and Wales and strengthen Scottish Nuclear's position south of the border. Alternatively, Scottish Nuclear could give one of its power stations to Nuclear Electric so as to introduce a new competitor into the Scottish market. Prof Littlechild says there is no case for the government subsidising the construction of further nuclear plant because it is not needed. Both companies welcomed the regulator's support for privatisation but reacted coolly to his proposals for plant reallocation. The government should assist the construction of further nuclear capacity to ensure diversity of supply and keep alive the UK's nuclear technology capability, says the Institution of Electrical Engineers. The body says in its submission to the review that the future of fossil fuels is uncertain and only nuclear can fill the gap. Nuclear also provides environmental advantages because it produces no gaseous emissions.</p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Survey of China (17): Peking distrust of UK may hit Hong Kong's prosperity - Political sniping accompanies countdown to 1997 handover CHINA has turned the tables on Hong Kong since the Tiananmen Square crisis in June 1989 when tens of thousands of local ethnic Chinese marched through the streets in support of the Peking students' demands for democracy on the mainland. That support made China fear that the colony would develop into a centre for subversion before the UK handed over sovereignty in 1997. Consequently, Peking has become much more sensitive about developments in the colony and about plans and policies drawn up by the British and Hong Kong governments, which it distrusts. It has launched outspoken and threatening criticisms of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement and it has also attacked three measures announced late in 1989 to boost Hong Kong's confidence in the wake of the crushing of the Tiananmen Square student movement - a Bill of Rights, the provision of British passports for up to 225,000 people, and a massive HKDollars 127bn (at 1988 prices) port and airport development scheme. During the past 16 months, this approach has escalated into a crisis over plans for the airport which is now costed at HKDollars 100bn in 1990 prices, excluding port developments included in the original 1989 plans. In particular, China has criticised the size and cost of the project and its impact on Hong Kong's post-1997 financial reserves and debt. But behind the detailed airport arguments, China has been establishing a precedent to exert increasing influence over Hong Kong government decisions in the run-up to 1997. It has won a say over the use of the government's HKDollars 73bn financial reserves for funding the airport, and it has demanded consultations leading to consensus on a wide range of other issues connected with the project, which it would want to scrutinise. This is causing considerable concern in Hong Kong because it has demonstrated how easy it is for China to interfere in the colony's affairs and slow down free-market developments before and after 1997. After initial resistance, Hong Kong has accepted the need for consultation on issues such as the airport which straddle 1997, but it has been reluctant to concede demands for anything approaching consensus which could give Peking an effective veto. China and Britain agreed in 1984 that Hong Kong would enjoy a 'high degree of autonomy' as a Special Administrative Region for 50 years after 1997 under a formula called 'one country two systems'. This was intended to leave economic and political traditions intact. There has always been concern that China would try to fudge this agreement and interfere for a mixture of political and bureaucratic reasons after (1997, and that this would probably slow down the growth and effectiveness of Hong Kong's economy. But few people expected China to show its hand so early. China claims it has a right to a say because the 1984 Sino-British agreement requires increased consultation in the second half of the 1984-97 transition period, which is just beginning. It also says that it has a duty to the 6m population to ensure that Britain leaves the colony and its economy in good order. Basically, China does not trust Britain, and senior officials suspect that the UK will behave like other departing colonial powers and cream off the riches before it goes. Similar suspicions are attached to the nearby Portuguese enclave of Macao, which goes back to China in 1999, and which is also running into problems with an airport project. In the Hong Kong scenario, the UK is suspected of organising the airport so that the colony's financial reserves could be drained to pay British companies' for money-spinning construction contracts. There is also a lack of understanding in China about capitalism and wheeler-dealing traditions. Peking officials are concerned that Hong Kong and Macao might be behaving like other Chinese provinces which launch over-ambitious projects that cannot be completed prof itably and could then land Peking with the debt. Peking is widely acknowledged to be justified in its demands for consultation and increasing involvement in Hong Kong's affairs as 1997 approaches. But the way it has pursued this target since the Tiananmen Square crisis has seriously knocked confidence in Hong Kong's chances of survival as a thriving international entrepot and financial centre after the sovereignty handover.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / The lion sleeps tonight That creaking sound in Downing Street is of a prime minister's equilibrium being restored. On Wednesday night the government won a procedural vote on the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty. Whew] Yesterday it presented a white paper on coal that stands a chance of being accepted by the House of Commons. Crikey] These two happy portents follow a Budget whose public reception has pleased the chancellor of the exchequer, if not absolutely everyone else. Sighs of relief all round. There is no cause to get overexcited. Mr John Major may conclude that the Conservatives' prolonged winter of disasters is coming to an end, but that does not change the quality of his cabinet. Britain still has to live with the best that a less-than-scintillating administration is capable of delivering. That means we must endure a continuation of government in bits and bobs. Some bits may be beneficial. Many will do very little harm. Few are likely to be connected to one another. There is no theme to this government, and little in the way of consistency. As one of the prime minister's loyal backbenchers put it the other day: 'The sixth form has taken over the school, and the smarter among them are beginning to get the hang of things.' Or as certain City lunch-tables have it: 'We'll never have a decent government until Clarke is prime minister and Portillo is chancellor.' It is not many years since gossip put the name 'Heseltine' where Clarke presently stands. Mr Michael Heseltine, who published the revised plan for coal yesterday, is one of a small number of grown-up politicians around Mr Major. He is one of the few men of substance in a cabinet of phantoms. Until recently his politics always aroused some kind of passion: he was either strongly admired or deeply mistrusted. This now toothless lion of British politics celebrated his 60th birthday last Sunday. The festivities were marred by several hours he was obliged to spend on coal, the subject that since October has threatened to blight the evening of his career. The party over, he slogged through a week in which he could hardly avoid looking and sounding harassed. He took to musing, as might be expected on such an anniversary, about his life's work. He has not done badly: built up a publishing empire; made a fortune; planted an arboretum; toppled a prime minister; risen to become secretary for trade and industry. The latter is the cabinet post, top dog's apart, that he always says he holds in highest regard; what a pity he has chosen to call himself president of the Board of Trade. It would be piquant, he acknowledges, if he, the instrument of Lady Thatcher's downfall, were to be destroyed by the coal mess, itself a consequence of the mishandling of energy policy by the then Mrs Thatcher's government. Such a drama would properly be entitled The Lady's Revenge. It could yet reach our political theatre, although it is unlikely. The 'president' will have had little difficulty in persuading his colleagues that he will resign on Monday if at the end of the debate on his white paper the House rejects it. As he is not slow to point out, he is a man of honour. He has resigned once before. Against that, he retains sufficient political skill to know how to re-package an old pit-closure policy and scent it with flattery of his Conservative opponents. He is still well able to turn on the enemy when fire is aimed at his person from all sides. For years a British sport has been to watch him get out of political traps by attacking the Labour party. That is what he did yesterday. It was hugely enjoyable. As insurance, he wrapped his presentation in a few hundred million used pound notes dunned from the taxpayers. A 'few?'. Precision was not on offer. The 'president's' white paper should, however, achieve two objectives. It should ensure the survival of Mr Heseltine, at least for long enough for him to be able to say, as he ascends to the House of Lords, that he has had a good innings. To do that, it must turn out to be enough to bamboozle most of the small band of Tory backbench opponents of pit closures into the self-delusion that something lasting has been achieved. The truth, however, is that the run-down of coal mining will continue, albeit at a slightly slower pace. The laws of economics are dictating the terms, and would have done so if there had been no botched Thatcherite energy policy, no Heseltine humiliation when the closures were announced last October, no select committee report, and no white paper yesterday. The mines employed 1.25m men in 1920, the peak year. At the time of nationalisation in 1947 this figure was down to 700,000, doubtless including some women. Last October it stood at 54,000. The 31 pit closures then announced would have taken it to 24,000 by now. The employer, British Coal, is nearly half-way there. Some 8,000 miners have accepted redundancy since October. A further 5,800 near-term job losses were announced yesterday. Mr Heseltine's lengthy white paper, like the chancellor's budget, throws in everything his civil servants could think of, and a few extras besides. British Coal will be privatised. While awaiting that glorious day, it will offer pits it does not want to private buyers, within the constraints of the current law. The remainder will be 'mothballed' or subsidised for a period while the market asserts itself. In short, that 24,000 figure may be delayed by a year or two, but it is coming in spite of everything. If the trick works it will be an achievement of sorts. The government fell on its face last year because it allowed Mr Heseltine, who should have known better, to announce the instant closure of 31 pits. That was at a time when nobody had much respect for any minister following Britain's ejection from the European exchange rate mechanism. At the same time, most people were deeply worried about unemployment for themselves or their families. The worst outcome of the subsequent negotiations would have been a total panic and an open-ended commitment to subsidise an ever-increasing mountain of unsold coal. By playing the game long, and by talking down expectations in advance, the government has won itself a chance of buying its survival relatively cheaply while yet running down an industry that, on environmental grounds, should be written off by the turn of the century.</p>

			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Money Markets: French futures tumble FRENCH interest rate futures tumbled yesterday after the Bank of France disappointed dealers by only reducing the cost of overnight funds by a 1/4 of a percentage point, writes James Blitz. Yesterday's easing in monetary policy was the first since the widening of the exchange rate mechanism's bands more than a week ago. But the scale of the move, which pushed the cost of overnight money down to 9.75 per cent, gave the impression that France is still trying to hang on to the D-Mark's coat-tails in the ERM, and that rates will come down slowly. The Bank of France's strategy failed to impress money market dealers. The franc dropped nearly 2 centimes, underlining that tight monetary policy is not credible as far as the markets are concerned. The Bank also added FFr18.9bn to the money market in its domestic tender, too small a sum to bring cash rates down by much. Three month French francs closed more-or-less unchanged by the end of the day at 8 per cent. The September French franc contract dropped 40 basis points, from a high of 93.50 at the start of the day to close at 93.10. Interest rate futures dealers took the view that German rates will be about  1/2 percentage point lower than French rates in two months time. It is only in December that futures dealers are discounting lower rates in France than Germany. Euromarks were nevertheless a touch lower yesterday after Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, the Bundesbank's vice-president, said at the weekend that dealers could not expect big cuts in interest rates in the next few months. The September Euromark contract was down 6 basis points at 93.51. There were expectations that the Bundesbank would again hold a fixed rate repo at 6.80 per cent for 14 day maturities, only 5 basis points above the Discount rate level. The downbeat atmosphere affected sterling markets where the September sterling contract fell 9 basis points to close at 94.16. Rates in the cash market were kept high by difficulties removing a large Pounds 1.85bn shortage. There was Pounds 730m of late assistance and the overnight rate was as high as 11 per cent at one stage. Three month money was slightly lower at 5.70 per cent from 5.75 per cent earlier in the day.</p>

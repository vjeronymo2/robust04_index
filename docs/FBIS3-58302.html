			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] French diplomacy has in a way forced the case of  Bosnia onto the NATO summit, by asking the 15 other member  states to think about a fresh initiative to launch the peace  process. Laurent Boussie asked Alain Juppe, minister of foreign  affairs, what he was hoping for specifically from this Brussels  summit.    [Begin recording] [Juppe] I am hoping for three things.  First, the alliance's support for the peace plan prepared by the  European Union. It is the only one existing, and now we have to  make commitments.    Then the reaffirmation by the alliance that it is ready to  go  to the area, to guarantee the application of the peace plan, if  it is signed.    Third and finally, the willingness of the countries of the  alliance to help the United Nations to get the Security Council  resolutions respected, be it the reinforcement of ground troops,  or the establishment of air protection when needed.    [Boussie] Isn't this hope a bit feeble given the dramatic  nature of the situation?    [Juppe] I am well aware that any diplomatic gesture is  insufficient today, in comparison with the terrible reality. I  think that it can be useful, and it will enable European foreign  ministries, in particular the French Foreign Ministry, to get  back into contact with the parties very quickly, to tell them:  you must stop now, or else there will be a disaster, because the  question of maintaining the troops there in their current form  will inevitably arise if the killings do not stop.

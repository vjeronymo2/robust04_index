			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Australia's recovery slower than forecast, says OECD AUSTRALIA'S recovery from 18 months of recession will be significantly slower than forecast by the government, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development says in a report published today. The Paris-based organisation says gross domestic product will grow by 0.1 per cent in the current financial year, followed by 3 per cent growth in the year to June 1993. It also says unemployment, now 10.5 per cent, will remain above 10 per cent for the next two years, and that inflation will rise from 1.7 per cent to 4 per cent by 1993. The OECD forecasts paint a more pessimistic picture of Australia's short-term economic prospects than the federal Labor government, which says GDP will grow by 4.25 per cent in 1992-93. The government forecasts inflation will rise no higher than 2.5 per cent by 1992-93, with unemployment falling to 9.25 per cent by June 1993, the last possible date for the next federal election. The OECD's economists appear not to have considered the impact of an economic statement in February by Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, in an attempt to boost economic growth. Mr Keating announced the injection of ADollars 2.3bn (Pounds 980m) into the economy as the first part of a four-year recovery programme intended to create 800,000 jobs and stimulate annual GDP growth of around 4 per cent until the mid-1990s. The report gives support to the government's attempts to open the economy to international pressures through industrial deregulation and reductions in tariff protection. The OECD criticises the government's handling of monetary policy, which it says contributed to the severity of the recession.</p>

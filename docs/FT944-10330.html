			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Candidates count on the absentee vote The outcome of a handful of elections, including for the Senate in California and the governorship in Maryland, still hung in the balance yesterday, awaiting recounts and the tallying of absentee ballots. The California numbers still heavily favour the return of Senator Dianne Feinstein, the Democrat, over Congressman Michael Huffington. But neither had officially claimed victory or conceded defeat. There are an estimated 400,000 absentee votes to be counted in California. With all state precincts reported, Ms Feinstein had 3,608,497 votes to Mr Huffington's 3,484,887. The Republican would have to take about two-thirds of those still outstanding to overcome his deficit; unlikely given the closeness of the race. But it was much tighter in Maryland, with about 40,000 absentee ballots. Mr Parris Glendening, Democrat, led Mrs Ellen Sauerbrey by just over 6,000 votes (683,995 - 677,808). State officials said most still to be counted came from counties where he had run strongest, but neither side was taking anything for granted. The tightest race of all, in which a recount was ordered yesterday, involved Congressman Sam Gejdenson, the Democrat from Connecticut known for investigations into US sales to Iraq before the 1991 Gulf war. The official tally had him winning by just two votes over Mr Edward Munster. It was still technically possible for Mr Tom Foley, the outgoing Speaker, to hold on to his Washington seat. But his qualified concession on Wednesday to Mr George Nethercutt recognised that a 2,274 vote shortfall was unlikely to be reversed by absentee ballots of at most double that number. With six House seats nationwide still undecided, the line-up stands at 228 Republicans, 200 Democrats and one independent, compared to the pre-election 256 Democrats, 178 Republicans and the same non-party representative, Mr Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who squeaked back by just over 7,000 votes out of 200,000 cast. Probably the most remarkable demographic discovery of the exit polls was the widening of the gender gap. Nationally, about 54 per cent of men voted Republican, with the same percentage of women preferring Democrats, the biggest difference in polling history. In some key races the split was even wider and occasionally decisive, with white male voters, many influenced by the conservative Christian Coalition and the pro-gun lobby, turning out in force. Though they may yet lose, Mr Huffington got 59 per cent of white male support and Mrs Sauerbrey 58 per cent, while no less than two out of three supported Mr George W Bush Jr, conqueror of Governor Ann Richards in Texas. In Virginia, where the religious right is particularly strong, Mr Oliver North outpolled Senator Chuck Robb by 46-43 per cent among men, but not enough to overcome his 48-41 deficit among women.</p>

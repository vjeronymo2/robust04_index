			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jacques Amalric: "When Clinton Reassures the </F> French"]    [Text] Is the one-month cease-fire signed in Geneva by the  different sides in the Bosnian conflict a result of the Clinton  effect? This was the question being asked yesterday evening in  Paris, 24 hours after the U.S. President had taken a clear  position -- in public at the National Assembly but also in  private in talks with [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur,  [President] Francois Mitterrand, and [Foreign Minister] Alain  Juppe -- in favor of the European peace plan. This plan  provides for a division of the territory of Bosnia between the  Serbs and the Croatian-Muslim alliance (created under the aegis  of the United States). No one dared answer the question in the  affirmative, but some senior figures were hoping firmly that the  cease-fire would not "be broken nearly as soon as it was  signed," like so many others in the former Yugoslavia.    This glimmer of hope was largely due to the determination  shown by Clinton during his stay in Paris. "His declarations  before the deputies were very clear," it was said in Juppe's  entourage. "But his resolution was clearer still during the  talks in the Hotel Matignon [office of the prime minister  office] and the Elysee palace [office of the president]."  Reliable sources confirmed that Bosnia was the only topic of  the discussions at the Elysee palace, bringing together the two  presidents, Juppe, and Secretary of State Warren Christopher and  various staffers. This was at President Clinton's request; he  was virtually the only one to talk for the U.S. side and showed  an excellent grasp of such a complex subject. "We were talking  with a politician," it was said on the French side, "whereas  when we talk with State Department officials, we have the  impression of dealing with ideologues who only think in terms of  good and evil."    This sneer obviously refers to Warren Christopher, who four  months ago reproached the Europeans for supporting an "immoral  and unjust" plan and confusing "aggressors and aggressed." On  Tuesday [7 June] in the Elysee he is reported to not have said a  word, whereas Clinton proved that he had "understood the  catastrophic scenario" which would result from lifting the arms  embargo on Bosnia. Clinton gave the impression that he was not  prepared to allow the Muslims to increase their territorial  claims much beyond the 51 percent accorded by the European peace  plan to the Croatian-Muslim federation.    The solution could lie in turning a number of urban centers  currently occupied by the Serbs, but where a large number of  Muslims lived before the hostilities started, into "gray" zones  under UN control. Juppe put forward the idea in an interview  published today in LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR. Juppe said in the  interview that "there is a chance" that the peace plan will  work. "The Croats accept the Geneva plan. The Serbs accept the  Geneva plan," the foreign minister said, "I think that the  Muslims will accept the 51/49 proportion, as they did last  December in Geneva, if we define another 4-5 percent of `gray  zones.'"    In this interview, given before Clinton came to Paris, Juppe  also attacked those who accused him of "capitulation." "With 58  percent, we would be respecting, they say, international  morality, right, and justice," he said. "But with 51 percent,  we would be blamed with capitulation and the acceptance of an  ethnic division! Does the difference between good and evil lie  in 7 percent more or less land?" Although nothing allows  Juppe's prudent optimism to be taken at face value as yet, it is  certain that Clinton's determination has strengthened him. More  will be known in the coming days, when the contact group, which  includes the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France,  and Germany, will look again at the subject of territorial  partition, which was not covered in the agreement signed  yesterday. This contact group could very soon be enlarged to  include Italy, and if all goes more or less well, France hopes  to achieve a meeting of the contact group countries by the end  of the month, but at the ministerial level this time.    Another crucial date, if no solution is in sight in the  short  term, is that of the summit meeting of the main industrialized  countries, the G-7, to be held in Naples from 8 to 10 July. The  main powers involved in seeking a negotiated settlement will be  gathered there: the United States, the UK, France, Germany, and  also Italy and above all Russia. It has been decided that Boris  Yeltsin, whose country is theoretically responsible for putting  pressure on the Serbs, will take part in the political part of  the summit. For France, the Naples meeting is particularly  important. It is, Juppe said, a sort of deadline after which  Paris will reexamine the presence of its contingent in Bosnia.  A way of keeping pressure on negotiations which will have many  more low points yet.</p>

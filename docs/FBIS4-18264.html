			<p>BFN     [Text] Istanbul, Mar. 31 (A.A.) -- Parliament speaker  Husamettin Cindoruk said today that a change in the existing  government was unlikely, despite the sweeping election victory  of the Prosperity Party (RP).    In a press conference here, after the fundamentalist RP  headed for a victory in Sunday's [27 March] local elections,  Cindoruk said that the bans on youth organizations, foundations  and similar organizations should be lifted so the political  parties can have broader-based relations with the people.    Stressing the superiority of the Consitutional Court, the  republic's prosecutor and justice, Cindoruk said, "if a  political party begins acting against the law, the justice and  the laws and the Constitution will do whatever necessary."    "No political party can enter an action which would spoil  the  basic structure and principles of the state," he said.    Cindoruk, also gave some advice to the new mayors, in his  address.    "The municipality is not a place to worship, but a place to  implement. In Turkey, there is a freedom of religion. Everyone  is free to live the way he pleases. If these facts are not  observed, then there will be a social resistance," he said.    "My second piece of advice is to keep in mind that a local  administration cannot bring a (new) social order, because it  cannot impose taxes, make laws. Local administrations should  not be used as if a new government came into power," he added.    He also stressed that whoever implements backward methods  when in office will not be reelected in the next elections.</p>

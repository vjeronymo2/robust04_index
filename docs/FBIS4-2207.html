			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 7 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier  Qian Qichen said here today that China would welcome civil  servants in Hong Kong to continue to serve the public after 1997  when China restores its sovereignty over Hong Kong.    Qian, who is also foreign minister, made the remarks when  meeting with a delegation from the Business and Professionals  Federation of Hong Kong, headed by its chairman Vincent Lo Hong  Sui.    Qian said that civil servants in Hong Kong do not need to  worry about their future after 1997.    However, senior officials in the future Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region should meet the relevant requirements  spelled out in the Basic Law, Qian said. Only a few are  involved in this regard, most civil servants are welcome to  continue their service, he said.    The vice-premier also attributed worries among some Hong  Kong  residents about the central government's policies towards Hong  Kong after 1997 to the lack of knowledge of the Basic Law, in  which, he said, most policies are clearly stated.    Therefore, he agreed with guests' ideas on accelerating the  pace of spreading the knowledge of the Basic Law and even  providing more financial support for these efforts.</p>

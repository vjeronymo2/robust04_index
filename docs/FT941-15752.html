			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Hornby link with US toymaker Hornby Group yesterday announced that it had taken a 10 per cent stake in the privately-owned Original San Francisco Toymakers. The deal gives the UK company, best known for its model train sets, exclusive UK distribution rights for the small US toy company's product range. The range includes action figures, talking story books and talking story 'pals' - stuffed toys which narrate literature. Mr Saul Jodel, president of Toymakers, said the deal solidified a long-standing relationship with Hornby, which he described as a quality company: 'It gives them the motivation to do a good job with our line because they have a piece of our company.' Mr Jodel founded the company two years ago with Mr David Galoob, chief executive officer. Both had previously been executives with Lewis Galoob Toys, another San Francisco toy company which is quoted on the NYSE. Mr Galoob resigned abrubptly as chief executive officer at Lewis Galoob in June 1991 after the company was sued by Nintendo of America, the video games company, for alleged copyright violation. The case was subsequently settled in Lewis Galoob's favour. Mr Jodel said yesterday the parting between the man and the company founded by his family had been a 'mutual decision.' Toymakers reported 'minor losses' on sales of Dollars 6m (Pounds 4m) in 1993 and is forecasting that it will treble or quadruple in size this year. Mr Jodel declined to disclose the consideration for the deal. No one at Hornby was available to comment.</p>

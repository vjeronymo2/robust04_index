			<p>BFN     [Text] A few days ago, the State Council's commodity price  inspection team arrived in Hubei to inspect the province's  implementation of the national commodity price inspection effort  and to keep abreast of market price developments. Since the  State Council held a telephone conference on launching national  commodity price inspection, the province's commodity price  inspection work has been carried out intensely and in an orderly  manner. Some cases of wanton price hikes and wanton collection  of fees have been discovered, and 2,803 cases of price  discipline violations have been handled. These cases involved  funds totalling 36 million yuan, and funds derived from economic  sanctions imposed on the cases total approximately 26 million  yuan. Hubei Province's present commodity price situation is  still quite grim. The provincial government has taken and is  taking measures to regulate and control the situation. The  measures included: On behalf of the provincial government, we  will promulgate the provisional regulations of Hubei on  combating exorbitant profits, and establish a grain, coal, and  oil reserve system, a system of risk funds, and a system of  regulatory funds for major foods such as meat, eggs, poultry,  vegetables, and sugar and agricultural means of production.    The inspection team of the State Council will go to the  rural  areas, enterprises, and marketplaces of Wuhan, Jingzhou, Shashi,  Yichang, and other localities to gain on-the-spot information  about the prices of grain, coal, and oil, and of agricultural  means of production, and to learn about the peasants' burdens,  general market prices, and the prices of energy and raw and  semifinished materials.</p>

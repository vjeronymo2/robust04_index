			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Bullet-proof glass covers up rural fears: The police and the crime rate are back on the political agenda. The report by Sir Patrick Sheehy urging radical changes to police employment has been attacked by officers of all ranks while MPs and the public are calling for initiatives against crime. FT writers sound out feelings in the city and in the country WITH ITS mellow stone buildings, immaculate floral displays and traditional shops, the Northumberland village of Rothbury looks like an oasis in a country troubled by crime. Looks deceive. Even before last week's audacious raid on Rothbury's post office, when masked men cut telephone lines to nearby homes and escaped with a safe containing Pounds 24,000, the picturesque village was not immune to crime. Police and public attitudes to policing and the Sheehy reform proposals are coloured in Rothbury by two geographical facts: the vastness of rural Northumberland, in relation to police numbers, and its relative proximity for urban criminals. Detective Inspector John Hope, of Alnwick CID, estimates 50 per cent of burglaries in rural Northumberland are committed by criminals travelling to the area. 'They say they've got it so tight in the cities, they're coming out here,' says Rothbury postmaster Mr George Ross. Like many older people in Rothbury, he disapproves of Sheehy's suggested fixed contracts for the police. 'If a policeman is only there for 10 years, he won't put himself out.' Younger people are less sympathetic to the concept of policing as a job for life. Mrs Henrietta Hay, 26, an army officer's wife, questions why the police should be immune from a general social trend: 'Everyone thought the army was a job for life. But even in the army cuts are being made.' Criticisms by villagers of local policing include too few officers, difficulty in contacting them and slow response. Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed, said: 'At night the thin blue line is almost non-existent.' In spite of this, local police enjoy a level of support many of their inner city colleagues would envy. Constable Joe Chapman of Rothbury said: 'The people actually talk to you out here.' Mr Tim Shilton, who runs an upmarket outdoor clothing shop in Rothbury high street, said: 'The standard of policing in rural areas is very high. The level of policing is non-existent.' He added: 'You can set your watch by the crime here. Burglaries are nearly all after 1am.' The time is significant. Between 1am and 8am all six police officers who cover Rothbury and many miles of surrounding countryside are off-duty. His store has bullet-proof glass and a ramraiding protection cage flanks the window display. After nine attempted burglaries in the past four years he is taking no chances. For rural policemen especially, the idea of performance-related pay is worrying. Mr John Stevens, Northumbria chief constable, has warned that it could create 'two-tier' policing, with poorer pay for country police. PC Chapman, based at Rothbury since 1987, estimated that performance-based pay could cost him Pounds 5,000 a year, lowering his salary to Pounds 15,600. An unwanted move back to Newcastle might be necessary to achieve higher arrest rates. Among Rothbury shoppers there is concern that performance-related pay could make the police over-zealous, making motorists an easy target. Back at Alnwick, Det Insp Hope said: 'You'll have people thinking 'I need to make so much money', and manufacturing arrests.' He believes the police have to some extent brought Sheehy's fixed-term contracts proposal on themselves by not taking steps to eliminate dead wood. He also thinks the 'supervision mentality', which fosters bureaucracy and hierarchy, needs reform. 'You send somebody out to arrest somebody, which is a serious thing, but you can't trust him to take 45 minutes for his meal.' Very few policemen, he insisted, object to change. 'But we're wondering why it's got to be a big bang.'</p>

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / International Company News: Turkey widens scope for sell-offs TURKEY is for the first time to place blocks of shares in state companies directly with foreign investors. The Public Participation Administration, the government agency handling state sales to the public, said that stakes in some 20 companies would be placed with both foreign and domestic institutions at market prices. The sales, which the PPA hopes to conclude by the year end, are expected to realise around Dollars 380m. The decision to make a secondary offering, rather than block tender or initial public offering, reflects the new urgency attached to the privatisation programme by Mrs Tansu Ciller, prime minister. Brokers say that the move will allow foreign investors to take a position in some of the large public concerns without disrupting the market, which suffers from a lack of liquidity. This is the first time that there has been a possibility of significant foreign stakes in some of Turkey's traditional state monopolies. The sales include 10 per cent of Eregli Iron and Steel, Turkey's flat-rolled steel producer which has a 71 per cent share of the domestic market. The government is also offering a 15.87 per cent stake in Petrol Ofisi, the petrol retail operation. This sector has seen cut-throat competition, with oil majors such as British Petroleum, Shell and Elf setting up operations. Petrol Ofisi recently formed a small marketing joint venture with Agip, the Italian company. Smaller stakes are offered in Petkim, the petrochemical corporation, and Tupras, the refinery company. The largest block on offer is the 5 per cent of Tofas, the Fiat manufacturing joint venture which at present market values is worth TL1,600bn (Dollars 138m). Brokers say the PPA is trying to broaden the scope of the privatisation effort ahead of a large sell-off of the important utilities. Mrs Ciller also restated her plans to sell the telephone monopoly, which is expected to raise Dollars 2bn. Morgan Grenfell, the UK merchant bank, is understood to be advising the government on the sale.</p>

			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / US Money and Credit: Politics provides focus as inflation genie is stoppered WITH THE inflation genie back in its bottle, at least temporarily, the attention of the US credit markets this week is likely to focus more on political developments, both in the US and Japan. President Clinton's budget cutting package, approved by the Senate's finance committee on Friday, is due to come before the full Senate on Wednesday in a debate being billed as one of the most partisan Democrat/Republican clashes in years. In Tokyo, there may be further financial fall-out from Friday's sudden dissolving of parliament and calling of snap elections next month - a development which sent the yen sharply lower against the dollar on Friday. Both developments could prove positive for the US credit markets. Political instability in Japan, coupled with a dollar rising against European currencies as well as the yen, could increase the attractions of US Treasuries for international investors. Greater political certainty in Washington would also help the market. Admittedly, Wall Street has factored into its calculations the strong probability that a much-amended deficit reduction package will pass through the Senate, go on next month to a conference between the Senate and House of Representatives to iron out differences between their two bills, and finally be signed into law by President Clinton. However, actual clearance of the measure through the Senate, after a debate limited to 20 hours, should provide considerable underpinning to the bond market, since its post presidential election rally has been predicated partly on firm action to cut the deficit. True, the bill under discussion in the Senate is a much watered down version of Mr Clinton's initial proposals. But the new package should still reduce the federal government's borrowing requirement, while the new taxes it imposes will tend to dampen growth and reinforce the belief that inflation, which grew at a 4.3 per cent annual rate in the first four months of this year, can be contained at a little over 3 per cent for the whole of 1993. That belief gained credibility last week when the consumer price index statistics for May showed a rise of just 0.1 per cent overall. The market was not entirely surprised, since May's producer price index, released the previous Friday, had shown a similar slowdown from the sharp inflationary trends of the previous four months. Still, the consumer figures erased any lingering fears the Federal Reserve might be forced in the near future to tighten monetary policy for the first time in four years. However, the positive effect of this news on the long end of the market was quickly erased, and the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue ended on Friday night with its yield unchanged on the week, at 6.80 per cent. An unsettling factor on Friday was comments by the two fiercest anti-inflation hawks among the Fed's governors, Mr Lawrence Lindsey and Mr Wayne Angell, who issued warnings that inflation remained too high for their tastes. Mr Lindsey said he planned to increase his inflation estimate to an annualised rate of 4 per cent. Still, the market can take comfort from the fact that the Fed has demonstrated an anti-inflation vigilance over the past few weeks by adopting a bias towards monetary tightening, should the need arise. But with the US outlook for growth remaining moderate and deficit legislation looking likely, some analysts are suggesting that long bond yields could test their recent 6.65 per cent lows over the coming weeks. Some are even beginning to wonder whether the Fed's tightening bias could be removed later in the year if the deficit reduction package duly becomes law and appears to be endangering the recovery.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] There is persistent speculation in foreign exchange  markets that the yen will further appreciate. This is because  many think it is difficult for the Japanese Government to  realize its plan, launched at a meeting of economic ministers  over the weekend, to reduce Japan's current accounts surplus as  a measure to bring down the value of the yen. Behind this  speculation also lies the fact that dollar-selling pressure  continues in foreign exchange markets due to apprehensions about  a possible drop in U.S. bonds, stock prices, and the value of  the dollar (a triple drop). Although Japanese and U.S. monetary  authorities are prepared to cooperate in halting any further  appreciation of the yen and depreciation of the dollar, some  people point out that the United States is reluctant to reduce  the yen's value. Thus, there is growing speculation that the  yen will continue to strengthen.    On 2 May, the Bank of Japan [BOJ] intervened off and on in  the Tokyo foreign exchange market through dollar-buying and  yen-selling, but the exchange rate remained on the level of 101  yen to the dollar. The fact that the yen dipped only to the  101-yen level (closing rate) despite last week's dollar-buying  and yen-selling intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve  indicates the strength of the markets' yen-buying pressure.    Behind the recent surge of the yen lies Japan's huge current  account surplus totaling about $130 billion. While some  Japanese companies are boosting their exports to the United  States, a drastic increase in Japan's imports is unlikely due to  the flagging economy.    To reduce the current account surplus, it is imperative for  Japan to promote deregulation and increase imports by  implementing economy-boosting measures. However, many dealers  think "it is difficult for the minority Hata government to  launch a full-scale pump-priming package, including tax  reduction measures," (according to the Long-Term Credit Bank).    The BOJ notes: "Since the government has said it will take  steps to cut the current accounts surplus, we expect it to work  out effective measures." But at the same time, it admits that  if Japan fails to meet U.S. expectations, "this will disappoint  Washington and incur the risk of further appreciation of the  yen."    Another cause of the recent surge in the yen is that many  investors are moving their funds from the dollar. Because of  persistent speculation that Washington will tighten its monetary  policy, government bonds and stock prices have shown a falling  tendency in the United States. Investors who hate this tendency  are moving to shift their funds from the dollar to the yen and  the mark. In actuality, the mark closed at 1.6549 against the  dollar on the Tokyo foreign exchange market on 2 May, marking  the first rise in its value in six and a half months. The  dollar is depreciating against the yen and European currencies  and this caused the recent sharp surge in the yen.    For the time being, monetary authorities' intervention in  foreign exchange markets will be the only measure to deal with  the markets' yen-buying pressure. However, many people point  out that this measure has only a limited effect. The value of  the yen rose last year due to pressure from the U.S. Government  in foreign exchange markets. This year, Japan's current accounts  surplus and investors' distrust of the dollar are behind the  recent surge in the yen, and Washington is now refraining from  applying direct pressure for the yen's appreciation.  Intervention in foreign exchange markets may help prevent the  yen from further appreciating, but it will not be able to remove  the causes of the yen's surge.    Although the BOJ intervened in the market on 2 May, it did  not indicate a determined attitude toward efforts to depreciate  the yen. Thus, some people have doubts about Japan's efforts to  prevent the yen from further appreciating in cooperation with  the United States.    Nonetheless, the government and the BOJ are worried that, if  the exchange rate breaches the 100-yen-to-the-dollar level,  private companies will immediately lose their business  confidence. The BOJ will ask central banks in the United States  and Europe to cooperate in preventing the yen from further  appreciating.</p>

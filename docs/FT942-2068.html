			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Closure costs cut East Midlands Electricity East Midlands Electricity is increasing its dividend for the year by 16 per cent to 22.7p in spite of a sharp fall in profits due to the costs of closing most of its contracting operations. In May the company announced its decision to reverse its expansion into contracting and to write-down the asset value of its home security and retailing businesses. This resulted in a total exceptional cost of Pounds 129.5m which reduced pre-tax profits to Pounds 51.2m (Pounds 155.1m) in the year to March 31. Turnover fell 8 per cent to Pounds 1.44bn (Pounds 1.57bn) following the separation of the retail business. Mr Norman Askew, the new chief executive, said the dividend rise from 19.5p, with a recommended final of 15.9p, reflected the strength of the underlying business. Operating profits advanced by 13 per cent to Pounds 182.8m (Pounds 162.1m). Mr Askew also pointed to the strong cash inflow last year which cut net borrowings from Pounds 141.4m to just Pounds 2m. More than half the inflow was due to one-off factors with underlying cash generation improving to Pounds 57.4m (Pounds 38.7m) East Midlands is to seek shareholder approval for the purchase of up to 10 per cent of its shares in the market. Mr Askew, who conducted a full review of the group following his appointment in September 1992, said this was consistent with its new strategy of focusing on its core electricity business. He said: 'The first call on the group's cash is to invest in the core business to get costs down. However, the surplus should not be left tied up in the company but released to shareholders.' The company had ruled out, for the time being, the idea of moving into the provision of any other utility services, he added. Operating profit from the electricity distribution business rose by 10.6 per cent to Pounds 169.9m with the number of electricity units distributed up 1.7 per cent. Last year's restructuring of the electricity business, which will yield annual savings of Pounds 15m, resulted in the loss of 400 jobs and a further 100 have gone so far this year. The retailing business, which was put into a joint venture with Yorkshire Electricity, lost a total of Pounds 5.7m and Mr Askew said that further restructuring was required in the electrical retailing market. Earnings per share fell to 12.7p (53.3p) but before exceptionals rose to 63.7p (59.2p). COMMENT Given the slump in earnings the 16 per cent rise in the dividend might seem over-generous. But it is still covered 2.8 times by earnings before exceptional items and the balance sheet is in fine health despite the diversification damage. Although East Midlands' distribution business is already one of the most efficient in the sector the new team, with a wealth of private sector experience behind them, believe there is still a long way to go. For the moment all City attention is focused on the sector's new price which the regulator will announce in August. Now yielding 5 per cent, East Midlands shares appear to be discounting all but the worst possible outcome.</p>

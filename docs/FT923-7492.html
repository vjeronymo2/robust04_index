			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / UN relief attacked by south Sudan rebels SUDANESE rebels yesterday threatened a United Nations plan for an emergency food airlift to some 300,000 starving residents of Juba, saying that relief workers flying into the besieged town did so at their own risk. The dispute, which emerged between the rebel Sudan Peoples Liberation Army (SPLA) and the UN, highlights the lack of a co-ordinated, comprehensive UN relief effort in southern Sudan, and the way in which food is being used, by both sides, as a weapon in the nine-year civil war. Ambassador Darko Silovic of the UN department of humanitarian affairs told reporters yesterday morning a resumed UN airlift would begin on Thursday to move 1,075 tonnes of food, medicines and shelter material into the starving government-held city. The initiative was immediately attacked by the SPLA who described it as 'provocative'. 'Anybody flying to Juba without proper agreement does it at his/her risk,' warned Mr Elijah Malok Aleng, executive director of the SPLA relief organisation. The SPLA has in the past shot down aircraft. Thousands of women and children have died in southern Sudan as both the fundamentalist Islamic government and the rigid SPLA have consistently disrupted and blocked relief efforts and sought to exploit them for military gain. Since the beginning of the year fighting has escalated as the government has pressed home a lightning offensive. For four years the civilian population of Juba has been dependent for food supplies on a threadbare airlift operation. The airlift was suspended on July 18 after the SPLA, which has laid siege to the town, stepped up fighting and shelling of the airport and shot down several government planes. The suspension also followed SPLA protests after the government had used a UN flagged aircraft allegedly to fly arms and ammunition to encircled government soldiers. Mr Silovic said: 'Today in Juba there is no food left. . .If immediate assistance is not provided, large-scale deaths will certainly follow.' The SPLA statement, which demanded a round-table meeting of all parties to discuss relief, appeared to cast doubt on whether the airlift could go ahead this week. Mr Silovic admitted the UN had no guarantees that the SPLA and government would not attack relief flights but said 'we have an understanding and we hope it will go smoothly'.</p>

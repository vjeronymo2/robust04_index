			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Elsevier in line with forecasts ELSEVIER, the Dutch publ-rishing group, saw strong increases in profits in 1992, in line with forecasts made last year after the announcement of its plans to merge with Reed International of the UK. The Dutch company, which will retain its listing on the Amsterdam stock exchange, said operating profit before tax - which it traditionally regards as the best measure of its performance - rose by 19.3 per cent to Fl 618.2m (Dollars 329.7m). Net profit was up 12.8 per cent at Fl 433.9m, while sales advanced by 7.2 per cent to Fl 2.43bn. Elsevier, whose merger with Reed to form Reed Elsevier took effect on January 1, said it would lift its dividend by 16 per cent to Fl 2.61. Scientific publishing, the company's biggest and most profitable business, posted further gains last year. This was caused in part by the fact that Pergamon Press of the UK was consolidated for the full year for the first time since the UK company was purchased from the late Robert Maxwell in mid-1991. However, sales of scientific books were below expectations. In its professional and business publishing divisions, Elsevier reported profit gains for Excerpta Medica, the electronic medical database, as well as for Congress-ional Information Service of the US. Elsevier, which has gradually moved away from consumer publishing because of its dependence on cyclical advertising spending, said that its Dutch newspapers were mired in a depressed market, with lower advertising volumes putting profits under pressure. However, its Bonaventura subsidiary, which publishes news, fashion, music and car magazines, posted sharply higher results.</p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Sarajevo airlift is flying on a wing and a prayer THE international airlift of supplies to besieged Sarajevo is 'working by a hope and a prayer', according to a United Nations official in the besieged Bosnian capital. 'The situation in Sarajevo is extremely fragile,' the UN official said. 'We don't have a ceasefire yet. We don't have a concentration of heavy weaponry controlled by the United Nations. And we don't have the ground security corridor within Sarajevo.' Eleven of a planned 16 planeloads of aid were delivered by yesterday afternoon. But Swedish truck drivers hired by the United Nations refugee-relief agency are refusing to transport the aid pallets because of the danger of snipers. 'The Swedish truck drivers want to go home,' the United Nations official said. 'It is too dangerous.' Mr Fred Eckhard, a UN spokesman, said aid trucks are coming under sniper fire every day. Yesterday a Canadian soldier was seriously wounded when he stepped on a mine. 'The military situation is precarious,' he said. An attack by Bosnian forces or a 'third party' on Serbian positions sparked a heavy retaliatory artillery attack on Sarajevo's centre overnight on Thursday. The 'third party' was a reference to Croatian forces that may or may not be loyal to the Bosnian government. UN troops came under fire in their Sarajevo headquarters last night as artillery fire, mortar blasts and machinegun fire resumed. Witnesses said some of the 1,100 UN troops in the city briefly fired back with small arms from their base in the south-west of the city. The exact troop strength of the Serbian army around Sarajevo is unknown, but western analysts estimate that they number some 20,000. They are armed with mortars, tanks, armoured troop carriers, anti-aircraft guns and multiple rocket launchers. In Belgrade Serbia's parliament yesterday passed an emergency economic programme that gives the government almost complete control over the economy. The law, aimed at countering the effects of UN sanctions, gives the government sweeping powers to control the sales of goods and services. Opposition MPs attacked the law.</p>

Boston avoided becoming the first team since the 1970-71  Bruins to lose in the opening round after compiling the best regular-season  record.  </P> <P> Boston led, 2-0, after one period on goals by John Byce, in his second NHL  game, and Craig Janney. Cam Neely made it 3-0 at 15:22 of the second period on  a give-and-go play with Janney.  </P></p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Retailers face charges over fruit juice labels THE Ministry of Agriculture is to prosecute 11 food companies for alleged misleading labelling of orange juices. The companies, which include big grocery retailers such as J. Sainsbury, Tesco, Safeway and Asda, are alleged to have sold juices described as 'unsweetened' which, the ministry found last year, contained levels of corn syrup or beet sugar above the prescribed levels. Most of the companies have said they will contest the allegations. At the time of the testing, Mr John Gummer, agriculture minister, said: 'It should not be assumed from these test results that the retailers and traders of the various products tested were aware that the products offered were not consistent with the labelling.' The ministry said yesterday that the action was being taken under the provisions of the Trade Descriptions Act and the Food Safety Act, although it had previously stressed that there was no safety risk from adulteration. In its survey last year, the ministry found that only five of the 21 brands it tested consisted of pure orange juice as was claimed on the packaging. Some of the juices tested contained 'pulpwash', which is produced by processing orange husks.</p>

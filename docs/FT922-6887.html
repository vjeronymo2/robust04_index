			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Consumer credit rise adds to Bundesbank fears THE BUNDESBANK yesterday again voiced concern about the rapid expansion of German money supply, coinciding with a strong rise in consumer credit, and weak growth in capital formation. In spite of adjusting its calculation of money supply growth in March downwards, from an estimated 9.75 per cent to a corrected annual rate of 9.4 per cent, the central bank emphasised that the expansion had accelerated again: from a rate of 8.9 per cent in January, 8.6 per cent in February, and now 9.4 per cent in March. At the same time it published figures for the growth of west German private indebtedness for consumption in 1991, showing that it expanded by DM28.6bn (Pounds 9.7bn), compared with DM23.7bn in 1990, DM21.1bn in 1989, and only DM13bn in 1988. The other particular concern expressed in the Bundesbank's monthly report is the failure of capital formation to match the growth in credit to the private sector, underlining the fact that credit is being used primarily for consumption. The trend reflects in part the massive transfers of capital from west Germany to the east, to finance consumption rather than a corresponding expansion in investment there. But it also shows that western consumers are financing their spending increasingly from credit, and not income - and that easterners are rapidly acquiring the habit. The pessimistic tone in a series of articles by the bank's economics department underlines the determination of its governing council to maintain a tight monetary policy until the growth of money supply and inflation are brought down. Even the fact that industrial production in the west expanded by 3 per cent in the first quarter, compared with the last quarter of 1991, was discounted: year on year, the growth was only 1 per cent, and the reason for the strong recovery was a combination of unnaturally low production at the end of last year, and a very mild winter, outweighing the normal seasonal adjustment. The independent German Economics Institute (DIW) in Berlin published its own estimate yesterday of real 3 per cent growth in gross domestic product in the first quarter - in spite of the fact that GDP in eastern Germany actually fell by 2 per cent. The institute said that a sustained recovery in the east German economy was still not in sight, although, thanks to the high level of earning from 'commuters' travelling to west Germany to work, the gross national product of the east actually increased by 4 per cent compared with the first quarter of 1991.</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / International Company News: BHP offers ADollars 1.72bn for 32% stake in Foster's BROKEN Hill Proprietary (BHP) yesterday moved to end the uncertainty surrounding Foster's, the world's fourth biggest brewing group, by offering ADollars 1.72bn (USDollars 1.27bn) for a 32 per cent shareholding formerly controlled by Mr John Elliott. The offer follows BHP's decision in June to appoint receivers to International Brewing Holdings (IBH), a private company controlled by Mr Elliott, which owned the shares through its subsidiary International Brewing Investments (IBI). BHP said in June it would acquire IBI's Foster's shares at 'full value' if such a purchase were necessary to prevent a 'fire sale' by the receiver. Mr Ian Ferrier, the joint receiver, said he was 'minded to accept the offer', but had appointed advisers to 'explore the market for other possible buyers'. Mr John Prescott, BHP managing director, said the offer 'advances the process of restoring value to Foster's, and gives all other serious bidders an opportunity to put alternative proposals to the receivers'. Analysts said there was little chance of an alternative bid emerging because of the substantial premium over the market price required to repay IBI's secured debts of ADollars 1bn to BHP and ADollars 1.2bn to a syndicate of banks headed by Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. If the offer goes through, BHP will acquire 720m Foster's shares for the equivalent of ADollars 2.39 per share, compared with last night's closing price of ADollars 1.73. BHP said it would pay ADollars 1.5bn in cash, plus a 27 per cent shareholding in Inar, an IBH subsidiary which was the vehicle for a ADollars 740m preference share investment in the group by BHP. The offer would allow the receiver to repay ADollars 1.2bn owed by IBI to the banking syndicate, which blocked an earlier attempt to unwind IBH by refusing a BHP offer to buy its debt. About ADollars 300m would be returned to BHP by the receiver when the preference share investment becomes due for repayment in November, leaving the group with exposure to IBI of about ADollars 100m after taking account of the transfer of Inar shares and an earlier decision to write off accrued interest. The Foster's shares acquired by BHP would be worth about ADollars 1.2bn at last night's closing price, compared with the cash price of ADollars 1.5bn. However, BHP would break even if the share price rose to ADollars 2.39. The deal would make BHP the largest shareholder in Foster's, and would allow it to control the group in concert with Asahi Breweries of Japan, which owns 19.9 per cent. However, BHP has said repeatedly it does not wish to be a long-term shareholder in Foster's. BHP has acquired IBI's so-called Faversham and Fresco options over nearly 600m Foster's shares, which would lift BHP's Foster's shareholding to nearly 50 per cent. The group is thought unlikely to exercise the options unless the Foster's share price rises above the exercise prices. Mr Elliott, once chairman and chief executive of Foster's, remains a director, but he and two other IBH representatives are likely to resign before the next shareholders' meeting.</p>

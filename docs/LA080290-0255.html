			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DEL MAR;  </P> <P> A CLASSY PAIR END LAYOFFS IN SAN DIEGO 'CAP  </P> <P> Perceive Arrogance and Quiet American, a pair of classy horses coming off  layoffs, will try to stop champion mare Bayakoa from becoming the first female  to win the San Diego Handicap on Saturday at Del Mar. The Grade III test at 1  1/16 miles will be run for the 49th time.  </P> <P> Perceive Arrogance, making his first start since December, will give trainer  Joe Garcia his first stakes starter.  </P> <P> "I acquired him at the end of February when I went out on my own," said Garcia,  37, a longtime assistant to Laz Barrera. "He was laid up for a minor leg  injury. He had a real good workout last week; he went six furlongs in 1:11 and  change and galloped out a mile in 1:39. I wanted him to get tired and get  something out of it. I'll probably blow him out a half (today)."  </P> <P> Perceive Arrogance, a 5-year-old son of Stop The Music, finished second in the  Charles H. Strub Stakes and has earned $335,490.  </P> <P> A field of six or seven is probable: Bayakoa, with Laffit Pincay Jr., 122;  Annual Date, Corey Nakatani, 116; Quiet American, Kent Desormeaux, 115;  Perceive Arrogance, Corey Black, 113; Bosphorus, Rafael Meza, 112; Charlatan,  Alex Solis, 112, and Kunjar, no rider assigned, 112.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule reflects the committee's and the Department's appraisal of the need to make the specified changes. The Department's view is that this action will have a beneficial impact on producers and handlers since it will help ensure that only mature avocados are shipped to fresh markets. The committee considers that maturity requirements for Florida grown avocados are necessary to improve grower returns and promote orderly marketing conditions. Although compliance with these maturity requirements will affect costs to handlers, these costs will be offset by the benefits of providing the industry and consumers with mature avocados.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (d) of &sect;915.150 (7 CFR 915.150), currently requires that each handler, at the end of the day's operation, report to the committee the number of containers (1/4 Bushel, 1/2 Bushel, and 4/5 Bushel) of avocados sold and delivered within the State of Florida. This proposed action would suspend paragraph (d) of &sect;915.150 for the next two seasons, through March 31, 1996. This would temporarily suspend the requirement that handlers file the ``Avocado Handler Daily Size Report Form.'' The committee has determined that information needed for operations, marketing policies, and compliance, could sufficiently be obtained from inspection certificates collected on a daily basis by program staff, and that information collected on the ``Avocado Handler Daily Size Report Form'' will not be needed for the next two seasons. Further, Hurricane Andrew reduced avocado production by almost half, and this has reduced assessment collections, resulting in a need to reduce staff and administration costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The information collection requirements have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB Number 0581&hyph;0078.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule would reduce the reporting burden on approximately 65 handlers of avocados who complete the form ``Avocado Handler Daily Size Report Form,'' taking about 0.083 hour to complete each report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 915  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Avocados, Marketing agreements, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR part 915 is proposed to be amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 915_AVOCADOS GROWN IN SOUTH FLORIDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

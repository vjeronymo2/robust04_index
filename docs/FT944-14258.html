			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: UK accounting There is no doubt that the Accounting Standards Board has done much to tackle the accounting abuses which corroded UK financial reporting in the 1990s. But while its attempts to crack down on issues as various as acquisition accounting and off-balance sheet finance can only be applauded, the new rules have introduced fresh complexities. The FRS3, for example, has obliged companies to provide on the face of the profit and loss account information which in the past would have been relegated to the notes, or not published at all. This gives observers a better insight into how and where a company is generating its profits. But the price of further detail can be confusion. The rules allow companies to highlight the most favourable way of presenting earnings. This has already spawned a bewildering variety of approaches, as shown by Ernst &amp; Young's compendious review of UK accounting published today. Unsurprisingly, companies tend to highlight earnings before exceptional costs. It is true that the details of what constitutes an exceptional item are disclosed. But the investor is presented with at least two versions of the 'bottom line' - the official one and the management's self-flattering version. Analysts will carry on seeking the holy grail of yardsticks which give a good indication of a company's maintainable earnings and which are comparable from one company to the next. But investors should remember that attempts to boil down a company's performance to a few key statistics are simplistic.</p>

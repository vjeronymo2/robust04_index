			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Myriam Astrid Montoya: "62 Billion Pesos for </F> Rural Employment"]    [Text] Between September of 1992 and the same month in  1993, the number of unemployed persons in rural areas rose 12.2  percent.    The 246,101 unemployed workers were joined by another 30,000  now searching for a way to earn a few pesos to dig themselves  out of the "hole" they are in.    Unemployment has turned into one of the most serious  consequences of the crisis faced by the agricultural sector in  the past three years, especially in the case of such crops as  cotton, sorghum, tobacco, rice, and coffee. Given the loss of  profitability and the smaller crop area planted, the demand for  workers has plummeted.    The national and municipal governments are both rushing to  launch a large number of projects of common benefit in order to  provide remunerative jobs for those out of work.    Resources available this year total some 62 billion pesos,  money it is hoped will generate roughly 6.2 million days of  work, the equivalent of 24,800 full-time jobs.  <H5>  Emergency Measure </H5>   The Ministry of Agriculture came up with the idea as a  result  of its analysis of the difficult social situation created by the  crisis in agriculture.    After examining the alternatives last year, the ministry  designed an emergency program to create jobs by undertaking  labor-intensive projects that would benefit the community such  as roads, aqueducts, and reforestation.    The government's Program To Generate Rural Employment (PGE)  was formally approved by CONPES [National Council for Economic  and Social Policy] in June and went into operation in September  1993, when it was given a budget of $900 million.    Ricardo Vargas del Valle, adviser to the minister and  director of the PGE, explained that the resources were  incorporated into the DRI [Integrated Rural Development Program]  Fund. The latter then drafted a fiduciary contract (the first of  its kind) for its management by the Fiduciary Department of the  People's Bank.    However, since the projects are to be cofinanced, the  municipalities standing to benefit from them contributed another  1.3 billion pesos, raising the sum available in 1993 to 2.2  billion pesos.    Vargas del Valle said the resources should be made available  during the first half of this year and thus help relieve  unemployment problems in the departments of Atlantico, Cesar,  Cordoba, Magdalena, Sucre, Meta, Risaralda, Huila, and Tolima.    However, the funds supplied by the PGE directly are not the  only resources. Vargas del Valle also noted that some 32 billion  pesos were allocated in 1993 to finance rural development  projects in the same regions through entities such as the DRI,  Agrarian Fund, PNR [National Rehabilitation Plan], and Himat.    When last year's balance is combined with these two sources  of funding, projects on the drawing board will provide 3.4  million days of work.  <H5>  More Money for 1994 </H5>   In addition to these funds and projects, the General Rural  Employment Program starts this fiscal year with a budget of 6  billion pesos in the DRI. When that sum is combined with  cofinancing from municipalities, the total is 12 billion pesos.    When one adds the 52 billion channeled through other  national  and territorial entities via labor-intensive rural development  programs, the grand total for 1994 is 62 billion pesos.    The departments benefiting from this new allocation are  Atlantico, Bolivar, Sucre, Cesar, Tolima, Huila, Caldas,  Risaralda, Valle, Cauca, Meta, and Narino.    It is estimated that projects planned using this year's  funding will provide 6.2 million days of work.  <H5>  Details </H5>   Explaining just how the program operates, Vargas del Valle  said that after identifying the most urgent areas and assigning  priorities to projects, the DRI is ordering the fiduciary  enterprise to negotiate the respective contracts with the  municipalities.    The latter will in turn hire local workers, which means that  the projects will take longer and be somewhat more costly.  Specialized personnel are excepted from this rule.    Programs eligible basically include roads, aqueducts,  marketing, housing, reforestation, irrigation, agroindustry, and  fish farming, as well as special projects for the integrated  management of drilling.</p>

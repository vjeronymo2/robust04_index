This poses a serious threat to Iraq's  security, sovereignty, and national unity.    In a letter addressed to the Arab League secretary general  yesterday, Iraq's permanent League representative said that on  4, 5, and 6 January these aircraft continued to violate Iraq's  airspace after taking off from bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait,  carrying out 157 hostile air sorties. A list attached to the  letter gave details on these violations.</p>

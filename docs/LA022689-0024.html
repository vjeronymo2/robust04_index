			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLDEN OLDIE  </P> <P> My wife, who disapproves of my own cigar smoking, does not believe George Burns  smokes them and says he uses them only as props. Can you reaffirm for me that  George does, indeed, smoke 20 cigars a day?  </P> <P> CARROLL F. MARQUARD  </P> <P> Rancho Sante Fe  </P> <P> Margy Rochlin responds: After spending considerable time with Burns, I consider  myself something of an expert on his habits. Please assure your wife that he  definitely smokes -- but doesn't inhale -- 15 to 20 cigars a day, and I have  the dry-cleaning bills to prove it.  </P></p>

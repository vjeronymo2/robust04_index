			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [No video available] </F>   [Excerpt] The chairman of Ukraine's Supreme Council today  met representatives of foreign embassies and consulates in  Ukraine.    [Correspondent] More than 50 countries have embassies and  missions in Ukraine today. Their heads and diplomats took part  in this meeting today. Extending warm greetings to his guests,  Ukraine's Supreme Council Chairman Oleksandr Moroz said:    [Begin Moroz recording] Diplomats are concerned at the  events  taking place today in Ukraine. One such event is, of course,  the situation in Crimea. The Supreme Council and I have done  and will do our best in order to relieve in a civilized and  non-violent way the tension over the conflict caused by  excessive use of subjective influences in the settlement of the  problems which indeed exist in Crimea today. I am talking first  of all about negotiations and, thus, a return of  parliamentarians and other power structures in Crimea into the  Ukrainian constitutional channel. The general view is this:  Everybody who is guided by common sense understands that the  Crimea-Ukraine status quo must be preserved, and this fully  accords with the stance of Ukraine's Supreme Council. [end  recording]    [Correspondent] The Ukrainian parliament speaker stressed  that the Crimean problem is not the only one which calls for the  Supreme Council's attention. It is necessary that we urgently  set about pulling our economy out of crisis. Considering the  nature of his audience, Oleksandr Moroz also spoke about the  need to encourage foreign investors who could help Ukraine build  an independent state. He also spoke about Ukraine's nuclear  status which naturally concerns diplomats. Oleksandr Moroz  expressed his willingness to meet personally each of the foreign  diplomatic representatives in Ukraine in the future. [passage  omitted]</p>

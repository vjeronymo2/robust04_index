			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Speculation among political, spiritual, and  media circles that the pope's visit to Lebanon would be  postponed was confirmed today when two statements were issued,  one by the Vatican and the other at a news conference held by  Papal Nuncio Pablo Puente in the Vatican Embassy in Harisa at  noon today. Puente, who returned to Beirut yesterday following  a brief visit to the Vatican, officially announced that Pope  John Paul II's visit to Lebanon has been postponed until a date  to be decided, when conditions are more suited to such a visit  producing the expected results. [passage omitted]    In the first reaction to the postponement of the visit,  Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din, chairman of the Higher  Islamic Shiite Council, received a message from Papal Nuncio  Pablo Puente informing him of the postponement of the pope's  visit to Lebanon. His eminence expressed his regret over the  postponement of the visit, which had been awaited by Lebanon and  the Lebanese in view of the pope's position in the hearts of all  the Lebanese. His eminence added: We hope the circumstances  will become suitable for the pope to make his visit.</p>

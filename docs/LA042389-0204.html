			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NICKOLAI'S BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION ENDS UNHAPPILY AT SAUGUS  </P> <P> Steve Nickolai of Simi Valley had everything going for him -- the lead in the  Street Stock standings, a trophy-dash victory and the pole position for  Saturday night's 25-lap main event -- all on his 36th birthday -- before a  crowd of 3,594 at Saugus Speedway.  </P> <P> Yet, after the race -- in which he finished last -- an angered Nickolai  practically crushed an aluminum can in his fist.  </P> <P> Nickolai was black-flagged twice, the second on Lap 15, forcing him from the  race, as fellow Simi Valley resident Dale White Jr., took the checkered flag.  </P> <P> A jubilant White, who established a track-oval qualifying record of 18.69  seconds, credited the win to his pit crew.  </P> <P> "Just a bunch of enthusiastic buddies," said White, who began the evening fifth  in the standings.  </P> <P> Nickolai was waved to the pits during the race's only yellow flag on Lap 10  because of a fluid leak. He was flagged the second time for a driving  violation, after which he spun into the infield and parked it.  </P> <P> "They said it was a fuel leak," Nickolai said, referring to track officials. "I  get in the pits, check the car -- there's not a drop."  </P> <P> White contended that track officials played no part in the outcome.  </P> <P> "I would have run him til his tires got hot and gotten under him," White said.  "I was just waiting."  </P> <P> Dave Phipps of Simi Valley, the three-time defending Sportsman champion, won  that division's 40-lap main event to pick up his first win of the new season.  Phipps, who began the evening fifth in the points standings, started the race  on the pole and led the entire way.  </P> <P> Rick Crowe of Canyon Country won the 15-lap Street Stock figure 8 main event.  For Crowe, sixth in the standings, the win was his second of the season.  </P> <P> Herb Hill of Simi Valley won the 12-lap Sportsman semi-main event and Dale  Petty of Agoura won the Street Stock oval main event.  </P> <P> Eight-lap Sportsman heat race winners included Rusty Parr of Newhall, Arlyn  Olson of Chatsworth and Ace Bennett of Monrovia. Eight-lap Street Stock oval  heat race winners included John Schwetz and Jim Marlewski, both of Simi Valley,  Rip Michaels of Arleta and Burt Tester of Canoga Park.  </P></p>

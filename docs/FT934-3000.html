			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Murray Enterprise net assets jump Murray Enterprise, the investment trust which now focuses on smaller listed companies, achieved an improvement in net asset value per share from 124.63p to 248.84p over the 12 months ended September 30. The improvement was principally due to an investment in Nextel Communications of the US, which rose in value over the year from Pounds 4.9m to Pounds 8.1m. Available revenue fell from Pounds 126,000 to Pounds 64,000. Earnings emerged at 0.53p (0.94p) assuming full conversion of the loan stock. A single dividend of not less than 1.5p (1.31p) would be payable if all the loan stock was converted by December 31. Should no loan stock be converted the dividend for the year would be 1.9p. For the 1993-94 year the board is forecasting a dividend of not less than 4p. A proposed 1-for-1 scrip issue would reduce that payment to 2p.</p>

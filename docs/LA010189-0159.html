			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Zola Budd says she would like to run again for Britain but that she never will  denounce apartheid despite pressure from opponents of the racial separation  laws of her native South Africa.  </P> <P> In an interview telecast on Britain's ITV network, the former world champion  middle-distance runner said that although her personal beliefs do not favor  apartheid, she would refrain from public criticism of the South African regime  or its policies.  </P> <P> "I will never regret not denouncing apartheid," she said. "I have strong views  about South African politics and I still don't feel I need to make public  statements."  </P> <P> Budd returned to South Africa from Britain last spring after anti-apartheid  groups applied pressure to keep her from competing for her adopted country in  the world cross-country championships in New Zealand.  </P></p>

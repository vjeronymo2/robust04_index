Prior to the passage of the Motor Carrier Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98&hyph;554, 98 Stat. 2832, 49 U.S.C. app. 2501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et. seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), the Federal government's jurisdiction did not extend to private motor carriers of passengers (PMCPs).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With the enactment of the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984, Congress defined the FHWA's jurisdiction on the basis of vehicles operating in interstate commerce. The stated purposes of the 1984 Act were to (1) promote the safe operation of commercial motor vehicles; (2) minimize dangers to the health of operators of commercial motor vehicles; and (3) assure increased compliance with traffic laws and with the commercial motor vehicle safety rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress expanded the definition of commercial motor vehicle (CMV) in section 204 of that Act (49 U.S.C. app. 2503) to include any self-propelled or towed vehicle used on highways in interstate commerce to transport passengers or property if (a) such vehicle has a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,001 or more pounds; (b) such vehicle is designed to transport 16 or more passengers, including the driver; or (c) such vehicle is used in the transportation of hazardous materials which require a placard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interstate commerce was defined in the same section of the Act as ``trade, traffic, or transportation in the United States which is between a place in a State and a place outside of such State (including a place outside of the United States) or is between two places in a State through another State or a place outside of the United States.'' Therefore, anyone operating or causing to be operated vehicles as defined in the Act in interstate commerce became subject to regulation by the Secretary of Transportation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Current Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FMCSRs are contained in title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, parts 350 through 399. These regulations set minimum safety standards for motor carriers, vehicles and drivers involved in interstate commerce. The areas covered include driver qualification, licensing, hours of driving and on duty time, vehicle safety equipment, operating condition, inspection and maintenance. Consistent with the pre-1984 authority, PMCPs are currently exempt from the FMCSRs (parts 390&hyph;399) pursuant to 49 CFR 390.3(f)(6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986 (CMVSA)(Title XII, Pub. L. 99&hyph;570, 49 U.S.C. app. 2701&hyph;2718) established requirements for testing and licensing of all drivers of commercial motor vehicles as defined in that Act. Under the implementing regulations in 49 CFR part 383, all drivers subject to that part must successfully complete a knowledge test and skills examination, as applicable, both of which are administered by the driver's State of residence. The State then issues a Commercial Driver's License (CDL), which is the only license that may be possessed by an operator of a commercial motor vehicle. The operative definitions in the CMVSA of 1986 extend jurisdiction to any driver of a defined vehicle, whether in interstate or intrastate commerce, and whether or not otherwise subject to DOT jurisdiction. The current rulemaking does not alter the provisions of Part 383 for any CMV driver, nor does it affect other regulatory exemptions, e.g., the transportation of school children and government operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FHWA issued a Notice of Interpretation (58 FR 27328, May 7, 1993) to clarify its policy relating to for-hire transportation of passengers. That notice clarifies the FHWA's policy that businesses operating passenger-carrying commercial motor vehicles in interstate commerce, and receiving direct or indirect compensation for their transportation services, are for-hire motor carriers subject to the minimum levels of financial responsibility requirements. If the passenger-carrying capacity of the vehicle is 16 or more, including the driver, they are also subject to the remainder of the FMCSRs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Rulemaking History  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1985, the FHWA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (50 FR 2998, Docket No. MC&hyph;114) to obtain comments on the merits of regulating PMCPs. Recognizing the wide diversity of operating practices, the FHWA (shortly after the 1984 Act) contracted for a study to gain greater insight into the operating practices of these carriers. (ASW Associates, Silver Spring, Md., June 10, 1987.) Although there is little definitive accident data, the study concluded that highway safety would be enhanced by regulating PMCPs. After comments to the ANPRM were received and analyzed, the FHWA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on February 17, 1989 (MC&hyph;88&hyph;15), proposing to assert jurisdiction over these carriers with respect to certain requirements of the FMCSRs (see 54 FR 7362).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the NPRM, the FHWA acknowledged that all buses should be in safe operating condition and driven by qualified drivers. However, it would be overly burdensome and counterproductive to attempt to require every entity transporting people by bus, regardless of purpose, to comply with the whole range of regulations, including recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the NPRM, the FHWA divided PMCPs into two groups based on the relationship of the driver to the motor carrier. Group I consisted of all employees hired to perform primarily as drivers. Group II consisted of volunteer drivers (who may also be employees) who received little or no remuneration for their driving and drove for less than 10 percent of their work time. The division of the two groups was intended to recognize the distinction between business and nonbusiness operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposal advanced in the NPRM, Group I would have been treated the same as for-hire motor carriers of passengers and would have been subject to all of the FMCSRs. Group II would have been subject to CDL and the vehicle and maintenance requirements, but would not have been required to keep driver qualification files.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FHWA was also aware that some buses currently in use may not have been subject to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) fuel system requirements at the time of manufacture. The NPRM proposed to ``grandfather'' this equipment and, therefore, would not require retrofitting of the fuel systems if the vehicle has been maintained and meets the original manufacturer's standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG /FTAG --></p>

			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ISRAEL CLAIMS GAZA STRIP UPRISING OVER, FREES 474  </P> <P> Israel freed 474 Palestinian prisoners today and claimed that the occupied Gaza  Strip, where a nearly 16-month-old Arab uprising began, had been pacified.  </P> <P> Promoted as a good-will gesture for the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, the  release coincided with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's arrival in Washington  for tough talks with the U.S. government on Israel's handling of the occupied  territories.  </P> <P> At an airfield near Gaza City where 224 prisoners were freed, Brig. Gen. Aryeh  Ramot, head of the Gaza civil administration, told reporters: "We have managed  to pacify the area and bring it back to normality."  </P> <P> But in clashes today, troops shot and seriously wounded a 14-year-old  Palestinian in the head in Gaza City and wounded three schoolchildren with  rubber bullets in the Khan Younis refugee camp, hospitals reported.  </P> <P> Most of the prisoners freed were stone-throwers or minor activists, let out a  few days before the expiration of short jail sentences. Among them were 50  youngsters aged between 12 and 16.  </P> <P> In the West Bank, 250 prisoners were released, including 106 political  activists held without trial in harsh conditions at the controversial Ketziot  prison camp in the Negev desert.  </P> <P> Security sources said almost twice that number had been proposed for release  but the Shin Bet security service vetoed the freeing of many senior activists  at the last moment.  </P></p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Warning on recovery for Sweden SWEDEN will make only a slow recovery from its current economic crisis, Scandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the country's leading commercial bank, warned yesterday, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. The bank expects the country's GDP to fall 1.5 per cent in 1993, the third successive year of decline, while recovering only a weak 0.7 per cent next year. Government estimates in January suggested a 1.4 per cent drop in GDP this year, but a stronger 1.6 per cent growth next year. The bank also predicts inflation this year will rise to 5.7 per cent, exceeding the 5 per cent level on which most government forecasts are based, following the sharp depreciation of the krona. Two of the country's main economic problems - unemployment and the budget deficit - are set to get worse, warns the bank.</p>

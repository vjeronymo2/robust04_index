			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M. K. Samokhvalov, Ulyanov Polytechnical </F> Institute; UDC 621.382]    [Abstract] Previous papers have outlined the basic physical  phenomena behind electroluminescent structures and the processes  which occur in the luminophore and dielectric layers. However,  no electric model of electron processes in the  electroluminescent structure of thin film capacitors has been  developed. A thin film electroluminescent capacitor consists of  a transparent electrode, dielectric, luminophore, dielectric,  and opaque electrode on a glass substrate. The electric  properties of the luminophore layer are nonlinear. In the  equivalent circuit this is modeled with a capacitor with a  capacitance equal to the geometric capacitance of the  luminophore layer connected in parallel to a nonlinear  resistance. The dielectric layer is modeled with capacitors  whose capacitances are geometric capacitances of the dielectric  film connected in parallel with variable resistors. A full  schematic is given in a figure. The real thin film  electroluminescent capacitor and the model were compared. It was  found during testing that volt-charge characteristics could be  used for quality control. The time dependence of current was  determined for a sinusoidal and linearly alternating voltage.  The model provides an adequate representation of electron  processes in thin film electroluminescent structures.. The model  may be modified to represent more complex effects.

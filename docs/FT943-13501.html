			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / International Company News: Coca-Cola shrugs off private label competition with 13% rise Coca-Cola, the US soft drinks group, increased net profits by 13 per cent to Dollars 758m in the second quarter in spite of competition from private label colas in several of its biggest markets. Last month PepsiCo, manufacturer of Pepsi-Cola, warned that its second-quarter profits would be virtually flat, partly because of price competition in the US soft drink market and because of poor results from its fast food operations. Coca-Cola said its soft drinks volumes grew by 6 per cent in North America in the second quarter, helped by the introduction of new 'contour' packaging for classic Coca-Cola and Diet Coke, and a successful Sprite advertising campaign. It did not report separate profit figures for North America. But the company tends to be less directly affected by price competition than PepsiCo because price cuts hit the bottlers first, and unlike PepsiCo, Coca-Cola does not own its bottlers. Internationally, Coca-Cola saw zero volume growth in the European Union countries and only 1 per cent growth in Japan. It blamed poor economic conditions for these results. But rapid growth in developing markets produced total international volume growth of 7 per cent. Group revenues rose by 11 per cent to Dollars 4.34bn and earnings per share, as predicted by the company last month, rose by 13 per cent to 59 cents. Half-year net income was 14 per cent ahead at Dollars 1.28bn. Coca-Cola bought back 6m of its shares in the second quarter, taking the year-to-date total to 10m. There are now 1.29bn shares outstanding.</p>

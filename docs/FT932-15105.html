			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / People: Investment Trust figurehead Murray Johnstone, the Glasgow fund manager, has reaffirmed its strong Scottish roots by appointing Royal Bank of Scotland chairman Lord Younger as its investment trust figurehead. Lord Younger, 61, a member of the George Younger brewing family and former secretary of state for Scotland, has been appointed chairman of Murray Income Trust, Murray International Trust, Murray Smaller Markets Trust and Murray Ventures, the four main trusts which are managed by Murray Johnstone and which also control the firm. He takes over from Sir Ian Denholm, 65, the Scottish ship-owner, in the chair since 1985. Nick McAndrew, Murray Johnstone's chairman, has known Lord Younger since their schooldays together. 'I asked him if he would like to have a job on the west coast as well as the east coast, and he accepted,' says McAndrew, who notes that Younger lives halfway between Murray Johnstone's base in Glasgow and the Royal Bank's Edinburgh headquarters. Although it is relatively unusual for a fund manager to appoint the same chairman to all its investment trusts, McAndrew says that 'it is the way we have historically done it'. He did not think the practice raised any corporate governance issues and stressed that the boards of the Murray trusts were made up of independent non-executive directors. Unlike some competing trusts, his fund managers did not sit on the boards of the Murray trusts.</p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / International Company News: Novell ahead of expectations Novell, the leading computer networking software company, reported higher-than-expected second-quarter earnings, boosted by the sale of a software licence to Sun Microsystems. Net income for the quarter (ended April) grew 30 per cent to Dollars 105m, or 33 cents a share, up from Dollars 80m, or 26 cents a year earlier. Revenues increased 45 per cent to Dollars 407m. The results included a one-time gain of Dollars 81m from the sales of a licence to UNIX technology to Sun Micro-systems and associated expenses to Novell of Dollars 35m. Excluding this transaction, net revenue for the second quarter was up 16 per cent, and net earnings declined by per cent to Dollars 75m or 24 cents a share. Mr Robert Frankenberg, Novell's president and chief executive, said: 'Novell has weathered the difficult year-over-year financial comparisons that followed major investments in technology in the second half of 1993. 'The company is now positioned for more favourable comparisons during the last half of fiscal 1994.' Half of net revenue during the second quarter was from the US, excluding the effect of the UNIX technology royalty. Revenue from the US grew by 9 per cent, from Europe by 13 per cent, Asia Pacific 52 per cent and Latin America 72 per cent. Together the rapidly growing markets of Asia Pacific and Latin America now represent over 20 per cent of total revenue. For the first six months revenue was Dollars 718m, up 33 per cent. Net income increased 17 per cent to Dollars 178m, or 57 cents per share. At the end of April, cash and short term investments stood at Dollars 930m.</p>

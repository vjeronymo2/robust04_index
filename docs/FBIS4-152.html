			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with IEC Chairman Johann Kriegler by </F> correspondent Steven Lange on the "Radio Today" program; place  and date not given--recorded]    [Text] [Announcer Jeremy Dawes] The countdown to the  elections has begun in earnest, but still a major cause of  concern is kwaZulu-Natal. With violence still unacceptably high  and the fact that a state of emergency is in operation, what are  the chances of a free and fair election there? On the line to  Steven Lange, we have the chairman of the IEC [Independent  Electoral Commission], Judge Johann Kriegler:    [Begin recording] [Kriegler] A very short while that it's  been in operation, but the prospects are that it would improve  the outlook for a substantially free and fair election in  kwaZulu-Natal. To the extent that it enhances stability, law and  order, free movement of people without fear of harm, it can only  be beneficial.    [Lange] Is the state of emergency having the desired effect,  from what you've heard so far?    [Kriegler] So far, certainly yes. But it's early days yet, I  repeat.    [Lange] Have you had cooperation from the kwaZulu  administration?    [Kriegler] No, not the requisite degree. We've had a very  close look at the extent to which we could mount an election  with the cooperation that has been offered. The subcommittee is  due to report to us tomorrow. But the last report that I had  from our side was that it didn't look as if we were really  getting a great deal of cooperation.    [Lange] In what respect is it failing?    [Kriegler] Well, it's failing in the will. The word is  there, but the will is not there. You know, our officials can  work for you provided they're available, provided they're not  engaged in essential services, provided they realize that in the  political climate they're taking an enormous risk -- that kind  of ostensible support, but really not.    [Lange] Do you sense a sort of passive resistance?    [Kriegler] Yes. There used to be a term in the old British  army called dumb insolence -- you know, you go along, but you do  so with such obvious ill-will and unwillingness that in fact  it's tantamount to disobeying.    [Lange] Over the weekend Chief Minister Buthelezi suggested  that the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] might still participate in  the elections. Is this logistically possible?    [Kriegler] On the ballot paper as it is, on the planning of  the election, the legislation as it stands, it's not possible.  The only feasible means that I can imagine -- but then, I don't  have all of the options necessarily in mind -- the only feasible  option is for them to join in, in collaboration with a party  already in the ballot paper, otherwise there's no way that I can  see them joining in this particular election on the 26th, 27th,  28th.    [Lange] So the IFP will not appear on the ballot paper?    [Kriegler] No, it simply can't. We've been printing those  ballot papers for weeks and weeks now, and we cut it very short  as it is, to allow late participants an opportunity to come in,  and there's no way that we can start reprinting and have ballot  papers available for the predetermined election days with other  runners on.

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Japanese Industry (9): Success has whittled away Miti's powers - Emiko Terazono examines industrial policy A poll taken last year by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the Japanese leading business daily, revealed that Japan's leading bureaucrats thought the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) was third on the list of insignificant ministries and government agencies, following the Hokkaido Development Agency and the Food Agency. Miti was once one of the most powerful institutions in Kasumigaseki, Japan's Whitehall, orchestrating the country's industrial policy in close co-operation with the business sector. However, now that Japan's has achieved economic success and the role of industrial policy in economic development has diminished, the ministry has been marginalised among even clannish bureaucrats. Many economists agree that Miti's interventionist policy - based on identifying key growth industries, supporting them with enormous investment programmes and protecting them from foreign competition - has been largely successful. Industries such as petrochemicals, cars and electronics flourished under the wing of Miti in the 1960s and 1970s. But economic success has whittled away Miti's powers. The rising strength of corporations has reduced the influence of the government's industrial policy, while the ministry's role of selecting and promoting industries has been limited by foreign pressure on Japanese exports. 'The ministry is a little like a poverty agency that has actually succeeded in eliminating poverty,' says Mr Chalmers Johnson, professor of University of California, Berkeley, and author of Miti and the Japanese Miracle. Increased criticism from businesses over informal administrative guidelines have also reduced the ministry's power. In the past, ministries such as Miti could withhold licences and legal permissions from businesses that did not follow the guidelines. However, rules governing administrative approval procedures, introduced to make the process more transparent, have made it difficult for bureaucrats to wield influence. The ministry is also losing out in a power struggle with the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications (MPT) which began in the early 1980s for control over new potential growth sectors - namely the telecommunications and multimedia industries. Mr James Vestal, economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo and author of Planning for Change, a book which analyses the role of Miti, says that while its success in the 1950s provides lessons for developing countries, the argument that the west has something to learn from Japan's industrial policies now, is questionable. He claims that there is little scope for industrial policy in solving the middle term issues which the country's economy faces. The biggest problem, unbalanced growth, comes as a result of corporate interests being placed over those of the consumer. The lack of emphasis on consumption has led to a surplus of domestic savings over domestic investment which is at the root of the country's chronic current account surplus. The underlying cause has been the willingness of Japanese workers to put the interests of the company before their own. Industrial or macro-economic policy cannot deal with this issue. Only a radical change in the way Japanese see themselves in relation to their employers will resolve it. Nor can industrial policy solve the demographic changes which will soon hit Japanese economic growth. Pollution, another big problem, is also an issue which needs tackling outside industrial policy. The lack of industrial models also makes it hard for the country to identify potential growth industries. Since Japan cannot follow other examples of industrial development, it is on equal standing with other industrialised countries in investing and promoting the development of new technologies. In its search for a new role, the ministry has started to undo its past policy failures. In the early 1980s it moved to save jobs in the petrochemical industry by organising a cartel of Japan's producers. This has left the industry fragmented with inefficient operations and costly products. Aerospace, another industry that Miti has promoted since the 1960s, is also being reviewed. The ministry is now promoting restructuring in the petrochemicals industry, encouraging mergers and cutting costs. Mitsubishi Kasei and Mitsubishi Petrochemical merged last October and Asahi Kasei is also undergoing rationalisation. Miti has decided to side with the consumer, shifting from its role as promoter of industry. Miti has backed the country's product-liability law which will protect consumers against defective products. The bill passed parliament last June after nearly 20 years of debate. The pro-consumer direction has also allowed Miti to regain its grip on certain industries. It is using its remaining powers of intervention to place market forces into the country's energy sector - including the gas and electricity utilities and the oil industry. In spite of heavy opposition from the industries, Miti is promoting the freeing of energy prices and the deregulation of distribution routes.</p>

			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Mideast accord ISRAELI and Syrian officials said last night they had made significant progress during talks in Washington towards agreeing a joint statement of principles that would form the basis of substantive peace negotiations between them. 'We agreed on the general character of the settlement that we all want to see in the Middle East, we agreed that we all want a peaceful solution, we agreed on the mutual nature of the security problem and that security arrangements need to take into account the security needs of both sides,' said Mr Itamar Rabinovitch, Israel's chief negotiator with Syria. The optimistic comments from both parties were the most positive so far between Israel and Syria. If they achieve the aim of a joint statement by the end of the present round of talks next week, it will be an unprecedented breakthrough in four decades of enmity between them and would open the way to substantive talks on the core issue of the Golan Heights, occupied by Israel since 1967. However, little progress was reported in the parallel talks between Israel and the Palestinians, Jordan and Lebanon.</p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Watching Capricorn rise over Capitol Hill - A Washington junket devoted to the delights of goat's milk SOME WINE and cheese parties could be held only in Washington. Take a recent Thursday afternoon on Capitol Hill. An august congressional hearing room with a red carpet and stucco walls was spruced up for a reception: wines and cheeses, both domestic of course, were served and a motley group of hosts, ruddy-faced and wearing paper name tags, met all visitors with hearty handshakes. The talk that filled the air was of one thing only, a subject so dear to the hearts of all the constituents who travelled to Washington: goats. The American Dairy Goat Producers Association had put on the party, according to one of its pamphlets, 'to introduce you to the wonderful world of dairy goats' who are 'alert, intelligent, socially inclined and affectionate. A loving and loved pet'. In fact, the gala affair was only a taste sampling. No cheques or endorsements at this gathering, only goat cheeses (from chevre to mozzarella), goat ice cream (chocolate and vanilla), goat butter, goat bon bons, goat milk, goat yoghurt, goat fudge. 'We're not lobbyists,' said Mr Larry White, a goat and cattle farmer from Virginia. 'Just trying to get the word out that goat products taste good.' And, perhaps taking a cue from the Rio Earth Summit, participants emphasised that their produce was environmentally correct, too. Compared with cows - the industry's main, and so far untouchable, competitor in the milk market - goats eat more sparingly and take up less space, and thus put less of a strain on the earth's resources. Pound for pound, the goat produces twice the milk a cow can, which is not a bad sell for economic efficiency in recession-plagued America. 'In the US, we think bigger is better,' said Ms Linda Cambell, the association's president, adding that if people were truly serious about economising they would switch from cow milk to goat milk. Just as dear to Americans are health concerns, and the goat enthusiasts have points to make here. Goat milk, with fewer calories and less fat, is considered healthier than the bovine; this is especially true for those with weak stomachs, because the protein structure of goat's milk is easier to break down, according to Mr Jerome Samuels, who not only distributes it but drinks it to alleviate his own stomach ulcers. Ms Emily Benedict, who raises cows and goats on her 260-hectare (650-acre) farm in West Virginia, noted that ironically 'heifers grow better on goat milk than cow milk.' Little wonder, then, that goat milk is so popular in health food stores, and especially in California. But there is a problem. The goat people, like many other Americans, feel a little disaffected and marginalised by foreign competition and domestic prejudice. The foreign threat comes principally from France, which is also a bete noir of US trade officials. The French dominate the goat cheese market. Although domestic production of 1.8m lb exceeds the 1.1m lb that is imported from France, producers lament that the French product is more popular and more easily available in America. The standard excuse is that US labour costs are higher and product quality regulations stricter, while the French under-price their cheeses in the US market and simultaneously play on the American bias in favour of French cheese. An appeal to patriotism may be just what is needed. 'We need to promote 'Made in America',' said Ms Cambell, whose group represents 13,000 farmers and some 400,000 goats. 'The US imports a tremendous amount of goat cheese, but ours is just as good as the French.' Even so, bias is not limited to snobbery. Mr Samuels, the goat milk distributor, said that his product 'has a stigma attached to it - just the name'. The group, through these meetings, tries to show people that in fact goat milk 'tastes great'. And yet, despite the innocuous billing for the party, the political designs were not far beneath the surface, as became apparent with the arrival of a Very Important Guest (nobody dared call him the big cheese) to meet the flock. This was the powerful House Agriculture Committee chairman, Mr Kika de la Garza, a Democrat from Texas. He is the group's champion on dairy goat research, alternative agriculture funds, and medical research for (not on) goats. He too, like the less prominent congressmen who came before him, shook hands, had his picture taken, and departed five minutes later without trying either the Alabama soft chevre or the Oregon feta. Out in the hallway - irreverently called the Gucci Gulch, because many well-dressed and well-paid lobbyists drift there to sway votes during committee hearings - Mr de la Garza explained his commitment to the goat. 'I grew up drinking goat milk in Texas,' he said. 'We have to make the palates of Americans knowledgeable of the delicacies of the dairy goat.' So the day was a success. The products were plugged and Mr de la Garza saw them. And as the sun set on the Hill everyone went back to their goat farms with their faith in American democracy, and their legislative priorities, renewed.</p>

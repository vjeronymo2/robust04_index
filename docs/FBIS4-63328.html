			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>   [Excerpt] Estonian Defence Minister Indrek Kannik and  Justice Minister Kaido Kama handed in their resignations to  Prime Minister Mart Laar at an emergency cabinet session  Wednesday [18 May] night, the government's spokesman Ain Saarna  told ETA on Thursday. Both Ministers were to present their  resignations to President Lennart Meri on Thursday.    The parliamentary faction of the ruling Fatherland had on  Wednesday agreed to Laar's proposition to dismiss Kannik.    On Thursday, other coalition parties were to discuss further  work of the government, Saarna said.    The coalition board met to discuss the situation in the  government. Their standpoint is that all government ministers  should immediately inform of their possible intentions to  resign. Clarity is necessary not only to the government, but  also the nation, the board said. [passage omitted]</p>

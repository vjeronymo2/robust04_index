			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Bristol (5): Shared strategy devised - Economic development During the 1980s, Avon was seen as one of the more successful sub-regions in the UK, with an employment rise of 12 per cent, the biggest increase for any mainly urban area. The county has 23,000 businesses, employing 400,000 people. The growth was led by business and financial services with companies relocating from London and the south-east. This masked the decline in traditional manufacturing such as tobacco, transport, food, chemical and mechanical engineering. By 1991, financial and business services accounted for 16 per cent of the workforce while distribution, hotels and catering employed 21 per cent. Manufacturing accounted for only 18 per cent. The recession braked inward investment from south-east England and jobs were shed from aerospace and defence industries. Between 1989 and 1991, the census of employment shows, defence jobs fell by 10 per cent, tourism by 12 per cent and construction by 17 per cent. An overdue awareness of a need to respond to rapid structural change has caused the public and private sectors to devise a shared strategy for economic development. In 1993, they formed the Western Development Partnership in Avon, an umbrella organisation to pull together previously unco-ordinated activities. Its partners include all seven of Avon's councils, Bristol Chamber of Commerce and Initiative, the regional Confederation of British Industry and Trades Union Congress, universities and Avon training and enterprise council. The WDP, led by Mr Richard Brown, its chief executive, has had a big impact in stimulating Bristol and Avon to be more pro-active. Taskforces have been set up for aerospace, high technology and financial services which are intended to lead to specific initiatives. A technology and innovation management team, with funding from the European Konver fund, has been established to advise small businesses to develop new products and bring them to market. In September, the WDP produced an agreed strategy for economic development, including a target of creating 7,000 jobs a year and of reducing unemployment at a faster rate than the UK average. The strategy seeks to create a 'marketable and recognisable region' in the west of England. One of the difficulties for the south-west in promoting its case has been this difficulty of defining the region, and the multiplicity of development partnerships which sprung up during the recession. All seven counties have their own bodies with the result that they often appear to compete rather than co-operate. After much lobbying, the Department of Trade and Industry is providing start-up funding of Pounds 100,000 for a single new agency - the West of England Development Agency - which will seek to win inward investment for the five counties of Avon, Dorset, Gloucestershire, Somerset and Wiltshire. Devon and Cornwall already have a government-funded development bureau. A chief executive for the West of England agency, which is chaired by Sir Michael Lickiss, who heads the Somerset Economic Partnership, is being appointed and it will be based in Bath. But it is not yet clear how the relationship between the new agency and the WDP and other county organisations will evolve. In Bath, the city council itself decided this autumn it must give more priority to economic development and to promoting the city as a business location. Another initiative is a North American Business Club, set up in February last year to promote Bristol as a gateway to the UK and Europe. It has gained members from 100 companies and is the only UK member outside London of the British-American Business Council, based in Washington, DC. In the summer, the club hosted a conference on US government procurement and, this month, a trade mission from the Bristol-Florida chamber of commerce. More missions are planned next year. Mr Richard Dennery, the club's president, comments: 'The awareness within the US of Bristol as a business venue is growing enormously.' An initiative for Avon's indigenous businesses is the setting up of Business Link one-stop advice shops, as part of the planned national network. A bid for funding, backed by Avon Tec and the chamber of commerce, has been made to the Department of Trade and Industry and it is intended Business Link should be fully established early next year. This should help Avon Tec, set up in 1991 and now chaired by Mr Colin Green, managing director of Rolls-Royce Military Aero Engines, to become better known. A survey of 820 employers in the county this summer showed the Tec's main impact had been on large employers with well-developed training cultures. Among the rest of the business community, it was seen as a purveyor of government training programmes and had not established its profile as a business support agency. The survey showed that most employers recognised the need for change if they were to grow. They saw the need to improve quality, raise skill levels of staff and managers, and improve strategic management. But the report commented: 'A considerable gap still remains between recognising the need to change and responding to it.' Less than half of the companies with fewer than 100 employees had sought help in these matters. Although 68 per cent of the employers provided training, the survey found that a third of companies - mostly those with 10 or fewer employees - were unaware of the Tec. Only a small proportion of employers had 'any real appreciation of the role of the Tec and a detailed knowledge of the activities it undertakes.' The report concluded that the Tec needed to work more closely with other business support agencies through Business Link. 'However, if this initiative is to make a real impact, it needs to develop a strong portfolio of services to meet the changing needs of employers, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, which all agencies, not just the Tec, have largely failed to reach to date.'</p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Rules on bankruptcy are the great leveller: The increase this year in personal insolvencies THE RICH may have farther to fall, but once they become bankrupt those concerned - from Thursday including Mr Kevin Maxwell - are subject to the same rules as everyone else. Mr Maxwell and Mr Asil Nadir, founder of Polly Peck International, are two of the most recent high-profile individuals to become bankrupt. Earlier this week, Lord Beaverbrook, the former Conservative party treasurer, staved off bankruptcy with the court extending him protection from his creditors who are owed nearly Pounds 1m. But behind the financial difficulties of these businessmen lie problems facing many thousands of ordinary people who have become bankrupt this year alone. Mr Nigel Halls, a partner with Cork Gully, the insolvency arm of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, says bankruptcy can be the fate of an individual who either has liabilities which exceed assets, or who does not have the cash to service debts in the short term. Statistics released last month by the Department of Trade and Industry for the first half of this year show 18,389 people were declared bankrupt in England and Wales, and 5,578 in Scotland. That represented a jump of 60 per cent and 52 per cent respectively on the same period last year. Separate figures from the Lord Chancellor's Department show that individual bankruptcy petitions in the courts in England and Wales - which register more quickly than the DTI figures and do not always result in bankruptcy - increased by 43 per cent to 23,032. The future looks no less gloomy. Cork Gully estimates that there will be 50,000 individual bankruptcies for the whole of this year. Many thousands more are still bankrupt from previous years. The recession has obviously caused an increase in bankruptcies as people have lost their jobs, found mortgage payments beyond their means and suffered rising interest rate charges on credit-card loans and other forms of debt. However, Mr Halls says: 'Bankruptcy is no longer the stigma it used to be.' People have shaken off the image of the debtors' prison and increasingly see the procedure as a realistic way to cope with mounting debt. At the same time, many practitioners point a finger at the government's insolvency service. Underfunding, combined with the increased volume of work in the past few years, has lead to less scrutiny of a bankrupt's affairs than used to occur. Bankruptcy under English law can result from two sources: debtors' petitions, which are brought by the individual and comprise nearly two thirds of the total this year, and creditors' petitions, which are brought by others owed money by the individual. A petition is lodged with a county court or the High Court and if it is not challenged, a bankruptcy order is issued by the judge. If there are assets which can be recovered, a trustee in bankruptcy will be appointed. Otherwise, an official receiver from the government's insolvency service is appointed. The trustee sets about investigating and realising the bankrupt's assets, and has the right to question others with knowledge of the assets. Any assets against which there are charges - such as mortgages - go to the 'secured' creditors. Preferential creditors, including the Inland Revenue and the trustee himself, must then be paid in full. Any remaining money is distributed between the other creditors. Bankrupts can keep a normal working salary or state benefits on which to live after the order is in place, but any windfall gains can be realised only by the trustee with the approval of the court. Bankrupts cannot be a director or manage the affairs of a company, stand for public office, or incur credit above Pounds 250 without declaring their status. Those with debts below Pounds 20,000 are normally discharged from bankruptcy after two years. Those with debts above this level are typically discharged after three years. Once discharged, creditors have no right to make claims on any money the bankrupt makes. However, if the official receiver objects to the discharge - which may be because the bankrupt refuses to co-operate, does not comply with the procedures or is found to have committed fraud - the period can be extended indefinitely.</p>

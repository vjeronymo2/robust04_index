			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Neuquen, 16 Feb (NA) -- Argentine President  Carlos Menem and his Chilean counterpart, Patricio Aylwin, have  dedicated an oil pipeline of 425 km that will carry oil to  Chile. This is the most important binational project between the  two countries.    The oil pipeline will increase oil transportation to 120,000  barrels daily, which will represent $500 million a year of  Argentine oil exports.    Chile hopes to save $25 million through the reduction of oil  import costs by buying directly from Argentina.    The financing of the oil pipeline involved YPF [Government  Oil Deposits], which provided 57.75 percent of the capital, the  Bank of Rio with 30 percent, and the Chilean National Petroleum  Enterprise (Enap) with 12.25 percent. [passage omitted]    Argentine Mining Secretary Alejandro Hales said the oil  pipeline was built in 15 months with an investment of $220  million, and that "this is a clear example that borders are  geographical divisions that should not separate but unite."    The pipeline will carry from 6,000 to 8,000 cubic meters of  crude daily in the first stage and eventually will reach 17,000  cubic meters, about 100,000 barrels daily, that will be refined  in Chile.    YPF President Jose Estenssoro said this "is the largest"  project built by the two countries and "an important day" for  the two.</p>

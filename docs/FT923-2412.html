			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / International Company News: IBM shares slide on sales fears INTERNATIONAL Business Machines' stock price continued to decline yesterday amid growing pessimism about the outlook for sales of its flagship mainframe computers, following Monday's announcement by Amdahl, another mainframe manufacturer, of slowing sales. As Wall Street analysts lowered IBM's investment ratings, the stock fell by Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 82 7/8 at yesterday's close. Amdahl dropped slightly by Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 9 3/8 following a fall of more than Dollars 5 on Tuesday. Amdahl's forecast of an operating loss for the current quarter raised concerns that weak capital spending may have a negative effect on all makers of mainframe computers. Many business customers are deferring capital expenditures by upgrading existing computer systems or purchasing second-hand mainframe computers. However, mainframe industry executives said that demand for high-end machines remains 'the same as it has been for the past 12 months'. Industry analysts agree that the trend toward 'downsizing' to networked computer systems has had little impact on sales of high-end mainframe computers. They argue that Amdahl is suffering more than its competitors at the moment because it lacks the high-capacity data storage products that its competitors offer. Amdahl is expected to begin shipments soon of a new generation of data storage systems that will match the performance of similar products from IBM and Hitachi.</p>

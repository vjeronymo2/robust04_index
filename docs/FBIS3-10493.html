According to a well-informed source, last week he said to  several of his colleagues: "See what you can do in Brazil's  favor. The Brazilians are good people and it is time to give  them a hand."    It has been almost a decade since we have heard a member of  the U.S. Government say something similar. In view of the  deterioration of Brazil's image and the interest in our country  in Washington, any positive comments on Brazil in official  circles were regarded, in the best of cases, as the prelude to a  sarcastic joke.    Kantor, in truth, has a good political reason to try  obtaining support for Brazil. He believes that positive  gestures from other government areas will help the Brazilian  executive branch convince Congress to approve the Industrial  Property Code amendments agreed on with Washington. If this  does not happen by mid-June, Kantor will resume his actions  against Brazil; he will impose commercial sanctions against our  country. Instead of a successful negotiation, Kantor will have  resounding failure on his hands.    But, on the other hand, Kantor's new attitude may mark the  beginning of a significant change in the U.S. attitude toward  Brazil. The patents agreement is merely part of a process to  review Brazil that already is being carried out simultaneously  by several sectors of the U.S. Government.    Recent Brazilian decisions, such as the ratification of the  nuclear nonproliferation agreement with Argentina and its  decision to sign the Missile Technology Control Regime, have  removed some ancient obstacles. The political stabilization  program, the political implications of the IMF's support or  rejection of the anti-inflationary program, and the increasingly  tight deadlines for the signing of an agreement by Brazil with  the creditor banks will force the Treasury to make decisions as  of this week.    Another factor is the defects that have surfaced during the  past few months in countries chosen by the United States as  models for Latin American reform: The Chiapas rebellion in  Mexico and revolts and signs of problems in the Argentine  economy have revealed the weakness of the countries chosen as  models and have prompted a reassessment of the region.    The domestic debate has hardly started. High-ranking  government officials, such as Kantor, who currently uphold a  more constructive and hopeful attitude toward Brazil admit that  their stance is not predominant. But the possibility of a  change of attitude does exist.    A recent internal analysis of the U.S. State Department  implicitly appreciated the warning made by former Brazilian  Ambassador to Washington Rubens Ricupero in December 1992 as he  criticized the negative stereotype adopted by the United States  regarding Brazil in a speech. Ricupero warned that this  simplistic approach prevented the United States from truly  valuing the democratic character of the country's transformation  process. Focusing his attention on Chiapas and the meager growth  experienced by Mexico and Argentina, the analysis' author  resorted to former President Richard Nixon's famous theory and  wrote that, in conclusion, the consolidation of political  democracy and a free market economy in the region, upheld by  Washington, is subject to what happens in Brazil.    The same theory was upheld last week by economist Albert  Fishlow of California University. "The future of the  hemisphere's economic integration will not be determined by the  debate regarding Chile or Argentina's entry into NAFTA but by a  future agreement to substantially reduce commercial tariffs  between Brazil and the United States," asserted Fishlow. He  regards that agreement as a natural result of the current  stabilization program's success.    The geo-economic logic of the search for markets  characteristic of Bill Clinton's foreign policy also has  contributed to bringing Brazil back on to Washington's radar.  For obvious reasons the U.S. Commerce Department has placed  Brazil on the list of the 10 top emerging markets in the world,  for which it is preparing specific penetration strategies. With  an stable economy, development, and an increasing number of  consumers, Brazil now fits U.S. interests.</p>

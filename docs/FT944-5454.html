			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / International Company News: Bear Stearns buys Dollars 700m of Kidder Peabody bonds Bear Stearns has bought nearly Dollars 700m of mortgaged-backed bonds from General Electric in a further liquidation of the bond portfolio once held by Kidder Peabody, GE's investment banking unit. The sale is believed to account for the bulk of the complex derivative-type securities once held by Kidder. Mr John Site, an executive vice-president at Bear Stearns, refused to provide details of the type of securities the firm had bought, except to say that they were all collateralised mortgage obligations. Although securities, these instruments share many of the characteristics of derivatives, since they provide a leveraged return based on underlying interest rates. The most common types are interest-only bonds (IOs) and principal-only securities (POs,) which are created by dismantling standard mortgage-backed bonds into separate interest and principal elements. Bear Stearns is believed to have bought the securities in an auction among a small number of Wall Street firms. Among those bidding, according to one rival firm, was Mr Mike Vranos, the head of mortgage-backed bonds at Kidder and the leading expert in the field on Wall Street. Mr Vranos, who has yet to announce his plans now Kidder's individual businesses are being either sold to PaineWebber or closed down, was said to have been backed in the bid by money from a wealthy US business family. The latest sale marks one of the most significant in the liquidation of Kidder's mortgage-backed bond portfolio, which stood at Dollars 16bn in March but had been cut to Dollars 4bn by mid-November. The CMO market was hit harder than other sectors of the fixed income markets by the progressive rises in US interest rates earlier this year, due to the complexity of many of the instruments traded and the leveraged nature of their exposure to interest rates. Commenting on the outlook for the CMO market, Mr Site said: 'We see it as slowly correcting itself over time. Equilibrium has returned.'</p>

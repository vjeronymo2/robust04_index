			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Baiba Melnace: "Russian Customs Tariffs Will </F> Impede Production in Latvia"]    [Excerpts] Riga, 31 Mar -- The new, higher import customs  duties, introduced by Russia, will have a negative effect on  Latvian manufacturers who export their products to Russia.  According to statistics, approximately 36 percent of the total  Latvian export goes to Russia. Olgerts Pavlovskis, minister of  state for trade and European Union Affairs, does not think that  the increasing of import customs tariffs on Russia's part means  economic pressure on the Baltic states. However, the Estonian  Government, as DIENA has already reported, is of the opinion  that by introducing new customs tariffs Russia has started an  economic war against the Baltic states.    According to O. Pavlovskis, an increase in customs duties is  not a special political act aimed at the Baltic states alone,  because the tariffs are higher also for other countries.  Nonetheless, the fact that the Russian parliament avoids -- for  more than one year -- ratifying the most favored nation clause  for trade with Latvia could be regarded as political pressure.  Consequently, the import tariffs for Latvian goods are twice  the so-called basic import tariffs.    At present, Russia has granted the most favored nation  clause  to 125 countries and organizations, for example, to the European  Union, and basic import tariffs are being applied to goods  arriving from these countries . Among the developing countries,  104 can supply their goods paying only half of the basic import  tariffs, and 46 countries are not obliged to pay any customs  duties at all. The rest of the countries, including the Baltic  states, have to pay a customs duty for their goods that is twice  as high as the basic tariff. Since 15 March, customs tariffs in  Russia were increased for all agricultural products, and were  applied also to those that were customs free until now. For milk  and milk products, as well as for meat, the new basic tariffs  are 15-20 percent of the value of the product, but for Latvian  products, as was said before, they are twice as high. Among  industrial goods, the highest raise was set for vans -- from 5  to 30 percent. For motorbikes it has risen up to 20 percent,  for cosmetics -- about 5 percent, for textiles -- about 10  percent. The average customs duty for Latvian goods amounts to  40 percent of the value of the manufactured article. [passage  omitted]    Andrejs Runcis, director of the trade department in the  Ministry of Economy, pointed out that the reason for the  problems with the export of Latvian products to Russia is the  lack of a main trade agreement between Latvia and Russia. He  told DIENA: It is absolutely clear that the new tariffs create  obstacles for Latvia in trading with Russia. At the same time,  the behavior of Russia is illogical -- if the customs duties are  rising, the prices are rising too. The big cities in Russia  wish to conclude direct trade agreements with Latvia on food  supplies, in order to lower the prices. [passage omitted]</p>

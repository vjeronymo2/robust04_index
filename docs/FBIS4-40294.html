			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Gavrilenko report: "Military Diplomacy </F> Strengthens Russian Positions in the Transcaucasus. And This  Has the Region's Support. Those Are the Results of Russian  Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's Visits to Yerevan, Tbilisi, and  Baku"]    [Text] How right the wise man was who gave the world many  centuries ago this brief but profoundly meaningful phrase:  Everything is relative. He may not have thought then that a  thousand years later people would use it to assess their past,  weigh up their present, and look to the future. Thanks be to  the wise man....    In spring 1993 Pavel Grachev inspected the 145th Motorized  Rifle Division of the Group of Forces in the Transcaucasus and  the Gudauta airborne troops. It was then that he told  journalists who besieged him in Batumi that Russia has always  had and will continue to have national interests in the  Transcaucasus. What a hullabaloo that caused.... This elicited  an extremely irritable reaction from the Transcaucasian  capitals. What hasn't the Russian military minister been  accused of! Imperial thinking, aggressiveness, an unwarranted  incursion into lofty politics.... But Pavel Grachev did not  counter the insults. He kept himself in check. Since he  realized that time and events would provide the best commentary.    A year has elapsed. And the Transcaucasian states, our  former Union brothers, have passed this year in an amazingly  similar fashion. Azerbaijan and Armenia have exhausted one  another in the war in Karabakh. Georgia has proudly and  unsuccessfully tried with weapon in hand to get back Abkhazia.  Ostentatiously turning their backs on Russia the heads of  states sought patrons elsewhere. It is needless to say  blasphemous to compare diplomacy to soccer, but I will run that  risk: Fortunes fluctuated during the game, but the ball is  round, as they say. And the result is what counts. There were  no sponsors to be found in the direct sense of the word.  Cautious advice was provided. And a little help.    Aircraft carrying humanitarian aid have indeed begun to be  heard in the skies of the Transcaucasus, but nothing more.  People in the capitals of the Transcaucasus have probably begun  to realize that turning their backs on Russia is tantamount to  fouling their own nest and flying in the face of history [metit  pod katok istorii]. And, regrettably enough, one once again has  to realize that the "notorious" wheel of history cannot be  stopped. And that Russia does indeed have and will continue to  have its interests in the Trancaucasus. And there where people  have always spoken ironically of Pavel Grachev's diplomatic  efforts and statements, he has suddenly begun to be eulogized  and his visits to each of the capitals have begun and ended with  an honor guard and the thunder of a military band. And it  suddenly became clear amid this thunder that not only do  Russia's interests in the Transcaucasus really exist, but the  Transcaucasus states themselves are committed to ensuring that  the interests of Russia and the Transcaucasus do not wane....    The Russian defense minister's visit to the Transcaucasus  lasted over three days. In Yerevan Pavel Grachev saw that the  Armenian leadership has no false illusions as to the nature,  scale, and intensity of the development of Russian-Armenian  relations in the military sphere. In their view, tackling the  question of creating some kind of coalition organ for the whole  Transcaucasus is a thing of the future.    The previous accord on retaining the two base components of  the Russian Army as defined and envisaged by the relevant  provisions of the interstate agreements and the norms of  international law, on increasing the number of personnel, and  giving Russian troops in the republic greater mobility while  tangibly strengthening Air Force and Air Defense Force  facilities was reaffirmed.    Tbilisi also clearly manifested a desire to change the  Russian troops' status to the base principle taking as a  foundation for this the Russian troops' current stationing  locations. The sides agreed to set up groups of experts to  draft decisions on this matter. Pavel Grachev's "drop" into  Gudauta for a few hours and his meeting there with Abkhazia's  head, Vladislav Ardzinba, was due to his desire to clarify the  whole problem of bringing Russian peacemakers into the  Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone. That seems to have been done  and the sides -- Georgian and Abkhazian -- are satisfied. So  the peoples are waiting for the peacekeepers.    In Baku people were waiting for Pavel Grachev to confirm his  intentions regarding the subsequent development of military  cooperation. In particular, the Azerbaijanis displayed interest  in the creation of a common air defense system with Russia.  Talks on the Russian early warning station can also be  considered successful: The station will operate; Azerbaijan  also has an interest in that. As for the Karabakh conflict,  Geydar Aliyev could not say anything more than that he is ready  to observe the cease-fire and so the question of bringing  Russian peacemakers into the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict zone  remains open.    Those are the results of Russian Defense Minister Pavel  Grachev's visit to the Transcaucasus. Despite the lack of  concrete accords in Baku, the results can be considered  successful. The current round of military diplomacy strengthens  Russia's positions in the Transcaucasus.    So are we returning to the Transcaucasus? Perhaps we have  not even left? At least we have not left the hearts and minds  of the peoples.</p>

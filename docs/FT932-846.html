			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Dethronement of the D-Mark: The German currency's weakness in the ERM It is not an excuse to sing the Marseillaise, says Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. But recent cuts in French, Dutch and Belgian interest rates, which occurred independently of any relaxation of monetary policy by the Bundesbank, were, he thought, a comforting example of European co-operation. They were certainly a demonstration of D-Mark weakness. That short-term interest rates in currencies closely linked to the D-Mark can fall below those in the D-Mark is not surprising, at least in theory. Since the exchange rate mechanism permits fluctuations within the bands of up to 2.25 percentage points, deviations in short-term interest rates can occur, in response to cyclical divergences, even when parities are expected never to be realigned. None the less, what is happening is unprecedented. Three-month interbank interest rates in Dutch guilders have been below those in D-Marks since January 1992. Recently, however, the guilder has been joined by the Belgian and, more significantly, by the French franc (see chart). Moreover, the official intervention rate of the Banque de France has been cut eight times since the parliamentary elections in March, the last time this week, to rest a quarter of a percentage point below the Bundesbank's discount rate. Yet the D-Mark remains among the weaker currencies in the ERM. It is no longer, it seems, fanciful to talk of the French franc as joint anchor of the ERM. But can one conclude that the D-Mark might cease to be an anchor altogether? The Bundesbank would certainly deny this. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank's president, recently congratulated the French on their achievement. But he also stressed that the Bundesbank had 'kept the D-Mark stable for 40 years and intends to go on doing so'. Mr Schlesinger is soon to retire, while his designated successor, Hans Tietmeyer, is more internationally minded. But he knows that his influence depends on the strength of the D-Mark. The view in the markets is far from apocalyptic. Yields on German bonds have risen since April. But they remain rather low by historical standards. Among ERM currencies, only Dutch bonds have lower yields than German ones. Outside the ERM, just two currencies, the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc, are regarded as far better long-term bets than the D-Mark. The D-Mark may no longer be the undisputed king of European Community currencies. But it remains co-regent. The markets do not expect it to depreciate in the long term against its core ERM partners or, for that matter, dramatically against the US dollar. They forecast further gradual cuts in short-term D-Mark interest rates. Core ERM currencies are expected to depreciate against the yen, the US dollar and even sterling in the short term, but to decline significantly only against the yen, among the main currencies, in the longer term. Things might go wrong with this complacent scenario in two ostensibly contradictory directions. The first possibility is renewal of doubts about the ability of the French, in particular, to stay the course. While French nominal interest rates have fallen, real French short-term rates are around 5 per cent. The French unemployment rate is forecast by the European Commission at 12 per cent in 1994, while economic recovery is also expected to be modest. Mr Philippe Seguin - leader of the anti-Maastricht tendency in the Gaullist party and president of the National Assembly - has already challenged the franc fort policy of the government. With the presidential elections due in 1995, it is easy to envisage renewed doubts about French willingness to tolerate high real interest rates. No wonder France wants Germany to accept co-ordinated cuts in interest rates. The second possibility is that D-Mark weakness would prove both long term and ultimately uncontrollable, even by the Bundesbank. This apocalyptic view has been advanced by the investor, George Soros. The case is not difficult to make. Germany's total public sector borrowing requirement is 7 1/2 per cent of gross domestic product, among the highest in Europe. Germany has the second highest inflation in the group of seven leading industrial countries and the fifth highest in the European Community. German labour costs are out of line, especially for a country whose true level of unemployment (allowing for short-time working and other make-work schemes) is already above 5m, or more than 13 per cent of the labour force. According to data collected by Morgan Stanley, West German labour costs per hour are the highest in the world, while east German labour costs more than Japanese and American labour and is 10 times more expensive than in comparable former communist countries, like the Czech Republic. This seems unsustainable. After unification Germany did need a short-term D-Mark appreciation, in order to help transfer resources to east Germany that were previously lent abroad, via the current account surplus. This adjustment seems to have largely occurred, partly through nominal appreciation of the D-Mark (notably after the summer of 1992) and partly through higher German inflation than in partner countries. In the longer term, however, Germany needs depreciation of the real exchange rate, in order to restore its competitiveness. There are two routes to enhanced competitiveness: depreciation and competitive disinflation. The former can occur easily enough vis a vis currencies against which the D-Mark is floating. Against core ERM currencies, however, nominal depreciation would imply downward realignment of the D-Mark. This the Bundesbank would presumably resist to the death. Germany does two-fifths of its trade with countries whose exchange rates have remained fixed against the D-Mark. None the less, it could obtain sufficient overall real depreciation if the core of the ERM were to depreciate substantially against currencies outside it. Such a general depreciation of the core currencies of the ERM would be more than welcome to France, since it could combine fixity of the bilateral exchange rate against the D-Mark with enhanced overall competitiveness. It might not be good enough for the Bundesbank, however, which is more likely to want to preserve a strong D-Mark. Moreover, even to sustain D-Mark credibility within the ERM, underlying German unit cost inflation must be no higher than in other core ERM countries. For this reason, the German central bank is certain to strive for underlying inflation as low as in any other EC member country. Unfortunately, this may prove infeasible, since disinflationary German monetary policies are normally matched, willy nilly, by other countries in the ERM. A vicious circle of competitive disinflation could result. One escape from such a collective downward spiral would be a sharp decline in German relative inflation, which looks unlikely. Another would be substantial German fiscal tightening, which looks more unlikely. Yet another escape would be a further collapse in German credibility, allowing far lower short-term rates in other ERM countries than in Germany, which looks less likely still. A final escape would be a jump to monetary union, which looks least likely of all. Markets may well be too complacent about ERM stability. Abandonment by the Bundesbank of the effort to push German inflation down to levels achieved elsewhere in the ERM is one threat, since this would undermine the D-Mark's position within the ERM. But continued efforts by the Bundesbank to push German inflation down could be equally dangerous, since it would reinforce the recession in the heart of the European economy and enhance French anguish. There is no easy way out. The currency markets are, in fact, seeing a slow motion clash between an irresistible force - German unification - and an immovable object - the Bundesbank's commitment to a stable D-Mark. The Bundesbank may be defeated, as Mr Soros expects. If it is, Europe's monetary scene would indeed be transformed. The battle to restore credibility to the D-Mark is certain to inflict continued pain on everyone. Germans may no longer be able to sing D-Mark uber alles. But a year from now, nobody in France is likely to sing the Marseillaise over the defeat of the D-Mark, even in their baths.</p>

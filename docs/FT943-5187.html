			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Cairo cobbles together a conference, at a price: Mark Nicholson finds the United Nations population and development gathering confused, chaotic and costly Diplomats gnashed their teeth, United Nations officials wore a tired air of resignation, journalists fumed and sweltering delegates inched their way painstakingly through a glacially slow registration procedure  - but the biggest international conference to be hosted by the Egyptian capital was up and running. Just. It has proved, according to United Nations conference organisers, one of the most nerve-jangling exercises in just-in-time management in their experience. 'In 20 years of attending and organising international conferences,' said one senior official, 'I have never seen such chaos.' UN organisers began arriving a week ago to find empty offices where they expected to find desks, chairs, telephones, faxes and photocopiers. Hundreds of local staff had not been hired. Telephone lines out of the press centre were hooked up only two days ago. But by yesterday, for all the gripes of organisers and some major outstanding difficulties, some UN officials were privately voicing a stunned awe at the conference hosts' ability to throw it all together, more or less, at the last moment. Some glitches remained. Like the fact that there were no telephone lines into the press centre to serve a world of anxious news editors. Reporters from Associated Press were none too impressed to find that the office they had rented for Dollars 7,000 had been locked up and declared out of bounds for security reasons. Late-arriving representatives, meanwhile, were grinding through a registration procedure averaging five delegates an hour: a combination of there being too few computers, just two photo-ID machines to process around 4,500 delegates and some fairly grave problems with the spelling of names. But inside the palatial Chinese-built conference centre 15,000 delegates and representatives ebbed and flowed in purposeful confusion from makeshift offices and halls which will host 100 meetings daily. In what appeared an attempt to lend the affair a subliminal tone of calm and majesty, dozens of computer terminals ranged around the conference centre blared out an endless loop of the March of the Slaves from Verdi's Aida. In what, at the same time, appeared an attempt to give the delegates some sense of urgency, a digital Population Clock in the centre's foyer relentlessly ticked up the growth in the world's population, which at noon yesterday was 5,657,178,226 and rising faster than a person a second. Outside, Cairo has been transformed. Security precautions are extraordinary. White-coated police ring the conference centre at 10-metre intervals and virtually line the main routes to and from hotels. Anyone carrying a bag of any sort down the 2km of the Nile corniche in central Cairo is searched. There is at least one security officer on duty for every delegate. This vast and filthy city has also been given an unprecedented facelift. Statues have been dusted, every single kerbstone along the main routes has been painted black or white, flyovers have been repainted, roundabouts grassed, a whole population of men with brooms has emerged from nowhere to populate the roadsides. Quite how much this is costing the Egyptian government is a matter for conjecture. How they might be financing it, however, is perhaps less so. One of the chief complaints of UN organisers, diplomats and others at the conference is that the government appears to have taken every opportunity to raise as much money from the event as possible. They cite as examples the fact that hotel rates have been fixed at Dollars 145 a night at all the main hotels, well above the standard Cairo hotel corporate discount rate of Dollars 80 the organisers had hoped for. Hoteliers suggest at least 25 per cent of this goes straight into government coffers. Organisations renting office space have been charged Dollars 10 a day to rent such things as bookshelves and wastepaper bins. Only an outcry forced the caterers to abandon charges of Dollars 8 for a sandwich. A State Department booklet offering orientation and security advice to visiting Americans stated that US delegates should watch out for 'scams and rip-off schemes', saying these 'often consist of overcharging for merchandise purchased or services rendered'. Did this apply to the conference itself, asked one uncharitable US visitor.</p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Letter: Gap between road and rail freight costs likely to remain Sir, The article, 'How freight hopes have finally been derailed' (September 1), and the subsequent letter from Dr Schimmelpfennig (September 3) showed some misunderstanding of the system of charging commercial vehicles for the use of roads in Britain. The taxation of goods vehicles combines an annual excise licence fee and duty on fuel. Currently, the excise duty on commercial vehicles of more than 3.5 tons yields Pounds 500m a year and the fuel duty yields Pounds 1,730m. A lorry of 15 to 17 tons pays excise duty of Pounds 1,280 a year and an average fuel duty of Pounds 3,400. The heaviest lorries of 36 to 38 tons pay Pounds 3,100 in excise duty and an average fuel duty of Pounds 10,874. About 30 per cent of the total costs of the road system are attributed to goods vehicles, including nearly all structural maintenance. The taxes they pay exceed these costs by about 20 per cent. Commercial vehicles do not therefore pay a negligible tax for access to the roads, and they pay a substantial tax through fuel duty. There are obvious limitations in this charging system: the estimates of costs attributable to different classes of road users are imprecise, charges are not directly based on the actual weight of the vehicle and the distance it travels, and there is no charge for environmental effects or congestion. Basing taxation on records of vehicle weight and mileage provided by vehicle-mounted sensors would be the most practicable improvement; congestion charges would result from any installation of electronic road pricing systems. Environmental taxation - unless arbitrary - depends upon valuing the effects of such factors as noise, which has not proved easy. And such taxation should be applied to trains as well as lorries. It is unlikely that any justifiable changes to taxation of road transport would eliminate the gap between the costs of road and rail haulage. They could only make rail freight marginally more competitive. Mr David Sawers, 'Crosby', 10 Seaview Avenue, Angmering-on-Sea, Littlehampton, West Sussex</p>

			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON THE RECORD: MOZART JUVENILIA MARKS 200TH ANNIVERSARY  </P> <P> Marketing-wise, things clearly have reached a crisis point in classical music  when we "celebrate" a composer's death, as will be the case in 1991, the 200th  anniversary of Mozart having shuffled off this mortal coil.  </P> <P> The notion of today's column, dealing with some of the most remarkable musical  juvenilia in existence -- and of a successor column, centering on late,  instrumental Mozart -- is to get the jump on '91, ghoulish as the whole concept  may be. There is never a shortage of Mozart recordings to review, but '90,  young as it is, has brought some Mozart so rare that we're unlikely to meet its  ilk again, even during next year's inevitable glut.  </P> <P> In 1767 the 11-year-old Wolfgang, having already amassed a sizable catalogue of  compositions, created the frequently written-about, never heard and, until now,  never recorded sacred cantata with the resoundingly pompous title of "Die  Schuldigkeit des ersten Gebotes" (The Obligation to Obey the First  Commandment), K. 35.  </P> <P> The First Commandment, to refresh your memory, reads in the Gospel According to  St. Mark, "And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with  all thy soul, and with all thy mind." The lengthy work -- some 90 minutes, so  skip as many recitatives as possible -- assigns singing parts to the  embodiments of Justice, the Christian Spirit, Compassion and so on, difficult  characters for anyone, of any age to inspire with dramatic life. But Child  Mozart succeeds, not with a stuffy, textbook exercise in religiosity but with a  jolly robustness -- and an already stunning gift for orchestration (his arias  aren't merely thinly accompanied songs) -- one expects of a very lively boy.  The skill employed, however, has nothing to do with childhood.  </P> <P> This recorded premiere (Philips 422 360, two CDs) respects the music while also  enjoying itself. Sir Neville Marriner's direction of the Stuttgart Radio  Symphony is deliciously fleet and pointed and the vocal ensemble, headed by  soprano Margaret Marshall and tenor Hans Peter Blochwitz, is first-rate.  </P> <P> Two additional works are appended: the "Funeral Music," K. 42 -- written by the  11-year-old while shut in a room for several days by the Archbishop of  Salzburg, who needed proof that Mozart's genius wasn't a hoax perpetrated by  his composer-father -- and a brief, touchingly sweet Passion song, K. 146.  </P> <P> Mozart's accelerated maturity is stunningly exhibited in the 19-year-old's "La  finta giardiniera" (The Lady in Gardener's Disguise), a comic opera with more  than a few dark asides, bursting with lyric invention and insightful  characterization. The ensembles in particular are rich in dramatic interplay  and personal revelation -- foretastes of the full-blown miracles of "Figaro"  and "Cosi fan Tutte."  </P> <P> The opera is overlong, even in its somewhat abridged new  </P> <P> recording (Ricercar 06045/6/7). But there aren't that many operas containing an  hour of brilliant music, fewer still by a teen-ager. The production, recorded  live last year by Ricercar at the Theatre de la Monnaie, Brussels, has since  toured widely in Europe and was considered sufficiently revelatory to have been  imported recently by that showplace of the artistic cutting-edge, the Brooklyn  Academy of Music.  </P> <P> Musically, it's a serviceable job, without the vocal ornamentation one would  expect from its largely youthful, presumably willing-to-learn cast under  conductor Sylvain Cambreling's energetic but unsubtle hand. Among his singers  are one reliable old pro, tenor Ugo Benelli, as the bumbling Podesta and an  elegant soprano named Joanna Kozslowska in the title role. The rest of the cast  rarely rises above routine, although according to Martin Bernheimer's report in  the March 19 Calendar the ensemble had become finely meshed by the time of the  Brooklyn staging, eight months and many performances after this recording was  made.  </P> <P> Now, a giant leap to Mozart in his final year, 1791: the year of "Die  Zauberflote," whose legendary 1938 Berlin recording, conducted by Sir Thomas  Beecham, has just made its first CD appearance (EMI/Angel 61034, two discs).  It's one old-timer every bit as special as one remembers, although the omission  of all spoken dialogue remains irksome.  </P> <P> The chief conjurer (in addition to Mozart himself) is Beecham, whose reading  remains a model of stylish wit and whose cast -- Gerhard Husch, Erna Berger,  Tiana Lemnitz, Helge Rosvaenge and Wilhelm Strienz -- thrillingly embodies a  latter-day vocal Golden Age.  </P></p>

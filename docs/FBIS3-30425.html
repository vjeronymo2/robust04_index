			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kragujevac, 2 Feb (TANJUG) -- Lieutenant Colonel  General Momcilo Perisic, chief of general staff of the Yugoslav  Army, said today that the U.S. intention to use  remote-controlled aircraft (?controlled from) Albania for spying  on the territory of the FRY and Bosnia clearly shows that the  Americans have decided to embark on a full-scale intelligence  operation by involving countries with certain designs against us.    In the Kragujevac radio program "The Hallmark of Time," Gen.  Perisic said that Albania is in a certain way getting involved  in a struggle against Yugoslavia by expressing certain  territorial aspirations. Planned infiltration of their people,  sent to carry out certain activities, into our territory is a  part of the scenario. According to Perisic one of the main parts  of the scenario is "to cause border incidents in order to  present a false picture to the world of the suffering of  innocent Albanians. Our border guards use weapons in accordance  with the regulations of their service and gravest consequences  have occurred," he said.    "The ultimate aim is to achieve one thing only -- to create  conditions for the international community to demonize the Serbs  in this area too, as has been done in the Srpska republic and in  the republic of Serb Krajina," the chief of the Yugoslav general  staff said.    Asked to comment on increasingly frequent statements by  politicians from the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia that  the Macedonians are under threat from the north, Gen. Perisic  said that "the creators of the new world order were not sure  that Yugoslavia would be securely sealed in this region, so --  under the pretext of preventing incidents -- they sent their  forces." Perisic said incidents in this region "happen  periodically, but increasingly often."    "Incidents at the Yugoslav border with Albania and Macedonia  are aimed at creating the impression that it is Yugoslavia that  causes them, while in fact it is just the opposite. The aim is  clear -- to demonize the Serbs and Yugoslavia in the world's  eyes in order to achieve the West's strategic objectives," Gen.  Perisic concluded.</p>

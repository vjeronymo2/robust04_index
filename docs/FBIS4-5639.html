			<p>BFN     [Text] Leading Malaysian journalist has criticized what he  called the highhandedness of his country's enforcement agencies  dealing with immigrants. Kadir Jasin, editor of Malaysia's  influential NEW STRAITS TIMES, was referring in its Sunday  weekly column to the roundup by Malaysian police on Palm Sunday  of more than 1,000 Filipino maids in front of a Catholic church  in Kuala Lumpur. In his column, Kadir said he did not think  many Malaysians were pleased by the highhandedness by  enforcement agencies in the operations against foreigners.    In the operations, 711 Filipino maids were detained. All but  33 of them were later released after their employers produced  their work permits. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin  Mohamed directed authorities, including the police, to exercise  greater care when carrying raids of suspected illegal workers in  places of worship. As this developed, Prime Minister Mahathir  is reported sending to Manila a personal emissary to meet with  President Ramos on the Palm Sunday arrest.    Meantime, Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto  Romulo  says the Philippine Government has reached what he called a  meeting of the minds with Malaysia on how to cool down the  dispute. Romulo said he and the Malaysian Foreign Minister  Abdullah bin Haji Ahmad Badawi have agreed to discuss the matter  in a joint commission set up last year. That commission carries  the task of improving bilateral relations chilled by a  30-year-old Philippine claim of Malaysia's Sabah State.    Speaking of Sabah, President Ramos has evaded making a  direct  response to a proposal raised in Congress for the revival of the  country's claim to Sabah. Speaking to reporters in Cebu in the  Visayas, the president said Malacanang [presidential office]  will issue a statement today on its position on the proposal.  Senator Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo presented a proposal the other  day asking President Ramos to again assert the Philippines'  territorial claim of Sabah. Arroyo made the proposal shortly  after Senator Ernesto Herrera suggested that the Philippine  Government withdraws its invitation to Malaysia's ceremonial  king to visit Manila beginning this Thursday to Saturday.</p>

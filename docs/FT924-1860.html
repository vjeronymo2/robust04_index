			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Mexico hails doctor's release MEXICO'S ambassador to the US said yesterday he was 'profoundly satisfied' by the release of Dr Humberto Alvarez Machain, accused of aiding the torture and murder of an agent of the US Drug Enforcement Agency. Mr Gustavo Gustaco Petrocelli said: 'There can be no doubt that it was one of the problems contaminating our relations with the US, which we want to be respectful and mature.' Dr Alvarez Machain, released on Monday after a Los Angeles judge ruled there was insufficient evidence against him, arrived back in Mexico City yesterday and was taken by security officers to an unknown destination. He had been kidnapped by agents working for the DEA in 1990 to stand trial. Mexico's foreign ministry said the release 'does not resolve the problem that arose in bilateral relations' and would push for kidnappings to be made illegal under the US-Mexico extradition treaty.</p>

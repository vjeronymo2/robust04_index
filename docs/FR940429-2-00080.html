			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commonwealth contend that its exclusion of Mr. Gray from consideration for employment was job related and consistent with business necessity <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  and safe performance of the job. Com. Resp. at 45. I reject that contention because, at the time of the hearing, Commonwealth employed two other individuals with uncorrectable hearing losses. D&hyph;13. Inasmuch as there is no apparent reason for differentiating correctable and uncorrectable hearing loss with respect to job relatedness or safety concerns, I conclude that Commonwealth violated section 503 of the At when it refused to hire Gray unless he had his hearing loss surgically corrected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> One of the stated reasons is Commonwealth's possible future medical liability if the individual elects to correct the condition. Com. Resp. at 45. Increased costs to an employer, however, is not a valid reason for rejecting a handicapped applicant.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> OFCCP <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> E.

OFCCP therefore argues that it may seek retroactive seniority and back pay on behalf of Worthington. Exceptions at 43. The record establishes that OFCCP was not seeking back pay for Mr. Worthington, and was not entitled to receive back pay on his behalf because Worthington was earning more elsewhere than he could have at Commonwealth. T. at 683; P&hyph;36. See R.D. and O. at 12. Inasmuch as OFCCP is not asking that Mr. Worthington be reinstated, the request for retroactive seniority is moot. Irrespective of whether the case has been settled, OFCCP has failed, as the AJL found, to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. I therefore accept the ALJ's recommendation that the complaint be dismissed as to Complainant Worthington. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Wilda Matthis. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The ALJ found there was no question that Complainant Matthis had moderate scoliosis, R.D. and O. at 16, and Commonwealth does not dispute that she was handicapped. Based on the contraindication for heavy manual labor, however, the ALJ found that she was not qualified for the manual labor position for which she applied.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 5, 16. The test of whether a handicapped individual is qualified is if the individual possesses the ability to perform the job.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Texas Industries, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  slip op. at 14. The record establishes that Ms. Matthis worked as an automotive parts dispatcher at Sears where she inspected cars, pulled wheels, and carried pipes, mufflers and brakes. P&hyph;2. Inasmuch as this constitutes manual labor and there is no other evidence that she could not perform manual labor, I find that she was qualified to work in a manual labor position at Commonwealth. Since she was rejected for employment because of her scoliosis, OFCCP established a prima facie case of handicap discrimination as to Ms. Matthis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commonwealth contends that its job qualification requirements, which is this case caused Ms. Matthis to be rejected for employment in part because of radiographic evidence of a back abnormality, are job related and consistent with business necessity and safe job performance. Com. Resp. at 69&hyph;76. The job qualifications as applied essentially screened out Ms. Matthis because of an increased risk of injury. As such, they must be examined with special care.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bentivegna, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  694 F.2d at 622. The evidence in this case fails to justify refusing employment to Ms. Matthis because it does not establish a reasonable probability of substantial harm,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mantolete, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  767 F.2d at 1422, or even predict that any injury would ever happen if she were employed in a manual labor position.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Texas Industries, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  slip op. at 21. An orthopedist reported Ms. Mathis had ``asymptomatic idiopathic scoliosis [which would not] limit [her] activities.'' p. 21. See T. at 447, 975; PX 3; DX 23. I find that Commonwealth violated Section 503 by refusing to hire Complainant Matthis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Kenneth Sherrard. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The ALJ noted that Complainant Sherrard had severe scoliosis, R.D. and O. at 16, and Commonwealth concedes that he is obviously handicapped. Com. Resp. at 61. As with Ms. Matthis, and ALJ found that Mr. Sherrard was not qualified for employment in mechanical maintenance which involves heavy manual labor. R.D. and O. at 5, 16. At the time of his application, Sherrard had worked for ten years as a maintenance mechanic, P&hyph;2, and an orthopedist recommended that he could continue working in that capacity. P. 17. I find that Mr. Sherrard was qualified to perform the job for which he applied at Commonwealth and, because he was rejected for employment based on his scoliosis, OFCCP made a prima facie case of handicap discrimination as to him. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

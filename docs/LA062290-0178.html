			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> INCOME EDGES UP 0.3%, SPENDING STATIC  </P> <P> Personal income edged up 0.3% in May for the second straight month, but  personal spending was unchanged from the previous month, the government said  today in another sign of consumer caution.  </P> <P> Consumer spending is considered a barometer of economic health since it  accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department reported that incomes totaled a seasonally adjusted  annual rate of $4.7 trillion. The 0.3% gain follows three consecutive monthly  advances of 0.8% and were the lowest since a 0.2% increase last September.  </P> <P> Consumer spending remained unchanged at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of  $3.66 trillion after seven straight months of gains, including 0.5% in April  and 0.3% in March. But even the April and March advances were weaker than first  thought. They were revised downward from 0.6% and 0.5% reported last month.  </P> <P> Today's report follows other signs of consumer weakness including three  consecutive monthly declines in retail sales through May. It was the first time  retail sales had dropped three months in a row since the summer of 1981 during  the last recession.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the difference helped improve Americans' savings rate. The rate  -- savings as a percentage of disposable income -- rose to 6.2% following a 6%  rate in April and a 6.3% rate in March. The March rate was the highest in five  years.  </P> <P> A higher savings rate means less dependence on foreign capital, since funds  thus would be available domestically for business investment.  </P> <P> The report said Americans' income after taxes increased 0.2%, the same rate as  in April.  </P> <P> The key component of the income category -- wages and salaries -- rose $10.3  billion after a $16.4 billion gain the previous month.  </P></p>

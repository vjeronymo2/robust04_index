			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ON CAMPUS: CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE;  </P> <P> FOOD SERVICES SWITCH TO PAPER  </P> <P> In response to concerns about recycling, the Cal State Northridge Foundation,  which runs many of the campus food services, has switched from Styrofoam, a  non-renewable material, to paper and plastic plates, bowls and cups.  </P> <P> "We have been researching this problem for eight months," said foundation food  services manager Dean Calvo. "We contacted the company which supplied us with  the Styrofoam about recycling, but that did not work out."  </P> <P> The paper and plastic items are biodegradable.  </P> <P> "People in the campus community . . . should be glad to hear of this change,"  he said.  </P></p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Fast-growth Malaysia running out of steam  -A massive power expansion programme WHEN the lights went out in Malaysia recently the message struck home. The country, now in its fifth successive year of 8 per cent-plus growth, is running out of power. The blackout, blamed on a freak lightning strike and described officially as an act of God, left many parts of peninsular Malaysia without power for several days. Now the government is stepping up efforts to put in place one of the world's more ambitious power expansion programmes with the private sector, both domestic and foreign, playing a central role. The power companies are rushing to Kuala Lumpur to grab a piece of the action. Malaysia has an installed electricity capacity of about 5,000MW. To keep pace with economic growth over the next 25 years - projected at an average of 7 per cent annually - power output has to grow five times. Mr Samy Vellu, minister of energy, estimates that the cost of new power projects over the next 25 years will be MDollars 100bn (Pounds 26bn). In the next 10 years alone Malaysia needs to invest MDollars 40bn to cope with increasing electricity requirements. Malaysia is the front runner in Asia in encouraging private sector participation in energy generation. Earlier this year, Tenaga Nasional, the country's electricity utility, was partly privatised and is now the largest company listed on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange. The government is studying proposals from the private sector for building, operating and owning a number of power stations round the country. Preliminary agreement has been announced for Malaysia's first independent power producer. A local construction group, YTL, has teamed up with National Power of Britain to build two power stations with a combined capacity of 1,000MW costing about Dollars 700m. National Power will have a 10 per cent stake plus a separate operation and management contract. While the authorities have not disclosed how much of the industry will be given over to independent producers, the eventual outcome could be a 50/50 split with Tenaga. Other projects are likely to be announced soon, involving the participation of some of the big names in power generation. Foreign companies are allowed to hold up to 25 per cent. The independent producers are likely to concentrate on gas-fuelled power stations - buying gas from Petronas, the state oil company, and selling power to Tenaga, which will have control of the national grid. The price at which Tenaga will buy power from the independent producers is the most important element in any contract. According to Mr Richard Hall of Schroders - who along with the World Bank's International Finance Corporation is acting as financial adviser on the YTL deal - the power purchase agreement should guarantee adequate returns to the independent producer. 'Once we have a decent power purchase agreement we can then go to the banks and raise the necessary finance,' says Mr Hall. 'Without that guarantee the banks won't be interested in putting up the funds.' Mr Martin Locke, a project finance specialist with Morgan Grenfell in Singapore, says the risks of taking on such projects can be handled only by the big power companies. 'A power project is a long-term proposition. It's also very complex contractually, particularly on setting pricing over long periods. Only the big power companies will be able to get the banks behind them.' Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, upset by blackouts and power shortages which could deter much-needed investment, has made clear he wants these projects to come on stream as soon as possible. The YTL power stations are due to be up and running by early 1995. Mr Locke feels Malaysia might deter some potential independent producers by trying to rush negotiations through while not giving adequate guarantees on financial returns. Other countries in the region, in particular Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, are also competing for power related funding. 'But Malaysia does have advantages,' says Mr Locke. 'It is seen as a more bankable country than most others in the region. The Malaysian dollar is strong and the local market could be tapped for funding. Most of all Malaysia is ahead of the hunt and it's likely the independent producers there will set the framework for other countries to follow.'</p>

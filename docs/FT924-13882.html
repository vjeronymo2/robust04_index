			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / International Company News: French adventure leaves sour taste - Italcementi's takeover of Ciments Francais FOR Mr Giampiero Pesenti, the entrepreneur who controls Italcementi, Italy's biggest cement group, it has been a week to forget. Less than six months after catapulting his company to the top of Europe's cement league through the surprise purchase of a controlling stake in Ciments Francais of France, the deal has turned sour following the discovery of substantial off-balance sheet losses at the French company. Italcementi's problems are doubly ironic for both its chairman and Mediobanca, the powerful Milanese merchant bank that is its main adviser. Last April's agreement to buy control of Ciments Francais was hailed by Italian investors. After Pirelli's failure to buy Continental and the Agnelli family's discomfiture at the hands of Nestle in the battle for Perrier, an Italian entrepreneur had finally pulled off a cross-border coup. The praise was shared with Mediobanca. The bank's low-profile approach to corporate finance, based largely on personal contacts with a select group of institutions, appeared out of place. The Italcementi-Ciments Francais deal showed that the bank was not superannuated. That the transaction has turned complex is a blow to both Italcementi and Mediobanca, two companies equally renowned in Italy for their distaste for publicity. Visitors to the Milan headquarters of Mr Pesenti's Italmobiliare holding company, which controls Italcementi, might easily think they have strayed. The impressive palazzo bears no nameplate. Only after passing a discreet porters' lodge, which bears no reference to the company, comes the security check giving access to Mr Pesenti's domain. The low profile contrasts with the policy of Mr Pesenti's father Carlo, who built the group into one of Italy's leading conglomerates. The price for expansion was debt. Following his father's death in 1984, Mr Pesenti sold assets to reduce borrowings under Mediobanca's guidance. Italmobiliare slimmed down to its core cement business, retaining some sidelines in engineering, publishing and tourism. Meanwhile, Mr Pesenti won admirers, culminating in his appointment as chairman of Gemina, the Fiat-controlled investment and financial services group in which Mediobanca and Italmobiliare are also shareholders. In the past two years, Italcementi, which has been solidly profitable throughout, has been making a more public come-back and has been expanding at home and abroad. Last year, it bid unsuccessfully for Cementir, the state-owned cement group put up for sale by the IRI holding group, and Heracles, the Greek cementmaker, which fell to Ferruzzi's Calcestruzzi cement and building materials subsidiary. But Italcementi managed to purchase two of Czechoslovakia's leading cement producers. Buying into Ciments Francais was its biggest coup. With a combined production of around 36m tonnes a year, the group is now the world's second-largest cementmaker. But even Italian plaudits for the purchase were clouded by criticisms of its financing. In spite of its liquidity, Italcementi had to launch a rights issue, along with a convertible bond, raising about L650bn (Dollars 500m) to help pay the L1,700bn purchase price. Minority shareholders were furious to be offered only non-voting savings shares in the bond, and to have to pay the same price for ordinary and savings shares in the rights issue. Some were further incensed by the sharp fall in Italcementi's share price in the run-up to the deal, triggering demands for an investigation into insider trading. Typically, Italcementi has made no official statement about the problems in France, while Mr Pesenti himself remains incommunicado. Company officials merely note that matters are being tackled jointly by Italcementi, Mediobanca, Ciments Francais and Paribas, the French bank that controlled the French cement producer, and that all four are determined to reach an amicable solution. Italcementi also stresses it will not suffer financially. It claims the recent devaluation of the lira has actually worked in its favour, as it had already bought French francs - now worth more in lira terms - to finance the deal prior to the lira's slide. Nor does the discovery of off-balance sheet losses at Ciments Francais affect the 'industrial logic' of the deal, it says. However, it is still far from clear how easy it will be to plug the gap in the finances of Ciments Francais, which was discovered by Italcementi's auditors, KPMG. Two ideas are now being touted. Either Italcementi, which will not pay for the acquisition until year-end, will re-negotiate the price, or Paribas, as vendor, will make up the losses. Renegotiation could be a minefield in view of the fact that Ciments Francais launched a big share placing in July. Though largely shunned by investors, allowing the Italians to pay less for the company could require compensation to shareholders who subscribed to the issue. Hence Italcementi's apparent preference for the second option. Letting Paribas make up the 'gap' in the accounts of Ciments Francais means Italcementi would buy what it expected, and minority shareholders in Ciments Francais could not claim compensation. With Paribas considering legal action, that idea so far seems to be more popular in Milan than Paris.  -----------------------------------------------                   ITALCEMENTI                Group sales (Lbn)  ----------------------------------------------- 1989                 1990                1991 1,436               1,582               1,661  -----------------------------------------------                  Net group profits           (After minority interests) Lbn  ----------------------------------------------- 1989                 1990                1991 170.3               206.1               184.5  -----------------------------------------------</p>

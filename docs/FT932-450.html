			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / BT restricts access to pornographic phone lines CALLERS to pornographic 0898 phonelines will soon need a personal identification number (PIN) to listen in, British Telecommunications said yesterday. The Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone Information Services also plans to restrict the advertising of adult services to 'top-shelf' publications. The measures reflect growing concern about children calling the adult lines, often as a result of advertisements in newspapers or magazines. Adult phone lines are produced and managed by independent operators using lines leased from BT. Premium-rate charges are 48p a minute at peak time and 36p off-peak, of which 28p goes to the operator. The PIN requirement will be introduced in July next year, when direct access to all adult services on lines with the prefixes 0898, 0338 and 08364 will be blocked. Customers who wish to access them will be issued with a security PIN. Their calls will be billed to their BT account, regardless of where they make the call. It will not be possible to call the lines from public phoneboxes or old-style dial phones without a Pounds 9.95 tone-pad, which simulates the tones of a modern touchphone. BT said that its market research showed that more than 90 per cent of customers supported an opt-in for adult services. It already offers customers the opportunity to bar premium-rate calls on their phones. More than 700,000 calls a week are made to recorded and live adult phone lines. One in seven of all complaints received by the ICSTIS watchdog last year concerned such lines. Information and entertainment services on 0891 numbers will not be affected.</p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (16): Labour force of 10m children - Need for social progress Pakistan's record on social welfare is visible on almost every street corner. Malnourished children wait at traffic-lights to beg from motorists or sell newspapers which they will never read. In rural areas, many work the land or provide labour in rice mills and brick kilns, writes Tim Burt. In Peshawar, capital of North West Frontier Province, children as young as six work in the kilns, mixing mud and filling brick casts. Impoverished families - most earning less than Rs2,000 a month - cannot spare their children for school and send them to work as patheras, 'the brick makers.' A survey of 20 kilns by the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) found almost 400 school-age children at work. In a damning indictment of a country where the labour force includes 10m children under the age of 15, Unicef says it was startled by the 'high rate of illiteracy, lack of family planning, exposure to health hazards, inadequate or total lack of medical facilities, deplorable sanitation and a general impression of being bonded to this way of life.' Those problems are not confined to child labour. They are endemic in poorer parts of Pakistan. The 1994 Human Development Index, compiled by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), ranks Pakistan behind neighbouring countries in many of the key measures of social progress. Its annual population growth exceeds that of India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Its performance, moreover, in school enrolment, adult literacy and the percentage of people in work also lags behind, while access to health and sanitation facilities are among the worst in the region. Addressing the international conference on population and development earlier this year, Ms Benazir Bhutto admitted: 'Pakistan cannot progress if it cannot check its rapid population growth.' That is a tall order for a country where the population has grown from 50m in 1960 to 128m today, and is set to double by the year 2017. Anxious to improve Pakistan's standing on human development, the Bhutto government has embraced and extended an ambitious Social Action Programme (SAP), launched last year by the government of Nawaz Sharif following mounting pressure from international donors and aid agencies. Over five years, the programme envisages Dollars 7.7bn being spent on initiatives to curb population growth, improve primary education, health care, rural water supplies and sanitation. In the first three years, the government plans to build more than 32,000 schools, improve teacher training and ensure that teachers stay in rural areas where demand is greatest. It also aims to revamp health education and train female paramedics. A village-level initiative on family planning is also under way to encourage contraception. Only a small number of villagers have access to safe sanitation and clean water. Public bodies have a poor record in maintaining water services, so control of new schemes will be transfered to local communities. Hailing the programme as a step forward, Ms Bhutto says it will 'educate and motivate our people to a higher standard of living.' Some international aid agencies are not so sure. They claim the programme is too narrow and the government will have few resources to fund its commitment while military expenditure remains at 6 per cent of gross national product - the highest figure in the sub-continent - and debt servicing continues to drains its reserves. 'I haven't seen any evidence of political groups being interested in far-reaching social change,' says a senior aid agency official in Islamabad. 'Pakistan is not addressing land reform, women's rights or defence spending.' Such officials want the SAP to become a community-based reform programme focused particularly on educating women, who take primary responsibility for family health care and education. Female literacy in Pakistan is among the lowest in the world at 20 per cent, and fewer than one-in-five girls complete even primary education - 'building more schools is irrelevant. The problems are more basic than that,' says Dr Tariq Banuri, head of the Sustainable Development Policy Institute. 'We need to develop a cohesive village-based education system. It can't be done through centralised management.' His view is echoed by Mr Jim Mayrides, head of the Unicef mission in Islamabad, who says female literacy is the key to improvements in basic healthcare and hygiene. 'If they could read and write, it would help spread the message of how to treat diarrhoea and respiratory infection.' Eradicating those two ailments alone would cut infant morality by more than 60 per cent. 'The political will is there to improve things, but there is a paralysis in the bureaucracy and the changes are very slow,' says Mr Mayrides. Failure to address these issues could prompt widespread social discontent - 'if the rural people were to become aware of the resistance in Malakand and Karachi it could prompt disorder elsewhere,' says Dr Banuri. 'The risk is complete breakdown in the community.' The government, however, claims the SAP - partly funded by a Dollars 200m World Bank loan - deserves praise for at least promising to upgrade basic services in rural areas, where some 24m people are living in absolute poverty. This poses a dilemma for the aid agencies. They have no wish to derail the programme but they want to broaden its scope to a 10-year horizon, with day-to-day management of the initiatives transferred from local politicians to new community groups. 'These issues are not susceptible to a quick fix,' says Mr Philip Regan, deputy resident representative of the UNDP in Islamabad. 'More people can be trained, more buildings put up. But they won't have an impact until the long-term problems are addressed.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 COMPARATIVE PROFILES OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Pakistan     India    Bangladesh   Sri Lanka  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Life expectancy          58.3 yrs   59.7 yrs    52.2 yrs    71.2 yrs Annual GDP per capita    Dollars     Dollars    Dollars     Dollars                           400         330         220         500 Annual population growth  2.9%        2.2%        2.7%        1.8% Health expenditure*       3.4%        6.0%        3.2%        3.7% Education enrolment**      24%         50%         32%         68% Adult literacy             36%         50%         37%         89% Labour force***            28%         38%         47%         41%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *As percentage of GDP. **Aged 6-23. ***As percentage of total population  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: UNDP Human Dev.

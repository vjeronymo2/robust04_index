Its session will begin at 14.00. The  lower chamber of the Russian parliament is expected to discuss  issues dealing with the election of deputy chairmen of the Duma  and heads of parliamentary committees.    Last Saturday those issues were tentatively discussed at a  conference of chairman of the State Duma Ivan Rybkin and heads  of parliamentary groups, held behind closed doors.    The planned number of deputy chairmen and the names of  candidates to those posts remain a secret. The names of  candidates to the posts of heads of parliamentary committees  (there are going to be 18 of them) are not known either.    In the opinion of observers, the main struggle will develop  over the posts of heads of the committees on international  affairs, defence and security.</p>

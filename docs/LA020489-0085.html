			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HERSHISER SAYS HE AND DODGERS ARE AT IMPASSE OVER LOCKOUT LANGUAGE  </P> <P> Orel Hershiser, the Dodgers' Cy Young Award-winning pitcher, said Friday that  his contract talks are at an impasse over lockout language.  </P> <P> Teammates Kirk Gibson and Mike Marshall both have clauses in their contracts  obligating the team to pay them in the event of an owners' lockout in 1990.  However, the Dodgers don't want to extend the same provision to Hershiser,  agent Robert Fraley said.  </P> <P> Fraley said the Dodgers have made Hershiser two offers, the best a three-year  deal worth $6.25 million. Dodger executive vice president Fred Claire said  Friday that that is more than $2 million less than what Hershiser is seeking.  </P> <P> Fraley said the impasse is over lockout language, but the financial terms of  the deal are also unacceptable.  </P> <P> Hershiser, who made $1.1 million in 1988 and could become a free agent after  this season, is scheduled for a Feb. 16 arbitration hearing. He is seeking  $2.425 million for one year, which would be a record arbitration award. The  Dodgers are offering $2 million.  </P> <P> Claire said: "We signed the other players to their contracts last season before  we determined our lockout language position. What we offered Orel is not  unreasonable. It is the largest guaranteed 3-year contract ever offered in the  history of the Dodgers." LONNIE WHITE  </P></p>

As is known, the decision  adopted by the Ukrainian Supreme Council on 18 November 1993  states that the republic does not regard it as obligatory for it  to accede to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear  Weapons.    The document containing Leonid Kravchuk's proposal was  distributed to Supreme Council members to look at today.    In the note accompanying the draft parliamentary decision,  Leonid Kravchuk notes that the accords reached in Moscow on 14  January between the presidents of Russia, the United States, and  Ukraine provide guarantees for the national security of Ukraine,  pledges by the United States to grant Ukraine a minimum of 175  million dollars for the dismantling of the nuclear weapons, with  the possibility that this amount may be increased, and also the  removal of all nuclear charges from Ukraine to Russia for  dismantling with the simultaneous provision of compensation to  the republic in the form of removed and processed nuclear fuel  for nuclear power engineering. Further, the Ukrainian  president's note states that the United States has declared its  readiness to help Ukraine to develop a market economy.    The Ukrainian Supreme Council plans to examine the question  of the trilateral Moscow Statement of the presidents of Ukraine,  the United States, and Russia this week.</p>

			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions The largest deal of the week was at property company Birkby where William Cran, the chief executive, sold 400,000 shares at 273p each, raising more than Pounds 1m. The sale was undertaken for personal reasons. Greggs, the high street baker, has been enjoying a good run on its share price over the past 12 months. Indeed, interim results announced at the end of July showed earnings growth of more than 25 per cent and a dividend increase of 16 per cent - fine results given the warmth of the summer which tends to depress people's appetite for sweet buns. The sale recorded by managing director Mike Darrington of 1,200 shares leaves him with a total holding of more than 71,000.

Jozef Rebo has the details:    [Rebo] [passage omitted] Slovakia is ready for bilaterally  advantageous cooperation with UNIDO. Regarding specific matters,  the president said that Slovakia would welcome concrete  assistance from UNIDO, in particular in economic transformation.  Privatization is also closely linked to economic transformation.  We also expect assistance in putting into effect environmental  projects and new technologies.    On the other hand, Slovakia wants to contribute to UNIDO  work  and get involved in assistance to Third World countries. We are  able to join mining and metallurgy projects, projects in the  construction industry, engineering, timber-processing, chemical,  and electrotechnical industries.    In reply, Mr. Campos said that UNIDO respected Slovakia's  efforts in the sphere of industrial development and that UNIDO  wished to continue to support our efforts. [passage omitted] Mr.  Campos then met representatives of Slovak business circles, and,  in the afternoon, he will visit Slovak Power Engineering Works  in Tlmace.</p>

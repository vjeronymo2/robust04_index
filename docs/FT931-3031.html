			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Help given over sale of business assets - Capital Allowance Provisions This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill. CHANGES were announced in capital allowances which allow connected persons to elect to treat the sale of industrial buildings, and some other business assets, as having taken place at their tax written-down value. The changes are aimed at helping some taxpayers wishing to restructure their business and at preventing manipulation of election provisions. The changes, in relation to sales on or after 16 March, are: To extend the provisions to include qualifying hotels; commercial buildings in enterprise zones; and scientific research assets. To allow elections only in cases where both parties are entitled to capital allowances. The Inland Revenue said: 'Under the capital allowances legislation connected persons can elect to treat the sale of certain categories of assets, for example industrial buildings and mineral extraction assets, as having taken place at tax written-down value (the original cost less allowances already taken). The result of this is that the sale will not give rise to any balancing adjustment. That is, the sale takes place on a no-gain, no-loss basis. In these cases, writing-down allowances are available to the new owner on the remaining unrelieved expenditure. Any subsequent disposal of the asset to an unconnected person will give rise to a charge or allowance on the same basis as it would have done had the seller continued to own the asset. Effectively, for capital allowances purposes the buyer 'steps into the shoes' of the seller. An election to treat the sale of assets as having taken place at tax written-down value has previously been unavailable where the assets concerned were qualifying hotels, commercial buildings in enterprise zones and scientific research assets. The chancellor's proposal extends the election provisions to cover such assets. The chancellor also proposes that no election will be available where allowances or charges under the Capital Allowances Code cannot be made on either of the parties to the sale. This is on the basis that tax-exempt persons cannot 'stand in the shoes' of taxpayers as far as tax liabilities are concerned.</p>

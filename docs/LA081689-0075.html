			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BENNETT NOTES DRUG LEGACY OF WOODSTOCK  </P> <P> Drug policy director William J. Bennett complained Tuesday about the "memory  distortion" in the nostalgia that has welled up around the 20th anniversary of  the Woodstock festival.  </P> <P> The 45-year-old Bennett, a one-time guitar player and fan of early rock 'n'  roll, recited what he called a "casualty list from Woodstock" of rock  performers, including singer Janis Joplin, who died in later years from drug  overdoses.  </P> <P> Bennett, who as a graduate student at the University of Texas in the late 1960s  had a blind date with Joplin, said "part of the legacy of Woodstock was  tolerance of drugs, and let us be glad that is over, rather than wishing it  were back. We do not want 1969 back in terms of its view of drugs. We've come  too far."  </P></p>

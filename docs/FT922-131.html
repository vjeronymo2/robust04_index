			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / International Company News: Sanyo sued by Texas Instruments TEXAS Instruments, the US semiconductor group, has filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Sanyo Electric which, it claims, is using its semiconductor patents without a licence. The move follows indications from Sanyo that the Japanese electronics group was, in turn, preparing to file patent litigation against Texas Instruments both in the US and Japan. Sanyo said last week that it would file a lawsuit against the US group unless it reduced the amount of royalties it was seeking for its patents. Sanyo's legal counsel has claimed that Texas Instruments' conduct in its negotiations constitutes patent misuse and anti-trust activity. The two groups have had a cross-licensing agreement but this expired at the end of 1990. At the centre of the trans-Pacific patent disputes are a broad portfolio of semiconductor patents held by Texas Instruments. Texas Instruments said it had been in negotiation with Sanyo for more than a year over extending the two groups' licensing agreement. The US group, one of the most aggressive companies in seeking royalty payments for its intellectual property, is also involved in a dispute with Fujitsu, the Japanese computer and electronics group, over the Kilby patent, which is a basic patent for the invention of the integrated circuit (IC) covering all ICs made, used or sold in Japan. The litigation against Sanyo 'should not have an impact on the case with Fujitsu', Texas Instruments said. A resolution of the Fujitsu case is expected by the end of the year. Texas has, nevertheless, successfully renewed licensing agreements with five other Japanese companies, it said. The five companies are Mitsubishi Electric, New Japan Radio, Nippon Precision Circuit, Seiko Epson and Toko.</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / More builders cutting house prices The number of builders trying to boost house sales with offers of price cuts and free cars and holidays has risen sharply in recent weeks, a leading house builder said yesterday. The report by Mr Steve Morgan, chairman of Redrow, coincided with a survey of 4,000 estate agents which showed a fall in all types of house sales last month The survey by Ombudsman for Corporate Estate Agents (OCEA) covering 26 estate agency chains and accounting for about half of UK house transactions, showed a 7.5 per cent fall in net sales compared with October last year. Sales were also 5.3 per cent lower than during September this year, said Mr Peter Constable, chairman of OCEA. The organisation did not blame the decrease on the half percentage point rise in general interest rates announced in September. It said: 'Housing activity declines towards the year end but sales volumes have fallen rather earlier this year. This is due in part to potential purchasers being distracted by high street retailers starting their Christmas promotions earlier. 'Housing activity also tends to be dampened due to change to an Autumn budget and house buying will decline further as we approach the peak festive season.' Mr Morgan, speaking to shareholders at Redrow's annual meeting, said: 'There has been an unwelcome return in the new homes market to discounting in recent times.' Those builders with a December year end are thought to have stepped up offers of discounts and incentives during the final few weeks of the year to meet sales targets. Mr Paul Pedley, Redrow's managing director said: 'You only have to look at newspaper advertisements to see that more companies are offering incentives to shift sales.' Redrow, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange this year and is expected to build more than 2,000 homes in 1994, said it did not expect the trend to continue into 1995.</p>

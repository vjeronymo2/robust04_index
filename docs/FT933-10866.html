			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Pay slides at small firms of architects THE heads of small architecture practices are suffering more in the building industry recession than their colleagues in larger firms, earnings figures today from the Royal Institute of British Architects show, Andrew Baxter writes. Earnings of sole principals - the heads of small practices - fell 16 per cent in the year ended April 1 to a median level of Pounds 15,072. It is the third consecutive year that sole principals' income has fallen and the cumulative fall in earnings has been 37 per cent since 1990. Principals in partnership, working for larger firms, saw median earnings fall 9 per cent to Pounds 25,489 in 1992-93. Overall, the average earnings of full-time architects on April 1 was Pounds 23,175 - a 1 per cent rise on last year's figure but still lower than the 1991 average. Private-sector in-house architects and those in local government fared better, with rises in income of 3 per cent and 4 per cent respectively.</p>

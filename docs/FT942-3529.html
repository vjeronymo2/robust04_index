			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Kemira net income down in first four months Kemira said yesterday that net income after taxes fell to FM215.6m (Dollars 38.97m) in the first four months, from FM237.6m in the same 1993 period. Sales were 9.7 per cent lower at FM4.19bn while operating income declined to FM404.1m from FM504.7m. The figures were prepared using international accounting standards for the first time. The group was more positive about prospects, saying results in the second four months should be better than last year. The group's main division, Kemira Agro, is expected to benefit from higher capacity utilisation and declining imports from eastern Europe, while higher titanium dioxide prices will lift the pigments division. Figures were hit by a strengthening Finnish markka, sales of non-core businesses and reduced agrochemical sales to Russia, Ukraine and Belorussia, the group said. The Agro division was also hurt by poor weather conditions which delayed demand for plant nutrients. Operating income was lower in both the Agro and pigments divisions, but there was a better performance from the chemicals and paints activities. Pre-tax profits amounted to FM214.6m, compared with FM238.4m a year ago, after a steep fall in financing costs to FM189.5m from FM266.3m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Guinea-Bissau's first ever multiparty elections have  been postponed. Although no new dates have been set, they  should happen before the middle of this year. President Vieira  led a one-party state in Guinea-Bissau for 12 years until  opposition parties were legalized in 1992. And this morning, he  summoned foreign diplomats to explain the reasons for the  postponement. British Honorary Consul Ian Van Manin was there.  On the line to Bissau, Alice Martin asked him what had caused  the delay:    [Begin recording] [Manin] The reason is that the National  Election Committee has not been able to organize in time the  electoral census. The electoral census is a process before the  actual elections to make sure that all the voters get registered  and get a card so that on the day of the election people can be  identified as legal voters. It is the first time they have a  big operation like this in this country, and I think they sort  of underestimated the work linked with the preparation of the  elections. The president announced that there will be elections  before the rainy season but only after the electoral census has  been completed, which is, of course, logical. We, ourselves,  are sort of speculating that the last logical physical moment to  have the elections will be in the first week of June.    [Martin] Do you think that the electoral census can be  compiled and completed by June?    [Manin] I think if everybody is of goodwill the census can  be  done in about six weeks, making it even possible to have  elections at the end of May. I think they can do it.    [Martin] Given that international funds are available for  this electoral census to be done, are there any other reasons  why they have been delayed? I mean, for instance, is the  president really willing to go ahead with the elections?    [Manin] I am pretty sure he is. He sounded very serious and  sounded even upset to sort of admit that there have been these  problems. But, you see, to hold elections is not only a matter  of money. Money can be made available easily. But, to give an  example, part of the delay was that there's been a fraud already  with the application of the recruitment of these people. The  National Election Committee had a small fee for each application  form that they issued to possible candidates, and they issued  6,000 forms. They only needed 1,200 candidates. But fairly  soon, these forms were available at sort of black-market rate of  10 or 20 times the price. People applying and buying these  forms had an idea they already had the job. That, of course,  wasn't true. They only selected 1,200, and especially those  people who paid a lot of money for these forms were very angry.    [Martin] What is the opposition saying about the delay?    [Manin] Well, I haven't seen Joao da Costa recently, but  yesterday I had a meeting with the leader of the Bafata  Movement. Well, they sort of accept that there is certain  incompetence with the National Election Committee. On the other  hand, they understand what is happening. Of course, I think it  is the opposition's right to attack the government party on  this, and say: Well, it is all on purpose and it is all done to  exhaust our funds. The longer the parties have to wait for the  election, the more money they spend. But if there are elections  now, as I said, at the end of May or beginning of June, they  would have run out of money completely. [end recording]</p>

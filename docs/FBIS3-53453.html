			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By 'Awdah 'Awdah] </F>   [Text] Amman--Hasan 'Asfur, a senior Palestinian negotiator  involved in the Taba negotiations, has said in a telephone  conversation with AL-RA'Y that he, along with Major General  'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya and Muhammad Dahlan, have, for the past  three days, been preparing for the Palestinian-Israeli  negotiations, which will resume in Taba tomorrow.    'Asfur affirmed that "this team has not left Taba since the  halt in the negotiations on Wednesday [12 January]."    'Asfur denied that "there are secret talks between the  Palestinians and Israelis," affirming that "the talks have been  halted, and that they will resume tomorrow, Monday, as agreed."    'Asfur hoped that progress will be made in the negotiations  that will be resumed in Taba tomorrow, affirming that "the  Palestinian side rejects Israeli pressures, which are aimed at  extricating concessions."    'Asfur added: "We have submitted a compromise to the Israeli  side on the issue of the border crossings with Jordan and Egypt,  one that falls in line with the spirit of the Declaration of  Principles, and heeds Israeli external security, as well."    'Asfur went on to say: "We are awaiting the Israelis'  response in the next round of the Taba negotiations." He  affirmed the Palestinian side's "commitment to the  Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles."    The Palestinian official affirmed that "coordination between  the Palestinians and Israelis on the border crossings must  involve the entire border crossings; that is, from the entrance  to the crossing up to the territories that will fall under the  jurisdiction of the Palestinian National Authority."    With regard to the size of the Jericho area, 'Asfur said  that  "the Palestinian side is insisting that it include populated  areas as well as historical and religious sites." All these, he  noted, must be under the jurisdiction of the future Palestinian  authority.    As for the issue of settlements, this is a complicated  issue,  he said. "However, we hope that we will make progress towards a  resolution of this issue," he added.    The negotiations which started on Monday were halted on  Wednesday evening so that the head of the Israeli delegation to  the negotiations could take part in the funeral of Nehemya  Tamari, commander of the Central Command, who was killed when  his helicopter crashed north of occupied Jerusalem on the night  of 11-12 January.    Dr. Nabil Sha'th has said that 35 percent of the civilian  issues discussed have been finalized. The two delegations are  yet to address the issues of water problems, planning, and  preparations on the ground, not to mention the construction of  housing units.</p>

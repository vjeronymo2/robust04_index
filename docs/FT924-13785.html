			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Chinese carrier orders five A340s CHINA Eastern Airlines, the Shanghai-based carrier, yesterday said it was ordering five Airbus A340 four-engine widebody airliners worth about Dollars 555m (Pounds 311.7m), writes Paul Betts. The order reflects a boom in civil aviation in China, which is currently seeking to modernise and expand its domestic airline industry. The Airbus order was announced in Hong Kong by Wang Lian, president of the fast-growing Chinese regional carrier. China Eastern is one of the country's six largest regional carriers which are expected to become increasingly autonomous from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) by the end of this year. Wang said the airline was considering eventually floating its shares on China's stock market as well as recruiting foreign expertise into its new management. One problem facing China's regional carriers is a shortage of qualified ground and air crew at a time of expanding business with the introduction of western jets into domestic airline fleets. China Eastern operates a large fleet of western aircraft including Airbus A300s and A310s, McDonnell Douglas MD82s and MD11s, British Aerospace 146s, Shorts 360s and De Havilland Dash-8s. It also has on order additional A300s and Fokker 100 jets.</p>

			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / The Russian Elections: Major defends sovereignty of former satellites Mr John Major, the British prime minister, yesterday delivered a clear warning that the west would resist any threats to the sovereignty of former Soviet satellites. 'The UK and the international community have recognised the independence of countries that were formerly part of the USSR. We expect their sovereignty to be respected,' he said. He was echoing an alarm felt across Europe about the implications for Russian foreign policy of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's success in the elections. In recent weeks the Liberal-Democratic party leader has repeatedly questioned the sovereignty of some of the former Soviet territories, such as the Baltic states and at times threatened Japan, Turkey, Finland, and Germany with military aggression. But although the British foreign minister, Mr Douglas Hurd, added his voice to the chorus of concern, decribing the results as 'alarming', western diplomats in general yesterday maintained their cautious stance. They insisted that it was too early to assess the longer term implications of the nationalist surge while it remains unclear what role Mr Zhirinovsky might play in any future government. Nevertheless, the success of his party seems set to add a nervous edge to the Nato meeting next month, as well as fuelling western unease about Russia's requests for an official role as 'peacekeeper' in the former Soviet republics - a request that Mr Hurd and other western European governments have hitherto given a cautiously warm hearing. Ambassadors from Europe and the US at a meeting of the Western European Union in Brussels yesterday denied there would be any policy change yet. 'We do not see a need to change our policy, neither Nato nor the WEU,' Mr Willem van Eekelen, WEU secretary general, said after the meeting. But in a comment which marks a shift of tone from recent western statements, Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary general, warned that the alliance should remain vigilant towards Russia and maintain a military balance. However, he insisted that the alliance had no need to change policy towards Moscow after Sunday's vote.</p>

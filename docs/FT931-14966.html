			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / IoD warns Lamont over risks of increasing taxes TAX increases must not form part of the Budget if the fragile economic recovery is to be given a chance, the Institute of Directors said yesterday. The IoD warned in its Budget representations to the chancellor that many powerful negative forces could yet upset the recent improvement in business confidence. It also called for a radical restructuring of public spending to overcome what it believes are structural rather than cyclical shortcomings of public finances. Even at the peak of the economic cycle, it argued, the government would not be able to balance the budget. Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the IoD, said: 'The size of the deficit problem is so big that no tax increases of acceptable proportions could come near to resolving it. What is needed is a revolutionary approach to public spending.' The institute's recommendations for reducing government spending include means-testing for all state benefits, tax incentives to encourage people to make their own provision for services such as education and health, and an extension of privatisation. Other proposals include: Sharply reducing the rate of capital gains tax. Cutting the rate of inheritance tax by half. Freezing business rates. Increasing tax relief for trading and capital losses and raising value added tax relief on bad debts. Cutting corporation tax from 33 per cent to 32 per cent.</p>

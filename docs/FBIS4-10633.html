			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] TRADE WITH COLOMBIA UP--An editorial in  the 11 March Quito daily HOY commented that the 1992 free trade  agreement between Ecuador and Colombia has had a "spectacular  effect," and that bilateral trade has "exceeded all  expectations." According to the editorial, in 1993 Ecuadoran  exports to Colombia increased over 100 percent and there was a  46-percent increase in imports from that country. The editorial  added that Ecuador has become the third largest exporter of  nontraditional products to the Colombian market after Venezuela  and the United States. Colombian investment is also on the rise,  the editorial continued, with about 350 Colombian companies  establishing factories or forming joint ventures in Ecuador.  Furthermore, the 25 March HOY reported that the  Ecuadoran-Colombian Chamber of Commerce revealed that Colombian  capital constitutes 18 percent of the capital of 327 Ecuadoran  companies. Heran Leon, executive director of the Ecuadoran  Federation of Exporters (FEDEXPOR), told the 10 March HOY that  evidence of the new trade openness was manifested at the first  Andean Fair held in Pasto, Colombia from 26 February to 6 March.    On 6 March, the Quito business daily EL COMERCIO reported  that between 1991 and 1993, Ecuadoran exports to Colombia  increased from $40 million to $195 million, breaking the 1983  record of $160 million, according to estimates by the Colombian  Embassy in Quito. The daily reported that Colombia fared even  better in 1993 with $224 million worth of sales, a 191-percent  increase from $77 million in 1980. As for Ecuador's principal  exports to Colombia, the 10 March HOY reported that, in 1993,  exports of automobiles totaled $40 million; seafood products,  $12 million; fish meal, $9.5 million; palm oil, $5 million;  plywood, $3.1 million; followed by 10 other products. Colombian  products most in demand in Ecuador include raw sugar, books and  printed material, textiles, medicines, sweets, and tires.    By January 1994, according to 6 March EL COMERCIO, Colombian  exports to Ecuador through the border town Ipiales were 53.4  percent higher than during the same period in 1993. Negotiations  are under way to construct a Pacific coast highway connecting  the province of Esmeraldas in Ecuador with the port of Tumaco in  Colombia's Narino Department. The project will include the  construction of a bridge over the Mataje River which would link  the Colombian department of Putumayo with the Ecuadoran province  of Sucumbios.    WOOD EXPORTS--The Quito daily HOY of 17 March reported that,  in 1993, wood exports surged to $15.8 million following the 1992  slump where wood exports only amounted to $5.8 million. Between  1988 and 1992, wood exports, mainly to the Andean Group, had  been steady at approximately $12 million. Following the 1992  slump, Ecuador started reentering foreign markets, especially  "nonprotected" ones such as Korea, Europe, and the United  States, ecuador's principal client. The inefficiency of the  country's forestry sector was pointed out by Alberto Robalino,  president of Ecuador's Forestry and Lumber Development  Corporation (CORMADERA), who said that around 10 million cubic  meters of wood are cut annually, but 70 percent is wasted and  remains in the forest after it is cut.    GUAYAS PROVINCE GENERATES MOST INCOME--A study by the  Guayaquil civic council and the Chamber of Commerce found that  Guayas Province, where Ecuador's largest city, Guayaquil, is  located, generates 49.36 percent of the country's sales, 63.51  percent of its customs receipts, and 45.40 percent of its  nonpetroleum revenue. Over 55 percent of the nation's companies  and 54 percent of its banks are located in Guayas. However, the  study indicates, this province only receives 11.7 percent of  provincial council allocations. The state's centralized system  was blamed for "hampering Guayas development," according to  Guayaquil EL UNIVERSO of 30 March.    SPANISH CREDIT FOR DAM--Spain has granted Ecuador $123  million to complete the construction of the La Esperanza dam,  due in 1995. The dam is part of the project to provide Manabi  Province with water for agricultural and home use, reports  Guayaquil EL UNIVERSO 2 March.    CREDIT FOR INDIANS--Quito EL COMERCIO on 18 February reports  that the European Commission has approved a credit line of $2.1  million to finance a development program for the Indians of  Pastaza Province. The 5-year program will aim at preserving  natural resources, rehabilitating lands, diversifying diets, and  improving livestock raising. The program will also encourage  ecotourism, health and education workshops, and the construction  of communal meeting places.</p>

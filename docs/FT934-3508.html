			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / International Company News: AMR warns of costs of attendants strike AMR, parent of American Airlines, estimates that fourth-quarter after-tax earnings will be reduced by more than Dollars 160m because of the strike by flight attendants last month, agencies report. As a result, AMR would report a 'significant loss' for the fourth quarter and a loss for the year. For the fourth quarter ended December 31 1992, AMR reported a loss of Dollars 200m, or Dollars 2.66 a share, on revenues of Dollars 3.6bn. The airline said it lost about 1.3m passengers in November because of the dispute. Flight attendants at American Airlines went on strike for five days just before the November 25 Thanksgiving holiday. The strike ended after President Clinton interceded. The company said its system-wide load factor in November declined 7.63 points, to 51.44 per cent from 59.07 per cent a year ago, due to the strike. It said November system-wide revenue passenger miles fell 16.8 per cent to 6.28bn from 7.55bn a year ago, while available seat miles declined 4.5 per cent to 12.21bn from 12.78bn. For the year to date, load factor declined to 60.5 per cent from 64 per cent.</p>

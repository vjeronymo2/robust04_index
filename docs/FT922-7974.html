			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: Lufthansa turns in DM386m loss LUFTHANSA, the German national airline, made a pre-tax loss of DM386m (Dollars 234m) in the first quarter of 1992 and said it did not expect to end up in the black this year. To cut costs, it is shedding 1,000 employees this year and refraining from new hiring. Originally, it had planned to take on 5,000 new people in 1992, twice as many as leave normally each year. More jobs will disappear in 1993. The loss, which came despite a rise of 23 per cent in turnover to DM3.4bn, was lower than the DM476m of last year's first quarter, but this period was heavily affected by the Gulf war. Mr Klaus Schlede, finance director, said the second quarter also showed a loss and he did not expect an operating profit for the full year. The airline, in which the German state owns 51 per cent, said its 1991 loss was DM301m before tax against a profit of DM142m the previous year. The net loss was DM426m after a profit of DM15m. Turnover was 11 per cent higher at DM16.1bn, with passenger numbers up by 11 per cent to 29.5m. As well as the Gulf war, Lufthansa also suffered from the weak world economy and sharply higher airport and traffic control charges. It has decided not to take up 11 options on new aircraft in 1993 and to take 23 aircraft out of service later this year. Mr Schlede said the Gulf war cost Lufthansa a net DM388m, while airport and traffic control payments were 24 per cent higher at DM2.1bn. Planned aircraft sales could not be made because the second-hand aircraft market had collapsed as a result of airline over-capacity caused by the first drop in world air traffic since the Second World War. The airline was also affected by landing and take-off delays, and Mr Jurgen Weber, the chief executive, said some German airports were no longer adequate. However, he hoped for some relief from the opening of the new Munich airport next week. Mr Schlede said Lufthansa's losses in Germany were around DM350m, with a seat-load factor of only 55 per cent. Its total worldwide break-even level is 67 per cent, but last year's seat-load factor was down by three percentage points to 62 per cent. Mr Weber said talks with US carriers on a partnership to increase Lufthansa's access to the US market were continuing. He was also encouraged by the Bonn government's determination to follow France's tough line and push for improvements in the US-German airline agreement which he said favoured the US.</p>

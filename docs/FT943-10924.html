			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: US Shoe rejects Dollars 425m approach from Nine West US Shoe, the US footwear, clothing and optical goods group, has received an unwanted Dollars 425m approach for its footwear business from Nine West, another US footwear group. The overture comes barely two months after US Shoe's shareholders voted against a similar proposal for a break-up of the company from a group of private investors associated with Mr Alfred Kingsley of Greenway Partners, a New York money management firm. Nine West said yesterday it had approached US Shoe last week with a proposal that US Shoe should spin off its clothing and optical businesses and merge its footwear business with Nine West's. However, US Shoe's board had rejected the idea. Its strategy in publicising details of the approach appears to be aimed at generating support for the plan from US Shoe's shareholders, so putting pressure on the company's board to reconsider. US Shoe is a specialty retailer of women's clothing, optical goods and footwear with about 2,200 stores and annual sales of about Dollars 2.7bn. Its lacklustre earnings record has put it under pressure to improve its performance. Two months ago US Shoe's board defeated the Greenway Partners proposal by arguing it would derail actions already being taken to turn the company around. Yesterday US Shoe said the latest proposal contained the drawbacks that led to rejection of the earlier plan. Nine West, which designs and sells women's fashion shoes and has annual sales of about Dollars 550m, was convinced of the logic of the deal because of the complementary brands and styles and the opportunities for merging manufacturing and sourcing.</p>

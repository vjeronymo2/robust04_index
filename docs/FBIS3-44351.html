According to the contract signed by the two sides today in  Colombo, the management of the sugar factory with an annual  production of 4,600 tons will be undertaken by 16 Chinese  managers and experts.    The signing ceremony was attended by Sri Lankan Minister of  Plantations Rupa Karunatilleke, Agricultural Minister R.M.  Dharmadasa Banda and Chinese Ambassador Zhang Chengli.

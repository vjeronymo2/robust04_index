			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH BEAT: BUDGET PRICES IN JAPAN  </P> <P> It's not always the inexpensive countries that attract the attention of budget  travelers. Interest in Japan is high, despite its very high prices. If it costs  at least $30 U.S. a day to survive in Europe, count on double that for Japan.  </P> <P> Two of the best values are Japan Rail Passes and Tokyo Youth Hostel  Accommodations.  </P> <P> Passes must be bought before arrival in Japan through Japan Air Lines or a  travel agent. You don't get the pass until you arrive in Japan, where you are  given a voucher that can be exchanged at the Japan Railways ticket counter in  the airport when you arrive.  </P> <P> The tickets are valid for unlimited rail travel, and are available for  first-class and economy. A seven-day economy pass costs 27,000 yen (about $214  U.S.), a 14-day ticket 43,000 yen ($340) and a 30-day ticket 55,000 yen ($435).  </P> <P> </P> <P> View of the City  </P> <P> Tokyo's Ichigaya Youth Hostel is on the 18th and 19th floors of an office  building near the Shinjuku area of the city.  </P> <P> It offers lodging in four-bed rooms, a terrace with a good view of the city, a  helpful English-speaking staff and traditional Japanese-style black granite  men's and women's baths. The price for bed, breakfast and dinner totals 3,690  yen ($29). There's a 10:30 p.m. curfew.  </P> <P> The hostel is at 1-6 Gobancho, Chyoda-ku, Tokyo 102. That's about a one-minute  walk from the Ichigaya subway station.  </P> <P> There are stories of extremely high wages paid to foreigners for teaching  English in Japan. But the wages are set high to match the cost of living.  </P> <P> If you are considering a trip to Japan, talk to as many people as you can who  have firsthand knowledge of the teaching opportunities and living expenses  there. You can probably find people with this experience through educational  institutions and language-teaching companies.  </P> <P> One source for background information is the third edition of the handbook  "Jobs In Japan," by John Wharton, published by Global Press. It deals primarily  with information for young travelers who hope to arrange temporary jobs  teaching English and includes information on visas and a listing of 223 schools  that hire foreign teachers.  </P> <P> "Jobs In Japan" can be ordered for $13.95 (postpaid) from Global Press, 1510  York St., No. 204, Denver, Colo. 80206.  </P> <P> Want to be sure that you'll travel with others who are close to your own age? A  variety of companies cater to travelers in a specific age group.  </P> <P> STI, which designs programs for travelers from 18 to 30 years, is introducing a  new Mayan Adventure tour this year.  </P> <P> The 24-day adventure concentrates on sites of ancient Indian cultures. It  begins in Mexico City and ends in Acapulco.  </P> <P> The land price of $1,394 covers transportation, breakfasts, some lunches and  dinners, accommodations in first-class and superior tourist-class hotels  (except for camping on a river expedition segment), sightseeing with local  guides and the services of a multilingual tour director. Departures are May 28,  June 25 and July 16.  </P> <P> STI also offers programs for this age group in China, Europe and Australia.  </P> <P> More information and a 52-page brochure are available from STI, 8619 Reseda  Blvd., Suite 103, Northridge 91324. Telephone toll-free (800) 637-7687 or (818)  886-0633.  </P></p>

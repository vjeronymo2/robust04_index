			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lyell rejects ruling on EC jobs law THE GOVERNMENT'S senior law officer yesterday took the unusual step of attempting to clarify the confusion over how EC legislation protecting the jobs and pay of workers in mergers affects the contracting-out of public services. Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, said that the European law - implemented in the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations 1981 - applied where contracting-out transferred an economic entity as a going concern that retained its identity. Whether this was the case depended on several criteria, such as whether the premises, assets, staff, goodwill or customer base were transferred. No single one of these factors was essential for there to be a transfer, he said. Sir Nicholas added that it had been wrong for UK courts to rule that the Tupe regulations applied only when assets were transferred. The ownership of assets did not need to change, although that might be a strong indication of a transfer of an undertaking. Nupe, the public services union, described the attorney-general's statement as a 'victory' saying that he had conceded that British courts had got the law wrong. A test case launched by the union against the Department of Employment is scheduled for the Court of Session in Edinburgh today. The attorney-general's statement was made to the standing committee considering the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Bill. Backbench Tories on the committee called for further action, saying that contractors had been thrown into confusion over the Tupe regulations. Dr Robert Spink, Tory MP for Castle Point, said that ministers should go much further to define the reach of the Tupe regulations. 'I want ministers to do what any French minister would do, by reasserting the interests of this country,' he said. 'We should resist this silly directive.' Mr Hartley Booth, Conservative MP for Finchley, said that so long as decisions about whether the regulations applied were at the discretion of the courts, contractors would be 'in a fog'. Until the government created greater clarity, there would be 'a total block on contracting out'. The Civil Service unions said they would take out an injunction against the first government department that releases contracting-out tender documents that make no mention of Tupe. Mr Bill Brett, general secretary of the IPMS civil service union, said: 'There is total chaos in government about what to do about Tupe and the lawyers are, at best, completely confused.' But he said it was becoming clearer that Tupe applied in far more cases than the government had originally believed. 'It appears that the only way to influence the government is through the law, so we will be serving an injunction against the first department which does not include a Tupe clause in its tender document,' said Mr Brett.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 18 (KCNA) -- Nine political parties  and organizations of Bangladesh including the Workers and  Peasants Socialist Party and the Workers' Party issued a joint  statement regarding the situation on the Korean peninsula.    Noting that the U.S. imperialists have deliberately massed  their Armed Forces and deployed nuclear weapons on the Korean  peninsula, systematically violated provisions of the Korean  Armistice Agreement and paralyzed even the armistice observation  mechanism, the joint statement says:    We call upon all the peoples and peaceloving governments of  all countries to firmly unite to defend world peace and denounce  the U.S. imperialists' illegal acts of aggression.    We consider that the DPRK's proposal to replace the  Armistice  Agreement with a peace agreement is justifiable under the  current situation and practical measures should be taken  immediately to establish a peace arrangement on the Korean  peninsula.    We will stand firm on the side of the DPRK Government and  people who have struggled for peace and security on the Korean  peninsula.</p>

			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Ferranti drops Troubled Ferranti suffered a drop of 3 3/4 to 8 1/2 p, or nearly 30 per cent, in hefty trade of 22m after the board of the electronics company said the value of net assets had fallen to less than half the share capital. The company has convened an egm for next month to discuss the crisis. Analysts said a break-up of the group was now highly likely, with GEC being touted as an obvious candidate to take on some of its contracts, which include a lucrative deal with the United Arab Emirates. Ferranti's sonar technology oper-ations would also be of particular interest, an analyst said. A full takeover is considered unlikely because of Ferranti's debt obligations. The market is forecasting losses of around Pounds 28m for the current year.</p>

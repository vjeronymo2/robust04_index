			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Technology: Heavenly inspiration - The US Star Wars initiative has led to a wide range of discoveries When former US President Ronald Reagan revealed the Strategic Defence Initiative to an awe-struck television audience 10 years ago, he captured the imagination of the world. To many, the concept of a defence system which would intercept nuclear missiles in space seemed the perfect palliative to a world fearful of nuclear war. To others, it seemed an impossible dream, and the programme's nickname, 'Star Wars', captured the scepticism and hope the project inspired. If the Star Wars initiative is not yet dead, it is certainly on its last legs. Earlier this year, SDI was forced to change its official name to the Ballistic Missile Defence Organisation (BMDO), and told to shift its priorities from space-oriented research to ground, or 'theatre', missile defence. The proposed 1994 budget has allocated no resources to space-based interceptors, the heart of the Star Wars programme, and a pending Congressional bill looks set to cut funding for the office's other projects further. Almost Dollars 30bn (Pounds 20bn) was poured into SDI over the last decade, and now that the project is facing demise, it is natural to question whether any good came out of the massive initiative. Although the goal of catching nuclear missiles in space remains little more than a dream, a dazzling array of new technologies has been developed by Star Wars researchers. From the beginning, the SDI office boasted an aggressive scheme to transfer technology to the private sector and many companies are making use of these new tools. The wide range of technologies available attests to the ambitious nature of the SDI initiative. Discoveries range from medical advances to computer software and new materials. Products on the market today include synthetic diamonds for use in industrial cutting, laser shows for Disney World, and three-dimensional computer software for architects. The BMDO office maintains a database with descriptions of 2,000 new technologies spawned by SDI. The number of technologies listed is far more impressive than the sales they generate, though. According to the BMDO, hundreds of companies are now relying on Star Wars discoveries, but most of those groups are small, with annual sales of Dollars 10m or less. Many companies are still in the research and development phase, without any products yet on the market. Still, those involved with the SDI spin-offs say annual sales are a poor measure of the new technologies' success. 'A lot of these companies will see their sales mushroom over the next few years,' says Aram Mooradian, chairman of Microcor, which helped develop laser systems for SDI. 'Also, a lot of this is what you call 'enabling' technology - technology that can enable the development of a multi-billion dollar industry. Microcor's sales may not be that large, but we're working on laser components for a Dollars 4bn sector.' Microcor is currently developing a miniaturised laser product which would add clarity to the images produced by projection television - television which is projected on to a big screen. Laser and computer software were two of the most prolific sectors of SDI research, and both have proved especially applicable to the medical field. 'We came up with a computer programme designed to track ballistic missiles after they took off,' said Kendall Preston, president of Kensal Corporation, which worked on Star Wars research. 'We had to deal in detail with a three-dimensional world. When we started looking around for alternative markets, the medical field was the first thing that came to mind.' Kensal Corporation now produces three-dimensional pictures of human tissues to help physicians develop treatments for their patients. Another company making a successful shift to the medical market is AccSys Corporation. The founders of the company were originally asked to develop an accelerator for neutral particle beams, which would be used to distinguish decoys from actual nuclear missiles. Today, the group uses the technology in proton therapy for cancer patients. With the new accelerator, a beam projects high-energy protons into a patient. 'The protons go through matter with no damage,' said Robert Hamm, president of the group. 'But then they are deposited in the tissue where the tumour is located. There, their energy explodes and kills off the targeted cancer cells.' The transfer of technology from SDI to the private sector has been a herculean task for the defence department. The SDI group has spent years matchmaking between the developers of technology and their markets. SDI targeted small companies rather than large corporations, under an initiative called the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) programme, which continues to provide a small amount of funding. 'We had a limited amount of money and decided it would make a bigger impact on smaller companies, which are more research and development oriented,' said Nicholas Montanarelli, who heads the SBIR programme. Since its inception, the programme organised several conferences a year to allow its suppliers to meet potential customers. The conferences were attended by representatives from a number of different industries, and developers of technology for SDI were periodically invited to deliver half-hour presentations on their research. The job of the representatives was to discover how some of these technologies could be used in industry. All intellectual property rights for the new technologies also belonged to the companies developing the new products. Many of the companies that are now marketing SDI technology were started by individuals once working for the federal government. 'The key to a good technology transfer programme is having certain people who want to go with the technology and start up a company on their own,' says Peter Clout, a former employee of the national Los Alamos Laboratory and today president of Vista Control Systems, a company selling software developed with SDI funds. 'You can't just wrap the technology up in a parcel and put it in the mail.' The worth of the Star Wars initiative will probably be debated for years to come. While Dollars 30bn may have been a high price to pay, there can be no doubt that a number of useful technologies has emerged from the project. Whether or not these will translate into the billion-dollar industries many of their developers are hoping is still uncertain.</p>

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Europe's high-fliers a down to earth lot THE average European business traveller is a family man, often careless with his health, more inclined to sleep than eat on long-haul flights and occasionally prepared to play computer games on his portable computer. The portrait is revealed today in a survey by Official Airline Guides, a publisher of airline timetables. It also records national differences in attitudes to air travel. The French are most inclined to ignore in-flight catering and the British most likely to drink alcohol, and the Germans like to both eat and drink. Women business travellers, just 7 per cent of the total, are the most industrious. Some 69 per cent say they preferred to work on short-haul flights, compared with 61 per cent of men. More than a third of all passengers polled did not take out full medical insurance and less than half made sure they had the necessary inoculations against disease. The British were the most conscientious on inoculations, and Germans the worst. One in five passengers usually carried condoms, of which most were married men. One in 12 women travelling also carried condoms, the survey found. Frequent flyer schemes - in which loyalty to an airline is rewarded with points that can be exchanged for free trips - emerge as an important determinant in airline loyalty. Some 82 per cent of survey respondents were members of such schemes and two thirds of members said that given a choice of carriers on a route they would choose one to whose frequent flyer programme they belonged. Ironically, the free flights earned from such schemes were of little importance to the frequent traveller. Top of the list of perks conferred by membership of such schemes, nominated by 92 per cent of respondents, is to be given priority in the waiting list for full aircraft. Their desires are probably the result of the need to make late changes in itineraries: 30 per cent of business travellers said they did this 'very frequently.' By contrast, only a minority of travellers had redeemed any frequent flyer points, perhaps not surprising when only 10 per cent said enjoying leisure time was more important than work or family life.</p>

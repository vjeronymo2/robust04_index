			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> OIL CLEANUP FOCUSES ON SCATTERED PATCHES  </P> <P> The cleanup of miles of Orange County shoreline fouled with oil spilled from  the tanker American Trader two weeks ago has reached the "hide and seek" stage  with patches on oily beaches, said British Petroleum spokesman Jim Marino.  </P> <P> The firm, which owned the spilled crude, has pledged to stay on the cleanup as  long as necessary. So far, about three miles of Newport Beach's shoreline has  been cleaned sufficiently to be reopened, leaving another four miles closed. In  addition, cleanup continues on all of Huntington Beach's closed shoreline.  </P></p>

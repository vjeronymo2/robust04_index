			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Treasury projects a cautious line on recovery THE RECOVERY, when it arrives, will be modest and driven by consumption rather than investment, according to the latest Treasury projections. In a muted and heavily qualified statement of UK economic prospects, the Treasury admitted that its Budget projections have proved to be over-optimistic while forecasting that the economy will grow by 1 per cent in 1993 after contracting by the same figure this year. The Treasury forecast for 1993 is lower than that of most independent forecasters. The consensus of forecasters expect a rise in gross domestic product of 1 1/4 per cent next year. In its pre-election budget, the government had forecast growth of 1 per cent this year and 3 per cent in the first half of 1993. Treasury forecasters have been criticised over the past year for being both wrong and over-optimistic. In a recent FT analysis of recent forecasting performance, the Treasury came 19th out of 41 forecasters. A Treasury calculation of its forecasts over the last 10 years show thats its forecast for GDP growth tends to be wrong, on average, by 1 1/4 percentage points of GDP. This implies that the Treasury's growth forecast for 1991 could vary between 2 1/4 per cent and - 1/4 per cent. But the Treasury appears to have swapped optimism for caution. 'The recovery could, of course, be a lot stronger if confidence picks up quickly in response to recent government initiatives' it says. 'But it seems prudent not to base the forecast on this assumption.' The effect of projected slow growth, rising unemployment and higher spending is to raise the public sector borrowing requirement to Pounds 37bn this financial year, up from the Pounds 28bn target announced in the budget. Excluding privatisation receipts, the PSBR is Pounds 45bn, equivalent to 7 1/2 per cent of GDP. The Treasury expects the headline PSBR to rise to around 7 per cent of GDP in the 1993-94 financial year, equivalent to Pounds 44bn. The government expects a moderate recovery in consumer spending, forecast to grow by 1 1/4 per cent next year. Fixed investment is expected to rise by a quarter of 1 per cent. The relatively sluggish pick-up in consumer spending means lower than expected import growth, although at 5 3/4 per cent it is higher than the independent consensus. It is also faster than expected growth of exports. There is little sign of a stimulatory effect on exports from the recent devaluation of sterling. Indeed, the short-term effect is to increase the current account deficit as import prices rise faster than export prices. The deficit is expected to rise to Pounds 15.5bn in 1993 or 2 1/2 per cent of GDP compared to 2 per cent of GDP this year. The devaluation does affect the government's inflation projections. Retail price inflation, excluding mortgage interest tax relief, is expected to remain at 3 3/4 per cent this year and next. But producer price inflation is expected to jump to 4 per cent from 2 1/2 per cent this year as manufacturers use the devaluation to boost their profit margins. The Treasury downplays this inflation risk. 'Against a back of strong disinflationary pressures, the lower exchange may imply only a marginal and almost certainly temporary increase in inflation,' it says.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SPOTTING THE UK ECONOMIC RECOVERY  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Autumn     Latest    Budget     Autumn                          statement    private    1992++  statement                               1992  consensus*                1991  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Gross domestic product 1992                          -1       -0.8        1       -2 1/4 1993                           1      1 1/4        3           na Consumer spending 1992                        -1/4       -0.3        1        2 1/2 1993                       1 1/4          1        3           na Govt consumption 1992                         1/2        1.2        1        1 3/4 1993                         1/2          1    1 1/4           na Fixed investment 1992                          -2       -2.8     -1/2        1 1/4 1993                         1/4       -1/4    3 1/2           na Exports 1992                       3 1/4          3    3 1/2            6 1993                       5 1/2      4 3/4    6 1/2           na Imports 1992                       6 1/2        6.1        4        7 1/2 1993                       5 3/4      3 3/4    8 1/4           na Current account (Pounds bn) 1992                         -12      -11.6   -6 1/2       -9 1/2 1993                     -15 1/2        -14       -9           na Manufacturing output 1992                          -1       -0.8      1/2        3 1/4 1993                           1      1 3/4    3 3/4           na Inflation 1992                       3 3/4        3.8       na           na 1993                       3 3/4      4 1/4       na           na PSBR (Pounds bn) 1992++++                      37       32.9       28           na 1993++++                      na       39.4       na           na  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes: Figures apply to percentage changes on previous year unless otherwise stated  Forecast for 1993 applies to year-on-year change to June 1993 * Comparison of forecasts compiled by Treasury, 1992 forecasts from October bulletin and 1993 forecasts from Autumn Statement ++++ Financial year ++ retail prices index excluding mortagage interest payments, Q4 on Q4  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

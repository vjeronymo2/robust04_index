The former parliament "White House" was allocated for  government use following the bloody October event last year.    Yeltsin's order was announced by the presidential press  service department in the wake of much criticism of the  construction plan which was also one of the reasons why Yegor  Gaydar, one of the government's senior officials, resigned on  January 16.</p>

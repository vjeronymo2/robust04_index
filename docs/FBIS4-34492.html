			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Pedro Margolles Villanueva, </F> president of PRENSA LATINA's Board of Directors: "Thirty-Five  Years, Come Hell or High Water"]    [Text] [no dateline as received] It was still common to see  a bearded man with a submachine gun dressed in an olive green  uniform with rebel army badges on it in the streets of Havana.  The Cuban revolution was making a strong impact on the world.  It was June 1959.    Jorge Ricardo Masetti, an Argentine journalist, had  interviewed Fidel Castro and Che Guevara in the Sierra Maestra a  few months earlier, smack dab in the middle of the fighting  against Fulgencio Batista's dictatorship. Masetti was in Havana  again and wanted to create a different kind of news agency. He  requested the cooperation of several young Latin American and  Cuban journalists and, with the revolution's support, created  the Latin American News Agency, PRENSA LATINA.    The idea for a news agency of this kind stemmed from a  reality imposed by the circumstances at that time; that is, the  monopoly that transnational news agencies exercised and still  exercise. Every day these agencies transmit hundreds of news  items on Latin America and the undeveloped world that present a  distorted picture that is detrimental to the area's interests.  These agencies, primarily the U.S.-based ones, were waging a  strong campaign against Cuba and the revolutionary government's  first social justice measures. It was necessary to spread Latin  America's own informational concept and to reach the majority of  our countries. That is how PRENSA LATINA emerged 35 years ago.    The agency's creation did not go unnoticed. Some  commentators predicted it would last only a few months, but the  dream, with all its ups and downs, continues. We are still  present in 21 countries and reach 19 of them every day with  objective, truthful reports on the national situation and that  of the rest of the Third World.    PRENSA LATINA has become a modest media complex that  publishes the magazines PRISMA -- already in its 20th year --  and CUBA INTERNACIONAL, has its own television department (TV  Latina), and offers printed and radio bulletin services. PRENSA  LATINA has created its own advertising agency, PUBLIMAGEN, and  prepares promotional materials aimed at the market. More than  130 reporters keep PRENSA LATINA operating around the clock  under complex conditions. We serve customers in Latin America  and Cuba and strive to improve our services to the Latin  American and world press.    In the past few years, PRENSA LATINA has achieved a  significant technological transformation by installing an  automated news monitoring and broadcasting system devised by its  own engineers. The agency's primary importance, however, does  not lie in the display of large resources or sophisticated  technology but in its well-known prestige and authority among  news media and professionals around the world. PRENSA LATINA  helped found and actively collaborates with the Non-Aligned News  Agencies Pool and the Association of Latin American National  Information Systems (ASIN).    In addition, PRENSA LATINA upholds the principle of the need  for a new order of information and communications because  inequalities regarding access to and handling of information  persist. Powerful consortiums have the upper hand and impose a  news flow detrimental to undeveloped countries, which continue  to regard the concepts and ideas of independence and sovereignty  as their inalienable rights. Information and communications must  serve as instruments of understanding rather than hostility and  dominance among men.    For several years PRENSA LATINA has been promoting the  highest values of Latin American journalism and sponsoring the  Jose Marti Award, created in 1986. Anyone who has published  works on the nation's situation and on our struggle for social  justice is eligible to compete.    On 15 June, the agency commemorates its 35th anniversary  with  the determination to keep uniting voices and to exercise a  genuine, independent, integrated, sincere, and articulate  journalism. This is the example set by dozens of Latin American  and Cuban journalists who learned the trade in some of their  editor's offices, worked as correspondents, or fulfilled  dangerous assignments. Most of them feel they are part of the  agency which, as Galeano said, keeps sailing come hell or high  water.</p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / UK Company News: EFG dips but seeks acquisitions EFG, the Oxford-based garden centre and horticultural products group, saw pre-tax profits decline to Pounds 615,000 in the six months to July 31, against Pounds 804,000. The fall, struck despite a turnround to interest receivable of Pounds 56,000 (payable Pounds 148,000), came on turnover of Pounds 6.49m (Pounds 10m). Stripping out discontinued activities, turnover showed an increase, the company said. Mr Robin Garland, chief executive, said that the main operations had remained profitable in difficult market conditions. 'Strong cash flow and proceeds from our rationalisation programme have considerably improved the cash position and further strengthened the balance sheet.' Earnings per share, on capital increased by last year's rights issue, dropped from 3.02p to 1.31p.</p>

			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / UK Gilts: Indications of upturn reignite inflation fears AFTER the run of indications that the UK economy may be picking up, gilt specialists are highlighting May 18 as a day of possible fireworks. The publication of the Bank of England's next quarterly report on inflation is expected to reopen the discussion as to how much extra upward pressure on prices may be expected over the next year. Also of interest will be any behind-the-scenes disagreements between the Bank and the Treasury as how best to describe the likely paths for inflation. In recent weeks gilt yields have dropped on the lack of any indications that a rise in inflation is around the corner. The trend continued last week, with buying pressure for the bonds helped partly by news of a four basis point cut in Bundesbank repo rates to 8.13 per cent. Last week produced more evidence that UK consumers may be increasing their demand for credit after the low level of borrowing last year. The increase in borrowing through finance houses, building societies and certain bank credit cards in the three months to the end of February totalled a seasonally adjusted Pounds 305m, well above the Pounds 64m in the previous three months. The announcement that new car sales rose in March by a year-on-year 12.7 per cent, and that house prices rose 1.2 per cent last month to show their biggest monthly increase for four years, added to the expectations that growth may be returning to the UK. For the time being, such indications are being welcomed in the gilt market on the grounds that a return to growth after the recession which started nearly three years ago will constrain any further rises in the fiscal deficit which is expected to be around Pounds 50bn this financial year. However, clear signs of an upturn will also reignite worries about inflation. Many gilt specialists believe that underlying inflation over the next 12 months will breach the government's 4 per cent upper limit. This measure of inflation - the year-on-year changes in the retail prices index, less mortgage costs - was 3.4 per cent in the year to February. The figure for the year to March is being announced on Friday, while the latest numbers for the price changes of manufactured goods at the wholesale level - another good indicator of inflationary pressures - are coming out today. In its first inflation report in February, the Bank set a possibly fateful precedent by publishing an explicit forecast of underlying inflation. While the Bank made clear there was a large possible margin of error, its central forecast for inflation at the end of 1994 is a year-on-year 3.5 per cent. The Bank hedged its bets by saying the range could be between 1 per cent and 6 per cent. The last published Treasury projection, made in the March Budget, is that underlying inflation would be 3.75 per cent in the second quarter of 1994. In the past, the Bank has refused to publish any of its internal forecasts. That has been mainly on the grounds that publication of Bank forecasts might open divisions with the Treasury - which has often been sensitive to the Bank coming out with views on the economy which differ from its own. Even though the details of Bank forecasts have been hidden from outsiders, the Bank has periodically patted itself on the back by saying its projections in recent years have been a lot more accurate than rivals both inside and outside the government. The Bank has now decided - at least for inflation - to put its forecasting reputation on the line. In the light of the apparent stirrings of economic activity, Bank economists are considering the range of possibilities which could lead to inflation overshooting the 4 per cent limit. If the Bank does feel impelled to publish next month a forecast of inflation above this level, there is a high possibility of a fracas with the Treasury. However, the Bank's game plan cannot be faulted. It seems determined to bring out into the open any disagreements about inflation possibilities between its own officials and the Treasury. In this way, a more sensible and informed discussion may take place as how best to keep price pressures low in the longer term and so improve on the UK's dismal inflation performance in recent years.</p>

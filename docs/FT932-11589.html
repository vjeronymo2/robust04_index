			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Irish Company News: Dublin sells remaining Greencore holding  -Institutions take 30.4% stake after ADM pulls out THE IRISH government has disposed of its remaining 30.4 per cent in Greencore, the sugar, malting and milling group, to institutional investors for a total of IPounds 70m (Pounds 68m) after ADM, the US food company, pulled out of talks to buy the stake. The deal valued the 25.4m shares at 275p each, a discount of about 7 per cent on recent trading levels. The government said yesterday that ADM 'decided not to continue further with the discussions due to their long duration and public nature'. News of ADM's interest leaked last February, pushing the shares above what was believed to be ADM's offer of 260p. Greencore's management had encouraged ADM to make a bid as part of the company's strategic development plan aimed at using ADM's financial and marketing muscle to expand into the European market. Domestic political pressure, however, forced Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, to put the government's shares out to tender with the intention of finding an Irish buyer. No other offers came forward, however, after the Greencore board made it clear that they favoured ADM. Mr Gerry Murphy, Greencore's chief executive, said yesterday: 'We are pleased at the successful placing of the government's holding which removes the market overhang of our shares.' Asked if he felt that the sale had been badly handled he said: 'It has to be said one can only be disappointed. This has gone on so long and a lot of effort was put in. 'But we have an excellent working relationship with ADM and all our options are still open and we can still work with them in joint ventures as long as it makes commercial sense for both companies'. Mr Ahern acknowledged that 'ADM went away because of the public controversy'. He attacked what he called 'the politics of the negative left', referring to opposition politicians who had objected to the sale to an overseas company. Objections had also come from the Labour Party within the government coalition. Following the failure of the public tender, Mr Ahern said: 'What I was not prepared to do was to let ADM walk away and then allow the overhang to remain. Greencore has excellent strategic plans and ADM were part of those. 'I would hope that Gerry Murphy and his colleagues will continue to look for partnerships, maybe with ADM or others that is for them to decide, but they will certainly have my full support.' The government continues to hold a 'golden share', which is intended to prevent Ireland's sugar quota within the EC being transferred to another company outside Ireland, which would threaten the livelihoods of thousands of farmers who supply Greencore with sugar beet.</p>

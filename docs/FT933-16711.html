			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Taurus vs Crest: How they compare ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TAURUS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- All shareholders required to use system No option to retain certificates Settlement and free 'custody' service available for private investors, with less flexibility Complex stock holding and transfer mechanisms Very high security and large compensation scheme, on account of comprehensiveness of system Operator as conduit for most information and benefits Structure Periodic register updates; ownership rights in the interim, largely dependent on system records Legal environment complex, increased by new entitlement concept System sought to automate complex and often manual procedures Overnight batch settlement Assured payments addressed late in development process  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- CREST  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Membership optional Certificates may be retained by shareholders Investor choice: uncertificated holding and transfer with option to hold certificates Relatively straightforward structure for ownership and transfer of securities Less overbearing requirements in an environment of choice System will provide fewer 'custodial' functions Structure Daily register updates promptly after settlement; legal ownership rights evidenced by the entry on the company register Should require far less new law, and in more familiar areas Seeks to address key causes of market complexity and thus reduce it Continuous settlement with same-day functionality Possible 'cash on delivery' mechanism  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

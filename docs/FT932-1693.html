			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Deficit, not ideology, drives French sell-off: David Buchan outlines the likely course and timetable of the new conservative government's privatisation programme - French Privatisation FRANCE's new wave of privatisations is primarily a matter of money, in contrast to those started seven years ago which were driven as much by politics. On their return to power in 1986, France's conservatives were determined to show that by pushing privatisation through under the nose of a defiant President Francois Mitterrand, they could roll back the nationalisations that were one of the main Socialist achievements of the early 1980s. Today, however, the conservatives have no such need to prove their political virility. In parliamentary elections in March they routed a Socialist government which, far from trying to re-nationalise companies in the late 1980s, partly conceded the case for private ownership by half-heartedly selling off a few state assets themselves. Some die-hard Socialists still rail about 'the cream of French industry being flogged off to foreign predators'. But, as Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister in charge of privatisation, told the senate, 'the ideological debate is over'. The government of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has a pressing need to get a lot of money from privatisation. It cannot squeeze any more out of a budget in which spending will outstrip revenue by FFr317bn (Pounds 38bn) this year. So it is raising FFr40bn in a special 'Balladur bond' issue, which it wants to finance with privatisation proceeds this autumn, rather than by further increasing the deficit. In theory, that should not be difficult. The government has put 21 companies on the auction block (see table), in what will be Europe's largest privatisation. Some of them are confirmed money-losers, such as Air France and Bull, the computer company, which have been put on the sell-off list probably more as a jolt to their managements than in the realistic hope of finding early buyers. Others, though, are stars in their sectors - Elf-Aquitaine in oil or Rhone-Poulenc in chemicals. One big sale would do the trick this year. Selling the state's 50 per cent stake in Elf would, according to Baring Securities, bring in between FFr38bn and FFr47bn. But the relatively small domestic stock market remains in frail health, while many of the foreign investors who already hold about 30 per cent of the shares on the Paris bourse believe Gallic protectionism will prevent them getting much more. The government has done away with the 20 per cent ceiling it put on foreign purchases of the 1986-88 privatisation issues. But, taking a leaf out of the UK government's book, it has said it would retain a golden share in strategic companies such as Elf, Air France and the two big defence contractors, Aerospatiale and Thomson. If and when such companies reach private hands, the state would still retain 'very strong prerogatives' in their management 'when essential national interests are at stake', Mr Alphandery assured anxious senators. With pledges like this, the government will have little problem getting privatisation through parliament. It hopes to celebrate Bastille Day (July 14) with the framework legislation on the statute book. Two weeks later it will establish the new privatisation committee, and give it something to work on immediately by announcing the first batch of companies to be sold. The privatisation committee will value the companies to be sold and conduct tenders among companies wanting to buy into the privatised entities as part of a ring of core shareholders, or noyaux durs. Last time around, Mr Edouard Balladur, then finance minister, took the decision himself on the noyaux durs and came in for considerable criticism that he was rewarding political and business cronies. To be above such suspicion, the government will now in effect farm out the forming of the noyaux durs to the privatisation committee. The first batch, probably two to five companies, will cover several sectors of the economy. The idea is to get started on a broad front on the valuing of companies, arranging for the conversion of any non-voting certificats d'investissement into shares and choosing banking advisers, and at the same time to give the government some flexibility to advance or delay a sale depending on the market. What criteria will the government use in choosing which sales should go forward? 'Above all, it will be the health of the companies themselves,' says a senior economy ministry official. 'This obviously includes the state of the sector in which it operates. We will not, for instance, offer to the market companies which happen to be making cyclical losses, even if they are basically sound.' A key question for investors will be the management of the company they are buying into. The government has inherited a bevy of managers largely appointed by the Socialists in 1991 for three years. It has decided that there should be no general chopping off of heads until at least 1994. But, in the case of companies slated for privatisation before then, it has said it may make changes. 'Experience has shown that a management must be comfortable with privatisation for it to succeed,' the economy ministry official says. 'Privatisation involves a big publicity campaign, and it is impossible for that to be carried out by someone who is not convinced of its merits and who does not have a good chance of staying on after the change'. One appointment, with privatisation clearly in mind, has already been made - Mr Michel Pebereau moved last month from Credit Commercial de France, which he took private with great elan in 1987, to head Banque Nationale de Paris. From all this, it is possible to guess that the first group of companies put on the slipway to privatisation might include BNP among the banks, AGF among the three insurance companies, and one of the two sound and big industrial concerns, Elf or Rhone-Poulenc. Rhone Poulenc said yesterday it would sell its 35 per cent stake in Roussel-Uclaf, the pharmaceutical company, for about FFr4.5bn, so reducing its debt and making itself more attractive for privatisation. The other guessing game centres on which companies might want to join in the noyaux durs, which Mr Alphandery says will henceforth be open to foreign, especially European, investors. Up to now the noyaux durs have been almost entirely French. But many French institutional investors got a poor return on the earlier privatisations; their shares in Paribas are worth little more than what they paid for them in 1987 and their shares in Suez are worth less. Because of the cross-holdings arranged under the Socialists, some privatisation candidates already come with their own noyaux durs. Credit Lyonnais, whose own sale will have to wait until it moves out of the red, has been very active, taking stakes in Rhone-Poulenc, Aerospatiale and Usinor, the steel company. BNP has a link up with UAP, the insurance company, and has an agreement with Dresdner bank for a 10 per cent equity swap. Mr Alphandery has said that noyaux durs should stay where they already exist. But some investors are clearly keen to expand. Societe Generale, the bank privatised in 1987, has said it would like to take equity in its long-standing customer, Rhone-Poulenc, while St Gobain, the glass company privatised in 1986, has been rumoured to want to link up with Pechiney, the metals group, with which it has common interests in packaging. The programme is clearly appetising to professional investors. It has, however, not so far excited the small punter. According to a recent Sofres opinion poll, only 4 per cent of the French said they were 'certainly interested' in buying shares in the newly-privatised companies. The government is offering a variety of incentives to entice the small investor. These include allowing employees to buy shares in privatised companies at a 20 per cent discount, investors to pay by instalments on some big issues, and holders of 'Balladur bonds' to convert their bonds into shares of privatised companies. An early test, therefore, of privatisation's prospects will be the level of interest in the Balladur bond issue, to be launched on Friday.

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Processors cash in on EC aid for pea production - Growers will get little benefit from area payments / Farmer's Viewpoint TO PEA or not to pea; that is the question. Indeed, it is a question UK growers of green peas for freezing ask themselves every year. For few crops create as much aggravation on the farm or generate as much emotion between growers and processors. And by introducing area aid payments for all peas, whether grown for animal protein or human consumption, the European Community's common agricultural policy reform package has created yet another area for conflict. While area aid for cereals, oil seeds and dry peas and the like was introduced to compensate growers for cuts in guaranteed prices, the area payment for green, or vining, peas did not replace anything. It was simply a bonus of about Pounds 140 an acre, which must have slipped past Euro-officials who failed to understand its significance. Moreover, vining pea growers said last autumn that they would prefer not to receive the aid. Instinctively they realised that it would complicate their negotiations with the processors and that in the long run they would be better off without it. But the wheels of government grind exceeding slow and since it had been agreed it had to stand, for 1993 at least. But the situation was complicated further when it was decreed that, in order to be eligible to claim the aid for crops grown in 1993, a farmer had to have been committed to growing green peas by November 17 1992. In other words, the farmers in question had to have a cropping plan or a contract to grow verifiable as having been written before the due date. Any farmer worth his salt would have planned his cropping long before that and most decided to claim the aid. Cynics will say, of course, that farmers will claim any grant that is going given half a chance. But the deciding factor this time was the declared intention of the processors to grab at least some of the benefit for themselves. Any farmer who did not claim therefore stood to receive worse terms for his peas as well as missing EC aid payments. The processors negotiated long and hard to secure the discounted deals they wanted. Some have cut the prices they will pay for a tonne of peas; others have extended payment terms; and at least one big processor has said it will spend the money gained on extra brand promotion. But all have made sure that the growers will not hang on to all the EC cash to which they are, however anomalously, entitled. Indeed some processors were still negotiating terms until well into last month, when this year's harvest began. This expensive, 24-hours-a-day, usually co-operative operation, is now about half done. It goes on, rain or shine, across the pea-growing areas, most of which are in the eastern counties of England, for six or seven weeks. It involves massive Pounds 150,000 vining machines, which separate peas from pods, and fleets of lorries to take the peas to freezing factories. Strict time limits are set for the peas to be delivered, processed and frozen. After more than 90 minutes out of the pod they begin to deteriorate, so the logistics must be meticulously planned and executed. Given such restrictions it is necessary to have more than adequate man and machine power available in case of breakdowns. All of which adds to the expense and the management problems of the pea campaign. Even so the procedure, carefully planned from staggered planting dates to orderly harvesting, can go wrong. The hot weather during Wimbledon fortnight, for instance, caused many fields of peas to ripen prematurely and the capacity of the viners was inadequate to deal with them all before some had deteriorated below the high quality standards demanded by the processors. The result was that some fields had to be passed over and left to be combine harvested for seed or for feeding to livestock. Farmers so affected can usually defray any losses they suffer against the co-operative group to which they belong. But they are left with a harvest for which they did not plan and with the cost and inconvenience of combining and storing the dry peas until a market for them is found. Peas crops that have been harvested green, as intended, are reported to have turned in variable yields this year. Some growers in Lincolnshire and Humberside have seen up to 2.5 tonnes an acre while some others in Norfolk and Suffolk have been disappointed to achieve only 1.5 tonnes an acre. There are few crops more weather-sensitive than peas. At the higher end of that yield scale the crop can be reasonably profitable, especially with the extra income from area aid. At the lower end growers will almost certainly have made a thumping loss, even with the EC cash. But profitability also depends on the contract each co-operating group has with its processor. This year has seen a welcome and significant resurgence of fixed price contracts, replacing some of the less secure market-related deals that have characterised recent years. Indeed it was the move towards market-related contracts and the threat of delayed payment until the goods were retailed that finally persuaded me to get out of the green pea business about 15 years ago. Since then many other farmers have also stopped growing the crop and there are probably fewer than 1,000 who have stuck with it, selling to 15 to 20 significant processors, themselves dominated by only three companies. It might be thought that farmers serving such a compact industry would be able to work together for mutual benefit. But apart from voluntarily agreeing to cut the acreage this year by about 20 per cent in order to clear last year's stocks there seems to be a sad lack of unanimity among growers, especially on contract terms and prices. Whether or not they agree to work more closely together, however, there will be no area aid from the EC next year and in order for a farmer to even equal this year's income per tonne the processors will have to raise prices significantly. Furthermore farmers will need to know the terms under which they can grow peas far earlier than ever before to be able to plan their 1994 acreage set-aside by the deadline date of the December 15 1993. In most years negotiations have hardly begun by then because, the processors say, they cannot decide acreages or prices until they know carry-over stock levels. And that depends on the severity of the winter and the availability and price of fresh vegetables through January, February and March. How that little difficulty will be solved is anybody's guess. Brussels-based bureaucrats do not make provision for the peculiarities of the British climate nor for the Machiavellian complications of corporate negotiations with farmers. I confess to being rather pleased that I am no longer involved in that particular can of worms.</p>

Radioactivity knows no frontiers, so monitoring systems must  operate on an international scale. The Russian Federation is  acquiring a system of this type, integrated into a system  already in place in Germany.  <H5>  Data Exchange Via Satellite </H5>   Rapid, standardized, transregional radioactivity data  exchange is of particular importance in the event of an accident  and requires a modern information and communications  infrastructure and regular practice in operating it. There have  been several facilities in Russia measuring radioactivity to  date, all working on their own, but a unified information system  for recording and assessing the data acquired will now improve  cooperation among them. The Federal Ministry of the  Environment, Nature Conservation, and Reactor Safety (BMU) has  commissioned German Aerospace AG to install a modern  radioactivity metering and information system. IRIS (integrated  radioactivity information system) is being set up for the  Russian Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources. In  the first phase of the project, parameters collected and tested  in the area surrounding the nuclear power station near Smolensk  will be transferred to a central post in Moscow, where they will  be processed and used to draw up radiological maps. As Germany  has an interest in obtaining accurate information as early as  possible in the event of accidents at Russian nuclear plants,  the data will be transmitted to the Federal Republic via  satellite and fed into the German information system. The IRIS  metering network planned for Russia is based on the IMIS  integrated metering and information system in Germany. After  the Chernobyl reactor disaster, the BMU commissioned Dornier  GmbH to create the user software for the system in 1988.  <H5>  Radiation Metering System for Europe </H5>   IMIS is an early warning system designed to minimize  exposure  to radiation following incidents involving the release of  radioactivity. A program system that uses models to calculate  the level of contamination in the water, soil, and air has been  incorporated to assess the impact on the population. The  calculations are used in conjunction with a catalog of measures  from which the appropriate recommendations and instructions may  be derived. The system comprises the following main functions:    -- measurement of radioactivity in environmental samples;    -- monitoring of environmental radioactivity in the air,  soil, and water over large areas;    -- compilation, presentation, and assessment of  radioactivity  parameters;    -- dispatch of instructions and recommendations to the  authorities concerned, and    -- information exchange among the authorities responsible.    The methods of linking and coordinating different metering  facilities and networks devised for IMIS can be used for other  environment protection operations, primarily waterway monitoring  and soil conservation, as well.    Cross-border environmental problems call for information  technology solutions using supraregional systems. Being of a  decentralized nature, the integration of heterogeneous networks  run by different organizations constitutes an ideal model for an  integrated European environmental information system. IMIS  systems of this type are already undergoing trials in the Czech  and Slovak republics.</p>

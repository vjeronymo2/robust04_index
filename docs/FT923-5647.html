			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / US bank denies Indian claims BANK of America, the US bank, yesterday denied that it had issued or accepted fraudulent Bankers' Receipts, or that it had violated the Reserve Bank of India's guidelines, as suggested in an official report released on Tuesday. In the face of detailed allegations about its Indian operations, the US bank blamed 'the very real difficulties within the Indian financial system', and its 'manual processing methods' for implicating the foreign bank in the Bombay financial scandal. The Janakiraman report, the third in a series inquiring into the Rs35bn (Pounds 627m) securities scandal, alleges that the Bank of America's Indian operations 'not only avoided the discipline' of the central bank's guidelines on portfolio management schemes, but 'also violated the Reserve Bank's directives on rates of interest on deposits', and entered into 'dummy deals', which were 'squared off in their books'. The bank has denied these charges, and points out that the report's discussion of 'off the books' transactions 'is generally derived from Bank of America's official books'. The report alleges that the bank used customers' short-term funds for lending in the call money market, contravening Reserve Bank guidelines. It also claims the US bank had links with brokers involved in the scandal. The bank has denied this, saying it has not extended credit lines to any stockbroker in the Indian market. The report alleges the bank allowed 'credits of substantial amounts' to Mr Harshad Mehta, the key broker in the scandal. Yesterday a Bombay court rejected a bail petition from Mr Mehta and remanded him in custody for 12 days.</p>

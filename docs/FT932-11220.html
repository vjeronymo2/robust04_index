			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Modest profit at Micklegate Micklegate Group, the USM-quoted industrial and commercial property developer, returned to the black in the six months to October 31. The pre-tax figure of Pounds 87,000 compared with losses of Pounds 699,000 at the previous interim stage and Pounds 4.75m for the last full year. The outcome, achieved on turnover of Pounds 2.88m (Pounds 3.1m) was struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 151,000. After a nil tax charge, earnings per share emerged at 0.45p (losses of 1.92p). The group remains under a substantial debt burden and its future relies on the support of its bankers. Talks concerning a further restructuring of the debt are in progress.</p>

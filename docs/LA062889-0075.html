			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE /HERBERT J. VIDA: NURSING VETERAN MOUNTS A COLLECTION THAT MAY BE ONLY  ONE OF ITS KIND  </P> <P> In a nostalgic sort of way, Norma Grundy feels a closeness for her collection  of bedpans.  </P> <P> After all, she spent much of her life cleaning them.  </P> <P> "I came by it honestly because I'm a nurse," said the nursing director and  clinic administrator of the mental health division at the UC Irvine Student  Health Center. "You know, they're fun to look at."  </P> <P> They may be called bedpans by most people today, Grundy said, but those who  used them decades ago affectionately referred to them as "chamber pots,"  "thunder mugs" and "chambers of delight."  </P> <P> "In years past, a Frenchman would present one to his fiancee as a wedding  gift," said the Fountain Valley woman, who was the first nurse to work at the  university's health center when it opened in 1965. She has four children and  three grandchildren.  </P> <P> Times have changed and so have the shape and material of bedpans, said Grundy,  who points with pride to the 44 zinc, porcelain, stainless steel and tin  bedpans that hang on the wall of her small office.  </P> <P> She has decorated some of the older pans with silk flowers, small stuffed  animals and decoupage poems. One day, she said, she plans to put a clock in her  small, round, 1800s ceramic model from England.  </P> <P> "I have the most fantastic collection you can imagine," Grundy said. "It's fun  looking for them and adding them to the collection."  </P> <P> Grundy credits her father for starting the collection. But the display was  prompted by a colleague at UCI.  </P> <P> "One of the psychiatrists on the staff thought my office wasn't bright enough  and brought in an 18th-Century French chamber pot, and that started the office  decoration," she said.  </P> <P> And that collection, she jokingly contends, helps troubled students feel  they're not so bad off in today's society.  </P> <P> "When Chancellor Daniel Aldrich retired four years ago, we had a celebration  and all of us wore hospital gowns and body stockings and carried the bedpans. .  . . We used them for drums, and we won first place for the best costumes."  </P> <P> So well known is her collection in and outside the university that theater  groups throughout the county contact her to use the bedpans when they stage  Victorian plays.  </P> <P> "The collection just magically grew, and I don't know anyone else that collects  them."  </P> <P> Many of her bedpans have come from people who know of her collection. "I got  one from someone who was tearing down their house and found it in a closet, and  another from a student who saw it on top of a trash can," she said.  </P> <P> Grundy is having fun with her collection and claims to have the best job in the  world. But the 58-year-old woman also has her sights on the future. "One of  these days I would really like to join the Peace Corps and teach children how  to sing and teach mothers how to take care of their children." In 1973, she  served as the nurse on a World Campus Afloat cruise to the Pacific.  </P> <P> But the Peace Corps may be a few years away.  </P> <P> "I'm really having a lot of fun now and there's so many surprises in what I'm  doing. It's a good life," she said.  </P> <P> Gail Greer never thought her first trip to a weekend wine tasting in Temecula  would turn into a new life style.  </P> <P> But when the Costa Mesa woman retires next month as purchasing coordinator for  the Coast Community College District in Costa Mesa, she and her husband, Bruce  Greer, will return to Temecula as full-time residents and owners of a 10-acre  vineyard.  </P> <P> They bought their new home and vineyard a year ago and already are selling  their grapes to two of the 11 wineries in Temecula.  </P> <P> Both are members of the Orange County Wine Society and said they have had some  success making their own wine.  </P> <P> Does that mean they'll eventually open a winery? "I'm one of those people who  take one day at a time," she said.  </P> <P> Acknowledgments -- Saddleback High School graduate Douglas P. Enright, first  place math and science finisher in the 1988-89 Orange County Academic  Decathlon, was awarded a $1,000 scholarship from Hughes Aircraft Co. The Santa  Ana resident is the first to qualify for the new scholarship. Enright, 18, will  attend UCLA, where he plans to study applied mathematics.  </P></p>

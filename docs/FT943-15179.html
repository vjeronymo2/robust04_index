			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Why vegetarians will inherit the earth: America Within 50 years people who eat red meat or drink alcohol will be ostracised. At social gatherings they will be able to indulge in these unhealthy - nay, barbarous - habits only after seeking the express permission of their disdainful companions. The vegetarian, teetotal majority will have enacted stiff laws to regulate these dangerous substances and will be especially vigilant in protecting the young. Studies will have shown that most carnivores take up their bad habit in childhood, before they can appreciate the force of arguments against meat. You may dismiss this as a ridiculous fantasy. Yet who would have dreamt that US public sentiment could shift so decisively against cigarettes? For much of this century smoking was not merely socially acceptable: it was expected of anybody with pretensions to sophistication. Movie stars and models smoked. So did political leaders and financiers. It was de rigueur for intellectuals: how many writers, artists or musicians would have refused a cigarette in the 1950s? Yet today smokers in the US are a furtive, pitied minority, often to be found huddled near the entrances of buildings they dare not enter. Smoking is a vice of green youngsters - and of apologetic old-timers who lack the grit to kick the habit. It is already banned in military workplaces, in most public places, in aircraft and in many restaurants. It will probably soon be outlawed in all workplaces - except in designated rooms with independent ventilation. States are now suing tobacco companies to recoup the vast - and unnecessary - cost of treating smoking-related illnesses such as lung cancer and heart disease. The regulatory crackdown reflects changed public attitudes. People have turned against cigarettes because they are more health conscious than in the past and because they are more aware of the medical risks. The strength of the global anti-smoking movement depends largely on living standards and access to information. Not surprisingly, the US is in the vanguard, followed by western Europe; only in the developing world and former communist countries are cigarettes still seen as chic or desirable. Opinion seems likely to turn against meat and alcohol for similar reasons. The medical case against meat is damning. A recent study in the British Medical Journal indicated that vegetarians were 40 per cent less likely than meat eaters to die of cancer. This followed numerous previous studies linking meat consumption with other chronic illnesses. Far more people die of heart disease in the US and western Europe than in Asian countries, where beans, grains and fish form the staple diet. The reason should be obvious to any hamburger junkie: meat (especially beef) is saturated with harmful fat and cholesterol. Self-preservation is probably the strongest reason for abandoning meat; but it is supported by ethical and environmental arguments that seem certain to receive a more sympathetic hearing in coming decades. As moral beings, how can we defend the unnecessary slaughter of millions of animals, especially when eating their dead flesh can cause disease in us? The basis of morality is compassion or the desire to prevent suffering. Since it is hard to deny that cattle, pigs and lambs have a capacity to suffer, we are necessarily acting unethically when we eat them. Moreover, if the land now used for grazing were turned over to cereal, beans and vegetables, we could feed millions of starving people in the third world, at no net cost, while reducing damage to the environment. Alcohol may have more staying power than meat, because humans throughout history have sought an escape from reality. Many moderate drinkers will argue that a glass of wine or beer is positively good for their health. Perhaps. But a heavy price is paid for the social acceptability of this dangerous drug. Because alcohol is addictive, many people are not able to control their consumption. As they get older, they tend to drink more heavily, despite their reduced ability to absorb the drug. A surprising number of moderate drinkers thus end up as semi-alcoholics; the human cost in wrecked careers, smashed marriages and premature death or disablement is high. The statistics are quite disturbing. In the US alcohol is one of the leading causes of death, after heart disease and cancer (to which it contributes). Cirrhosis of the liver alone claims more than 26,000 lives a year. Some 50 per cent of fatal car crashes are alcohol related. Drinking is known to exacerbate many social problems - including violence on the streets and wife-battering in the home. Conservative estimates indicate the purely economic costs of alcohol abuse - in work days lost, premature deaths and medical expenses - exceed Dollars 100bn a year in the US. Lest there be any confusion, I do not support bans of any kind, except those (such as restrictions on smoking in the workplace) that aim to protect innocent parties. I am enough of a libertarian to believe that people should be free to seek pleasure as they see fit, even at the risk of killing themselves. Nor am I in favour of hair-shirts or puritanical philosophies of life. Public opinion has turned against cigarettes because people realise that, on balance, they reduce rather than increase the sum of human happiness. This is the spirit in which future generations will reject meat and alcohol. And, in case readers are curious, it is the spirit in which I have turned my back on these fleeting pleasures - at least for the time being.</p>

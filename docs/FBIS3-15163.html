			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev -- A direct phone-in between readers and the  Yevhen Marchuk, chairman of Ukraine's security service [SBU],  was held on 1 March in the editorial office of the MOLOD  UKRAYINY newspaper. Afterward, Marchuk said in particular  during an interview with journalists that the situation in  Crimea would have been much more complex if "certain actions"  had not been taken. "The problem of Crimea and of  regionalization as a whole is one of those kind of threats which  is of prime importance to Ukraine, owing to economic,  historical, and other reasons," Yevhen Marchuk said.    He is also convinced that there are no grounds for  dramatizing the situation, since Ukraine has the force to  prevent the development of events similar to those in  Yugoslavia. The head of the SBU is convinced that only the  strategic internal policy of the Ukrainian leadership in its  attitude not only toward Crimea but also toward other regions,  in particular the Donbass, Transcarpathia, and Bukovina, could  speedily neutralize a threat to the decentraliztion of the  state.    In an interview with a UNIAN correspondent, Yevhen Marchuk  confirmed that he had a meeting last week with people from  Yevhen Saburov's entourage, who had been invited by Yuriy  Meshkov to take up the post of vice premier of Crimea. The SBU  head declined to comment on the subject discussed.    Yevhen Marchuk also said that the security service has  information ("details, personalities, names and numbers") about  the fact that foreign structures are attempting to interfere in  Ukraine's election campaign, "beside our own native criminal  capital." In his words, the security service will make use of  its entire mechanism to uncover such facts.    In reply to a question from a UNIAN correspondent about how  the SBU intends to counteract such manifestations, Yevhen  Marchuk said: "This will be done with specific state of the art  methods until evidence is gathered. Only then will we publicly  reveal such facts." Yevhen Marchuk gave assurances that "the  SBU would pass some information on certain parliamentary  candidates to the Central Electoral Commission and leaders of  political parties on whose behalf these candidates are running."  He stressed that they "are talking about specific facts and  cases rather than interference by the security services in the  election campaign."</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: TCI moves back into the black Tele-Communications Inc, the biggest US cable TV operator, moved back into profit in the third quarter, helped by a contribution from Liberty Media, with which it merged in August, writes Tony Jackson in New York. On sales up 23 per cent at Dollars 1.29bn, TCI suffered a 21 per cent fall in operating profit to Dollars 186m. However, after a Dollars 101m contribution from Liberty and sharply lower tax, it made a net profit of 4 cents a share, compared with a 14 cents loss. TCI said basic service customers had risen by 5.1 per cent over the past 12 months to 11.3m. However, cable companies' profits have been hit this year by government-imposed reductions in cable rates. TCI is withdrawing a planned Dollars 500m offering of preferred stock, due to difficult equity market conditions.</p>

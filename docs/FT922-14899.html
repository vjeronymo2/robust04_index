			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Slight fall in underlying reserves BRITAIN'S gold and foreign currency reserves fell by an underlying Dollars 7m last month, indicating that there was no need for the Bank of England to support sterling in the European exchange rate mechanism. The Treasury announced that the overall level of reserves fell in March by Dollars 445m to Dollars 44.31bn, largely because of repayments of Dollars 437m of borrowings under the exchange cover scheme. The reserves were revalued to Dollars 45.027bn at the end of last month to reflect changes in the price of gold and non-dollar currencies during the 1991-92 financial year. The slight decrease in the underlying reserves was calculated after the deduction of Dollars 67m for gold returned by Britain to the central banks of Lithuania and Estonia and the receipt of Dollars 14m in contributions from non-combatant countries to Britain's costs in last year's Gulf war. Without these exceptional transactions the underlying reserves would have risen by Dollars 46m.</p>

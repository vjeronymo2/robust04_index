			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt climbs 1.7% on zero growth warning THE THIRD quarter results season was well under way, but Frankfurt preferred to second-guess the Bundesbank once again, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT heard chilling economic news at the weekend; yet it took the DAX index up by 34.10, or 1.7 per cent to 2,049.11. Turnover leapt from DM6.7bn to DM9.7bn. Mr Horst-Kaspar Greven, an institutional adviser at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, said that hopes for further interest rate cuts were raised by the forecast of zero West German growth in 1994 by Germany's 'five wise men', the government's independent economic advisers. However, he said, this also weakened the other leg of the German equity scenario, which would involve the beginnings of corporate earnings recovery from the middle of 1994. Two of yesterday's best performers, Mannesmann and Thyssen, were losing money at the moment, he said. Mannesmann, up DM13.40 to DM369.80, had accumulated a gain of DM30.10 over the past five trading days. Yesterday saw a big US buy order and one dealer said that reports of a forthcoming telecommunications link between AT&amp;T, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom had excited fans of Mannesmann's telecoms offshoot. In financials, Bayerische Vereinsbank rose DM18, or DM3.5 per cent to DM527 following an analysts meeting late last week, while AMB dropped DM45 to DM1,405 for a two-day drop of DM95 from last week's speculative peak. PARIS saw a spate of nine-month figures as the CAC-40 index rose 21.05, or 1 per cent to 2,117.90, short of its day's high of 2,128. Analysts said that the market took its main encouragement from a number of external factors, including strength in Germany and hopes that trade talks will be boosted by an agreement on Nafta later in the week. Rhone Poulenc was up FFr3.40 at FFr153.60 ahead of a government announcement on privatisation details after the close. Among those releasing turnover figures, Bouygues added FFr4 to FFr655 on a small fall in the numbers. AMSTERDAM remained strong with VNU showing one of the day's biggest gains, but in small volume. The publisher's shares gained Fl 6.50 to Fl 158.00, just off their all time high of Fl 158.20 as the CBS Tendency index added 2.5, or 1.8 per cent to 137.9. Unilever recovered some of last week's losses on its third quarter figures, closing a net 62 cents higher at Fl 212.10, ex a Fl 1.48 interim dividend. After reflection, some analysts have returned fairly positive comments on the group. Hoare Govett, in sticking to its buy recommendation, noted that while the headline figures may have been unsatisfactory, the 'underlying picture' remained good. ZURICH found interest in corporate developments but the SMI index eased 3.7 to 2,717.4. CS Holding added SFr45 to SFr3,425 on a share split, and its offer for Leu Holding, the private banking group. Leu firmed SFr98 or 16.6 per cent to SFr690. BK Vision, which invests in shares of leading Swiss banks and insurers, rose SFr80 or 4.7 per cent to SFr1,770 after it sold its Leu shares to CS Holding. Alusuisse, planning to buy Canada's Lawson Mardon group packaging company, fell SFr15 to SFr515. Holderbank, the cement producer which found strong demand last week, saw profit-taking as its forecast of a 3.9 per cent rise in current year profits proved at the bottom end of expectations. The shares dipped SFr11 to SFr859. MILAN was inhibited by today's end of the monthly account and the Comit index eased 0.90 to 545.42. Fiat rose to an early L3,748 before easing to finish L19 lower at L3,609. Pirelli, firmly denying market rumours that it planned a rights issue, picked up L39 of last week's losses to finish at L1,775. BCI, forecasting a net profit for the current year as it launched its privatisation prospectus, added L36 to L2,253. MADRID responded to third quarter results as the general index closed 0.85 higher at 300.89 in turnover of some Pta19.5bn. In banks, a small reduction in nine-month profits left Central Hispano Pta50 lower at Pta3,595 while in motors, quintupled losses at Nissan Iberica left it Pta28, or 14.6 per cent down at Pta164. Pryca, the supermarket retailer, rose Pta45 to Pta1,425. Its figures, incorporating a 15 per cent gain in profits, came in after hours but Ms Alexandra Perricone at James Capel thought that after a period of share price weakness, the market would be satisfied with this performance. ISTANBUL gained 4 per cent helped by easier money market rates and a calmer political situation. The composite index was up 610.7 at 15,788.5. Investors were also encouraged by news that the government intends to push ahead with privatisation plans after the forthcoming party congress.

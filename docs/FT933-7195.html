			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / A contrary view on healthcare: America One of the few spheres of life in which proponents of free markets have suffered a devastating defeat is healthcare. After 50 years of quasi or fully socialised medicine in most of the industrialised world, economists are nearly united in believing that the normal laws of supply and demand cannot and should not be allowed to function (doctors and lay observers, of course, have always taken this for granted). To control costs and ensure fair access to care, governments (or their agents) must supervise the provision and the financing of care, if not actually own hospitals and pay for them with taxes. Nothing supposedly shows more clearly the folly of relying on the private sector than the US's chronic problems. The one rich country that tried to buck the trend toward socialised medicine isconfronting a large uninsured population (37m people lack easy access to care) and uncontrollable pressure for higher spending (healthcare absorbs 14 per cent of national income, against 7-8 per cent in other rich countries.) The surprise is thus not that the Clinton administration is attempting to extend the role of federal government but that this was delayed for so long. This conventional wisdom is so well entrenched that it is refreshing to see the opposite point of view argued with clarity and commitment. In Patient Power: Solving America's Health Care Crisis*, economists John Goodman and Gerald Musgrave first try to dispose of the argument that US experience has proven the inadequacy of free markets. Nothing, they claim, could be further from a real market than the US system in which nearly all healthcare is financed by employers or the government. Consumer preferences determine neither the overall level of spending nor the allocation of resources between different types of treatment; the system is as paternalistic as any in Europe while lacking any semblance of cost controls. The solution, according to Goodman and Musgrave, lies in abandoning the belief that healthcare is 'different.' It is ludicrous, they say, to argue that individuals lack the knowledge to make wise decisions; the same could be said of many other fields, such as finance, where the products are highly complex. And a glance at the way medicine really operates shows that all involved are just as self-interested as in supposedly more commercial spheres. The challenge is to direct self-interest in socially useful directions and to give the 'experts' an incentive to use their knowledge for the benefit of the consumer. Dismissing the Clinton strategy, which involves an extension of employers' responsibilities, Goodman and Musgrave advocate putting individuals in the healthcare driving seat. The first step would be to replace the large tax incentives (worth Dollars 60bn (Pounds 43bn) a year) for employer health schemes with a modest tax credit claimable only by individuals. Companies that persisted in providing health insurance would have to include the benefit as part of gross wages and give employees the option of taking this benefit in cash. The result would be a rapid growth in personal health insurance, although most people would probably opt to join large, managed care groups. But the link between health insurance and employment would be broken. The second step would be to promote personal saving for health expenses as an alternative to private insurance and government welfare. Individuals would receive tax relief only for 'catastrophic' health insurance - cover for relatively improbable but potentially very expensive care, such as open heart surgery. Catastrophic insurance tends to be much cheaper than policies that also cover every minor ailment. All routine low-cost care (up to, say, Dollars 2,000 a year) would be paid for out of savings. To make this possible the government would give employees (and employers) tax incentives to build up 'medisave' accounts. These would reduce health spending in two ways. First individuals would have an incentive to economise since any unspent cash in medisave accounts would form part of their personal wealth. Also, most health bills would be paid out of pocket, thus greatly reducing administrative costs. Government would have a drastically reduced role. Rather than setting up special programmes for the poor, it would restrict itself to providing direct financial support to individuals to enable them to buy the insurance they need. The level of support would depend on health needs as well as income, reflecting the higher cost of insurance policies for people who have (or have had) serious illnesses. There is no chance that such policies will be tried in the near future. But as technology advances, increasing the range and cost of potential treatments, the 'one size fits all' health policies championed by many governments may come under increasing pressure. Individual preferences (which vary a great deal) surely ought to determine crucial trade offs - for example between spending on consumption today and on extremely expensive medical treatment to prolong life by a few months. Yet such rational decision making could occur only in an individualised, truly market-oriented system such as that outlined by Goodman and Musgrave. *Published by the Cato Institute, 1000 Mass Av, Washington DC. 20001.</p>

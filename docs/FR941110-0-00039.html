			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 1819(g)(5)(B) and 1919(g)(5)(B) of the Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require State survey agencies to notify the State's long-term care ombudsman of any adverse actions imposed against a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility. We proposed at 488.175(e) that the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey agency be required to provide the State's long-term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care ombudsman with the report of noncompliance of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility, report of any adverse actions imposed, any written  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response by the SNF or NF, and the results of any appeals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of sections 4008(h)(2)(E) and 4801(e)(5)(D)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of OBRA '90, sections 1819(b)(4)(C)(ii)(IV) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1919(b)(4)(C)(ii)(IV) of the Act require the Secretary and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State, respectively, to provide notice to the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> long-term care ombudsman and the State protection and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advocacy system for the mentally ill and mentally retarded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of SNF and NF waivers. Sections 1819(b)(4)(C)(ii)(V) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1919(b)(4)(C)(ii)(V), as added by OBRA '90, require the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility receiving such nursing waivers to notify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents of the facility (or, when appropriate, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guardians or legal representatives of such residents) and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resident's immediate family of the waiver. We proposed, at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 488.175 (f) and (g), that facilities give this notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within 10 days from the date the SNF or NF is granted the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waiver.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under sections 1819(g)(5)(C) and 1919(g)(5)(C) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act, the State is required to notify each attending  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physician and the State board responsible for licensing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nursing home administrators when a facility has provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substandard quality of care. We proposed requiring each SNF  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or NF to provide either HCFA or the State, no later than 10  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days after receiving a notice of substandard care, with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> list of each Medicare and Medicaid resident in the facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the name and address of his or her attending physician.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also proposed at &sect;488.175 requiring the State to notify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the attending physicians and the State licensing board  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within 30 days of the date the SNF or NF is notified of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finding of substandard care. We recognized that this and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the notification requirement related to nurse waivers were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the only provisions in our proposed regulation which set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forth requirements for nursing homes. All other provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the proposed rule set forth requirements for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary and the State in the enforcement of nursing homes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. We included these facility requirements in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed rule because they directly or indirectly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pertain to the enforcement process. The same sections of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act also required the State survey agency to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> access to any information incidental to a facility's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation in Medicare or Medicaid upon request by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State Medicaid fraud control unit established under 42 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part 1002, subpart C. We proposed incorporating this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision under paragraph (j) of &sect;488.175.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> J. Enforcement Options  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Overview  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated earlier, before the passage of OBRA '87, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only adverse actions available to HCFA and the States for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposition against long term care facilities that were out  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of compliance with Federal requirements were termination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation, nonrenewal and automatic cancellation, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> denial of participation for prospective providers. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, HCFA and the States had authority, in cases of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> long-term care facilities, to deny payment for new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> admissions to facilities rather than to terminate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider agreements when deficiencies did not present an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediate and serious threat to the health and safety of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents of the facilities. The denial of payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision was considered both an alternative to the more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> severe measures, as well as an intermediate step that HCFA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or the State could take prior to and possibly in lieu of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanction afforded HCFA and the States the opportunity to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defer the decision to terminate. Thus, the terms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``alternative sanction'' and ``intermediate sanction'' came into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use to designate denial of payment for new admissions to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities for a period of up to 11 months after the month  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in which the sanction was imposed. Former sections 1866(f)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 1902(i) of the Act were the authority for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative sanction under Medicare and Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respectively. The Family Support Act of 1988, Public Law  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 100&hyph;345, repealed the Medicare provision and MCCA made the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid provision applicable only to ICFs/MR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

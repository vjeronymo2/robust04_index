			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Rifkind is cautious on military role MR MALCOLM RIFKIND, the defence secretary, yesterday said that the UK should not commit military forces to international peace enforcement operations where there was no military solution but merely public clamour for 'something to be done.' Referring to demands for greater international military involvement in the Bosnian conflict, Mr Rifkind said: 'It is our servicemen who have to bear the risk, not those who call for their deployment.' His speech to the Royal United Services Institute was highlighted by Downing Street as a clear statement of the government's thinking at a time when anxiety has risen markedly at Westminster over the extent of Britain's military commitments overseas. At the same time, however, senior officials confirmed that Britain expected to be asked to contribute to a 3,500-strong United Nations force for the Kuwait-Iraq border and anticipated a formal request from the Kuwaitis to provide defence forces. While it was hinted that the request from Kuwait would be considered sympathetically, there remain reservations over whether Britain should also supply personnel to the UN Gulf peacekeeping force. Mr Rifkind spelt out his criteria behind the deployment of the armed forces. 'We should not put them into danger unless we are satisfied that there is a real military task for them to do, a realistic prospect of their achieving it and a degree of risk to their physical safety which is not unacceptably high,' he said. Governments had to be careful about assuming that military action was, in all cases, the answer to serious international crises. From time to time the UK would have to stand out publicly against the use of force and decline to contribute to international military operations because they entailed 'open-ended commitments' or were not in the national interest. The UK had consistently refused to commit ground forces in Bosnia 'in an intervention role', as distinct from a humanitarian role, for such reasons, the defence secretary said. But he stressed that any attempts to fly combat planes by the warring factions would be viewed with 'the same seriousness' as in Iraq. It was 'highly desirable' the no-fly zone over Bosnia should be enforced, he said. Because of the limited availability of forces, Britain should press for 'explicit time limits' to be placed on peacekeeping operations. Failing that, limits should be set on the period for which any one country should commit forces to the UN for a particular operation.</p>

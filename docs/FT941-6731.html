			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Fiat workers back deal to save jobs Works councils at Fiat's Italian vehicle plants have overwhelmingly endorsed a complex government-sponsored agreement avoiding large-scale job losses. The deal directly affects 16,000 of Fiat's 95,000 vehicle workforce and was brokered by Mr Gini Giugni, the labour minister, between the Fiat management and union leaders last Monday. The Fiom, the main engineering union, insisted the agreement be put to a shop-floor vote because Fiat's plans to cut its workforce by more than 5 per cent and lay off a further 10 per cent had provoked serious unrest in the previous three weeks. Although less than 60 per cent of the workforce voted, almost 90 per cent favoured the deal in most plants. The closest vote was at Alfa's Arese plant outside Milan, believed by the unions to be threatened with closure. Here, 55 per cent accepted the agreement. The high numbers in favour suggested that employees previously threatened with job losses or up to two years laid off (and with an uncertain future after that) opted for a generous package of work sharing and early retirement. The more militant among the unions rejected the deal because they said it funded job cuts at Fiat without any clear future industrial strategy. The deal is based round four points: early retirement for 6,600 workers and staff; 'solidarity contracts' covering some 3,500 jobs and affecting 8.700 people, involving a shorter working week, salary cuts and job sharing; government subsidised retraining and job hunting for 2,200; and the commitment to spend up to L450bn (Pounds 182m) on the development of a clean car. According to the latest estimates of the labour ministry, the agreement will cost some L310bn more than the original package of job pruning measures proposed by Fiat last November. Of this L220bn will cover early retirement, split jointly between the government and Fiat. A further L90bn covers the solidarity contracts over the next three years. The funds earmarked for the development of a clean car include over L300bn for an electric car. These funds were already in the ministry of science budget. Put together the overall cost of achieving labour peace at Fiat and allowing the Turin-based group the means to fight the recession in the automotive business over the next three years comes close L900bn. This figure also excludes the cost to the social security budget of 4,100 persons to be covered by temporary lay-offs until 1996. With unemployment still rising it is extremely doubtful whether the next government can afford to be so generous in offsetting job losses. Over the weekend, Prof Mario Monti, one Italy's leading economists, was highly critical of the Fiat package.</p>

			<p>940722 FT  22 JUL 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Turned on to description TV UK broadcasters are launching a trial of a system which will make television programmes more accessible to people with sight problems. Over the next four months, a number of programmes on ITV and the BBC will be broadcast with a data signal carrying an audio commentary describing what happens in the programme during gaps in the dialogue. The Audetel system uses set-top receivers which transmit the commentary through headphones or a loudspeaker. The system was primarily developed to give people with sight problems greater access to television but it is also intended to appeal to other viewers who want to follow a programme while doing something else. The system has been developed by a consortium including the Age &amp; Cognitive Research Centre at Manchester University, BBC, ITC, ITV Association, Motorola and the Royal National Institute for the Blind.

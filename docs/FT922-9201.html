			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Rover sales drop by 9.6% ROVER, the vehicle subsidiary of British Aerospace, suffered a further sharp fall in UK sales of new cars in April in sharp contrast to the overall increase in UK new car demand, Kevin Done writes. Rover's sales volume last month fell year-on-year by 9.6 per cent to 15,854 compared with a 9.1 per cent jump in the overall market. Its market share last month plunged to only 11.5 per cent from 13.9 per cent a year ago. For the first four months, it remained narrowly in fourth place in the UK new car sales league behind Ford; Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US; and the Peugeot group of France, which includes Citroen. In the first four months Rover's sales, at 64,420, were 27.7 per cent lower than a year before. Its market share in the first few months plunged to only 11.8 per cent from 15.3 per cent in the same period a year ago. Ford, the UK new car market leader, again achieved a late surge in registrations in the final days of the month. It logged 38.2 per cent of its total April registrations in the last five days of the month. In the first four months this year the carmakers that gained most ground were Renault, Peugeot and BMW.</p>

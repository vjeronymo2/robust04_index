The annual percentage yield shows the total amount of dividends on an assumed principal amount as a percentage of the principal, based on the dividend rate and frequency of compounding for a 365 day period (for accounts such as share or share draft accounts) or for the term of the account for term share accounts. The annual percentage yield assumes the principal amount remains in the account for 365 days or for the term of the account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> How Annual Percentage Yield differs from Annual Percentage Yield Earned.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The annual percentage yield (APY) differs from the annual percentage yield earned (APYE). The annual percentage yield earned is required for periodic statements only. The annual percentage yield earned shows the total amount of dividends earned for the dividend or statement period as a percent of the actual average daily balance in the member's account. Unlike the annual percentage yield, the annual percentage yield earned is affected by additions and withdrawals during the period. The annual percentage yield and the annual percentage yield earned must be calculated according to the formulas provided in Appendix A to this rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> (d) Average Daily Balance Method. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> General.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> One of the two required methods (the daily balance is the other) of determining the balance upon which dividends must be paid. The average daily balance method requires the application of a periodic rate to the average daily balance in the account for the average daily balance calculation period. The average daily balance is determined by adding the full amount of principal in the account for each day of the period and dividing that figure by the number of days in the period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> (e) Board. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> General.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The NCUA Board. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> (f) Bonus. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> General.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Bonuses include items of value offered as incentives to members, such as an offer to pay the final installment deposit for a holiday club account. Bonuses do not include the payment of dividends (including extraordinary dividends), the waiver of reduction of a fee, the absorption of expenses, non-dividend membership benefits, or other consideration aggregating $10 or less per year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Examples.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The following are examples of bonuses. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 -->  A credit union offers $25 to potential members for becoming a member and opening an account. The $25 could be provided by check, cash, or direct deposit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  A credit union offers $25 to a member with only a regular share account to open a share draft account. The $25 could be provided by check, cash, or direct deposit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  A credit union offers a portable radio with a value of $20 to members and potential members for opening a share draft account. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The following are examples of items that are  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  bonuses: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> Discount coupons distributed by credit unions for use at restaurants or stores. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  A credit union offers $25 to a parent or custodian if the parent or custodian opens an account for a minor. The $25 is not a bonus because the parent or custodian is not opening the account in his or her own name. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  A credit union offers $20 to any member if the member is responsible for convincing a potential member to open an account. The $20 is not a bonus because the $20 is not paid to the individual opening the account. Any item, including cash, given or offered to a third party in exchange for a member or potential member opening (or a member renewing or adding to) an account is not a bonus. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  A credit union offers $25 to a member if the member if the member can locate his name in the body of a newsletter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Life savings benefits. Many credit unions offer life savings benefits to beneficiaries of deceased members. Because the benefit accrues to a third party, such life savings plans offered are not bonuses. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> De minimis rule.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Items with a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> value of $10 or less are not bonuses. Credit Unions may rely on the valuation standard used by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to determine if the value of the item is  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> de minimus.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (See 26 CFR &sect;1.6049&hyph;5(a)(2), which discusses the fair market value of property received.)

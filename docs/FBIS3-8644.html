			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A NATO delegation, led by Assistant Secretary  General for Political Affairs Count Gebhard von Moltke, is  paying a one-day visit to Slovenia today. Prime Minister Dr.  Janez Drnovsek was the first to greet the guests in Bled. They  met with Defense Minister Janez Jansa and Foreign Ministry Under  Secretary Ignac Golob in Ljubljana. Tomaz Gerden has more  details:    [Begin recording] [Gerden] Following the talks in Villa  Podroznik, Count Von Moltke was the first to give a brief  statement:    [Von Moltke, in English fading into translation by Gerden] I  am very pleased that NATO has the opportunity to cooperate with  Slovenia within Partnership for Peace. This plan initially  pooled former Warsaw Pact countries, which are members of the  NATO Cooperation Council. Partnership for Peace aims to  strengthen stability in Europe and cooperation between NATO and  other countries in peace initiatives within the United Nations  and the CSCE.    The NATO delegation discussed details of Partnership for  Peace with our representatives. The initiative will be  officially signed by Prime Minister Dr. Drnovsek in Brussels on  30 March. He said the following about today's talks:    [Drnovsek] Today's visit is dedicated to the preparations  for this signing, as well as the concrete activities that will  ensue--joint planning with NATO, preparation of cadres, and  exchange of opinions on the security situation. I believe that  everything is progressing well, that Slovenia is being treated  very seriously as a NATO partner, and that there is a belief on  both sides that we will develop a partnership very quickly.    [Gerden] Dr. Drnovsek believes that neutral countries like  Switzerland and Sweden will also join Partnership for Peace soon  and that our country is in no way in any worse position than the  members that have already been admitted.    Defense Minister Janez Jansa assessed the Partnership for  Peace plan as follows:    [Jansa] From a security viewpoint, membership in Partnership  for Peace for Slovenia is almost as equally important as  international recognition. This represents a starting point for  us, the beginning of a road, at the end of which is the greatest  possible security that a country can obtain in a family of  like-minded states.    This is particularly important because geographically,  Slovenia on one side borders a relatively solid region of  stability and on the other side, a region of instability.  Membership in Partnership for Peace will allow us to strengthen  relations with the part of Europe that represents a factor of  stability, which is, of course, a precondition for any sort of  social and economic development.    [Gerden] The NATO delegation was also received by President  Milan Kucan. The delegation also met with the ambassadors of  NATO member states. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Laos has put on hold plans to cooperate with the United States against drug  trafficking because of a U.S. report accusing Laotian government officials of  involvement in the drug trade, Deputy Foreign Minister Souban Salitthilat said  in Vientiane. "We were absolutely stunned and surprised at the American  government report (issued March 1)," Souban said. Before the report, he said,  Laos had been prepared to discuss direct U.S. aid and to send officials to the  United States for anti-drug training. Under U.S. law, the negative report means  that Laos cannot receive direct bilateral aid.  </P></p>

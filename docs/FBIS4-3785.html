			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhu Yuquan (2612 3768 3123)] </F>   [Text] Tianjin, 2 Apr (XINHUA) -- During an inspection of  Tianjin's experimentation with comprehensive coordinated reform  in the city, Li Tieying, member of the CPC Central Committee  Political Bureau and state councillor and concurrently minister  in charge of the State Economic Restructuring Commission,  pointed out: Key economic cities should proceed from the local  conditions, seize the opportunity, and make the most of their  strengths to deepen reform, open up wider, and promote  development.    He said: This year will be a crucial year for China's  economic structural reform. State-launched reforms of the  financial, banking, taxation, foreign exchange, and foreign  trade systems have proceeded smoothly. As long as we firmly  grasp the overall interests of "seizing the opportunity,  deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and  maintaining stability," and as long as we translate the  guideline of "combining comprehensive coordinated reform with  breakthroughs in key areas" into concrete actions, we will  surely be able to smoothly achieve the various reform targets  this year. In the course of implementation, all localities  should pay attention to the following four areas:    1) It is necessary to ensure the smooth implementation of  various reform programs introduced by the central authorities by  subordinating local to national interests and working hard to  gradually establish a socialist market economic system; 2) It is  necessary to go all-out to change the operating mechanisms of  enterprises to gradually establish a modern enterprise system;  3) It is necessary, in line with the spirit of the "decision"  adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee, to earnestly implement the reform of macroeconomic  regulation and control formulated by the central authorities  under unified plans, and to study and formulate other reforms in  light of the realities of each locality to facilitate sustained,  rapid, and healthy economic development; 4) It is necessary to  properly handle the relationship between reform, development,  and stability.    On 31 March and 1 April, Li Tieying and Vice Minister He  Guanghui of the State Economic Restructuring Commission  inspected the Tianjin Stock Exchange, the Lisheng Pharmaceutical  Plant, and the Lida Group International Emporium in the company  of Tianjin party Secretary Gao Dezhan and Mayor Zhang Lichang,  and they heard briefings by the municipal party committee and  the municipal government on Tianjin's experimentation with  comprehensive coordinated reform.    After hearing the briefings, Li Tieying said: Following the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the  Tianjin municipal party committee and government took the  initiative to explore ways to establish a socialist market  economic system, and they put forward a number of pilot projects  for comprehensive coordinated reform. They have attached great  importance to the pilot projects, thus fostering sound ideas and  adopting effective measures in formulating and implementing  pilot and special projects. After seriously studying Tianjin's  pilot projects, the State Economic Restructuring Commission and  other relevant State Council departments on 15 January 1994  approved Tianjin as the city designated by the state for  experimenting with the comprehensive coordinated reform of the  economic structure. As one of China's three municipalities  directly under the central government, Tianjin is the economic  center of the Bohai Rim economic zone, as well as a major  economic, trade, and port city in northern China. The  municipality's reform and development have a vital bearing on  the country as a whole.    Discussing areas to which Tianjing as a key economic city  must pay close attention in the next-phase reform, Li Tieying  said: First, it is necessary to accelerate the pace of  readjusting the structure of industries and to energetically  develop tertiary industry, which is very important for bringing  into play the key economic city's functions. An underdeveloped  tertiary industry will inevitably make the municipality  dependent on industrial enterprises for financial revenues and  aggravate the predicament of enterprises, while a developed  tertiary industry can provide the municipality with more  financial revenues and give old enterprises a chance to  recuperate and build up their strength. Second, it is necessary  to cultivate new economic growth points. In seeking  development, village and township enterprises should implement a  shareholding cooperative system, and a small number of qualified  enterprises may try out stock systems. This will be a general  trend of economic development. The expansion of nonstate  economic sectors is an objective demand of the socialist market  economy. Therefore, we should encourage the healthy development  of individual, privately owned, and foreign-funded economic  sectors. Third, it is necessary to attach importance to  maintaining and increasing the value of state-owned assets, and  to readjusting the structure of state-owned assets. The  transaction of property rights of state-owned enterprises is  essential for invigorating the state sector of the economy.  However, the transaction must be conducted according to  standards and must avoid the losses of state-owned assets during  the entire process from the assessment of assets to the transfer  of property rights. The transfer of state-owned enterprises'  property rights should be approved by the investment  organization authorized by the state, while the transfer of  property rights of enterprises owned by the central government  should be approved by the investment organization designated by  the central government. A government system of assessing assets  and approving the transfer of property rights in accordance with  the principle of unified state ownership and supervision by  governments at different levels should be established to avoid  confusion.</p>

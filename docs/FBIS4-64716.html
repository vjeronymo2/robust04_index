			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Stefano Marroni: "Achille's Challenge: `They </F> Want To Overthrow Me, But I Will Not Go"]    [Text] Rome -- Two weeks have been enough. A handful of  days have been enough to bring about the collapse of the  official truth proclaimed from Botteghe Oscure's [headquarters  of the Democratic Party of the Left, PDS] second floor, i.e.,  [PDS Secretary] Achille Occhetto's words emphatically uttered  before the PDS's top brass: "My leadership is not being called  into question." It was only 20 April then, but it feels as if  centuries have gone by, following a succession of interviews and  opinion polls, moves and countermoves, coded signals, and drops  of poison, which are daily racking the party's nerves. Today it  was the "leader of the turn" who unveiled his views by saying --  in the course of a long interview with L'UNITA -- that the issue  is an open one, although it will not be easy to solve it  because, as Occhetto has made it clear, he has no intention of  stepping down -- except after a tough political battle.    The secretary's decision to take a hard line -- explaining  that a change of leadership would be suicidal, and sending out a  message which, in the words of someone outside politics, could  be translated as "I am up here, try to get me if you can" --  matured somewhat unexpectedly. It matured precisely on the day  when [PDS Deputy Secretary] Massimo D'Alema's expected return to  the PDS secretariat was announced officially -- the same day  that a lengthy discussion took place at Botteghe Oscure about a  long article in IL MESSAGGERO, which, in suggesting that  [L'UNITA chief editor] Veltroni's possible election was part of  a "secret plan" devised by Occhetto against D'Alema, gave many  people the impression that it was an attempt to torpedo the  candidacy of L'UNITA's chief editor (which the interested party  himself denied yesterday in very harsh tones).    This, then, was the reason for Occhetto's statement: the  newspapers. L'UNITA "Occhettologue" Alberto Leiss described a  secretary who "did not conceal his deep concern," the "difficult  moment" experienced by a man who "has no intention of letting  himself be pushed aside" only because people like Salvati or  Cacciari were openly speaking of this possibility in the  newspapers. However, although apparently replying to such  people, Occhetto was in fact addressing the PDS itself, saying  that "while, on the Right, bellicose leaders were emerging who  are eager to concentrate enormous power in their hands, we are  falling into the trap of destabilizing the leadership of the  sole force which, albeit in defeat, has shown any vitality and  consistency. I believe that this attitude," the secretary  stressed, "is tantamount to hara-kiri."    This was an open challenge, followed by the emphatic  assertion that the leadership issue could only be settled on the  political level. The "anticommunist condition" set by Salvati  and Cacciari is "even somewhat foolhardy, and, in a pinch,"  Occhetto added ironically, "accepting it might enable me to  remain secretary for who knows how long."    Faced with Occhetto's clinging to his post as secretary,  Leiss was looking for reasons, and found them. So Occhetto  stays -- he asked -- and that is the end of the matter? Or is  it true that you will resign after the European elections so as  to keep D'Alema out by means of Veltroni? No, Occhetto replied,  there is no plan, other than that of "bogging down the PDS over  the issue of the leadership and the so-called internal  struggles." The real issue is a different one, the PDS leader  warned, namely, that there are only two ways of replacing the  secretary. If the problem is posed in terms of a simple  "turnover," he emphasized, "say so openly and, after the  European elections, I will have no objection to stepping down,"  so as to prevent the congress from being reduced to a "petty  power struggle," to the scene for "personal confrontations at  the top." However -- Occhetto went on to say -- if someone at  the congress wishes to move toward a political confrontation,  "submitting an alternative motion and linking his own candidacy  to the latter, let him do so: This is the only democratic way  to solve the leadership issue."    The outlined path is really unprecedented for a former  communist party. At the same time, it is an open challenge, as  it faces anyone contemplating the replacement of the PDS  leadership with the choice between appearing to be motivated by  personal ambition, or, alternatively, confronting the  uncertainties -- and the disruption, and the paralysis -- of a  vote count, down to the last vote.    Essentially, without ever calling a spade a spade, Occhetto  was flatly saying "no" to the role of "transition guarantor"  which D'Alema had suggested to him, and was casting the  suspicion of a negotiated co-opting procedure on the Veltroni  option, thus depriving it of any "novelty." This scenario can  be expected to give rise to serious tensions at PDS headquarters  within the next few days, on the eve of the new distribution of  responsibilities which, to a great extent, hinges on the  "Gallipoli deputy" and L'UNITA's chief editor's return to the  secretariat.    Within the PDS, the scuttlebutt is now suggesting that next  week Occhetto will name the secretariat's coordinator(s), and  casting some doubt on the reappointment of Davide Visani, who is  still recovering from health problems. What the political  framework will be, however, it is as yet difficult to say, until  we know the results of the European elections, among other  reasons because, from the grassroots -- and with some  considerable support from the guarantee commission -- the  request is being put forward to vote for the party's leaders one  by one, with an open list.</p>

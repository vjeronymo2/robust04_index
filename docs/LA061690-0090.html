			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOORPARK;  </P> <P> $9.8-MILLION BUDGET ADDS 6 POSITIONS  </P> <P> Moorpark city officials have unveiled a $9.8-million budget that adds six staff  positions and an increase for recreational activities.  </P> <P> The new positions include a public works director, solid-waste coordinator,  code enforcement officer, two maintenance trainees and a part-time recreation  coordinator, City Manager Steven Kueny said.  </P> <P> The recreation coordinator will manage special events and recreational  programs. About $63,000 has been requested by the city's Park and Recreation  Commission for special events.  </P> <P> Overall spending is up about 5.4% compared with last year, Kueny said.  </P> <P> The City Council has reviewed the budget and will vote on it Wednesday.  </P> <P> The city is collecting more in property and sales taxes than ever before,  mostly because of development of residential and commercial property, Kueny  said. Last year alone, Moorpark grew by about 4.2%, or 1,059 people.  </P> <P> Part of the 7.9% increase in general fund revenues comes from the $321,277 in  property taxes that were collected last year over the limits established by the  Gann initiative.  </P> <P> The 1990-91 budget also includes a projected $276,632 in excess property taxes  that will be collected next year. Taxpayers may get a refund, since the  spending of excess tax revenues must be approved by voters or be refunded,  Kueny said.  </P> <P> The reason the city collected excess taxes was because the original limit was  set too low, and the city grew faster than was projected, he said.  </P> <P> Kueny said he will suggest the city develop five- to 10-year financial  projections on tax revenues so that it can set realistic spending limits.  </P> <P> Despite the increase in revenues, at least one councilman said the city should  take a conservative approach to spending in the event of an economic downturn.

With the approval of the State Council, the Dandong Border  Economic Cooperative Zone was formally established last July. At  present, 56,000 square meters of standard factory buildings have  been developed and construction has been completed in this zone.  Investments and capital invited to the zone totalled $33.43  million; 27 items are under consultation; and 166,000 square  meters of land- use right were sold.    Dandong Yanjiang Development Zone is a new technological  development zone, which is one of the development and  construction projects of Dandong city. Over the past two years,  this zone has attracted 480 million yuan in capital. At  present, it has nearly 800 registered enterprises and realized  2.27 billion yuan in business volume and 29.59 million yuan in  taxes. The amalgamation of these two zones will enable them to  complement each other with their strong points and help promote  the opening up of Dandong city to the outside world.</p>

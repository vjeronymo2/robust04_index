			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Reform of capital gains tax urged The British Venture Capital Association has called for a fundamental change in capital gains tax, which it says is higher than in any leading competitor country and discourages investment in growth businesses. In a submission to the chancellor for the November Budget the association calls for gains on assets to be taxed at a rate that would fall the longer assets were held. The top marginal tax rate for assets sold within three years of acquisition would be 40 per cent and the rate would decline to 20 per cent if the assets were held for more than six years. Autif, the unit trust industry's trade association, says in its Budget submission that it wants the overall annual limit on how much an individual can invest in Personal Equity Plans to be kept at Pounds 9,000.</p>

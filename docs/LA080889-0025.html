			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Look for "Ghostbusters II" to be available in the home video market by  Christmas. The word Monday from RCA/Columbia at the eighth annual Video  Software Dealers convention in Las Vegas is that the hit film will hit the  market in the fourth quarter of this year, possibly by Thanksgiving. The  expected price tag: around $90. "See No Evil, Hear No Evil" is also headed for  the video shelves about the same time. Convention delegates now are awaiting  word from Warner Bros. as to when "Batman" might be available in video form. An  announcement could be made Wednesday at a Warner-hosted luncheon.

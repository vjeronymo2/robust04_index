Supported by all kinds of factors, hardliners are  gaining the upper hand and will, under the precondition of  "stability" overwhelming everything, take a strong attitude on  the Taiwan and Hong Kong issues and toward the United States.  This informed source revealed that "some people in Zhongnanhai  do not sleep well every day" and that all kinds of  contradictions are causing a change in policy.    A week ago, Wei Jingsheng told a friend that the CPC's  policy  on political dissidents will not change, nor would the human  rights record change much. This high-level CPC official also  revealed that the CPC's attitude toward "Wei Jingsheng and the  like" has not changed and that it will continue to release  political dissidents who "have given a good account of  themselves." What has caused the CPC to change its plan and  strategy in a week?    The United States has always regarded the treatment meted  out  to pro-democracy activists, including Wei Jingsheng, Wang  Juntao, Chen Ziming, and Wang Dan as a criterion to appraise the  CPC's human rights record. Has the high-level CPC leadership  suddenly "become ferocious" regardless of the connection between  Chinese-U.S. political and economic relations on the one hand  and U.S. concern for Wei Jingsheng et al and the treatment of  political dissidents on the other? Is the CPC ready to take a  hard-line policy? Has it worked out a complete plan to resist  U.S. pressure?    The high-level CPC official revealed that a silent two-line  struggle is taking place for top-level power and that the  participation of the gerontocrats has made this struggle for  power and the two lines and policies even more complicated. He  pointed out: No conclusion can be made now and no one has won  or lost the struggle; as this struggle involves a wide range of  aspects, it is very difficult to say whether or not there will  be personnel changes or whether or not someone "will be hit by  an arrow and fall off his horse?" The hardliners have gained  the upper hand in counterattacking U.S. human rights pressure.  This could possibly involve China's foreign policy.    On whether or not local officials, who maintain delicate  relations with the central authorities, are involved in this  two- line struggle, the high-level CPC official said that most  local leaders with real power are taking a "wait-and-see"  attitude until the "situation is clear."    Viewing the CPC's strong attitude on the Hong Kong issue,  its  leap in economic reform, its liveliness in diplomatic relations,  its response to U.S. human rights policy, as well as economic  and trade pressure, and its way of handling inflation and social  problems, we can explicitly see the change from "fluctuation" to  "aggravation" in the high-level CPC two-line struggle. The CPC  official indicated that this struggle started at the beginning  of this year and became more intense after Lunar New Year.  Surrounded by pressures from all sides, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji  is seeking more cooperation and support. On the other hand, the  conservative forces' activities are also noteworthy.    As learned, apart from using "strong words" in finally  revising the section on the Hong Kong issue in the government  work report to the upcoming National People's Congress, the  section on diplomatic relations with the United States and Japan  will also be strongly worded.    This informed source in Beijing said that Deng Xiaoping's  health will have a major impact on this struggle. After a video  showing of Deng Xiaoping's public appearance, conservatives were  overjoyed and became active in engaging in foreign economic and  trade relations. The change in policy toward Wei Jingsheng et al  is an advance indication of the adoption of a hard-line  attitude. Some people believe that Deng Xiaoping's condition is  worse than thought, while Chen Yun's condition is much better.  No one knows who will win in this power struggle.    This high-level CPC official said that "some people in the  Central Committee are really worried about Deng Xiaoping's  health. Deng Xiaoping's condition is worse than last year."    There is a close connection between Chinese-U.S. relations  and Wei Jingsheng et al's behavior as well as political  dissidents' contacts with organizations outside China, this CPC  official indicated. The CPC will not allow these people to form  organizations or undermine social "stability," still less will  it allow them to collaborate with hostile forces outside the  borders. Of course, it will not allow these people to harm  "state interests."    Under this hard-line policy, even if Christopher arrives  with strong human rights pressure, the CPC will not yield to  this pressure; it will only make concessions on the Korean  peninsula issue, nuclear arms control, and some economic and  trade restrictions unless "there is a major internal change."  And this depends on these two weeks.    A Western observer said that the feeling in Beijing in March  this year is similar to that in the spring of 1989. The  people's resentment against speculating officials, bribery, and  corruption is high, commodity price hikes are out of control,  inflation is serious, the peasant issue is worsening, the gap  between rich and poor is widening, and there are more problems  in state-owned enterprise reform and the worker issue--all these  are pummeling Beijing. Whenever the CPC faces internal  pressures, it generally assumes a posture of being strong on  foreign policy, carrying out retrenchment in the economy, and  becoming conservative in politics. The Wei Jingsheng case is the  prelude to a big case.    The high-level CPC official said that the upcoming sessions  of the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference could possibly reflect many  problems, such as the Hong Kong issue, attitudes toward the  United States, the agricultural question, the relationship  between the central and local authorities, imbalanced  development, and setbacks in five reforms; but these are not the  focal points facing the high-level CPC leadership, the focal  point lies in Zhongnanhai.</p>

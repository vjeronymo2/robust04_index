			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (8): Clouds in the crystal ball  -UK recession takes savage jobs toll THERE is little to relieve the gloom shrouding the UK new car market. Sales forecasts have been steadily revised downwards throughout the year, with background fears now being voiced that the market this year could be barely more than 1.5m units - a 35 per cent fall from the record 2.3m units of 1989. Total output has held up surprisingly well - after eight months it was 0.5 per cent higher than a year ago at 858,204 - but dismal sales prospects for the final quarter of the year are likely to see output for the full year sag below 1991's 1.24m units. The failure of the UK economy to emerge from recession, and weakness in other important markets like North America, has begun to take a significant toll in short time working, job cuts and other measures to stem losses and adjust output to lower demand. The cuts have been severe in the volume car sectors and even worse in the executive and luxury car sectors, where Jaguar and Rolls-Royce have been forced into savage cutbacks, with 1,000 workers to go from Rolls-Royce alone. The year has also seen Lotus, General Motors' sports car and engineering subsidiary, abandon production of its Elan small sports car and a string of less illustrious companies collapse then re-emerge with new owners - among them Reliant, Evante, Jensen and Ginetta. Among the survivors, TVR of Blackpool is doing well thanks to the introduction of its spectacular Griffith 'supercar' while Morgan, still producing around 500 of its vintage-style sports cars annually at Malvern, Worcestershire, has merely seen its order book shorten a bit (it still extends for some years) and remains glad it shrugged off the televised advice of former ICI chairman and TV company 'doctor' Sir John Harvey Jones to expand production. The underlying UK market situation is actually worse than the bald figures indicate. Prof Garel Rhys, professor of motor industry economics at Cardiff Business School, says this has been the year in which, after years of industry pleadings, the UK Government finally acted on the anomalous Special Car Tax, halving it to 5 per cent. Had there not been an intervention by the Government last month, the struggle for sales between now and the end of the year could easily have assumed a much graver dimension for manufacturers. The collapse of the market this year to levels far below expectations has already left the industry with excess stocks. But in addition there are at least 40,000 unsold cars which are not fitted with the catalysts which become mandatory on all new cars sold throughout the EC from next January 1. Had the industry been forced to sell or otherwise dispose of all these before the January 1 deadline, the consequent price war would have made the present situation pale by comparison. However, the UK Government is invoking an EC Commission escape clause under which manufacturers are to be given until the end of next year to dispose of the non-'cats'. The further fall in new car sales in September - down 4 per cent compared with a year ago, leaving year-to-date sales at 1.3m, a further 2.62 per cent below last year - has left manufacturers casting around ever more feverishly for more carrots with which to tempt buyers. A new round of price cuts was recently started by Ford, its once clear-cut market leadership increasingly being eroded by second-placed Vauxhall and fourth-placed Peugeot-Talbot. (Rover Group is third, but has also been losing market share.) The price cuts, which apply to stocks of 1992 models only, range from Pounds 235 on a basic Fiesta small hatchback to Pounds 2,161 on a Fiesta 1.4 litre Ghia - reducing its price to Pounds 8,999 - and Pounds 2,150 off its sporting RS 2000 model, now selling at Pounds 14,000. Even if the UK market embarks on a firm recovery next year, pricing is bound to come under increasing pressure. Both the UK's Monopolies and Mergers Commission and EEC Commission have identified UK new car prices as frequently being at the high end of the EC spectrum. Potentially more worrying for the industry is a report from Ludvigsen Associates, the UK-based automotive analysts, asserting that European car buyers as a whole are paying up to one-third more for their car than counterparts in Japan and North America. Price pressures will be increased, too, by heightened competition as Honda and Toyota join Nissan in UK manufacturing, and both Nissan and Peugeot each start building small cars to complement their respective British-built Primera and Peugeot 405 upper-medium car models. In the meantime, the competitive position of Rover Group, which manufactures only in the UK and has a very high level of UK content, has been increased by the devaluation of sterling, particularly against the D-Mark. Although Ford has cut sharply its balance of payments deficit on its UK motor trade to Pounds 214m last year from Pounds 1.297bn in 1990, the position of it and Rover's main rivals is less clear-cut because of the amounts of vehicle or components imported from Europe. However, they remain significantly better placed than importers and distributors of German cars in particular, who need substantial price increases to compensate for sterling's fall. Recently Mr Tom Purves, managing director of BMW(GB), the executive car maker's wholly-owned importer, said price increases of 12-14 per cent would be needed to compensate for the currency shifts. Equally, he accepted that in current market conditions BMW, Volkswagen and others will have to absorb most of the adjustment through reduced margins. The share of the market taken by imports is in any case continuing to recede. They accounted for 54.27 per cent in September (55.82 a year ago) and 55.48 for the first nine months of the year (55.97). Precisely when the UK market is likely to start to recover remains a matter of hot debate. Mr John Towers, managing director of Rover Group, is cautiously optimistic. He suggests that sales could recover to 1.65m or perhaps even 1.7m units next year. 'We know for a fact that there is a lot of money about. Once we break through the consumer confidence barrier, then quite clearly there could be a lot of movement in the market.'</p>

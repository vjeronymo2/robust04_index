			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Sale closer as potential TVS bidder withdraws THE SALE of TVS Entertainment, the south of England company which lost its franchise, to International Family Entertainment came a step closer yesterday when a second potential US bidder decided to withdraw. Broadway Video, a television production company, had asked for information about TVS while the offer document for the sale to IFE was being produced. Broadway has now said that it is not interested in making a bid for TVS, whose assets include MTN, the US production company behind such shows as Lou Grant and Hill Street Blues. TVS said yesterday it had received no other approaches which would lead to an alternative offer. IFE, the company behind the successful Family Channel in the US, has made a share offer worth about Pounds 45.3m, with a cash alternative of some Pounds 36m. Many preference shareholders are still unhappy about the deal and Mr Julian Treger of Restructuring Advisers, who speaks for a number of them said yesterday he believed there would be enough opposition to block the sale. Mr Treger said he believed the TVS assets should continue to be managed and it was wrong to sell at this depressed stage of the cycle. Mr James Gatward, former chief executive of TVS, yesterday expressed concern that the most up-to-date information might not be available to shareholders before the December 15 closing date for the offer.</p>

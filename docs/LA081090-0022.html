			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. RESPONSE TO CIVIL WAR IN LIBERIA  </P> <P> Your editorial ("Thinking the Unthinkable," July 31) suggested, "Yes, U.S.  intervention in Liberia may be the best humanitarian move."  </P> <P> Why United States troops? Where are the United Nations peacekeeping forces?  Clearly this horrifying massacre of 600 women and children is a violation of  the principles of the United Nations Charter. When are we going to impose  compliance with the U.N. Charter and international law? We need an  international force capable of preventing such massacres and a commander in  chief who need not wait for the Security Council to debate the problem.  </P> <P> EDWARD C.

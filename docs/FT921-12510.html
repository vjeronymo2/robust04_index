			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / New York air fare cut to Pounds 199 BRITISH Airways, American Airlines and United Air Lines of the US cut their cheapest transatlantic return fares to Pounds 199 yesterday in a battle for low-season customers. At the start of the week most tickets cost Pounds 299. All three carriers reduced their cheapest fares to Pounds 229 on Tuesday. The price war was officially initiated by American, which applied to the UK Civil Aviation Authority to sell at the lower prices. It said, however, that it 'responded to British Airways offering an off-tariff fare to ticket retailers.' Off-tariff fares are those sold through unofficial discount outlets, or 'bucket shops'. British Airways denied selling any tickets at Pounds 199 and called its mimicking of to American's official price cut 'a prudent competitive response'. The Pounds 199 fare applies on Monday to Friday travel to eastern seaboard cities including New York. It is available until March 15 and all travel must be completed by April 12. Tickets can be booked only up to seven days in advance. A Saturday-night stopover is required and the maximum length of stay is 21 days. Last night Virgin Atlantic cut its Pounds 269 fare for tickets bought within 21 days of departure to Pounds 199. Dutch airline KLM, which is discussing a possible link with BA, said yesterday it would raise capacity on its European route network by 20 per cent.</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Clyde Petroleum Pounds 16.2m loss CLYDE PETROLEUM, the UK exploration and production company, yesterday reported a Pounds 16.2m loss in the six months to June 30 after writing off Pounds 21.6m due to failed exploration, mainly in Malaysia. Dr Colin Phipps, chairman, said he was disappointed that the company's international exploration programme had 'led to a high level of write-offs during the last two years'. The Pounds 16.2m net loss for the first half of this year compared to an Pounds 11.8m loss last time. The loss per share was 4.6p (3.7p), but Dr Phipps predicted that Clyde would return to profit in 1994 and reinstate a dividend in October 1994. Mr Malcolm Gourlay, chief executive, said planned maintenance shutdowns at the Wytch Farm field and the Forties pipeline system in the UK led to a lower average daily output during the first half of 21,072 barrels of oil equivalent. Production had returned to normal levels and he predicted average output for the full year would be close to the 23,900 b/d achieved last year. The drop in first half production caused turnover to decline to Pounds 39.2m (Pounds 43.7m). But the company benefitted from selling forward 73 per cent of its estimated 1993 output at Dollars 18.67 per barrel, against recent prices of under Dollars 16 a barrel. Cash inflow of Pounds 25m was supplemented by the Pounds 34.2m received from the company's rights' issue last March. Gearing, currently at 100 per cent, is likely to be slightly higher by year-end, according to Mr Gourlay. But he expects it to fall to 60 per cent by next year because of the cashflow expected when the North Sea Gryphon field begins producing next month. Clyde has a 35 per cent stake in the field. Mr David Basham, an analyst at Kleinwort Benson, said the size of the interim loss took the market 'a little bit by surprise,' and added that Clyde was 'trying to tidy up its balance sheet before the Gryphon production began.' Mr Gourlay said the company's exploration efforts would focus in future on the Netherlands, UK and Yemen. He said Clyde would be 'opportunistic' about possible disposals.</p>

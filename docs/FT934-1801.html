			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / The GATT Agreement: Psychological boost for British industrial exporters - The Gatt deal could create around 400,000 industrial jobs in the UK over time This week's Gatt package is being greeted by British industry as momentous good news which should help in its struggle to raise the nation's exporting effort. But the move to slash tariffs and open up global markets is a two-way affair. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, was yesterday anxious to play down the threat of still higher import penetration of UK markets and to call instead on companies to use the stability of a world trade liberalisation treaty to step up overseas sales. 'We must not say we can't do it. We have very considerable opportunities to win in world markets if we put our minds to it,' he said. The theme was picked up by Mrs Ann Robinson, director of policy at the Institute of Directors. 'There are big benefits waiting, providing companies prepare to respond to it and the Department of Trade and Industry provides the support services for exporters which it has been putting in place,' she said. Mrs Robinson said Britain has concentrated too much of its sales effort within other European markets and the new Gatt package should help them refocus their efforts on alternative markets with much bigger potential. Early industry estimates have suggested that the deal could generate as many as 400,000 new jobs across British industry over time. Britain's exporting effort has been improving recently and the country still exports per head nearly 50 per cent more than the US and 20 per cent more than the Japanese. Ministers were recently bold enough to commit themselves to boosting the country's share of world trade from 5.3 per cent to 6.3 per cent by the end of the decade - adding Pounds 10bn to exports at 1993 prices. It stood at 20 per cent 60 years ago. Though the Uruguay Round will not be enacted until 1995, with many changes then progressively phased in, the agreement was being greeted as an important psychological boost for companies at a critical point in the economic recovery. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, said the deal would 'give a considerable boost to business confidence. It sends a positive signal from world leaders to the business community that international trade prospects should improve, barriers come down, markets open up and interest rates fall'. British business is also emphasising the importance of the agreement on prospects for inflation. An IoD spokesman said: 'We have achieved low inflation and the challenge is to keep it that way. Gatt should help make that possible, eventually bringing down a whole range of prices, from food and clothing to other products. We could even see inflation at zero.' The Confederation of British Industry is also enthusiastic about a deal which it says will help the 'lean and fit' businesses now emerging from recession to take full advantage of a low inflation and low interest rate base to tackle markets previously hard to penetrate. The UK clothing and textile industries, where exports run at half the value of imports, could derive marginal benefits from the Uruguay Round. The agreement promises the phasing out of the UK's import quotas on supplies from many Asian countries. But the effect on UK manufacturing will be small because most production of low-priced garments such as T-shirts, and goods such as cotton yarn has already ended in the UK. At the same time tariffs and barriers imposed by other countries on UK exports will be eased. The US and Australia, for example, should cut import taxes from their current levels of 40 per cent or higher. Some of Britain's privatised industries, which have since turned themselves into global businesses, are also encouraged. British Steel, which has Pounds 4bn of annual sales - almost half of them overseas - says a reduction in tariffs is good for suppliers and customers. But work on achieving a multi-national steel agreement was decoupled from the Gatt negotiations when it was realised that agreement between the EU and the US was not going to be possible. British Steel said yesterday: 'It is important to us that the US, the world's champion of free trade, is prepared to open up its own market.'</p>

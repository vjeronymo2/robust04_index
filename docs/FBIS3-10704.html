Following last night's meeting with government officials,  the  Chapare coca growers were today satisfied with the progress.    [Begin coca growers' leader Evo Morales recording] At the  start of the meeting, the government apologized to coca growers  for having accused them of producing drugs. [end recording]    He added that the government is also willing to end the  forceful eradication of plantations:    [Begin recording] This will definitively ease social tension  in tropical Chapare and prevent confrontations. This is  basically what we have accomplished. It is not enough.  Discussions should go deeper into the technicalities and the  institutional framework of alternative development to see how  the government can guarantee funds for true alternative  development. [end recording]    Deputy Ramiro Barrenechea, adviser to coca growers, said the  end of forceful eradication in return for peasants joining the  voluntary eradication plan -- which involves financial benefits  per eradicated hectare -- is a trap by the government. In an  effort to prevent coca growers from signing an agreement to this  end, Barrenechea went today to the Labor Ministry where a final  meeting is being held to consider the subject. [passage omitted]    Coca growers have backed down on their decision to sign an  agreement on the topics agreed upon last night. They will not  agree to any type of eradication. They admitted, however, that  there are new illegal coca farms in Chapare. They said they  will defend them, because -- as they put it -- the government is  to blame.    [Begin Morales recording] In the face of the unfulfilled  promises and the lack of alternative development, we have no  alternative but to plant coca. The peasants are not to blame  for planting coca. It is the free market policy, the free  importation policy which is encouraging coca growing, not just  in Bolivia but in the entire Andean region.

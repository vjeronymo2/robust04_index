			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour electoral qualms reflected in Plant report THIS MORNING the Labour party's ruling National Executive Committee will have before it the third report from the Plant Committee, a working party on electoral systems chaired by Lord Plant, Professor of Politics at Southampton University. The report contains the committee's recommendations on appropriate electoral systems for elections to the House of Commons, the House of Lords and the European Parliament. If Labour adopts it the main opposition party will be committed to electoral reform for the Commons for the first time since the 1920s. The UK uses the first-past-the-post system for most elections, in which the successful candidate is the one who receives the highest number of votes - even if this is less than half the votes cast. Opposition to this winner-takes-all approach has been growing among Labour party members and that disquiet is reflected in the report, which says that first-past-the-post fails to recognise the increasingly pluralistic nature of British society. The report says that the Commons would be strengthened if MPs represented more closely the pattern of votes cast in various regions. In seeking a new electoral system for the Commons, the report emphasises the need to preserve the close link between MPs and constituencies to ensure that elected representatives are accountable. This rules out electoral systems such as Ireland's single transferable vote which has multi-member constituencies, or list systems where voters choose parties rather than MPs (as happens in Italy). Lord Plant's personal preference was for a variant on Germany's electoral system, with 500 MPs directly elected by constituencies and 150 others nominated by parties so that seats in parliament reflect party support among voters. But he was unable to carry a majority for this system, largely because of fears that it would create two classes of MPs. Instead, the committee went for the supplementary vote, an electoral system devised by Mr Dale Campbell-Savours, Labour MP for Workington, and used in no country in the world. Under the supplementary vote system, each voter would cast a first preference and a second preference vote. If no candidate won more than half the first preference votes, second preferences of the candidates with the least votes would be redistributed to elect the candidate with the most first and second preferences. The supplementary vote system is not a proportional system - it could even in some circumstances lead to a less proportional result than the current first-past-the-post system. But supplementary vote would involve the least change in the pattern of representation in parliament. It would therefore probably encounter least resistance if Labour ever tried to introduce it - many MPs would be reluctant to vote for a change which might put them out of a job. Its main advantage for its Labour supporters, however, is that it would have reduced the number of Conservative MPs elected in the last election while more than doubling the number of Liberal Democrats. As Mr Campbell-Savours says in his contribution to the report: 'It is almost inconceivable that there would not have been a Labour government, with the support of the minority parties.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HOW SUPPLEMENTARY VOTE MIGHT HAVE CHANGED THE 1992 GENERAL ELECTION RESULT*  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                        MPs under                                   present first-        MPs under                            % of    past-the-post    supplementary Party                      vote           system      vote system  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Conservative                 42              336              288 Labour                       35              271              288 Liberal Democrat             18               20               47 N Ireland parties             2               17               17 Nationalists etc              3                7               11  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Assuming Conservatives win 40 per cent of Liberal Democrats' second preference votes and Labour 60 per cent.

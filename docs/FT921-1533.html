			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Pretoria moves to set up first multiracial councils THE South African government expects to have the first phase of a multiracial interim government in place by next month, ministers said yesterday. Pretoria tabled proposals for multi-party transitional councils to oversee key areas of government in the run-up to elections for an interim legislature, expected to take place by mid-1993. The African National Congress (ANC) initially rejected the proposals, saying the councils would have insufficient powers and would be purely advisory. However, ministers said council decisions would be binding on the cabinet. Senior ANC officials said they believed agreement could be reached after further negotiation within the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the multi-party forum, including the Government, ANC and 17 other parties, negotiating a post-apartheid constitution. The ANC also rejected the government's insistence that the ANC abandon armed struggle and disband its military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, before full transitional government is put in place. Pretoria took a hard line on this issue, saying joint control of the police and army would only be conceded once the question of armed struggle was resolved. However, both sides said they believed a deal was within reach in this area as well. Under the government's proposals, the councils would include six members chosen by Codesa, and a seventh appointed by the president in consultation with Codesa. The councils would initially oversee four areas of government: preparation for elections, government finance, regional government and local government. Councils to oversee education, health, housing and foreign relations would be put in place as soon as agreement was reached by Codesa. Once the government and the ANC resolved the question of the ANC's armed struggle, the councils could then also oversee areas of security, including the police and army. The existing all-white cabinet would remain in place, although government ministers made clear yesterday that, as the councils would take decisions by consensus - and as consensus could not be achieved without the agreement of all parties, including government - the cabinet would have no reason to veto decisions already agreed by the government in the council. Pretoria may have to make further concessions on the powers of the councils, but it seems likely that the issue can be swiftly resolved in Codesa. Further stumbling blocks could yet emerge, however, over who should be appointed to the councils, and over how many parties should be represented. The ANC wants the broadest possible representation, while the government wants to exclude all but major parties. Pretoria also proposed a second phase of interim government, involving an elected two-house legislature, with the upper house made up either of regional representatives, or of members of the existing white, Indian and 'coloured' houses of assembly. There would also be a three-to-five man revolving presidency and an appointed cabinet, though ministers made clear that much negotiation remained on these issues.</p>

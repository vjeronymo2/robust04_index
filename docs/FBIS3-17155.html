			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow, March 24 -- The ROSSIISKIE VESTI newspaper  singles out materials on growing social stratification of  society. Referring to official data, the newspaper notes that  "20 per cent of well-to-do population enjoys now 40 per cent of  all cash incomes while 20 per cent of population in the low wage  bracket has only seven per cent".    "The society's `elite' has formed its closed circle isolated  from the popular masses, working for itself and serving itself,"  the newspaper writes. Noting that such a situation is fraught  with a social explosion, the newspaper calls for stepping up  state and public control, using economic levers.    The same newspaper speaks about "an emerging course for  stabilisation" in the country in another article, where premier  Viktor Chernomyrdin is called its main herald. According to  ROSSIISKIE VESTI, this course should not be rescribed as a  rollback on reforms. It means "only a departure from radicalism  to more organic development of society".    The TRUD, KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA and other newspapers single  out a report on the land-crash of an A-310 plane belonging to  the Russian International Airlines Company, which flew on the  Moscow-hong kong route. All crew members, nine stewardesses and  63 passengers died.    In the opinion of the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper, an  explosion is a possible reason for the tragedy. The newspaper  writes that circumstances of the plane's crash are very similar  to those of the Boeing's crash in 1986 over Scotland blasted by  international terrorists (notorious "Lockerbie case").    The TRUD newspaper carries an interview with Russian  Minister  for Nationalities Sergey Shakhray who explains reasons  motivating his faction (Party of Russian Unity and Accord) in  the lower house to vote for the much publicised amnesty. "One  cannot be a judge at his own house," he says. "The logic of  civil clashes knows only one way out: an attempt for civil  reconciliation."    The same newspaper features an interview with acting  Ukrainian Premier Yefim Zvyagilsky, saying that some Western  media fan up "a conflict" between Ukraine and Russia. "These are  ravings of a madman," he stresses. "Some people are evidently  very eager to direct our relations according to this scenario.  But nobody will be able to sow a discord between us." According  to Zvyagilsky, "close and equal relations with Russia were and  remain the top priority in politics for us".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, ROSSIISKIE VESTI and other newspapers  print a report on consultations between Russian and German  Foreign Ministers Andrey Kozyrev and Klaus Kinkel in Moscow on  Wednesday. Newspapers note that the sides concentrated on the  forthcoming visit by President Boris Yeltsin to Germany this May.    Writing about a meeting in the United States of the  Russian-American commission on the fate of U.S. citizens who had  disappeared in the former Soviet Union, the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA  newspaper carries an interview with a Russian delegation member  and legislator Dmitriy Volkogonov. He expressed conviction that  the participation of Russians in the commission "works for the  prestige of Russia".    Newspapers write about talks, which ended in Moscow on  Wednesday, between the Russian Government and the International  Monetary Fund to bring closer their positions on Russia's  economic policy in 1994.    Konstantin Kagalovsky, member of the IMF directors board  from  Russia, said in an interview with NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA that "good  personal relations" between Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin and IMF  managing director Michel Camdessus were a decisive factor for  the successful completion of the talks. According to the  newspaper, the IMF wants the Russian side "to rationalise  production" which means higher rates of privatisation and  bankruptcies.    Continuing this topic, the SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA daily  reproduces a cartoon from the English-language MOSCOW TIMES  newspaper where our country is depicted holding holey hat, into  which the IMF tosses "the so-called system credit of 1.5 billion  U.S. dollars which immediately falls through".</p>

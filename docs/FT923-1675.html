			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Chemicals explosion leaves two people dead A FULL inquiry is to be carried out into yesterday's explosion at a chemicals plant in Castleford, West Yorkshire, which left two people dead and 15 injured, four seriously. The blast occurred at 1.30pm at the manufacturing plant of Hickson and Welch, an organic chemicals subsidiary of Hickson International, the Yorkshire-based chemicals group. In addition to a health and safety executive inquiry, the company is to conduct its own investigation of the incident. The full extent and likely cost of the damage is not yet known. Initial reports said the incident happened as workers at the plant carried out routine maintenance work on a distillation column used to purify nitrotoluene. Nitrotoluene is a flammable, toxic liquid produced as a feedstock for many of Hickson's products, particularly pharmaceuticals, dyestuffs, pigments and photographic products. Industrial grade toluene has a flash point of 2 degrees to 5 degrees centigrade. One of the two maintenance workers was killed instantly in the explosion, which destroyed the distillation column and set alight an adjoining four-storey office block. The other fatality and most of the injuries occurred in the office block. Many more casualties could have been expected if the building had not been almost empty during the lunchbreak. Around 100 firefighters and 17 pumps attended the blaze, which was rapidly extinguished, leaving a cloud of thick black smoke above the town. Residents were advised to stay indoors and keep windows shut, but police later confirmed that the smoke was not toxic. Buildings near the plant were shaken by the blast. Hickson International is Castleford's largest employer, providing around 800 jobs, and has been in the area for more than 50 years. The company has recently undergone a series of board changes and been reorganised after several poor acquisitions in the late 1980s. Pre-tax profits more than doubled to Pounds 16.9m in the first half of this year. Its shares fell 11p to 183p yesterday in late trading.</p>

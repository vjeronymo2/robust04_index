Qiao's first trip to Germany is regarded as a major event in  the history of Sino-German ties.    Sources from the NPC described the tour as "successful" and  said that "anticipated results have been achieved during the  visit."    The visit has promoted mutual understanding and friendship,  and expanded bilateral cooperation, exchanges between the two  parliaments in particular, the sources said.    The visit shows that the two sides attach great importance  to  further enhancing bilateral ties and have made earnest efforts  to this end.    The economies of the two countries are mutually  complementary. So there exists a sound basis for developing  bilateral cooperation.    The situation over the past three years has demonstrated  that  the evaluation of bilateral ties that Qiao has made is  completely correct.    Qiao said during the visit that the two sides should treat  and handle their mutual relations from a strategic viewpoint.    Meanwhile, Qiao met with many German entrepreneurs, spent  hours touring the Mercedes-Benz bodyshell and assembly plant in  Sindelfingen, and discussed with the leaders of the Siemens  Company future cooperation between the two sides.    While visiting the Sindelfingen plant, Qiao was informed  about the passenger car and commercial vehicle ranges as well as  the Daimler-Benz group's current projects in China.    Edzard Reuter, chairman of the Daimler-Benz AG, was  confident  in Sindelfingen's economic cooperation with China. "We are  determined to reinforce our activity in this region and to  continuously maintain and extend our relations with our  partners," he noted.    Reuter said that more contracts will be concluded with China  and more investments made in that country in addition to the  current and planned major projects such as the production of  buses, equipping the metro systems in Shanghai and Guangzhou,  delivering 23 Airbus planes as well as developing and producing  telecommunication satellites.    Qiao said he has full confidence in such cooperation.</p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FREEWAY LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> LA HABRA CONTAINS FULLERTON  </P> <P> La Habra High School's "freak" defense in the second half and Leslie Ferguson's  27 points and 14 rebounds led the Highlanders over Fullerton, 58-40, in a  Freeway League girls' basketball game Thursday night at Fullerton High.  </P> <P> Ferguson scored 12 of La Habra's 20 points in the third quarter and its defense  controlled the boards, forcing Fullerton (11-5 overall, 4-1 in league play)  into poor shots.  </P> <P> "We put our freak defense, designed to take two shooters (Fullerton's Summer  McLane and Jennifer Comstock) out of the game while increasing our intensity .  . . in the second quarter," La Habra Coach John Koehler said.  </P> <P> "As a result, our defense forced the ball into the hands of Fullerton's  nonshooters and contained them to only one shot, and our rebounders were in  position to sweep the boards."  </P> <P> La Habra led only 22-18 at halftime, but Fullerton lost momentum when Lynn  Gilbert, its inside shooter, injured her right ankle with 7:43 to play in half.  Gilbert injured the same ankle last year and was out for three weeks.  </P> <P> La Habra (13-2, 4-0) had 47 rebounds. Zrinka Kristich had 15 rebounds and 12  points and Ana Kristrich had 12 rebounds and 13 points.  </P> <P> Fullerton Coach Vernie Ford called her team's poor shooting (15 of 54)  "discouraging, an age-old problem for us."  </P> <P> "We played hard and made good adjustments, but our shooting just wasn't on  target," Ford said.  </P> <P> McLane hit six of 15 shots from the field (15 points), and Comstock hit six of  17, one a three-pointer (13 points).  </P> <P> Koehler said the score is not indicative of the game. "We made mistakes in the  first half and Fullerton got after us," he said. BOB BORSUM Sonora 54, Troy 35  -- Chris Kiel had 15 points, Casie Lozano 13 and Denise Donadio 12 to lead host  Sonora (4-10, 1-3). Brandy Richardson had 22 points for Troy. Sonora trailed,  15-3, in the first quarter, but came back with a press and took the lead,  33-31, in the fourth quarter. Sonora made 14 of 18 free throws in the fourth  quarter and outscored Troy, 40-14, in the second half. Buena Park 55, Sunny  Hills 30 -- Three girls scored in double figures to lead host Buena Park.

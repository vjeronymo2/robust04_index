			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Small business groups see EC threat SMALL business groups around Europe are concerned that the European Commission's enterprise directorate is to be abolished or is to be merged into the industry directorate with the loss of an independent voice for small companies. A delegation of European MPs and representatives of small business organisations throughout Europe will argue the case for a continued strong voice for small business in meetings with government ministers in Portugal - present chairman of the European Commission - tomorrow. The European Committee for Small and Medium sized Independent Companies (Europmi) has written an open letter to Mr Jaques Delors, commission president, seeking his assurance that the enterprise directorate (DG 23) will not be abolished. An official of the directorate yesterday denied any knowledge of plans to abolish or merge it but small business organisations believe the directorate is threatened by proposals to simplify the commission structure. They also suspect that the directorate's monitoring of the impact of proposed EC legislation has angered other departments, according to Mr Brian Prime, president of Europmi and European representative of the Federation of Small Businesses, a UK small firms lobby group. Small business concerns about the future of the directorate have coincided with a review by independent consultants of the effectiveness of its small business programmes. Their preliminary report is due next month. While some small business organisations are opposed to any change in the status of the enterprise directorate others would be willing to see it merged with the industry directorate (DG 3) as long as it retained a distinct identity. 'The interests of small and medium-sized companies need to be given more weight in Europe. If this is the best way to do it then I am prepared to consider it,' said Ms Kala Paijs, president of the small firms' group of European MPs and a member of the delegation to Portugal.</p>

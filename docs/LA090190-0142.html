			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER;  </P> <P> POLICE GET $15,000 FOR COMPUTERIZATION  </P> <P> A new computerized office management program will allow city police to spend  many more hours in the field each year instead of staying at the station to  fill out paper work.  </P> <P> At the request of the police, the City Council approved a plan this week to  install a $15,000 computer networking project by 1992, one year ahead of  schedule.  </P> <P> Report writing now takes each officer up to two hours a day. Police hope to cut  that time in half with the new program, Capt. John Savage said.  </P> <P> Reports will be entered into computers, making revisions and filing easier. "We  want to get as close to paperless as possible," Savage said.  </P> <P> The department's 41 computers will also be linked through a central system with  crime databases in Sacramento and Washington.  </P> <P> The project, and a concurrent program to install computers in squad cars, will  also be completed within 18 months, Savage said.  </P> <P> The projects will cost $50,000, to be paid for with money seized in drug cases.

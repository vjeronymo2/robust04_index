			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPERA REVIEW;  </P> <P> THE MET GOES MODERN -- AFTER A FASHION  </P> <P> Of all the major houses in the world, the Metropolitan Opera must be the most  conservative. It is a matter of tradition, of taste and of finance.  </P> <P> By most standards, the double bill that was introduced Monday night at Lincoln  Center would seem a timid gesture. Bela Bartok wrote "Bluebeard's Castle" in  1911. Arnold Schoenberg completed "Erwartung" back in 1909.  </P> <P> The mighty Met, however, had discovered "Bluebeard" only in 1974 and abandoned  it after a dozen performances. The company had never touched a tone of  Schoenberg until this momentous occasion.  </P> <P> Actually, the occasion wasn't as daring as once envisioned. The two short  operas originally were to have been complemented by a third -- either Debussy's  "Le Martyre de St. Sebastien" or Dallapiccola's "Il Prigioniero." The  theatrical mastermind for this stimulating juxtaposition was to have been the  inevitably provocative Peter Sellars.  </P> <P> By the time the not-so-well-laid plans were realized, however, the third act  and the first director both fell victim to some weird operatic policies and  politics. The Met finally settled for a smaller package of 20th-Century  masterpieces and wrapped it in second-hand Eurotrash glitz.  </P> <P> To stage the two surviving psychodramas, the management turned to Goran  Jarvefelt, an internationally fashionable, mildly controversial gimmick  specialist. For trendy modernist decors, the Met enlisted Hans Schavernoch and  Lore Haas, set and costume designers who had performed similar service for  Vienna three years ago.  </P> <P> To prove that it harbors no consistent concern for the validity of opera as  comprehensible drama, the company offered "Bluebeard" in English but  "Erwartung" in German. The program magazine didn't even deem it worthwhile to  translate the title. Anyone for "Expectation"?  </P> <P> Essentially, the evening was reduced to an unorthodox indulgence for a  misplaced prima donna, Jessye Norman, as accompanied by an inspired conductor,  James Levine. The singing was variable. The playing was brilliant. The staging  was pretentious.  </P> <P> Jarvefelt (well remembered for the distortions of numerous Santa Fe efforts)  and Schavernoch (well-remembered for the high-tech kitsch of his Bayreuth  "Ring") have, of course, ignored the careful theatrical instructions outlined  by the composers and librettists.  </P> <P> "Bluebeard" no longer takes place in a dark castle chamber with seven  mysterious doors. "Erwartung" no longer takes place in a nightmarish forest.  Both operas are forced to inhabit the same shiny set, a mock-marble mausoleum  equipped with sliding panels that can reveal missiles, branches, sci-fi  panoramas, hootchy-kootchy dancers, piles of bloody gems plus other cheap and  useful symbols.  </P> <P> In "Bluebeard," the room is bare except for a podium that supports the  protagonist. The protagonist, not incidentally, executes a profoundly  significant partial strip-tease as each door to his psyche opens. Gosh.  </P> <P> In "Erwartung," the room is strewn with bloody autumn leaves that surround a  grand piano bedecked with a Liberacian candelabrum. A convenient corpse appears  and disappears on cue, via trusty trap door. Ask not why.  </P> <P> It is all very chic and very silly. The claptrap could even be funny if it  weren't such an affront to Bartok's brooding, decaying romanticism and  Schoenberg's febrile, ecstatic expressionism.  </P> <P> In "Bluebeard," Samuel Ramey sang with nice, bland basso fortitude,  demonstrated model diction, bared his chest proudly and even doffed his purple  wig without cracking a smile. Still, it didn't mean much.  </P> <P> As his hapless and chronically inquisitive bride, Norman offered more crooning  and marking than genuinely expressive singing. She all but faked the climactic  high C at the opening of the fifth door, and tended to hide under the  orchestral blanket. She did, however, strike grandiose, statuesque poses.  </P> <P> As the victimized heroine of Schoenberg's monodrama, she traced the mercurial  vocal line with verve and reasonable accuracy. Even here, however, she seemed  more intent on producing lush sounds than on portraying neurotic tragedy.  </P> <P> Still, she made her loyal fans undeniably happy. The brave ones who stayed to  the atonal end gave her the sort of ovation usually reserved for an Isolde or  Elektra. The director and designer had to endure a few boos.  </P> <P> And so Bartok and Schoenberg ended up providing a star turn for an  old-fashioned diva. Only in New York. . . .  </P></p>

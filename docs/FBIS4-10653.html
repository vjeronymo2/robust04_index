			<p>BFN     [Text] President Alberto Fujimori announced today that he  has a third letter from Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman and  he will reveal the letter at the appropriate time. Fujimori  also denied that a letter published in a local magazine is true.    [Begin recording] [Fujimori] [words indistinct] Second, I am  keeping the third letter under lock, in a safe, and no one else  knows the combination. I therefore do not see how the letter  could have left my safe. Then [words indistinct] the magazine  published a letter which is not the third letter. I deny it.    [Unidentified reporter] [words indistinct]    [Fujimori] [words indistinct] Look, here we must use  censorship to be able to handle properly the psychological  aspect in the struggle against the Shining Path. The handling  of this has been good. Now no one can criticize me about why  the letter was published or that it was a propaganda coup for  the Shining Path. All the facts contravene this statement  because, thanks to the way the famous letters of Guzman were  handled, massive desertions took place -- not hundreds, but  thousands of Shining Path members deserted. The study we made  from the psychological point of view was correct. [end  recording]</p>

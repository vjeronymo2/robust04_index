			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Yang Shanqing (2799 0810 3237)] </F>   [Text] Changsha, 25 Dec (XINHUA) -- State Councillor Chen  Junsheng stressed today that action to bring down grain prices  and stabilize the market represents one important measure of  macroeconomic control today.    From 21 to 24 December, Chen Junsheng conducted inspections  of Hunan's grain market and studied problems in the province's  agriculture and rural economic development. Chen Junsheng said:  Grain procurement prices were rather low. Therefore, the  appropriate upward movement of grain prices has a reasonable  side to it because peasants will be able to get good prices for  their grain. However, in some localities grain prices have risen  sharply over a short period of time; this is abnormal. He  pointed out: Total grain output for 1993 is expected to top 450  billion kg. The amount of grain procured will be roughly the  same as last year. As of now, the grain procurement plan is 80  percent complete, state grain depots are well-stocked, and there  is more than enough grain to ensure adequate supply. He added:  Why are grain prices rising sharply in some localities?  Reports from localities indicate the following reasons: 1) A  chain reaction to grain price rises in some major grain  marketing areas. 2) Some peasants are unwilling to sell grain  in the belief grain prices will increase next year; certainly,  natural disasters are also a factor. 3) State-owned grain  departments -- notwithstanding the great deal of work they have  done in terms of procurement and marketing -- have failed to  bring into full play their role as the major channel of  circulation. Chen Junsheng stressed: We must increase  macroeconomic control; we must ensure market stability and bring  to a quick end the irrational, runaway increases in grain price  in some localities so the interests of both producers and  consumers are protected.    Chen Junsheng pointed out: In drafting next year's  production plans, we must see to it the readjustment of the  rural production structure and the development of a type of  farming that provides high yields of fine quality with maximum  efficiency are carried out under the preconditions of a steady  increase in grain output. He added: We are in the middle of a  severe winter. Localities must take advantage of all favorable  conditions to help people in disaster-ridden areas; in  particular, they should properly handle the food supply for the  victims of natural calamities.    Accompanying him in the inspection tour were Yang Yongzhe,  deputy director of the State Council Research Office, and Zhang  Yanxi, vice minister of agriculture.</p>

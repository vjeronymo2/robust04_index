They may also specify times when vessels may enter, move within or through, or depart from ports, harbors, or other waters of the CVTMS Zone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, the U.S. Coast Guard's Navigation Rules, International and Inland, speak specifically to the conduct of vessels while at sea. Rule 6 of the International and Inland Steering and Sailing Rules states that ``Every vessel shall at all times proceed at a safe speed so that she can take proper and effective action to avoid collision and be stopped within a distance appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Prohibit engine powered water craft of any type.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A fundamental objective of the sanctuary program is ``to facilitate, to the extent compatible with the primary objective of resource protection, all public and private uses of the resources of these marine areas not prohibited pursuant to other authorities'' (16 U.S.C. 1431(b)(5)). NOAA will consider the threats from all types of vessels_power driven, sailing, or paddle propelled_as a continuing analysis of vessel traffic within the sanctuary boundaries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Manage the off-loading or exchange of cargo or oil.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  No offloading or exchange of oil occurs within the boundary of the Sanctuary. This activity generally occurs in ports which are located outside of the Sanctuary boundary. Further, this type of activity is addressed by both OPA 90 and programs being established by the recently created Washington State OMS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Prohibit shipment of reclaimed spent nuclear fuel from foreign reactors through the Sanctuary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As previously noted, NOAA has recommended to the U.S. Coast Guard that an IMO approved ATBA be established within the Sanctuary boundary. This would require vessels transporting hazardous materials to remain at least 25 nautical miles offshore while in the vicinity of Sanctuary waters or until making their approach to the Strait of Juan de Fuca using the established CVTMS traffic separation scheme.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NOAA will also work with the State of Washington's OMS and both the U.S. and Canadian Coast Guards to be informed of, and alerted to, in a timely and regular manner, all hazardous cargo carriers transiting near Sanctuary waters. Further, through participation in regular meetings of the Washington State Regional Marine Safety Committees and discussions with the U. S. Coast Guard, NOAA will ensure that contingency plans adequately address such transport issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Prohibit commercial vessel anchorages within the Sanctuary, particularly off Makah Bay, except in emergencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The use of the Makah Bay anchorage by vessels waiting either for an available pilot at Port Angeles or instructions from their home office, has been examined. Currently, its use as a temporary anchorage has been agreed upon by both the U.S. and Canadian Coast Guards. This is viewed as a more favorable alternative than having such vessels continuously underway within, and off the entrances to, the Strait. Vessels at anchor are subject to MARPOL, U.S. Federal law, and Sanctuary regulations regarding discharges. The use of this anchorage is monitored by Tofino Vessel Traffic Service which can also educate such vessels regarding the Sanctuary and its regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

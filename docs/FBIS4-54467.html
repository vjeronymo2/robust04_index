			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bernard Besserglik] </F>   [Text] Sarajevo, May 2 (AFP) -- NATO warplanes were called  in to deter a group of Serbs who attempted to remove a heavy  weapon from a collection point within the 20-kilometre (12.5  mile) exclusion zone around Sarajevo, a UN spokesman said  Monday. Around the same time three Serb shells fell in a  non-residential area of central Sarajevo, another spokesman said.    The Serbs approached the collection point at Poljine, near  Vogosca, six kilometres (four miles) north of Sarajevo, at 8:00  p.m. (1800 GMT) Sunday, and demanded that they be allowed to  move a 122mm gun stored in the depot with several other  large-calibre guns, UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] spokesman  Eric Chaperon said. French UN peacekeepers at the site rejected  the demand, and the Serbs left around midnight after NATO planes  were called in to overfly the region.    Meanwhile three Serb shells exploded near the Grbavica area  of Sarajevo, Sarajevo sector spokesman Guy Vinet said. Two fell  300 metres (yards) from the Brotherhood and Unity bridge, the  main crossing point between central Sarajevo and the  Serb-controlled Grbavica suburb. No casualties were reported.    The incidents were the latest in a series in which Serb  forces have violated or attempted to violate ceasefire  agreements and exclusion zones ordered by the North Atlantic  Treaty Organisation around Sarajevo and Gorazde in eastern  Bosnia.    An UNPROFOR convoy bringing a British battalion of  peacekeepers to Gorazde was still held up early Monday at  Rogatica where local officials were demanding to inspect the  personal possessions of the troops, Chaperon said.    The convoy set out for Gorazde at 8:00 a.m. on Saturday and  was held up at the first Serb checkpoint between Sarajevo and  Kiseljak, west of the capital, for most of the day. An UNPROFOR  spokesman said Sunday he believed the convoy had been allowed  through Rogatica, located midway along the 70-killometre  (40-mile) route between Sarajevo and Gorazde.    The troops are badly needed to reinforce the 500  peacekeepers  currently policing the exclusion zone imposed on the  UN-designated safe area. Chaperon said the delay was a  violation of NATO's April 22 ultimatum ordering free and  unimpeded movement for UNPROFOR and humanitarian relief convoys.    An attack on Danish Leopard tanks near the safe area of  Tuzla, in northeastern Bosnia, late Friday left nine dead and  four wounded on the Serb side when the UN peacekeepers riposted,  Chaperon said, citing figures issued by the Serbs. The tanks  fired 72 rounds during the exchange near a UN observation post.  "Shooting at a Leopard is a very bad idea," Chaperon added.    The sector further north near Brcko, where UNFPROFOR has  detected a build-up of Serb heavy weapons and Bosnian army  infantry in recent days, was reported quiet.    A group of around 100 Serb militiamen had grouped on the  east  bank of the Drina river within the three-kilometre (two-mile)  exclusion zone in Gorazde, Chaperon said. Most of the men were  currently unarmed, though they had been armed earlier, he added  said. The Serbs claimed to be policemen, ensuring the  protection of Serb civilians in that part of the town, he noted.</p>

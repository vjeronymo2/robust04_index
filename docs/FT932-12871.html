			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Attali promises change at EBRD MR JACQUES ATTALI, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, yesterday promised he would 'carefully oversee rigorous implementation' of new measures decided after two weeks of criticism which, he said, 'had provided constructive lessons for the bank and for me'. But the barrage of criticism continued after the opening speeches, with Mr Viktor Geraschenko, Russian central bank chairman, adding his voice to complaints about the EBRD's slow pace of disbursement. He decried the 'paltry' sum of Ecu6.3m (Pounds 4.97m) disbursed in Russia to date by the bank. Despite admitting that Russia's own unpreparedness was equally to blame for slow progress, Mr Geraschenko criticised what he called the lack of 'Russian specialists acquainted with the real conditions of the country'. He called on the bank to go beyond investments in the energy and minerals sector, and help foster investment in the conversion of military industries, the agro-industrial sector and the development of 'healthy competition in the banking system'. By contrast, Hungary reflected the concern of the fast-track central European countries to prevent Russia acquiring the lion's share of available resources. Mr Ivan Szabo, finance minister, called for the EBRD to 'focus on a manageable number of well-defined priorities'. One area in which the bank has a new chance to demonstrate its practical worth isof nuclear safety, which was raised by Mr Attali as a top priority at the EBRD conference in Budapest last year. The nuclear installation safety fund, to which more than Ecu100m (Pounds 79m) has been committed by 11 countries and the European Commission, 'will be operational by the end of this week', Mr Attali announced. The first project, for improving safety at the Kozloduy nuclear complex in Bulgaria, will be submitted by the bank to the committee of donors next month, he said. Mr Attali also showed his penchant for the broader perspective by reminding his audience that the Yugoslav crisis revealed the need for Europe's diversity to be respected, and that, without stable institutions, the former Soviet Union could be split into 15 nuclear powers.</p>

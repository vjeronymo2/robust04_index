			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Insurance profits fear hits CU FEARS ABOUT the effect of the bomb damage on the profits of Commercial Union, one of the UK's leading insurers, hit its share price yesterday. Initial indications are, however, that the rest of the insurance industry will lose less from this attack than it did after the bombs of last April. Commercial Union, which leads coverage on NatWest Tower, said it was 'unlikely to lose less' than the Pounds 15m paid out last year. Its shares fell 15p yesterday to close at 593p. Others expect to be less badly hit. Sun Alliance said total net losses were unlikely to exceed Pounds 15m, compared with Pounds 39m last year. General Accident is forecasting a loss of less than Pounds 7m. Guardian Royal Exchange and Royal Insurance expect to lose less than Pounds 5m. Differences in reinsurance arrangements explain the contrasting outlook. The main exposures of the companies stem from policies underwritten in 1992, before terrorism was excluded from standard commercial policies. Both Royal Insurance and Guardian Royal Exchange bought reinsurance policies from Pool Re, the government-backed reinsurance company. Sun Alliance and General Accident bought extra reinsurance from alternative sources. Commercial Union has less comprehensive reinsurance. The figures indicate that the government and reinsurance companies will bear the brunt of the bill, estimated at between Pounds 300m and Pounds 400m. Market report, Page 44</p>

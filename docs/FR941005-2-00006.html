The project area is located within all or portions of T19N, R15 &amp; 16E, T20N, R15, 16, &amp; 17E; and T21N, R15, 16, and 17E, MDB&amp;M. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency invites comments and suggestions on the scope of the analysis. In addition, the agency gives notice of the full environmental analysis and decision-making process that will occur on the proposal so that interested and affected people are aware of how they may participate and contribute to the final decision. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments should be made in writing and received by November 21, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments concerning the project should be directed to Steve Bishop, District Ranger, Sierraville Ranger District, P.O.

That 85,000-acre project was proposed to address the area's extensive tree mortality and overstocked timber stands. Opportunities were identified to treat those stands in order to improve forest health and reduce the fire hazard, while concurrently accomplishing watershed restoration and wildlife habitat improvement goals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Significant new circumstances have occurred that bear on the original proposal. From August 16 through August 31, 1994, the 48,000-acre Cottonwood Fire burned through the Eastside Forest Restoration Project analysis area, affecting about 36,300 acres of National Forest System land and 11,700 acres of lands of other ownership on both the Tahoe and Toiyabe National Forests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fire burned with high-to-moderate intensity on over 90 percent of the affected area, leaving only skeletons of burned trees and shrubs. Less than 10 percent of the area burned with low intensity, leaving partially burned or scattered live trees. This loss of vegetation has resulted in large areas of exposed soils and, thus, unstable watershed conditions, large amounts of new fuels, and the loss of standing timber and future timber growth potential. The fire also affected other important resources, such as wildlife habitat, recreation sites, visual quality, historic and pre-historic sites, fisheries, sensitive plant and animal species, and water quantity and quality. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The unburned portion (about xx,xxx acres) of Eastside Forest Restoration Project EIS is being deferred for analysis until the completion of the Cottonwood Fire Restoration Project EIS; a revised Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the remaining area, along with new time schedules, will be placed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at a later date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Cottonwood Fire Restoration Project analysis area is about xx,xxx acres in size, and includes xx,xxx acres of National Forest System lands and xx,xxx acres of lands of other ownerships. Most of the area is in the Feather River watershed, with a small portion in the Truckee River watershed. It is located east of the town of Sierraville and Highway 89, north of Sardine Peak and Lewis Mill, west of Babbitt Peak and the crest of the Bald Mountain Range, and south of the town of Loyalton. Major drainages within the project area include Cottonwood Creek, Lemon Canyon, Turner Canyon, Smithneck Creek, Bear Valley Creek, and Badenaugh Canyon. The project area includes all lands within the fire boundary on the Sierraville Ranger District of the Tahoe National Forest; the area burned on the Carson Ranger District of the Toiyabe National Forest will be analyzed separately. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In preparing the environmental impact statement, the Forest Service will identify and analyze a range of alternatives that address the issues developed for this area. One of the alternatives will be no treatment. Other alternatives will consider differing levels of implementation of salvage treatments, fuels reduction, watershed restoration, road obliteration, wildlife habitat improvement, and new road construction and reconstruction. An ecological approach will be used to achieve multiple-use management of the Cottonwood Fire area. It also means that the needs of people and environmental values will be blended in such a way that this area's desired condition would represent a diverse, healthy, productive, and sustainable ecosystem. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public participation will be important during the analysis, especially during the review of the draft environmental impact statement. The Forest Service is seeking information, comments, and assistance from Federal, State, and local agencies and other individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposed action. This input will be used in preparation of the draft environmental impact statement. The scoping process includes: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Identifying potential issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Identifying issues to be analyzed in depth. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Eliminating insignificant issues or those which have been covered by a relevant previous environmental analysis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Exploring additional alternatives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Identifying potential environmental effects of the proposed action and alternatives (i.e., direct, indirect, and cumulative effects and connected actions). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Determining potential cooperating agencies and task assignments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following list of issues has been identified through initial scoping: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) To what extent can the potential for future large, catastrophic wildlife be reduced within the project area? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

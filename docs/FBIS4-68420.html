The basic goal of the Society's activity is the country's  political, economic, cultural, and moral revival, the basic  prerequisite of which is the restoration of Georgia's  territorial integrity and the creation of the political,  material, and legal base necessary to meet the needs of the  population.    2. We condemn chauvinism, local separatism, and every form  of  demagoguery and are guided solely by principles of true  democracy, people's friendship, protection of human rights, and  the political, economic, and creative liberties of the  individual.    3. Georgia's internal state system and  administrative-territorial division must take full account of  historical traditions, specific regional characteristics,  satisfy the needs of the native peoples and national minorities,  and be in accord with universally recognized human rights.    4. Our economic program rests on the modern world's  practical  experience of the organization and management of production as  well as Georgia's national, historical, and production  experience and characteristics. Because we believe that there is  no alternative to a market economy, our aim is to promote the  kind of market relations which will ensure effective realization  of the country's material, labor, and scientific potential and  strengthen the foundations of the country's spiritual life. We  believe that a multi-structural, socially-oriented market  economy is most in keeping with the country's development  interests. Equal economic, organizational, and psychological  conditions need to be provided for the development of all forms  of property ownership. The state should not intervene directly  in economic management but only in the creation and regulation  of the kind of economic, organizational, and psychological  environment whose ultimate goal is a functioning, balanced  national economy. A multi-structural, socially-oriented market  economy will serve to prepare the groundwork promoting the  interests of all social strata (groups) and, in this way, the  attainment of social harmony in society, which is an essential  prerequisite for any revival of the country.    5. We endorse private and state ownership of the land. Only  household, vacation home, and garden plot lands should be turned  over to private ownership; all other lands should be owned only  by the state, which can transfer land to citizens on a lease or  permanent-use (possession) basis with the right of inheritance.  A land's owner as well as a land's lessee, whether physical or  legal persons, may themselves determine the form of production  and organization of labor (peasant farming, individual farm  operation, cooperative, partnership, state farm, or other).    6. The country needs its own currency, the use of which will  require the preparation of the necessary material, economic, and  organizational foundation. We endorse efforts to attract foreign  investment and the effective use thereof, initially through the  sale of stock shares, the creation of joint enterprises, the  acquisition and use of new technologies, and so on.    7. The privatization process is in need of state regulation.  We endorse the development of private property and the creation  of the legal, economic, and organizational basis as well as the  nurturing of entrepreneurial proprietors for the purpose. The  state must provide the protection of property and its owners.    8. The cornerstone of Georgia's political and  social-economic  development is the integrated development of the country's  regions. We believe it is essential to work out and implement  goal-oriented state programs for the social-economic development  of the various regions. They must take full account of the  specific character of local economic and cultural life,  prospects for the effective use of available resources, labor  traditions and customs, and so on.    9. In the interests of the various strata of society, a  clearly defined state social policy needs to be carried out. It  is essential to provide real guarantees of citizens' rights to  an education, health care, and social aid for certain categories  of the population (pensioners, college students, single mothers,  and invalids). State responsibility for scientific, cultural,  and educational development needs to be increased. And the  criminal practice of reckless experimentation in schools and  health care facilities must be condemned and stopped.    10. At the present stage, one of the most important tasks is  for the state to take care of our countrymen who have been  forced to abandon their homes and have become refugees in their  own homeland, also citizens who were robbed during the Civil  War. The state will have to create not only temporary,  elementary provisions for normal living but also, eventually,  pay for their lost property with appropriate material  compensation, because the people should not have to be liable  for the results of the adventurism of political circles.    11. The country needs to have a properly trained, properly  equipped [lines illegible] army and internal troops. Considering  the exceptionally difficult tasks (the disarming of [words  illegible] units and banded gangs) we believe it is possible to  enlist properly qualified citizens of other states for military  service on the basis of a temporary contract. In order to avoid  collusion between mafia-gangster and state structures, measures  need to be taken to purge state administrative and law  enforcement agencies of persons who have been besmirched by ties  to criminal elements, and strengthen and renovate the  material-technical and organizational base of state security and  internal affairs bodies.    12. In foreign relations, we endorse a policy of active  neutrality. At the same time, owing to the country's  geopolitical, historical, and economic characteristics, the  Russian Federation and the other republics of the former Soviet  Union will continue to be our country's chief partners in  political and social-economic spheres; naturally, this does not  rule out close relations with the world's other countries, in  particular those of the Black Sea Basin. Particular priority  must be given to the development of good-neighborly relations  with all the republics of Caucasia.    13. Our Society will actively cooperate with all  social/civic  or political organizations, promote the harmonization of the  goals and tasks of political parties and movements, and share  analytical information for the purpose of preparing shared views  as to the accomplishment of the tasks of the country's political  and economic development at the present stage, in order to  protect the interests of every stratum of society and eventually  attain social harmony.</p>

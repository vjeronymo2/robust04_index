			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Technology: China exports Torch Since China launched its Torch Programme in 1988, the cream of the country's 8m scientists and technicians has been mobilised in a big effort to exploit high technology. So far, the 100,000 specialists chosen by the State Science and Technology Commission have developed more than 1,500 industrial applications in new materials, biotechnology, electronics, information technology, energy saving and environmental protection. China is eager to reap more benefits from this effort by exporting new technology and finding foreign partners. Beijing is also keen to incorporate applications researched abroad into its own programme. Thus China recently established a joint venture (to be known as Torch Overseas or Torch Worldwide) with Micro Electronics International Europa, a supplier of Chinese-made telecommunications equipment based in Portugal. The new company will explore the market for Chinese technology, introduce advanced technology into China, supply equipment for high-tech production in China, foster joint ventures and promote foreign investment in Chinese projects. 'The Torch Programme is designed to take Chinese industry out of the 19th century into the 21st,' says Roman von Rupp, the Lisbon-based president of MEI Europa. 'The opportunities the programme offers to foreign companies are vast but most of the international business community has not yet become aware of it.' MEI manufactures telecommunications and other equipment in China, sometimes using Japanese technology. It has offices in Japan where it researches electronics projects. A Torch delegation visited universities and research centres in Lisbon last November. Chinese authorities are examining the market potential of two applications developed in Portugal - one uses halogen lamps to grow low-cost thin ribbons of crystalline silicon, the other is a computer program for public transport planning.</p>

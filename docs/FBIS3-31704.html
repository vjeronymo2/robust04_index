			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic by </F> correspondent Roger Horne in Washington on 22 February;  Silajdzic speaks in English with superimposed German translation  -- recorded]    [Text] [Horne] I am very glad to welcome the Bosnian prime  minister here at N-TV. Dr. Silajdic, are you, after the talks  you have held here in Washington today, and after the expiry of  the ultimatum, more optimistic?    [Silajdzic] Yes, the American involvement in this initiative  gives us hope. We believe that Bosnia is a global issue. It  must be viewed globally by the international community and, as  far as that international community is concerned, the United  States plays a leading role. We therefore believe that we are  closer to a solution than before.    [Horne] How do you see the Russian involvement?    [Silajdzic] Well, I think they have tried to come in rather  late to remain there in that theater. They were undoubtedly  much more committed to the Serb side than we had expected. They  are therefore lacking in objectivity in some cases, it has to be  said.    [Horne] Are you nevertheless not very disappointed over the  fact that NATO and the UN needed nearly 23 months for the  ultimatum and that so many people had to die in the meantime?    [Silajdzic] Yes, we have expressed our opinion about that.  We think that whatever is lost in Bosnia also applies to the  rest of the world. Much is at stake here -- democracy, human  rights, humanity, in short, civilization. We believe it is time  to state: better late than never. This applies to those forces  in Bosnia that are fighting for democracy and against aggressive  nationalism, which stand for order and do not embody chaos and  dictatorship. We expected the world to help us fight this evil,  but as I already said: better late than never.    [Horne] But, nevertheless, what are your expectations now?  The fighting continues, heavy weapons encircle Tuzla, Bihac,  Srebrenica, and Mostar?    [Silajdzic] We expect a peace settlement, a comprehensive  peace settlement that would ultimately make it possible to  withdraw those heavy weapons from the encircled towns in Bosnia.  But the main issue is the establishment of a permanent peace,  not an unjust, but a just peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The  latter cannot consist in moving guns 20 km away, for Sarajevo  and other towns remain besieged. The point is to establish  peace without rewarding aggression and genocide. I stress this  once again most strongly, for this is important, as we will  otherwise serve as an example for future adventurers and petty  dictatorships.    [Horne] Are you at all capable of still trusting people like  Milosevic and Karadzic, or do you believe that only force can  bring a peace agreement?    [Silajdzic] Trust people like them? I think they only  recognize force, just like any classroom bully who understands  only force. That is why we think that this NATO decision has  made it quite clear that force works.    [Horne] Talking about force, did you receive any guarantees  from the U.S. Government as far as the deployment of ground  troops operating under the UN flag is concerned?    [Silajdzic] Well, within the implementation, yes. Because a  serious implementation of the peace plan is not possible without  international guarantees. I believe that the international  community has much at stake in Bosnia. The implementation has  to take place with full NATO support. The UN, more or less by  decree, guarantees the status quo. It is neutral, whatever that  means. This has proven counterproductive so far. For this  reason we have to change the situation in Bosnia and other parts  of Europe. What counts is the credible threat of force: that is  now proved to be working.    [Horne] You have problems not just with the Bosnian Serbs  but  also with the Croats. There are efforts at present aimed at  bringing the both of you back to the negotiating table together  with the objective of creating a bloc against the Serbs. This  has already been attempted, although in vain.    [Silajdzic] Yes, you're right. Why didn't it work? Because  there was a basic assumption of the division of  Bosnia-Herzegovina between the Serbs and Croats. This made  agreement impossible, and the concept has to be changed  entirely. This is not 1939, when Bosnia was divided between  these two. There must be a very serious attempt to reconsider  this concept and to accept the fact that Bosnia is not a  territory for grabs, but a state and must be dealt with that way.    [Horne] Mr. Prime Minister, what do expect in the  humanitarian sector from Europe now, and more precisely from  Germany?    [Silajdzic] Well, unfortunately we have to continue that and  I'm afraid that we are facing a dramatic humanitarian crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. We don't want to be the welfare recipient,  the international welfare recipient here. But we must consider  that, because it is the guilt of the European nations that  things happened this way. We had an arms embargo, we could not  defend ourselves, so now they must have a welfare state on their  hands. We will try to get out of this situation as soon as  possible. As for Germany, they have taken care of a lot of our  own people and we do appreciate that fact.    [Horne] Mr. Prime Minister, many thanks and best wishes for  the people in your country.</p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Texas Rangers owner Eddie Chiles said he has agreed to sell his majority shares  to a group led by George W. Bush, the President's son.  </P> <P> Chiles twice had tried to sell the team to Edward L. Gaylord, but each attempt  was rejected by American League owners, who were concerned about his ownership  of Gaylord Broadcasting.  </P> <P> Gaylord, who owns 33% of the team, must approve the sale. In addition, approval  is needed from both leagues, but that is expected to be routine.  </P> <P> No purchase price was announced, but Chiles, who will remain chairman of the  board, said Bush had agreed to keep the team in Texas.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARTICLE ON THOMAS DIDN'T TELL IT ALL  </P> <P> I read the article on CIF Southern Section Commissioner Stan Thomas (Dec. 10)  with great interest. As Mark Landsbaum points out, Thomas has done remarkable  work at resolving some of the knotty problems of Southern California athletics.  </P> <P> What Landsbaum doesn't say, however, is even more important -- how the  commissioner fulfills his important duties. By that, I mean how much Stan  Thomas has done to promote and make possible the educational value of athletics  for all youngsters.  </P> <P> Thomas is a rare commissioner of high school athletics, one who pays just as  close attention to the value of athletic competition for all students as he  does to the superior programs and highly sought-after athletes.  </P> <P> Teachers and high school administrators throughout Southern California should  be grateful that he brings these unique qualities to the commissioner's office.  </P> <P> WILLARD G. WYMAN  </P> <P> Headmaster, the Thacher School  </P> <P> Ojai  </P></p>

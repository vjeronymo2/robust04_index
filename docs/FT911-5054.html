			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Exports bill provision deleted - ECGD GOVERNMENT assurances that exporters had nothing to fear from the absence of a specific statutory commitment to maintain a reinsurance facility covering exports to areas of political risk were questioned from both sides of the Commons last night. Ms Joyce Quin, from the Labour front bench, said 'nothing less than a statutory commitment' in the Export and Investment Guarantees Bill would be acceptable to industry. The bill was given a third reading by a majority of 87 (281-194) and now goes to the Lords. A claim by Mr Tim Sainsbury, trade minister, that it was impossible to frame a provision to satisfy the needs of commercial interests without exposing the government to unacceptable risks was also challenged by Mr Robert McCrindle (C Brentwood and Ongar). A parliamentary consultant to the British Insurance Brokers Association, Mr McCrindle urged the government to give the issue further consideration with a view to introducing an amendment in the Lords. Ms Quin appealed to independently minded Conservative peers to take account of the views of industry and to join the opposition in seeking to remedy the bill's defects. Mr Sainsbury successfully called for the deletion from the bill of a provision intended to ensure the continuance of a reinsurance facility for areas of political risk when elements of the Export Credits Guarantee Department are privatised. The provision - defeated by 97 votes (285-188) - was inserted on a government defeat during its committee stage. Mr Sainsbury argued that MPs and business organisations supporting the inclusion of such a provision had failed to appreciate the safeguards which the government had already agreed to put in place. He stressed that the part of the ECGD remaining in state control would provide support to supplement the reinsurance which the privatised company would secure in the private market. This would be a temporary facility available for up to three years after privatisation.</p>

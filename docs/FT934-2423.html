			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Observer: Washington's Seitz US secretary of state Warren Christopher has a pressing task: to find a deputy to succeed Clifton Wharton, summarily disposed of last month. He has a few names in the hat but it's reasonable to think Raymond Seitz, currently ambassador in London, is in with a fair chance. Christopher is said to be looking for an experienced career diplomat. Seitz is certainly that. He also has the advantage of early availability; next year retired Admiral William Crowe takes over in London. Two other contenders - Tom Pickering and Stapleton Roy  - occupy the hot spots of Moscow and Beijing respectively and may be difficult to move. Another veteran diplomat, Morton Abramowitz, now running the Carnegie Endowment in Washington, has ruled himself out because of sharp disagreement with US policies in Bosnia. But Michael Armacost, former US Ambassador in Japan, is free. Whoever gets the nod still faces confirmation by the Senate, which has been sticky with nominations this year. President Clinton has ineffectually complained about the Senate's sluggish ways. So far this year he has sent 618 candidates for the top 957 jobs; but only 465 are in place.</p>

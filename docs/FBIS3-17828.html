According to him, the Black  Sea Fleet is equipped with outdated rocket weaponry of the  former USSR, some of which is no longer produced by the  industry. In the past seven to 10 years, scheduled maintenance  of the rocket artillery weapons has not been performed, and only  emergency repairs and renovations have been conducted. The  average age of the ships is 15-20 years, and no money has been  allocated lately for their servicing. No new ships have been  added to the Black Sea Fleet in the past few years, while  modernization and reequipment of the existing ships, considering  their old age, does not look justifiable. According to Oleksiy  Ryzhenko, [words indistinct] five submarines, 20 auxiliary  vessels, and five special task ships of the Black Sea Fleet are  currently being repaired at Ukraine's shipyards. Another 77  ships and vessels are due to be sent for repair.    The rear admiral said that the intensity and quality of  combat training has suffered a drop for a number of reasons,  while "the occasional appearance of 20-25 ships does not prove  the power or combat readiness of the Black Sea Fleet. One  cannot seriously say that this fleet is a guarantor of CIS  security," Oleksiy Ryzhenko believes.</p>

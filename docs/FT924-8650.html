			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / ICI demerger is on course for 1993, confirms chairman SIR DENYS Henderson, chair-man of Imperial Chemical Industries, yesterday confirmed that the organisational split of the group's pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and specialities businesses into a separate company was on track. He said the new company would be fully formed as a subsidiary of ICI by January 1, 1993. A final decision to go ahead with the demerger of the group into two separately quoted companies would be made at the February meeting of the ICI board, said Sir Denys. The board would look at the financial position of the whole company and forecasts for the group's performance next year. Sir Denys, speaking in Taiwan where ICI was opening a Pounds 150m facility, declined to comment on whether ICI would maintain its full-year dividend. The board would also consider the state of the stock market to establish whether it would be possible to issue fresh shares in the bioscience company, he said. Analysts believe most of ICI's liabilities would be given to the bioscience group, freeing the bulk chemicals operations from debt. The bioscience businesses would then issue shares to clear their debt and raise cash for possible acquisitions. Sir Denys warned that the pharmaceutical division's operating profits next year would be flat. The division generated trading profits of Pounds 538m last year, equivalent to 52 per cent of ICI's total pre-tax profit on 12 per cent of group sales. Next year agrochemicals would improve on poor performance during 1992, he added. 'There's a lot of money looking for quality stocks,' he said. 'As a company, the bioscience business should be quite attractive - in fact, that is British under-statement, they should be very attractive.' The bioscience company, which had previously been referred to as ICI Bioscience, would be renamed to create a new identity, said Sir Denys. Details of the progress of the demerger process will be given on November 18. Sir Denys denied that advanced corporation tax would prove a stumbling block to the demerger. ICI did not face an unrelieved ACT problem yet, although at some stage it would happen because the group generates more than 80 per cent of its turnover outside the UK. Risky gamble, Page 4</p>

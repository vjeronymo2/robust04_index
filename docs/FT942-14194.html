			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Arrival of second generation Concorde is only a question of time Sir, The FT's normally perceptive attitude towards technological development (one of its instructive and welcome features) was woefully, uncharacteristically and surprisingly lacking in its negative, anti-SST leading article 'Supersonic subsidies' (April 11). As the history of science and transport makes clear, in due course a dramatic advance on Concorde - larger, of longer range, quieter, environmentally acceptable and of much better economics - will certainly be funded, developed and introduced, profitably, by the world's big airlines on to intercontinental routes. The question is not 'if', but 'when'. Experience - and Concorde (first flown 25 years ago in 1969) - has shown that, at the competitive fares which can, and must, be achieved for its successor, a wide market exists for non-stop services over longer distances, with flying times cut to less than half those of subsonic jets. Hence, the current joint studies by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale and Dasa for an eventual, but by no means final, successor to Concorde is a logical, sensible and commercially profitable advance along the path of human progress. During the past 38 years, there have been dramatic advances in all aspects of supersonic technology: in materials, structures, systems, aerodynamics and computer-controlled engine characteristics and performance. Aeronautical progress, only glimpsed when Concorde first flew, will not be cast aside, nor left to become no more than history. Fortunately - as with earlier aircraft - the service lives of existing Concordes can be extended, usefully and safely, into the next century through the process of computerised continuous maintenance. Thus there need be no gap in supersonic transatlantic services while the next generation of SSTs is explored, developed and brought on stream, to follow the next series of much larger, subsonic aircraft.

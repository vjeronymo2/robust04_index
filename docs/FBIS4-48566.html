			<p>BFN     [Text] Kinshasa, 20 May (AFP) -- The Rwandan ambassador to  Zaire today criticized the way current events in his country are  portrayed by the international media, which he accuses of "being  oddly indulgent toward the rebels."    Mr. Etienne Sengegera stated in a communique that the media,  "manipulated and/or misinformed by supporters and sponsors of  the Rwandan Patriotic Front -- rebels from the Tutsi minority  group -- have remained silent over the numerous atrocities that  these rebels, who have moved up the ladder working alongside  Ugandan President Museveni -- a former underground leader --  have committed as they wage their dirty war in Rwanda."    Furthermore, Mr. Sengegera said "President Museveni's  proteges lose no time in burying their victims in mass graves.  They take care to photograph and film them for their pernicious  propaganda, with the aim of deceiving the international  community by presenting the Hutus thus massacred as Tutsis who  are the victims of a so-called genocide."</p>

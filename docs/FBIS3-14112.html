In a cable sent to leader President Saddam Husayn on the  Nauruz festivities, the Political Bureau added that the  Kurdistan Democratic Party seizes the opportunity granted by  this noble occasion to extend to his excellency the leader  president the most sublime, sincere, and heartfelt  congratulations, and beseeches God Almighty to go grant him  continued good health, to protect him as an asset for all free  people, and to render the Nauruz a feast on which the will of  the well-meaning Kurds will triumph against the forces of  agentry and deception associated with the United States, the  enemy of mankind. The clique of agents and traitors has flouted  all honorable values. It is indifferent to the harm caused to  the Kurdistan Region and the Iraqi people, and to the injustice  and wrong done them.    The Political Bureau of the Kurdistan Democratic Party  added:  On Nauruz, Jawal Haddath, a righteous son of the Kurdish  people, brandished his sword in the face of the tyrant Izdahak  al-Dahhak to end his tyranny and bring about security and  stability throughout Kurdistan. At present, you are the hero of  the age. You have set an example for free men of the world.  And here you are brandishing your sword, the sword of right, in  the face of the unscrupulous tyrants, atheistic infidels, and  all misled agents and traitors in defense of not only the Iraqi  people, but also tortured humanity and free people of the world,  who are suffering at the hands of the tyrannical ones. You have  triumphed against them. Hence, the eternal annals of history  will document your bright and heroic feats.    The cable went on to say: It is true that the agents have  rendered the situation in Kurdistan intolerable due to the  lawlessness and sabotage they have caused to serve their  masters. But, it remains to be said that your Kurdish people  will continue to honor their pledge. They will remain sleepless  until Kurdistan restores its security and stability and kicks  out traitors and their masters so that it may return to the laps  of the homeland, joyful and proud. The day of victory is  imminent. Neither the unfair embargo, nor the machinations of  colonialists, or the treason of traitors are capable of bringing  your Iraqi people, be they Arabs or Kurds, to their knees. The  Iraqi people will continue to hold their heads high. The  banners of pride, glory, and dignity will continue to flutter  throughout Iraq as long as you are its leader.</p>

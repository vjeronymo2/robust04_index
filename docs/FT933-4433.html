			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / A Russian Perot urges end to chaos MR Yuri Skokov, a former head of Russia's Security Council yesterday presented himself as the effective leader of a new political grouping which calls for an end to political wrangling. Mr Skokov, a figure often tipped as a future saviour of his country, is counting on support from the majority of people presumed to be sick of politics and politicians. With the support of Mr Nikolai Travkin, leader of the Democratic Party and Mr Oleg Poptsov, chairman of Russian Television, Mr Skokov said yesterday the group, called Agreement for the Motherland, would organise a gathering of 'the peoples and citizens of Russia' next month. He said the intellectual potential of the country must be harnessed to find a way through the political deadlock gripping Russia, which is preventing either reforms or reaction. Mr Skokov's group, which won immediate support from Mr Yevgenny Kozhokin, head of the parliament's Security and Intelligence Committee and from Mr Ramazan Abdulatipov, chairman of the House of Nationalities in the Russian Parliament, stands for 'an evolutionary path to a federal, democratic and law-governed state'. 'People are tired of conflict,' he said. 'What we offer is self-preservation, survival.' The group, which has caused a stir in the capital because of Mr Skokov's reputation as a shadowy figure of the corridors of power, is one of several competing and mobile alliances now manoeuvring for popular and financial support before elections which are expected to be called this autumn or, more likely, next spring. Leading figures such as Mr Yegor Gaidar, the former prime minister, Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the vice president (currently suspended), Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, the leading economist, and Mr Sergei Shakhrai, the deputy prime minister, are criss-crossing the country addressing meetings and giving interviews. With the exception of Mr Gaidar, whose 'Russia's Choice' bloc is proposing free market policies, and the neo-nationalists and neo-communists who have formed a delicate alliance, most of the groups are vying for the centre ground. Mr Skokov's base is in the regions, where he is assumed to command a good deal of support. He has said that his group is being funded by donations from 20 regional councils. As a man so far untouched by scandal or allegations of corruption, and with strong links to the Soviet period which is now seen in a positive light by many, he could become a rallying figure for those disenchanted with the democrats who support Mr Yeltsin but find the nationalist/communist alliance too strong a dish, even in today's chaotic society.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Mediator Dante Caputo supports the settlement  plan to solve the Haitian crisis, presented last week in  Washington by Haitian legislators of various leanings. This  miniplan is not global, he says, and does not replace the  Governors Island accord; but it constitutes a significant  development because it was suggested by both opponents and  supporters of Aristide. This statement was made by Caputo during  a press conference on 22 February at the UN Headquarters.  [passage omitted]    It should be noted that this plan, which was rejected by  President Aristide, is supported by the United States and  provides for the nomination of a new prime minister, the  anticipated retirement of the Army commander in chief, and  amnesty for the military who overthrew Jean-Bertrand Aristide in  September 1991.    In a letter addressed on Sunday to the UN Security Council,  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali implicitly supported the  plan of the Haitian legislators. Caputo said that he was waiting  for President Aristide's response to the legislators' initiative  that was communicated to the UN secretary general during the  past weekend. However, during a meeting in Washington with the  legislators last week, President Aristide had rejected the plan  which does not set an effective date for his return to power.    Some of his concerns are totally legitimate and we think  that  the international community could answer to them, states Caputo.    The mediator noted Jean-Bertrand Aristide's cooperation  while  specifying that the president in exile is concerned about the  means implemented in order to overcome the deadlock and the  necessity to avoid the kinds of experiences which in the past  did not yield the expected results, he said.    On 21 February, President Aristide once more asked the  international community to reinforce the sanctions against Haiti  in order to compel the military to leave power.    Mediator Caputo considered that the international sanctions  are a means to favor a solution to the crisis and not a solution  in themselves. However, he added that if the nondemocratic  sectors in Haiti continue to block the situation, new sanctions  will probably be imposed by the Security Council.</p>

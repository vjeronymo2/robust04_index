			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Tokyo stores suffer decline DEPARTMENT store sales in Tokyo - an early indicator of Japanese consumer spending - declined in real terms in February for the third month running, the Japan Department Stores Association said yesterday, writes Steven Butler in Tokyo. Sales for the month totalled Y191.9bn (Pounds 835m), with a reported 0.2 per cent increase from a year ago accounted for by the extra day in February this year. The figures provided further evidence that continued strong consumer spending may fail to underpin the otherwise weak Japanese economy, as many economists had hoped. Clothing sales were up modestly by 0.6 per cent, household goods rose by 1.6 per cent while foodstuffs were 7 per cent up, while miscellaneous goods were off by 5.3 per cent.</p>

			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Management: Bowing to pressure and the corporate hierarchy / A look at how public humiliation is part of business life for junior employees in Japan Japanese management style is often described as Confucian in concept and family-like in feel, with an enlightened manager deftly and sensitively handling crises, inspiring corporate loyalty and, as the Chinese sage put it, 'cultivating his own character such that he can govern other men'. But closer scrutiny of the crisis-handling techniques of managers at large Japanese companies suggests that Confucius would definitely disapprove of their readiness to show anger and of the apparently common practice of openly condemning younger employees who have erred. A research affiliate of the Ministry of Labour surveyed 3,359 companies, large and small, to gather information on whether managers were coping with shinjinrui, younger Japanese employees who come equipped with broader outlooks on life and, reputedly, less devotion to the corporate cause. In dealing with a young employee's fictional 'failure' in the workplace, managers were asked to choose suitable responses. Instead of subtlety and sensitivity, 39.1 per cent chose 'a public scolding' and 48.2 per cent selected 'a scolding in a separate room'. Only 18 per cent of managers would 'comfort' the mistake maker, and 16.9 per cent would pass on sage advice at a bar or restaurant. However, just over 3 per cent said they would be incapable of saying anything, while 10.4 per cent would use a third person to deliver the criticism. The sometimes harsh methods of dealing with young employees were also highlighted in the advice columns of the Yomiuri Shimbun, the leading Japanese daily. A young women, describing herself as an employee of a large trading house, complained that she was routinely scolded and humiliated by her section chief. She was advised to examine her behaviour and alter it to reduce tension in the office. One motive for the public scolding is to maintain a clear definition of the corporate hierarchy, putting the younger worker in his or her place, and reaffirming the power of the manager. A 27-year-old who resigned from a Japanese brokerage house expressed frustration at the constant pressure to 'know his place', which he saw as attempt to force younger employees into accepting corporate goals by limiting their perceived options. 'You could see people changing because of this pressure. They were made to feel very small. I couldn't accept that,' the former securities house employee said. The hierarchy is physically reinforced in the Japanese office, as the section chief has a desk perpendicular to a long row of desks at which lower-ranked employees sit. In that position, the manager 'overlooks' the section, allowing him - only 2.3 per cent are women - to issue orders in a manner confirming and asserting his authority. Younger workers are generally expected to wait for their turn at the top table and are told to regard their early years as a kind of 'boot camp' at which the rough edges are removed. There has been increasing debate about the need to reward merit and encourage 'creativity', but that movement was partly stimulated by concern about securing staff in the midst of a labour shortage. The souring of the economy and the easing of that shortage have prompted a return to traditional desk arrangements and techniques. Even managers are under pressure, with companies such as Pioneer Electronic, the audio and video equipment maker, cutting costs by forcing senior staff to take early retirement packages. Rather than larger companies setting management standards, small and medium-sized enterprises appear to be more enlightened, at least according to the survey findings. Within larger companies, 10.4 per cent more managers would prefer to scold an employee openly than to retire to a separate room - the trend was reversed at smaller companies. Mari Okutsu, planning manager at the Japan Vocational Ability Development Association which conducted the survey, said she was initially surprised that larger companies appeared to treat employees more harshly but, after further thought, concluded that the criticism was commonplace and not likely to disrupt the working environment. 'The relationships between employees and managers at smaller companies are deeper and so they would choose to discuss problems in a room. Relationships are more professional in a large company, roles are more clearly defined and scoldings are common,' said Okutsu. Managers are trying to deepen their contacts with younger staff, some of whom enter a company determined not to become a dutiful, old-style manager. Conversation may be a problem. The survey found that 77 per cent of managers like to talk to staff about hobbies or recreation, 59 per cent chat about work and 24 per cent discuss 'life and living', presumably after a few water-weakened whiskies.</p>

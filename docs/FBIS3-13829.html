			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Nirmin Murad] </F>   [Text] Amman--Jordan will await a consensus among Arab  parties to Middle East peace negotiations before it takes final  decision on resuming rounds of bilateral talks in Washington,  Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani told the JORDAN TIMES  Saturday [19 March].    Dr. al-'Anani said that the decision to "cut short"  bilateral  talks in the U.S. capital in protest after the Feb. 25 massacre  of Palestinian worshipers in Hebron by an extremist Jewish  settler was taken within an Arab context and had to be similarly  reversed.    "We need an Arab decision," Dr. al-'Anani said. His comments  came after a cabinet meeting Saturday during which details of a  United Nations Security Council resolution condemning the Hebron  massacre were discussed.    Dr. al-'Anani said the Kingdom welcomed the Security  Council's resolution condemning the massacre but expressed  reservations over Washington's decision to abstain from voting  on the part of the resolution that described Arab East Jerusalem  as Israeli-occupied territory.    "We hope that the Israeli statements that Jerusalem is the  eternal capital of Israel have not received a boost by the  American vote," said Dr. al-'Anani.    He said that Jordan had been made to understand that the  U.S.  abstention "was in line with what they said was the terms of the  Oslo agreement which relegates the negotiations over Jerusalem  to final status talks."    "But our position is that Jerusalem is an occupied territory  regardless of when its final status is to be negotiated," Dr.  al-'Anani added,    The minister, however, described the resolution, passed late  Friday after weeks of haggling, as a "good decision."    He said that the resolution provided positive stipulations  protecting the Palestinians in the occupied territories.    Dr. al-'Anani added that Jordan "viewed positively" the  resolution's call for accelerating the peace process and  reiteration of the applicability of the 1949 Fourth Geneva  Convention to the territories occupied by Israel in June 1967  including Jerusalem.    A source in Jordan's delegation to the peace talks said an  announcement by U.S. Ambassador Madeline Albright that Jordan,  Syria and Lebanon had agreed to resume negotiations with Israel  in April "is inaccurate."    The source, who asked for anonymity, said that Jordan's  decision to consult with its Arab partners before resuming  negotiations "does not mean that Jordan will not return" to the  negotiating table in April as was announced by the U.S. envoy.  [sentence as published]    The Kingdom, along with Syria and Lebanon, "only took a  decision to cut short a round of bilateral talks between the  heads of the negotiating teams in Washington in February." The  three teams left the U.S. capital three days before the  scheduled end of that round.    At the time, Jordanian sources said that the negotiators  were  not expected to return to Washington before April mostly to  accommodate religious holidays of the Muslims and Christians in  March and early April.</p>

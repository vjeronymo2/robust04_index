			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, June 22 (XINHUA) -- A new joint venture  container company has been set up in Tianjin, north China's  biggest industrial center.    The company, co-financed by the Tianjin port and a container  firm of the Republic of Korea, is the thirtieth joint venture to  be built in the port.    The port now has eight container berths capable of handling  over one million containers yearly.    The container turnover time has been shortened to 21 days  from the previous 45 days due to a land-and-water coordinated  transport system with more than 120 inland container relay  stations built in Baotou, Zhengzhou, Xian, Chengdu, Yinchuan and  Lanzhou cities.    The company has opened over 50 water routes for scheduled  container shipments to more than 160 countries and regions  around the world.</p>

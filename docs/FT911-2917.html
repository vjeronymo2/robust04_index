			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Airlines resist weakness despite quarterly losses Wall Street A SERIES of computerised sell programmes, including a particularly large one in the morning which knocked almost 20 points off the leading index, left share prices sharply lower yesterday in a market depressed by its inability to recover from recent weakness, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 28.47 down at 2,921.04. The broader based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fell 3.51 to 379.25, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks receded 2.42 to 496.03. New York SE turnover remained on the low side, totalling 167m shares again, with declining stocks outpacing advances by 956 to 569. Among airline issues, Delta and UAL showed resilience to the downtrend in spite of reporting large losses for the first quarter, which were in line with market expectations. Delta unveiled an operating deficit of Dollars 500.6m, against a profit of Dollars 309m a year earlier, but the shares gained Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 71 7/8 . UAL announced an operating loss of Dollars 268.9m, compared with a loss of Dollars 47.2m in the first quarter of 1990, and rose initially before receding to end just a net Dollars  1/8 off at Dollars 159 1/4 . Hopes that demand for air travel will recover as economic activity in the US picks up has helped airline shares to perform well in spite of dreadful quarterly earnings, and both UAL and Delta stand just below their 52-week highs. Compaq Computer plunged Dollars 9 3/8 to Dollars 52 1/4 on 6.4m shares traded after stating that its second quarter profit for this year would probably be below the Dollars 1.18 a share of the second quarter of 1990. Data General displayed a more buoyant mood, advancing Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 17 7/8 on turnover of 1.6m shares. The company said yesterday that it expected to report a Dollars 13m gain in fiscal third quarter earnings because of the sale of a unit in Japan. In the second quarter the company earned a profit of 60 cents a share, compared with a 29 cents a share loss a year ago. Wednesday's decision by an Alaskan district court judge to reject a plea agreement between Exxon and the Justice Department over the Exxon Valdez oil spill sent the stock sliding Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 59 1/8 . Although Exxon has just reported a 75 per cent jump in quarterly income, the market believes the decision exposes the company to a far bigger fine than the Dollars 100m originally agreed with the government. Diagnostek moved ahead Dollars 2 to Dollars 20 1/4 after the company signed a pact with the Teamsters Union to provide prescription drugs by mail. Canada TORONTO closed with a slightly easier bias after moderate trading. The composite index lost 2.1 to 3,502.0, while declines edged out rises by 301 to 224. Volume came to 25.3m shares. Mining issues fell 1.35 per cent, while golds dropped 2.35 per cent as the bullion price lost USDollars 2 an ounce in New York. BCE, unchanged at CDollars 40 3/4 , reported higher first-quarter earnings. Alcan, which declined CDollars  7/8 to CDollars 24 1/2 , said over-capacity in world aluminium inventories may force it to cut production. The company added that if economic conditions do not improve it may have to reduce capital spending.</p>

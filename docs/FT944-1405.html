			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / International Company News: Beneficial takes Dollars 38m charge on German unit Beneficial, the US financial services company, is to take a Dollars 38m charge to cover potential losses at its German subsidiary, BFK Bank, as part of the process of preparing the unit for sale. BFK faces losses on a block of loans made to German consumers to finance the purchase of camp sites. The German government is investigating charges that the relationship between the consumers and the seller, the German financial group Fundus Grundstuecks, was not as represented to BFK, according to Beneficial. Mr Finn Caspersen, Beneficial's chief executive, said he expected the charge to cover any losses related to the campground loans. 'Our intention is to clear the deck and clarify BFK's financial situation for potential sale,' he said. 'While this charge is a shame in that it ruins our consolidated results for the fourth quarter, the essential fact remains that our basic business in the US, Canada and the UK remains vibrant.' He cited BFK's 'failure to achieve profitability up to the corporate standard' as the main reason for the sale. The German subsidiary, which provides consumer loans, currently has DM798m (Dollars 508.3m) in accounts receivable. Beneficial is pulling out of Germany just as another US company, GE Capital, enters it. The financial services subsidiary of General Electric last week took control of Service Bank, the finance arm of Kaufhof store group.</p>

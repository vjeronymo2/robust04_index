			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS-KAZTAG] </F>   [Text] Tokyo 7 April, TASS -- Kazakhstan stands for  creating a unified economic space of all former Soviet republics  in which, as "it is taking place in the European Community, the  states would help each other, and our similar economies would  carry out reforms jointly," Kazakh President Nursultan  Nazarbayev, who is in Japan on an official visit, said on  Thursday.    "I have already made a relevant proposal for creating the  economic union, and now it largely depends on the leaders of the  Commonwealth of Independent States," Nazarbayev said at a  meeting in the federation of Japan's economic organisations,  refferring to his idea of an Euro-Asian union.    He believes that the new structure can "help CIS states at  least during modernization of their economies." Goods, which  are produced now in the former Soviet Union, are competitive  only on the domestic markets of CIS because of their low  quality."    Nazarbayev pointed out that he had always stood for economic  integration, and expanding of relations but not for their  elimination, which finally led to the economic collapse in the  former Soviet Union. "What the politicians made was like cutting  off arms and legs from a living organism, lives of millions of  people become worse," he said.    Two years ago, the creation of the Commonwealth of  Independent States was essential to promote a relatively  peaceful separation within the framework of the former Soviet  Union, though some states failed to avoid victims, according to  Nazarbayev.</p>

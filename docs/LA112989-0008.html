			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLEAN UP THE SWEATSHOPS  </P> <P> Sweatshops are generations old in the garment industry, where extreme  competitiveness among clothing manufacturers melds with the needs of immigrants  to scrape out even the meanest of livings. Traditional enforcement has focused  on unannounced sweeps by inspectors from one sweatshop to another, looking for  wage, child labor, home sewing, overtime and other violations.  </P> <P> But, as a recent Times series pointed out, many sweatshops that had been  concentrated in downtown Los Angeles are moving to the suburbs and Orange  County. That makes the task of those charged with protecting such workers  harder still.  </P> <P> Overwhelmingly female Latina and Asian immigrants, they toil either in small  industrial parks or rent sewing machines to work in their own homes. Few know  that commercial home sewing violates both state and federal laws. Nearly all  work for far less than the minimum wage. Some get their children to help. But  workers seldom speak up about wages or working conditions for fear of being  fired. Some also fear deportation; still others are silent because they  illegally supplement their incomes with welfare payments.  </P> <P> The system that breeds such misery must be attacked on many fronts. Gov. George  Deukmejian -- who had dismantled Cal/OSHA before it was reinstated last  November by a vote of the people -- has never made enforcement of labor laws a  priority. So the state must do more to enforce laws already on the books to  protect workers, especially those who work at home.  </P> <P> The U.S. Department of Labor's Wage &amp; Hour Division in Santa Ana has dusted  off a 1938 "hot goods" statute forbidding shipment across state lines of any  product made in violation of federal labor laws. Using the law, authorities are  cracking down on four Los Angeles manufacturers who were shipping to retailers  "hot goods" made in Orange County sweatshops that allegedly violated minimum  wage and other laws. That's a good start.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration also must abandon its effort to lift a 47-year-old ban  on sewing women's clothes in the home. Garment union officials, testifying on  the proposal in Los Angeles last spring, said that if the ban were lifted, even  more women would be vulnerable to unscrupulous and exploitative contractors.  </P> <P> There is another way to get at the problem: Manufacturers who knowingly  cooperate with contractors who hire workers at illegally low wages should be  publicly exposed. Then retail buyers -- who have no other way of telling under  what circumstances the clothes they buy are made -- can exert pressure on the  manufacturers to clean up their act.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Suit Over Canceled S&amp;L Bonuses: A former attorney for Imperial Savings  Assn. has sued the federal government, charging that the agency responsible for  cleaning up the S&amp;L mess deprived executives of the failed thrift of $1  million in bonuses. In a class-action suit in federal court, Jack Cohen alleged  that the Resolution Trust Corp. broke the law because directors of the thrift's  parent company approved the bonuses before its seizure.  </P></p>

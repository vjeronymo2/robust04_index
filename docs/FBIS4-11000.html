			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Homero Campa] </F>   [Excerpt] Havana--[passage omitted]  <H5>  Love in Times of the Special Period </H5>   The studies titled "Preliminary Analysis of Consensual  Unions  in Cuba" and "Characterization of Some Trends in the Formation  of Couples and Families in the Young Population," written by the  Family Task Force of the Center for Psychological and  Sociological Research (CIPS) of the Cuban Academy of Sciences,  and statistics from the United Nations Population Fund (UNPF)  reveal some facts on love and couple relations among young  people on the island.    Here are some of them:    In 1992 (by which time the crisis was already full blown),  191,800 couples got married, all in civil ceremonies. Church  marriages are so rare that they do not appear in any statistics.  (The Family Department of the Archbishopric of Havana estimates  that there are about 2,000 in the entire country, which amounts  to one percent of civil marriages.) The marriage rate is 18.2  per 1,000 inhabitants, a significant increase over the 7.1 per  1,000 reported in 1980.    The government gives each newlywed couple a package of goods  and services that are difficult to obtain by other means these  days: a wedding cake, three cases of beer, an order of "hors  d'oeuvres," and a chance to go to a special store and buy  products such as sheets, towels, irons, pressure cookers,  underwear, etc. That is, if they are in stock.    In addition, for their honeymoon it gives them a reservation  for two nights and three days at a hotel or house located on the  beach.    On weekends, couples flock to Marriage Palaces--old mansions  adapted for the purpose--and upon emerging, are greeted with  hugs and kisses from small family groups. "We do not throw rice  because there is none, but we do give out applause and  congratulations," says Antonia Vazquez, mother of the  18-year-old bride Odalis Lugo, who is already on her second  marriage.    The bride and groom usually wear wedding attire rented from  the state. Recently, it also became possible for "private  parties" to rent such clothing to make a living, at 350 pesos  for a bridal gown (the monthly wage of a medical specialist) and  200 pesos for the groom's suit. Some couples also rent  cars--1950's-era convertible Fairlanes and Cadillacs decorated  with balloons--that lead noisy caravans through the streets of  Havana.    Although the increase in the number of weddings is  considerable, it is not disturbing. According to the CIPS study,  it is within worldwide norms. The significant thing is that for  every 100 marriages, there are more than 80 couples living in  common-law relationships; for every five married women, there  are four living in common-law relationships. These "consensual  unions" are particularly frequent among young people under the  age of 20, and it is disturbing when they occur between  teenagers under the age of 15; in the last decade there has been  an increase of 100 percent in these. In other words, many young  people in Cuba do not believe in marriage.    In Cuba, according to the study, common-law relationships  are  concentrated in the eastern part of the island (Las Tunas,  Holguin, Santiago de Cuba and Guantanamo), especially among  mulattoes and mestizos and, in general, among low-income and  unemployed persons.  <H5>  Love and Affection </H5>   But if marriage is easy in Cuba, divorce is even easier. All  that is required is 100 pesos, the papers, and the presence of  one of the spouses. Between 1955 (prior to the revolution) and  1988, the marriage rate multiplied 2.8 times. During that same  period, the divorce rate increased 12.5-fold. According to data  from the UNPF, there is one divorce for every four marriages.  "Nowadays," says the CIPS study, "Cuba has one of the highest  divorce rates in the world. It is 3.4 per 1,000 inhabitants,  exceeded only by the United States (4.8) and Puerto Rico (4.2)."    Fifty percent of divorces occur within the first two years  of  the marriage, and in general, among young people under 30.  Recently, youths between the ages of 15 and 20 have begun  divorcing much more frequently, as much as five times more.    According to a CIPS study, young people who start families  do  not have enough information about contraceptives. The pregnancy  rate among teenage girls is growing by the day. For every 1,000  women under the age of 20, there were 57.1 pregnancies. These  women dropped out of school, became isolated from their  contemporaries or were unable to spend free time with them, and  "became detached from the political-social activities aimed at  that age group."    Abortion is not prohibited in Cuba. Health authorities try  to  discourage women from using it as a birth-control method, and  provide guidance to prevent pregnancy. Nevertheless, every day  dozens of "regulations of the menstrual cycle" and  "interruptions of pregnancies" are performed in maternity  hospitals. Most of the women receiving them are under the age of  20. They go to these hospitals accompanied by their partners or  their mothers.    The CIPS study states: "Abortion is a woman's right, but  tolerance of its use as a contraceptive method poses an ethical  problem that should be confronted by society, by the family, and  by the couple themselves."    And it offers these statistics: "Forty-five percent of  pregnancies are interrupted, and 81.8 abortions occur for every  100 deliveries."    Normally, marital conflicts between Cubans are due to the  couple's lack of information, the lack of understanding of what  marriage is all about, the young age of the spouses, and their  limited education. Many weddings are "forced by the parents,"  and another factor is the poor conditions in which the couples  live: the shortage of funds, unemployment, the lack of a home of  their own, and other conditions.    Indeed, the housing shortage is a decisive factor. In view  of  the lack of housing in Cuba, especially in Havana, newlyweds  have to live as "add-ons"--that is the way Cubans say what we in  Mexico call "keeping company"--with the parents of one of them.  It is not rare for a small house to hold the parents, their  single children, the married children and their spouses, and the  grandchildren. [passage omitted]</p>

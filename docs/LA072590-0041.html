			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS CREATE AN AGENCY TO PLACE SALES TAX ON BALLOT;  </P> <P> FINANCES: HALF-CENT INCREASE WOULD RAISE $423 MILLION A YEAR FOR NEW JAILS.  SCHABARUM OPPOSES PLAN AND ACCUSES HIS COLLEAGUES OF 'SHAM.'  </P> <P> Los Angeles County supervisors Tuesday created an agency to place a half-cent  sales tax increase on the November ballot to pay for new jails.  </P> <P> Supervisor Pete Schabarum accused his colleagues of creating a "sham" agency to  get around the requirement of Proposition 13 for two-thirds voter approval for  a tax increase.  </P> <P> Richard B. Dixon, the county's chief administrative officer, recommended  seeking approval of the tax increase. He said that raising the sales tax by  half a cent to 7 cents would raise $423 million a year for construction and  operation of jails.  </P> <P> The tax increase is necessary, Dixon told supervisors, to relieve jail  overcrowding, which has forced the early release of more than 250,000 minor  offenders. A June, 1988, court order limits county jail population to 22,000  adult prisoners.  </P> <P> "The juvenile detention system is also faced with ever-growing detention needs  and antiquated facilities which cannot provide adequate programs and security,"  Dixon said.  </P> <P> The sales tax increase requires a simple majority vote for approval under state  legislation passed last year, said County Counsel DeWitt Clinton.  </P> <P> State legislation sought by Los Angeles County and five other counties and  approved last year allowed counties to create special agencies to raise funds  for jail construction.  </P> <P> The legislation was declared unconstitutional by a Sacramento judge after a  lawsuit was filed by the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers' Assn. Los Angeles County  appealed. Pending the outcome of the appeal, a state appeals court last week  lifted the injunction that had prevented counties from implementing the  legislation.  </P> <P> The Board of Supervisors voted 4-1 Tuesday over Schabarum's objections to  establish the Los Angeles County Regional Justices Facilities Financing Agency  to place the half-cent sales tax increase on the ballot. The agency will be  chaired by Sheriff Sherman Block and consist of four other law enforcement  officials. Supervisors will have final say over when and where jails are built.  </P> <P> Schabarum accused his colleagues of a "lack of backbone" in creating the agency  to avoid taking the political heat for proposing a tax hike.  </P> <P> Supervisor Ed Edelman said the tax increase would free county funds for  strapped health and welfare programs.  </P> <P> On another issue, supervisors delayed for one week a vote on placing a measure  on the November ballot to create an elected county executive. Edelman and  Schabarum, who support the measure, are hoping to pick up the third vote  required to place it on the ballot from Supervisor Kenneth Hahn.  </P> <P> Hahn insisted that supervisors also ask voters to expand the board to seven  members in return for his support.  </P> <P> With powers similar to those of a governor, the executive would prepare the  budget, veto ordinances and appoint department heads. The board would continue  as the legislative body with authority to confirm the executive's appointments,  adopt ordinances and override vetoes.  </P> <P> Supervisors Mike Antonovich and Deane Dana oppose the1 measure.  </P></p>

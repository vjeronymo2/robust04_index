			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / World Trade News: China gets Rothmans habit THE Chinese are the world's heaviest smokers. There are 300m of them, the great majority men, though more women are taking up the habit. They smoke 1,600bn cigarettes a year, 30 per cent of total world consumption. It is an enviable domestic market for international tobacco companies hit by declining sales in countries with more active anti-smoking campaigns than China, but not an easy one to crack. It has taken the Rothmans company eight years to establish a small joint venture cigarette factory in Jinan, Shandong province, officially opened on Tuesday by former British prime minister, Sir Edward Heath. Shandong is one of China's biggest tobacco growing provinces. The Rothmans venture, in partnership with the Shandong Tobacco Corporation, provincial arm of the national monopoly, is only the second tobacco joint venture in China and the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration has decreed it will be the last. The first was set up by Winston manufacturers RJ Reynolds in Xiamen, a special economic zone in Fujian province across the strait from Taiwan. Rothmans was given the go-ahead only because it spent years helping Shandong tobacco growers improve the quality of their leaf, said Lord Swaythling, the chairman of Rothmans International. He dismissed criticism that it was bad for the company to be seen selling cigarettes to new markets as sales declined in the health-conscious west. 'We're not encouraging Chinese to smoke. They have been the world's biggest consumers of cigarettes for 40 years. They all smoke like chimneys here anyway, we just want them to smoke our brands.' The two brands to be produced in Jinan, are Rothmans international brand and a local brand, Horseman, retailing at half the price, 3 yuan (43p). Both brands' packs will carry a health warning, 'Cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health'. The Chinese are conscious of a health risk in smoking, but with 20 per cent of state revenues deriving from taxes on tobacco - the single largest source of revenue in the country - the authorities tread warily in mounting anti-smoking campaigns. The State Tobacco Monopoly Administration has set a target of reaching 30bn yuan in profits and taxes. Smoking restrictions are not the rarity they once were. Hotel restaurants have no-smoking areas and smoking is banned on domestic flights and in airports. The joint venture Jinan factory is under-capitalised and very small, with a capacity of only 40m cigarettes a year. To be viable it should be six times as large, but Rothmans hopes 'phase two' will begin in two or three years - if China allows - bringing production levels to 2.5bn.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Halle (DDP/ADN) -- The German crew members on board  the AWACS aircraft [over Bosnia] will not be pulled out in the  event of NATO air strikes on Serbian targets. Tomorrow's  Halle-based MITTELDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG reports German air force  spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Eike Krueger as saying: "That is  not planned at present." Apart from the ability to locate enemy  aircraft movements and antiaircraft radar, and pass that  information on to friendly aircraft, the AWACS planes can,  according to information from the paper, provide close air  support and reconnaisance.    Krueger said that in the event of NATO air strikes, AWACS  would not be used to carry out such an operation. However, he  admitted that the system would continue to be active in the same  way in the event of air strikes, thus supplying information for  the operation. The presence of a tactical air control  organization on the ground was however decisive for successful  air strikes.    The AWACS flights have been monitoring the no-fly zone over  Bosnia declared by NATO since last April.</p>

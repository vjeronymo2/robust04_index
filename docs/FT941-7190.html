			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Union Miniere to sell US zinc operations for Dollars 200m Savage Resources, which eight months ago was a little-known Australian exploration company selling at 30 cents a share, is to double in size by acquiring the US zinc operations of Union Miniere, the Belgian metals group, for USDollars 200m. The Australian group is buying Union Zinc, which has five low-cost zinc mines and a 100,000 tonnes a year smelter employing 650 in Tennessee. The self-contained business accounts for 25 per cent of US zinc output. This is the second disposal in a week by UM as part of its 1993 long-term plan to dispose of non-strategic assets to fund investments in its core business. Last week it sold its 56 per cent stake in Asturienne, the Belgian mining group. UM had been planning to float Union Zinc on the American market but preferred the Savage offer because 'it could be concluded immediately for a similar return'. Savage came to prominence because of its successful litigation against Western Mining of Australia over the Ernest Henry copper-gold deposit in Queensland. It then sold 51 per cent of Ernest Henry to MIM, another Australian resources group, for ADollars 92.5m (USDollars 67m). Savage shares were suspended before the deal at ADollars 1.55. It will fund the zinc purchase by a five-for-six renounceable rights issue to existing shareholders at ADollars 1.25 a share and a placement of 50m shares at ADollars 1.29. The placing will be made to institutional clients of Prudential Bache Securities (Australia) and Ord Minnet Securities. Both issues are fully underwritten. UM and Savage will enter into a commercial relationship cemented by UM receiving options to acquire 15m Savage shares (less than 5 per cent of the increased capital). UM is a major cobalt producer. It will help Savage market zinc and germanium from the US operations.</p>

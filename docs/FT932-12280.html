			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Walker bankrupt with Pounds 180m debts MR GEORGE Walker, former chairman and chief executive of the Brent Walker, the property and leisure group, was declared bankrupt with debts of Pounds 180m yesterday after a High Court judge accused him of taking a 'cavalier' attitude towards his creditors. In September Mr Walker, who has also been charged by the Serious Fraud Office with the theft of Pounds 12m from the company and false accounting, reached a voluntary arrangement with his creditors, mainly TSB and other banks and the Inland Revenue, to repay some of the debt. No money has been repaid to date and Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor, yesterday granted a request from accountants Stoy Hayward, the supervisors of the voluntary arrangement, for it to be ended and replaced by a bankruptcy order. Sir Donald singled out two aspects of Mr Walker's finances which indicated that the former Brent Walker head was 'not playing fair with his creditors'. Mr Walker had provided no explanation of the affairs of Walkers International SA, a Monaco-based business which exports tobacco to Russia. His wife, Mrs Jean Walker, is the company chairman and receives a monthly salary of USDollars 5,000 (Pounds 3,164). Mr Walker is a director, but draws no salary. Sir Donald said Mr Walker had not explained his substantial travel expenses incurred working for the company. This suggested that money was being diverted from Mr Walker to his wife, who has no obligations to repay any money to his creditors. He also criticised Mr and Mrs Walker's handling of the Pounds 214,000 compensation paid to her by Brent Walker after she left the company. Acting on Mr Walker's advice, she returned the cheque to Brent Walker so that the money, with a further Pounds 24,000, could be paid into her pension account. This placed it out of her reach, leaving her unable to use the money to fund two legal actions which she had promised to pay for under the voluntary arrangement. Sir Donald said: 'When, in those circumstances, she, with the assistance of her husband, puts a very substantial sum out of her reach, I am left gravely troubled about the genuineness of her and his commitment to the spirit and terms of the voluntary arrangement.' An affidavit about these arrangements submitted to the court by Mr Michael Coleman of Harkavy's, Mr Walker's solicitors, had been 'highly misleading', he added. Under the voluntary arrangement, an alternative to bankruptcy introduced by the Insolvency Act 1986, Mr Walker had agreed to pay creditors half his disposable income. He originally estimated he would earn Pounds 100,000 this year. Although he has since earned some money - from property rentals - Mr Walker has not submitted detailed accounts of his expenses to the voluntary arrangement supervisors. The bulk of the money to be repaid was expected to come from legal actions against Brent Walker and others, the proceeds of which would be passed to creditors. In one of these - a claim for Pounds 14.5m - very little progress had been made, Sir Donald said. The other actions have also yet to start since Mrs Walker has yet to fund the legal costs involved as she promised under the voluntary arrangement. After the hearing Mr Walker issued a statement through his solicitor, saying he was deeply disappointed by the ruling. Mr Coleman said: 'Under the provisions of the voluntary arrangement, whilst there was no guarantee, there was a reasonable prospect of creditors receiving some of the money owed to them. 'As a result of the bankruptcy, it is unlikely they will receive a single penny. How this benefits shareholders of the dissenting creditors it is difficult to see.'</p>

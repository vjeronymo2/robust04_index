This draft agreement modifies the Treaty for the  Proscription  of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean, which was  formulated in April 1969 and was ratified by Chile in October  1974.    This international treaty, signed in the Mexican town of  Tlatelolco, seeks to establish zones and environments free of  nuclear weapons. It is the first of its type encompassing an  extensive and heavily populated zone like Latin America and the  Caribbean.    The changes seek to include countries which obtained their  independence since the implementation of said treaty (Belize and  Guyana), to change in the treaty's name, and to include the  Caribbean nations.    Finally, by suggestion of Chile, Argentina, and Brazil,  essential amendments are being made to make the treaty's control  system more operational without affecting its essential  political principles and objectives.</p>

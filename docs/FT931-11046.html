			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: Travelers faces Dollars 658m loss as loan reserves increase TRAVELERS, one the largest US composite insurers but beset by a troubled property portfolio, yesterday said it would step up sales of foreclosed real estate assets as the US property market recovers. As a result of this, and the need to comply with a new fair value accounting requirement, the company was bolstering property and mortgage loan reserves by a further Dollars 735m, and warned it would post a Dollars 658m after-tax loss for 1992. Mr Edward Budd, Travelers chairman, claimed the strategy was designed to 'take early advantage of emerging liquidity developing in real estate markets'. It would allow Hartford-based Travelers to redeploy investment funds tied up in ailing property into assets offering a better return. Over the past four-and-a-half years, the company has shed some Dollars 1.4bn of foreclosed real estate assets. However, at end-1992, its mortgage loan and real estate portfolio stood at Dollars 13.6bn (before valuation reserves). Of this, Dollars 5.1bn-worth was classed as underperforming and Dollars 2.3bn-worth as underperforming in the foreclosed category. To reflect the disposal strategy and the accounting standard - which requires the company to account for the foreclosed real estate held for sale at fair value - Mr Budd said Travelers had written down almost all of its foreclosed property assets and provided for disposal costs. It had increased provisions for mortgage loans which might be affected by the new strategy. As a result, the loss provision ratio, as related to the underperforming property portfolio, stands at 38 per cent, and Travelers' total mortgage and real estate reserves are about Dollars 1.5bn. At end-1991, the reserve for potential property-related losses was Dollars 909m. The increased provision will cause Travelers to post a net loss of Dollars 589m in the fourth quarter, and a Dollars 658m deficit - equivalent to Dollars 6.51 a share - for the year. In 1991, the company reported after-tax profits of Dollars 318m, or Dollars 2.97 a share.</p>

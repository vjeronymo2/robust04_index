			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE FAITHS MUST UNITE TO PRESS A VISION OF PEACE;  </P> <P> JEWS, CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS MUST CALL FOR CONCILIATION AND COMPROMISE ALONG  THE PATH OF AN EMERGING CONSENSUS.  </P> <P> At a time when there is a strong temptation for the United States to back away  from involvement in pursuit of peace in the Middle East, it is essential for us  as American Jews, Christians and Muslims to reassert the urgency for an active  and sustained U.S. initiative  </P> <P> Recent events in the Middle East -- the massacre of seven Palestinian workers  near Tel Aviv, the killing of at least 20 Palestinians and the wounding of  hundreds of others by Israeli soldiers responding to a resurgence of the  intifada and the attempted Palestinian speedboat attack -- reveal the imminent  danger of much greater violence in the Arab-Israeli-Palestinian conflict,  despite signs that negotiated peace is more possible now than ever before.  </P> <P> Reactions among Americans with close ties to people on both sides of the  conflict reveal how easy it is to revert to the politics of frustration and  confrontation despite a shared sense that a new approach is needed. For many  Arab-Americans, the attacks on Palestinians reinforced the most negative images  of Israelis as totally unwilling to recognize the Palestinian people, end the  occupation and accept a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. For  many Jewish-Americans, the failed beachfront raid by a faction of the Palestine  Liberation Organization reinforced the idea that Palestinians can never be  trusted and will never accept Israel's existence.  </P> <P> Increasingly, one hears calls for the United States to cut aid to Israel or to  break off the dialogue with the PLO. While understandable in the context of the  fears and frustrations felt by partisans of each side, these demands are not  likely to contribute to a more constructive U.S. policy or to peace in the  Middle East. We fear that such demands will only exacerbate ethnic and  religious tensions in our society.  </P> <P> What is needed now is not more politics of frustration and confrontation, but a  new politics of conciliation and compromise. It is absolutely essential and  urgent that American Jews, Christians and Muslims meet together in dialogue,  not merely to make us feel better but to build a common vision of Middle East  peace on which we can unite and urge the Bush Administration and Congress to  support.  </P> <P> A common vision of peace is possible today. Indeed, the main elements already  are agreed upon by many important Israelis and Palestinians. According to  public opinion polls, a substantial majority of Americans supports this vision.  Key principles of this emerging consensus include:  </P> <P>  -- Israel's right to secure borders and peace, based on the Jewish people's  right of self-determination.  </P> <P>  -- The Palestinian people's right of self-determination, including their right  to an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza, with adequate security  arrangements for Israel and all states in the area.  </P> <P>  -- Negotiations based on U.N. Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338,  involving all parties to the conflict.  </P> <P>  -- U.S.-Soviet cooperation to develop an international framework, process and  guarantees for a negotiated peace.  </P> <P> It is time for U.S. leaders not only to emphasize the urgent need for  negotiations, as Secretary of State James A. Baker III effectively did last  week, but also to publicly support these principles as the only realistic basis  for peace. For the United States to do less at this point is to leave the field  to those who foolishly choose the risks of trying to maintain the status quo  over the risks of pursuing peace and, in doing so, prepare the ground for  escalating acts of violence and the next, even more dangerous and devastating  Arab-Israeli war.  </P> <P> Fundamentally, there will be peace in the Middle East when the parties  themselves agree to make peace. At the same time, Arab and Israeli leaders who  seek peace agree that outside help, especially from the United States, is  essential.  </P> <P> Our role as American Jews, Christians and Muslims who believe peace is a moral  imperative of our common Abrahamic faith is to work together to create the  climate of urgency and the political space in this country for the United  States to develop a much more active and sustained policy for peace in the  Middle East.  </P></p>

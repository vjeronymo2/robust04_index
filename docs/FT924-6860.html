			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Survey of Lancashire (5): Those clouded hills - Tourism around the county BLACKPOOL may be the largest tourist resort in Britain but it is not the only visitor destination in Lancashire. Other attractions range from heritage sites to industrial museums and markets in old manufacturing towns. There is good walking, fishing and riding in countryside areas such as Pendle Hill, the Ribble Valley and the Forest of Bowland - with a well known beauty spot, the Trough of Bowland. Lancaster has a Norman castle owned by the Queen in her capacity as the Duke of Lancaster. (John of Gaunt, Shakespeare's 'time honoured Lancaster,' was the first duke). There is a Benedictine priory church and a judges' lodging house containing fine Gillow furniture. The Georgian custom house on the quay is now the home of the maritime museum, and there are lots of Georgian streets. The city authorities have forged a link with the nearby resort of Morecambe to form a 'holiday corridor'. Morecambe, with grand old hotels and attractive gardens along the sea front, offers a more genteel seaside alternative to brash Blackpool. All the main towns in Lancashire, as elsewhere in the old manufacturing centres in the north of England, have turned former factories and dark, dank mills into industrial museums. Blackburn has its Lewis textile museum; Burnley has the Weavers Triangle visitors' centre, with displays showing the manufacture of cotton, and the Leeds and Liverpool canal. From any of the towns access to splendid countryside is easy, whether to the West Pennine moors in the south of the county, the Ribble valley in the centre, or the Forest of Bowland in the north. But Blackpool dominates tourism in Lancashire, accounting for more than 70 per cent of all tourism destinations in the county. The town had 16.8m holiday visits in l989, showing an expenditure of Pounds 445m. (It is estimated that this year's visits will show a decline of about 6 per cent from the 1989 mark.) Blackpool has 120,000 holiday beds - more than in the whole of Portugal - in 3,500 hotels and guest houses. On a typical summer's day, 1m ice creams are consumed and in high summer 25,000 vehicles a day enter Blackpool. (There are 15,000 parking spaces.) More than half all visits come from people living in the north west region. A further 18 per cent of visits from elsewhere in the north of England. Very few foreign visitors go to Blackpool: it is quintessentially a British resort. Conversion of the old central station into a coach and car park makes the resort ideal for coach parties; the large number of these is reflected in the figures for day trippers: 75 per cent of all visits. (Although day trippers spend only Pounds 100m of the total holiday expenditure). But it is not just the geography and ease of access which account for Blackpool's continued popularity. Developing new attractions has helped Blackpool to extend its season. Switched on each year by a celebrity amid great fanfare at the beginning of September, when other resorts are beginning to close down, the illuminations continue until November 9. They cost the local council Pounds 1.8m a year to install and run, but it is estimated that the illuminations alone attract 8m visits and Pounds 180m worth of tourist spending. Conferences similarly extend the season well into the winter. Originally opened in 1878, the Winter Gardens are now covered over. They contain the Empress ballroom and the Opera House (claimed to be Britain's largest theatre), along with bits and pieces of dream palaces of different cultures. Sprawling over 4.5 acres, the Winter Gardens can thus accommodate all kinds of conferences and meetings and make a small profit for the borough council. For ordinary tourists there is no end of diversion. The Pleasure beach is a 42 acre amazement park; the Tower has a circus and a ballroom as well as shops and amusements at its base; the Golden Mile is an unbroken ribbon of shops selling hamburgers, chips, ice creams and candyfloss, interspersed with cabaret spots and arcades. The latest addition is the Pounds 6m Sea Life centre, complete with shark tunnel.</p>

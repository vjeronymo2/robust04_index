			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / World Trade News: No sign of reforms Clinton administration efforts to improve workers' conditions in Indonesia by threatening to withdraw trade benefits have failed to produce promised reforms, according to US human rights activists, Nancy Dunne reports from Washington. This week's Human Rights Watch/Asia report concludes that labour unrest in Indonesia has been exacerbated by government failure to allow freedom of association and the right to organise unions independent of government control. Under US law, a country must take steps to meet international labour norms to be eligible for the US Generalised System of Preferences, which allows many products from developing countries to enter the US duty-free. The Clinton administration has other goals in Indonesia competing for the President's attention. It is one of the US Commerce Department's Ten Emerging Markets and one in which the US hopes to make import trade gains. Jakarta is to host the annual meeting of the Asian Pacific Economic Co-operation forum, and President Clinton is meet President Suharto on November 16.</p>

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Bankers defend derivatives Senior banking executives rallied in Washington yesterday to fight off calls for more government regulation of derivatives. There is growing congressional concern about the risks raised by these sometimes complex financial products, such as interest rate swaps and foreign exchange hedges. A panel of senior bankers and former financial services regulators told a House of Representatives committee yesterday that the risks associated with derivatives had been greatly exaggerated and that they saw no need for further legislation. 'Whatever else is true - and there are real issues that should be addressed  -the sky is not falling,' said Mr Richard Breeden, former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr Gerald Corrigan, former head of the new York Federal Reserve, also rejected the need for legislation. 'I am hard pressed to think of sensible things that might be done through legislation that would better equip the Fed or other official bodies to deal with a financial disruption of consequence,' Mr Corrigan said. 'So far the normal channels are working. It is hard to make a case that additional regulation or legislation is needed to make up for a deficiency,' added Mr Dennis Weatherstone, chairman of JP Morgan, who headed a study last year by the Group of 30 of derivatives practices. The three financiers scoffed at measures proposed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, one of the principal bank regulatory agencies, to broaden the requirement for banks to determine whether a derivatives transaction is appropriate for a particular customer. Expanding on a circular it put out last year, the OCC said banks should assess the suitability of a derivative instrument for their customer, whether they were acting as a dealer or an agent, and should make sure the customer understood the risks of the transaction. But Mr Breeden dismissed the need for such concern about the large and sophisticated financial investors who may be engaged in derivatives. 'The traditional and still appropriate answer as to whether a dealer should have a duty to make a suitability determination with respect to a major multinational corporation is simply no. There has not been a category of 'widow and orphan multinational corporation,' and I do not believe that we should create one now,' Mr Breeden said. Mr Corrigan added that it would be a 'colossal mistake' to try to extend the system of financial regulation to corporate end users of derivatives. The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, is due to publish a report on derivatives later this month which is expected to call for more comprehensive capital standards for banks dealing in derivatives, along with greater federal scrutiny of the market.</p>

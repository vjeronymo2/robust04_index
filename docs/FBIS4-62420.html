			<p>BFN     [Text] Tbilisi 13 [May] -- Talking to an IBERIA news agency  correspondent, a deputy of the Georgian parliament, Nodar  Natadze said a draft agreement on a cease-fire and separation of  forces worked up during current Abkhaz-Georgian talks in Moscow  is a shameful and capitulatory document.    Nodar Natadze said that the UN Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali's change of stance is difficult to understand.  Also difficult to understand is Georgian Head of State Eduard  Shevardnadze's role in the issue.</p>

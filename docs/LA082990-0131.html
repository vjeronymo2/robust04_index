			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IRATE ROTH FORCES COUNTY REWRITE OF REPORT OPPOSING DESERT JAIL SITE;  </P> <P> STUDY: THE SUPERVISOR FIRMLY DISPUTES CONTENTION BY ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF THAT  THE PLAN IS TOO COSTLY. REVISE IS DUE IN 60 DAYS.  </P> <P> Supervisor Don R. Roth, expressing his deep disappointment in a county  administrative office report that snubbed a desert jail proposal he strongly  supports, led his colleagues Tuesday in sending the report back for more work.  </P> <P> "I frankly expected much more from the county report," Roth said during a board  session dominated by discussion of the controversial document. "I'm not sure  what damage this report has done. . . . I just hope we can turn it around."  </P> <P> Roth has questioned many aspects of the report, which staff members wrote after  conducting a detailed, 10-month study of the desert jail proposal. The report  concluded that utility and transportation costs at the proposed desert facility  would make its operation so expensive that it should be dropped from any  further consideration.  </P> <P> That conclusion infuriated Roth, who has focused much of his criticism on the  report's estimates of land values in Gypsum Canyon, east of Anaheim, and  Chiriaco Summit, in Riverside County.  </P> <P> Backed by a local consulting firm that reviewed the staff report over the  weekend, Roth, a former Anaheim mayor, has argued that buying land in Gypsum  Canyon would be far more expensive than the report indicates; similarly, he  said the price of land in Chiriaco Summit is much cheaper than the report  states.  </P> <P> "I was fully expecting a feasibility study, but what the staff returned with is  flawed," Roth said, adding that Gypsum Canyon site costs were "unrealistically  low, and I put that lightly."  </P> <P> County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider told supervisors in a memo last  week that Chiriaco Summit land prices were taken from data supplied by the  First Boston Corp. The value for land in Gypsum Canyon came from a 1989 county  study, Schneider said.  </P> <P> To bolster his case that the Chiriaco Summit land was overpriced in the county  staff estimates, Roth brought with him to Tuesday's session Margit Rusche, a  lifelong Chiriaco resident who offered to sell her 800 acres in the area to  Orange County for less than $2,000 an acre. The staff report had estimated land  values in the desert at about $7,200 per acre.  </P> <P> "That's ridiculous," Rusche said following the board meeting. "Nobody's getting  that kind of money for land out there. There's nothing on that land but the  snakes and the lizards."  </P> <P> Roth requested that the county administrative office review the criticisms of  its work and report back to the board within 60 days.  </P> <P> The supervisors approved that request, and Schneider said he believed the work  could be completed within that time.  </P> <P> Even supervisors who have supported construction of a jail in Gypsum Canyon  backed Roth's request. Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, for instance, urged  Schneider to return with a broader set of estimates than are provided in the  original document.  </P> <P> "Maybe you ought to give us a couple of different scenarios in terms of a  high-end and a low-end cost," Stanton said. "I think you ought to look at those  concerns."  </P> <P> Stanton and two other supervisors, Thomas F. Riley and Harriett M. Wieder, have  voted to proceed with Gypsum Canyon as the site for the county's next jail. But  four votes are needed to condemn land, and both Roth and Supervisor Gaddi H.  Vasquez, whose district includes the Gypsum Canyon site, say they will not vote  to do that.  </P></p>

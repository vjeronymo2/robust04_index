			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Public sector pay AS TREASURY ministers struggle to contain UK public expenditure, hard decisions loom. Government funding for the building programmes of housing associations is threatened. The inner cities may lose money for urban regeneration to ease the introduction of the council tax. Important transport projects such as London's Crossrail will be postponed. Cutting these programmes - all of which generate employment  - will do nothing to help end the recession. Yet the cuts might be less painful if the government seized control over public sector pay. Running at more than Pounds 70bn this year, the public sector pay bill accounts for almost a third of general government expenditure. It has been rising at around 10 per cent annually in the last two years - almost double the rate of inflation at a time when there has been no economic growth. As today's New Earnings Survey shows, average pay in the public sector is now higher than in the private sector for the first time since 1986. Public sector pay increases tend to lag behind awards in the private sector in times of boom and overtake them in recession. But the New Earnings Survey figures suggest that it is time for the catching-up to stop. If the government is serious about reining in public expenditure, its pay bill must be at the top of the list. Mr Howard Davies, the new director general of the Confederation of British Industry, has called for the public sector pay bill to be frozen. That seems eminently sensible. Sadly, a bad start has already been made to the pay round with this month's settlement for the police. With the system of police remuneration under review, the government might reasonably have shelved this year's inflationary 6.5 per cent increase due under the Edmund Davies formula. Unfortunately it did not. The same mistake should not be made with firemen's pay, likely to rise by more than 6 per cent next year unless their pay formula is set aside. Freezing the pay bill would be simple for the civil service and armed forces, where the government is the employer. However, a firm line is also needed on the pay of almost 1m people working in the health service and 2.3m in local government. The government should make it clear that funding for these services for the coming year will be on the basis of nil increase in the overall pay bill. If local authorities concede increases in the pay bill and pass the cost on to local taxpayers, the government must ensure that the blame is firmly pinned on their profligacy. A freeze on the total pay bill does not rule out pay rises for some. Where efficiency gains are made - for example through contracting-out of services  -the savings will be available to increase pay within the organisation. However, the emphasis should be on improving incentives for experience and good performance rather than across-the-board increases. Performance-related pay still plays an insignificant role in most of the public sector and has not yet penetrated some such as teaching. Fast progress should now be made on extending its coverage throughout the public services.</p>

Under journalistic and  diplomatic cover, he worked a total of 12 years in the United  States and then became deputy head of the KGB  counterintelligence unit in Leningrad. Because of the strong  accusations, declarations and disclosures from this unit,  Mikhail Gorbachev stripped him of his rank of general and of his  22 decorations, but he regained them from Yeltsin later. Oleg  Kalugin appears in the Western press regularly. In the course  of one of his visits in London, he was imprisoned for a short  time on suspicion that he was connected with the  Markov-assassination with the poisoned umbrella. Our  correspondent interviewed him in the hall of an elegant hotel in  Moscow.    [Horvath] Two years ago, Russian Intelligence Head Yevgeniy  Primakov suggested that the United States and Russia mutually  stop spying against each other. Was this a realistic offer?    [Kalugin] Not at all. I do not think it was a serious offer  either, because neither the interests of the West nor the  interests of Russia can be asserted without spying today. In  addition, the intelligence services now have more work to do  with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the former  predictable and monolithic system. It is the obligation of the  intelligence services to inform their governments about the  potential threats coming from the enemies of reforms within  Russia and from the peripheries that are in flames today.    We hope that the time will come when Primakov's offer can be  implemented but, today, even clear allies like Israel, Japan,  America, and France spy against each other. As for Russia, the  tasks of our intelligence service have narrowed down, and there  is a considerable difference between the former activity of the  KGB and the current activity of the Foreign Intelligence  Service. Formerly, we allocated tremendous energy to  psychological warfare and to undermining the prestige and  influence of our enemy. We are no longer engaged in such  activity.    [Horvath] Is that true?    [Kalugin] I will explain why not: The CIA is no longer  interested in Russia's disintegration and Yeltsin's fall. On  the contrary, the United States is interested in maintaining and  continuing the democratic changes. Nor is Russia interested in  supporting communist parties all over the world.    [Horvath] However, Washington might oppose the idea of  Ukraine and Belarus joining Russia again....    [Kalugin] This does not fall in the jurisdiction of the CIA;  they do not have so much power to decide on the fate of  countries. One should not exaggerate the possibilities of  intelligence.    [Horvath] In the current international politics, what is the  role of the information obtained by various states through  illegal means?    [Kalugin] Regarding today's Russia, the role of such  information is extremely low. Our society is open now, and we  hardly have any secrets. It is very difficult to keep back even  the really confidential information. Nor is there any Russian  secret policy against the United States, NATO, or the West. On  the contrary, we would like to be the first to join NATO and  precede all the other candidates. Today's intelligence service  works more as an analysis center: It gathers and analyzes the  information originating from various sources.    [Horvath] Where is the dividing line between a diplomat  gathering information legally and a secret agent under  diplomatic disguise?    [Kalugin] Honestly speaking, the difference is becoming  increasingly smaller. For example, formerly we spent huge  amounts of money to obtain inside information from the U.S.  State Department, because the United States was interested in  weakening the Soviet Union. We no longer have such motives.    [Horvath] Thus, the current spy hysteria is totally  unfounded.    [Kalugin] The current American campaign is a rather  hypocritical thing, because American agents are also active in  Russia, and even within the KGB. There were people who were  caught and condemned -- and even executed -- according to the  law. But the Russian leadership never engaged in a noisy  propaganda war. The Russian leadership regarded this as an  "operational accident." True, I understand and partially excuse  Clinton, because the U.S. conservative circles are suspicious of  the too rapid rapprochement with Russia. After all, the loud  declarations are only political gestures toward these circles.  America is actually trying to help us, so the use of the  principle of "tooth for tooth" would be irrational. On the  other hand, intelligence is playing a considerable role in  science and technology and in obtaining new markets, even among  friendly nations. For example, Central Europe used to be the  traditional market for the Soviet industry and it would not be  fortunate to lose it.    [Horvath] What role could the intelligence service play in  this?    [Kalugin] A wide role. It might seem unbelievable today,  but I remember how proud the officials of the Hungarian  intelligence were when they succeeded in obtaining some American  types of corn with which one could increase production. At the  time, we even looked down at them a little, although it really  was an achievement, because they saved their country a lot of  money.    [Horvath] Suppose that the Russian intelligence is also  active in Central Europe. Is obtaining such economic  information among its major tasks?    [Kalugin] Precisely so, and this is not aimed at forcing  these countries back into the Warsaw Pact, because this would be  a useless effort.    [Horvath] In other words, we are not talking about support  for pro-Russian parties and influencing election results.    [Kalugin] This would only push Central Europe away from  Russia. But there is sense in economic intelligence. For  example, we learn that Hungarian-French talks are being held on  the supply of certain products, while there is also a  competitive Russian offer in that area. In that case, it is in  our interest to discover the financial conditions offered by the  French in order to lower our price and obtain or preserve our  market positions. There is nothing morally condemnable in this.  Moreover, intelligence services can even cooperate in the  struggle against terrorism or drug trafficking, and then they  actually contribute to some countries becoming closer to each  other.</p>

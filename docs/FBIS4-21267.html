But they certainly found it odd that anyone in  a position to reside in a typical foreign executive's mansion  should spend his time at home, apparently idle. The household  employees also were amazed that their employer bathed in a  swimming pool wearing long pants and a long-sleeved shirt,  buttoned to the neck. However, what most piqued the employees'  imagination was one of their employer's hands, the left one, on  which the little finger was amputated. The mystery began to  unravel on the afternoon of Monday, 7 March. The blond Japanese,  named Hitoshi Tanabe, is 32 years old. The money with which he  was paying the $1,300 to rent the luxurious eight-bedroom house  is not from any inheritance or lottery prize. In fact, the  source of Tanabe's funds is the dreaded Japanese Yakuza Mafia,  of which he is a member.    Tanabe's arrest by the Federal Police could prove decisive  for exposing the Yakuza's intricate operations, and the strategy  for its activity in Brazil. The "Mafioso" jailed in Brasilia,  awaiting extradition, has been in the country since at least  early 1993. The first warning of his presence was provided in  February, by the Japanese police, after the seizure, in Tokyo,  of 5.6 kg of cocaine put aboard in Sao Paulo. The trafficker who  was arrested claimed that the drugs belonged to Tanabe, and that  he was in Brazil to coordinate the Yakuza's activities in the  areas of extorting business firms, drug dealing, exploiting the  labor of "dekasseguis" (descendants of immigrants contracted to  work in Japan), and the traditional trafficking in women. The  "Mafioso's" presence in Sao Paulo became public knowledge in  April, when JORNAL PAULISTA, directed toward the Japanese  colony, printed a feature article on him. Because of the  disclosure, Tanabe had to flee to Buenos Aires. He did not  return until September, when he rented the Londrina mansion,  residing there with his wife, Kiyomi, and his 11-month old  daughter, Mary, registered as a Brazilian. However, he was  constantly visiting Sao Paulo, apparently not fearing exposure.  He even showed his body completely tattooed (with a brightly  colored dragon on his back, and a geisha with cherry blossoms on  his chest) to the prostitute, A.C.R., an 18-year old blonde.  During October, they spent a night together at an apartment on  the 16th floor of the luxurious Hotel Eldorado, in downtown Sao  Paulo. On that day, Tanabe smoked "crack" and spoke very little.  He left $100 in payment.    In Londrina, the Tanabe family's life was more discreet.  S.A.S., a female employee at the mansion, claims that they  seldom went out, and received no visitors. However, as the  police learned, it was from there that Tanabe was directing the  work of the agencies recruiting "nisei" [descendants of Japanese  immigrants] interested in employment in Japan. One of the  contractors of cheap labor was the Okayama Tourist Agency,  established in Vila Mariana, in the southern zone of the Sao  Paulo capital. It was acting as a broker to send young people,  paying their fare and keeping them under control. According to  the social worker, Reimei Yoshioka, from the Center for  Information and Assistance to Workers Abroad, there are  currently about 150,000 Brazilians working in Japan on jobs  arranged by the Yakuza. An Okayama employee reported that  another recruitment is due to occur on Monday, 14 March. Among  the youths already recruited are the brothers, F.H.T., aged 18,  and G.H.T., 17. According to their stepfather, the agency  promised F.H.T. a job at the Osaka airport. However, upon his  arrival there, his passport was seized by the Mafia and he was  assigned to bridge construction. Since he requested the  cancellation of the contract, the Yakuza began deducting 1,500  yen from his salary of 2,000 yen to pay the installments on his  fare, and for a "penalty." The stepfather claims that G.H.T. is  working at a golf club near Tokyo. Many of these clubs serve  only as a front for prostitution, according to the journalist,  Marcos Lacerda, who has lived in Tokyo for three years.    Author of the book "High-Tech Slum," about the Yakuza,  Lacerda remarked that the Asian Mafia's mainstay is the sex  industry, with an annual billing of approximately $150 billion.  The journalist does not even think that Tanabe is the leader of  any faction. "A Yakuza leader would never be acting foolishly in  a small city like Londrina," he comments. As for the amputated  finger, this is the sinister punishment imposed on those who  flout the organization's rules. Besides investigating the  activity of the "dekasseguis" companies, through which drugs  reportedly are being trafficked to Tokyo, the Federal Police are  also being informed on Tanabe's connection with the construction  of a sports complex in Londrina. While the investigations are  under way in Parana and Sao Paulo, Tanabe is attempting to  convince the Brazilian Government not to extradite him. His  allegation is that his daughter is Brazilian.</p>

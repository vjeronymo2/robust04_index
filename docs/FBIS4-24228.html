			<p>BFN     [Text] Ndjamena, 23 Jun (AFP) -- Chadian President Idriss  Deby has appointed Noudjalbaye Ngaryana as minister of public  health to replace Dr. Salomon Ngarbaye Tombalbaye who  "categorically refused" to enter the government formed on 17 May.    Mr. Noudjalbaye Ngaryana, a police commissioner, is a close  relative of former President Francois Tombalbaye. The post of  health minister has remained vacant since the decision made by  the son of the first Chadian head of state, Ngarta Tombalbaye,  not to be part of "a government that will only increase the  sufferings of the Chadian people," according to his own  statement.    Meanwhile, Abderamane Dadi, former managing director of the  National School of Magistrates and Administration, has also been  appointed secretary general of the government to replace Dono  Horngar Neldita. The replacement of the government secretary  general follows the arrest on 18 June of Prime Minister Delwa  Kassire Koumakoye by the Higher Transitional Council [CST] for  "anomalies" in the 1994 budget. Some members of the CST, the  transitional Chadian parliament, had called for the dismissal of  Dono Horngar, who they charged with "tampering" with the text.</p>

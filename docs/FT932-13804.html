			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Tokyo attacks Clinton for pushing up yen THE YEN'S rapid ascent against the US dollar, fuelled by recent remarks by President Bill Clinton, yesterday threatened to provoke an open war of words after the Japanese foreign minister described the president's comments as deplorable. The dollar ended Tokyo trading yesterday Y0.10 down at Y110.35 after falling to an historic low of Y109.90 during the day. The Japanese currency's sharp increase followed comments by Mr Clinton's at the weekend that a stronger yen would help to reduce Japan's trade surplus. The clash over the yen means that less than three months into the life of the Clinton administration there is mounting tension with Japan on the three main aspects of their economic relations - exchange rates, the amount of stimulus being provided by Japanese macro-economic policy and trade negotiations where the US is pressing for market share targets for US goods in Japan. The sense of siege in Tokyo's Otemachi financial district was echoed by mounting frustration in Nagatacho, the political district, with what many Japanese politicians regard as unwarranted US intervention in Japan's economic policy. Mr Kabun Muto, the foreign minister, was the most outspoken. Mr Muto openly criticised Mr Clinton, saying: 'It is extremely unusual for a head of state to refer to currency exchange rates and a departure from the norm for someone with top authority to say something like that.' Mr Muto's comments were echoed by warnings from business leaders about the likely damage to Japanese growth. Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren, the federation of economic organisations, said the yen's rise would fetter Japan's economic recovery and expand the trade surplus in the short run. Mr Isao Yonekura, his deputy, said the rise would 'throw cold water on the economy' just as it is recovering. The growing criticism of US policy will put increasing pressure on Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, to take a tough line over trade negotiations with the US. Mr Miyazawa has unsuccessfully attempted to play down the significance of Mr Clinton's remarks in an attempt to head off possible direct conflict with the US. Mr Miyazawa and Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, finance minister, who are close political allies, had hoped sustained intervention by the Bank of Japan would slow the yen's rise. The central bank intervened throughout yesterday, the third day in a row. Mr Hayashi again appealed for calm, offering exporters the hope the yen's rise was a temporary product of speculation. Finance ministry officials are urging patience, arguing that the US administration is still working out the balance between its macroeconomic and exchange rate policies. Officials argue the Clinton team does not realise how a stronger yen could damage the US economy through slowing Japanese growth and weakening the Tokyo stock market, which could affect stock markets elsewhere. The yen's rise partly reflects economic factors. Mr Robert Feldman, economist at the Tokyo branch of Salomon Brothers, the US securities house, said the yen was moving to a new trading range of about Y108 to the dollar from its previous range of about Y120. According to Mr Feldman this reflects the scale of the Japanese trade surplus, which amounts to 3.3 per cent of gross national product, the need to stimulate an outflow of long term capital from Japan and the gap between US and Japanese interest rates. However, the yen's ascent from about Y125 to the dollar at the turn of the year has been intimately linked to US policy and pronouncements. The yen was first lifted by Mr Clinton's budget cutting plan which helped to lower US interest rates. That was followed by comments by Mr Fred Bergsten, an influential US economist, that the yen should rise by about 20 per cent. On February 19 Mr Bentsen told reporters he favoured a stronger yen and last weekend Mr Clinton said a stronger yen was one factor which could reduce the Japanese trade surplus.</p>

			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A WRITER IN PARADISE;  </P> <P> FICTION: LIFE IN REPUBLICAN ROME IS THE SUBJECT OF AUTHOR COLLEEN MCCULLOUGH'S  NEW BOOK, WHICH ALREADY IS A NATIONAL BEST SELLER.  </P> <P> You have to get the whole picture:  </P> <P> This rather large lady lives on an island in the South Pacific that is said to  be more perfect than paradise. The island is three miles long and five miles  wide. Her husband, 6-foot-3 and 270 pounds, farms palm trees.  </P> <P> She dresses in billowing cotton pajamas. She eats glorious fresh fruit. She has  a swimming pool, a garden and a house with, the last time she counted, 30  rooms. And every day, this lady, Colleen McCullough, surrounds herself with  acquaintances who have been dead for 2,000 years.  </P> <P> Cicero: "I was reading the letters of Cicero, those marvelous letters of Cicero  to Atticus," McCullough said. "It is so extraordinary to read them. In one  letter, Cicero says: 'That woman has finally quit Rome.' " McCullough looked  jubilant. "He was talking about Cleopatra!"  </P> <P> Julius Caesar: "It is rare in history to be lucky enough to read the words of  the man who ran the place." Unfortunately, said McCullough, "Caesar never put a  foot wrong."  </P> <P> Caesar's apparent faultlessness knocked him out of the running for the role of  hero in McCullough's latest literary endeavor.  </P> <P> "It's very hard to make a hero who does nothing wrong," the author of "The  Thorn Birds" and four other novels said.  </P> <P> So there on Norfolk Island, not far from where the mutiny on the Bounty took  place, McCullough crafted new heroes to fill six volumes of fiction about life  in republican Rome. The debut novel in the series, "The First Man in Rome"  (William Morrow &amp; Co., $22.95), was published Oct. 1, arrived on the Los  Angeles Times best-seller list on Oct. 14, and on Sunday moved on to the New  York Times national best-seller list.  </P> <P> Men and women run around in togas in McCullough's new novel. Their names and  the places they live and visit are so complicated that McCullough has included  a 15-page glossary. The research took 13 years -- "10 years of dabbling and  three years of sitting down and doing nothing else."  </P> <P> It probably would have been easier, and undoubtedly less risky, to write a  sequel to "The Thorn Birds," McCullough's best-selling contemporary family saga  of 1977. But, she said, "I had always wanted to do a really fat historical  novel."  </P> <P> No two of her books are in the same genre, she explained. "I mean, I'm  hopeless," she pronounced, plopping herself down in a chair in her hotel suite  here. McCullough has hair that seems to march to its own brush. Her  black-patent leather shoes have fake leopard-skin trim. Instead of lunch,  McCullough takes a swig of paregoric, because her stomach is bothering her, and  lights the first of an endless, unapologetic chain of cigarettes.  </P> <P> "I read anything," McCullough said. "Everything."  </P> <P> Thwarted in her search for an ashtray, she commandeers a candy bowl. "I can  still tell you what is written on the toilet paper in the public bathrooms in  London." On the top of each sheet, said McCullough, are the words "London  County Council." On the bottom, "Now please wash your hands."  </P> <P> "I like to read in every genre," she said -- and also, to write in them. "So  anyway, a historical novel I knew I couldn't do until I had enough money not to  have to work for a living." Fortunately, "I have not since 'Thorn Birds.' " To  emphasize her point, McCullough threw back her head and laughed. "I ain't  hurting for a quid," she said.  </P> <P> But to do an historical novel, McCullough knew she needed to find a period that  had not been done. "I like to be fresh," she said. "And I really came across it  when I was reading the letters of Cicero and Julius Caesar."  </P> <P> Now McCullough is just the kind of person who would be reading ancient letters  for recreation. A science major at the University of Sydney, McCullough became  concerned that she "had never acquired much culture," and signed up for a  classics course. "We read everything," she said. "It was wonderful."  </P> <P> Years later, after the publication of "The Thorn Birds," McCullough decided to  reread the classics. "I thought I would love to do it again." Unmarried well  into her 40s, McCullough thought it seemed an appropriate pastime -- "life  being serious when you are a spinster, and expecting to remain a spinster."  </P> <P> Early on in the years after "The Thorn Birds," McCullough began to feel unsafe.  She had lived alone since she was 18, but with the fame of "The Thorn Birds,"  she said, "there were threats, and all sorts of weirdos popping out."  </P> <P> A friend suggested Norfolk Island, where the mutineers from the Bounty were  resettled in 1856. Residency was by permission only, but McCullough quickly  qualified.  </P> <P> "I was at the time in my early 40s, therefore I wasn't going to be a strain on  the local hospital," she said. "I was wealthy enough that I wasn't going to be  a strain on the economy. No. 3, I had no children, so I wasn't going to be a  strain on the school."  </P> <P> Soon after she arrived on Norfolk Island, "I was lucky enough to meet, for want  of a better word, one of the natives."  </P> <P> Cedric Newton Ion-Robinson, a.k.a. Ric, "had just sunk all his money into  palms." Since "all those palm trees that you see in hotel foyers all over the  world started life as seeds on Norfolk Island," palm farming can be "very,  very, very" lucrative.  </P> <P> Just then, Robinson's wife "packed up and left him," McCullough said.  </P> <P> "She let him go."  </P> <P> "Really," she added, "that's the trouble with women. They never know when  they're well off."  </P> <P> But things worked out well for McCullough and Robinson, a descendant of the  Bounty mutineers. "The next thing you knew, we were married." Another toss of  the head, and another big laugh. Since Ric is 13 years her junior, "I am Mrs.  Robinson."  </P> <P> To guarantee the new book's historical accuracy, McCullough employed a  multilingual research assistant. "She traveled around the world, interviewing  people on my behalf," locating, for example, "the world's expert on the Roman  saddle." McCullough herself drew sketches of all of her characters as she wrote  about them.  </P> <P> Historical fiction can be chancy, McCullough conceded. Academics in particular  are often quick to attack the credibility of these novels.  </P> <P> But "times are changing," McCullough said. Money is tight and attendance is  down at many universities, and "history departments are one of the first to  feel that economic crunch," McCullough said.  </P> <P> "So anything that popularizes ancient history" is seen as a good thing. She  flashed a big smile. "So, I will popularize ancient history."  </P> <P> Ancient Rome was a jumping place, McCullough said. "It's so interesting and  juicy and meaty that I would love the whole world to know what went on there."  </P> <P> McCullough's total-immersion approach to writing this series gave her an edge  on some historical novelists, she said. "The thing that I object to in many  historical novels is that the characters think in the present." By contrast,  McCullough's characters "think like Romans." This is possible, she said,  "because when I was writing, I was a Roman."  </P> <P> Six volumes on ancient Rome seemed no more daunting to McCullough than any  other work of fiction.  </P> <P> "I've always written novels, always, since I was 5 years old," she said.  </P> <P> But as a Depression child, "You never announced to anyone that you were going  to write novels." McCullough made science, neurophysiology, her "bread and  butter." It was during her 10 years as a research associate at the Department  of Neurology at Yale University that McCullough wrote her first novel, "Tim,"  and completed the manuscript for "The Thorn Birds."  </P> <P> The success of "The Thorn Birds" made science "impossible," McCullough said.  "To do useful work, I needed to be faceless, anonymous." Suddenly, at dinner  parties, "I was being introduced as 'our novelist.' "  </P> <P> So McCullough fled to the sanctity of Norfolk Island, where, she said, "This is  what I do. I just sit down and write books."  </P> <P> There in her tropical Eden, hard-core workaholic McCullough writes at least  eight to 10 hours each day.  </P> <P> Having written her love story ("Tim," 1974); her family saga ("The Thorn  Birds," 1977); her whodunit ("An Indecent Obsession," 1981); her novella ("The  Ladies of Missalonghi," 1987), and her future tale ("A Creed for the Third  Millennium," 1985). McCullough can now add history to her dance of the genres.  She is two-thirds finished with the second in the Roman series, and promises  that "it's even better than the first."  </P> <P> And so, next?  </P> <P> "Next I think I will do something contemporary, nasty, bitter and steamy,"  McCullough said. She thought for a moment and decided she liked that idea.  "Yes, something steamy, after the Romans."  </P></p>

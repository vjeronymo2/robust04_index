			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Bvenjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 12 (CNA) -- Premier Lien chan  emphasized Tuesday that the Republic of China [ROC] is a  peace-loving country and has no plans to manufacture nuclear  weapons.    ``This is the principle the government has adhered to and it  should be understood by the world,'' Lien said in reply to an  inquiry on the issue by Democratic Progressive Party legislator  Chou Po-lung.    Although Chou is an opponent of Taiwan's fourth nuclear  power  plant project, he nevertheless suggested that the government  accelerate the development of nuclear devices as a hedge against  the Mainland Chinese threat.    ``Peace in the region can be maintained only by the creation  of mutual assurance of destruction over the skies of the Taiwan  Strait,'' Chou said.    He said developing nuclear weapons is necessary if Taiwan  wants to be independent of Mainland China. He warned, however,  that announcing independence without a deterrent force to back  up the proclamation would invite disaster.</p>

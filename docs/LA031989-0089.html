			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> HOW 1 HOSPICE EASES PAIN OF FINAL GOODBYS  </P> <P> The smiling faces of healthy young children help soften the pain of terminally  ill patients at the Connecticut Hospice, a way station on the journey to death.  </P> <P> A preschool for town kids is separated from the patients' rooms by only a  picture window and a hallway.  </P> <P> The hospice founders planned it that way.  </P> <P> "We want to say to the world that death is very much a part of life and  children are very much a part of life," says Rosemary Johnson-Hurzeler,  president of the Connecticut Hospice, which opened in July, 1980, the first of  its kind in the United States.  </P> <P> For the terminally ill -- among them a few weeks ago an artist, a woman who  worked at Woolworth's, a plumber -- the children are among their last remaining  connections to life.  </P> <P> And so now, this gathering of the old generation -- the artist, the  five-and-dime clerk, the plumber -- watch the new generation make faces in the  window and play on the patio.  </P> <P> Fifteen girls and boys, 3- and 4-year-olds, attend the preschool, some of them  children of staff members.  </P> <P> to make ends meet -- 95% of them are nonprofit, Bates said.  </P> <P> Patricia O'Neil, a liaison nurse at the Merrimack Valley Hospice in Andover,  Mass., said that 90% of patients in that program die at home. "I think that's  really important, because in order for that to happen, you need a lot of  support and intensive visits."  </P> <P> Hospice patients range from the very young to the very old. At Merrimack Valley  Hospice, many patients are in the program only a few days. It is a step people  are naturally reluctant to take, since it means "a real acknowledgment that  you're finished with looking for a cure," O'Neil said.  </P> <P> "We can be very low key," she said, "but there has to be some understanding, at  least from someone in the family, that the prognosis is limited."  </P> <P> Patients, she said, may not be afraid of death, but of the process of dying,  and a hospice program can comfort them about that.  </P></p>

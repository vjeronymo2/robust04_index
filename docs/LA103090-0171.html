			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY;  </P> <P> COMPUTER SLUMP? INGRAM MICRO D SALES UP 54% IN 3RD QUARTER  </P> <P> Don't tell the folks over at Ingram Micro D that there's a slump in the  computer industry.  </P> <P> The Santa Ana-based computer distributor says its sales jumped a whopping 54%  -- to $367 million -- during the third quarter compared to a year earlier.  </P> <P> "If there is an industry slowdown in progress," says company Chairman Linwood  A. (Chip) Lacy, "(Ingram Micro D) has not experienced it."  </P> <P> Ingram Micro D said the company's U.S. sales for the quarter ended Sept. 30  grew 46% from the year-earlier period. The privately held company does not  release earnings.  </P> <P> Lacy expects growth of desktop computer sales to slow to about 7% a year  compared to double-digit growth in recent years. He estimated that total sales  of computer hardware, software and peripheral equipment are growing between 15%  and 18% annually.  </P> <P> "The distribution industry will grow slightly faster than overall business  because some manufacturers may shift to distribution because it's a more  economical way to sell products as the prices of products come down," Lacy  said.  </P> <P> Ingram Micro D is expected to post sales of $1.45 billion during 1990 and $1.75  billion in 1991, Lacy said. He said the company's biggest customer, Microsoft  Corp., will provide an estimated $150 million in 1990 sales.  </P> <P> He said the overall industry growth is being driven by sales of laptop and  notebook computers. Despite the growth, Lacy said the company is being cautious  about adding staff or filling vacant jobs. The company employs about 1,200  people.  </P> <P> Lacy said his goal is to increase international sales to a third of total sales  by 1994, from the current 10%.  </P> <P> Lacy said the company may either move its warehouse-style headquarters into new  offices or build its own headquarters complex by the end of the year. The  location would be within 5 miles of the company's headquarters on South Yale  Street in Santa Ana.  </P></p>

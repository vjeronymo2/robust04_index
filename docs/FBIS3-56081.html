[Landsbergis] I am happy that two most important tasks begun  by my colleagues and myself have been accomplished successfully  -- Lithuania's admission to the European Union and the  withdrawal of Russian troops.    [Mankevicius] What have been the greatest failures in  the opposition's political strife this year?    [Landsbergis] I do not think that we have suffered any final  defeats. However, we have had a few failures: To influence the  Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP] leadership or its  extreme forces. The latter's pressure on the LDDP leaders  allows for more cooperation with the opposition.    [Mankevicius] The congresses of Sajudis and the  Homeland Union (Lithuanian Conservatives) proposed that early  elections to the Seimas [parliament] be held already this year.  Would not this be another mistake of the right-wing forces?    [Landsbergis] First of all, I do not agree with the  assumption that we made a mistake then. Our political rivals  were assuming power without any elections by taking over control  in the former Supreme Council. The elections were understood as  a possibility for testing whether the Lithuanian people really  agreed with this. People may have believed that such an outcome  would bring better results, and, therefore, a few more people  voted for the LDDP than for other parties. We, as well as the  LDDP, did not predict such results.    However, we see similar processes in neighboring countries,  where Landsbergis or Sajudis have no influence. These are the  specific regularities of the transitional period, mass  psychology, and the influence of communism.    It is very difficult to hold early elections against LDDP's  will. This can be determined only by the LDDP itself and the  president if the latter decide that it is more favorable for  them to hold new elections now rather than in a few years.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address from Republic of Belarus Government "To the Readers </F> of This Issue"]    [Text] Esteemed rural workers of the Russian Federation!  The mutual interest in the lives of our states' peoples is  determined by the proximity of their destinies in the past and  present.    The Belarusian countryside is experiencing similar  difficulties to the Russian countryside at a complex period in  its history. In the recent past Belarus was one of the leading  republics in terms of per capita agricultural production.    The marketable production of milk, meat, and potatoes made  it  possible not only to meet our own requirements but also to  deliver a substantial quantity, under mutually advantageous  exchange, to other republics and primarily to Russia. Large  livestock raising complexes similar to the specialized farming  facilities of Western countries made it possible to achieve high  production indicators.    Belarus was one of the Russian countryside' most reliable  partners for deliveries of tractors, other agricultural  equipment, and mineral fertilizers. Today too it is prepared  for the closest cooperation with Russia's rural workers and to  supply reliable equipment and other output. The actions of our  states' governments in concluding the treaty on the union of our  monetary systems were also aimed at such relations.    With the start of the treaty's operation artificial  obstacles  will be lifted which are dividing not only states but primarily  the inhabitants of cities and villages -- barriers which have  artificially arisen between us.    The present development of the Republic of Belarus'  agriculture is proceeding within the scheme of a mixed economy  and rational support for collective farms and peasants' private  plots. The main principle of our reforms in the countryside is  not to destroy but to help all commodity producers irrespective  of forms of ownership, all those who are able and capable and  willing to work honestly on the land.    The breakdown of our ties is affecting the position of the  Belarusian countryside, the production of reliable agricultural  equipment, and the mutually advantageous exchange of the fruit  of their labor between the peoples of Russia and Belarus.    We sincerely hope that this influence is of a temporary,  transient nature and that common sense will prevail.    We wish that the Russian rural workers may successfully  overcome the difficulties of our complex time and we wish them  favorable conditions for spring work and hope for the  restoration and development of the traditional fraternal ties  with the Belarusian countryside and between our peoples.</p>

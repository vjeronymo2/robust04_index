			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (24): A step into yesteryear - Walbrzych typifies problems faced by eastern Europe IT WOULD be difficult to imagine a town with more problems than Walbrzych, in south-west Poland - or one that better illustrates the scope of the problems faced by eastern Europe. Coal is the main source of employment and the main source of fuel, and here lies the problem. Four hundred metres beneath the town, miners toil in some of the most primitive mining conditions in Europe, crawling along tunnels only 70cm high. 'Stepping into one of those mines is like stepping back into the 19th century,' says Mr Pawel Kuczynski, of the social and market research firm Demoskop, which has been involved in drawing up plans for the restructuring of the region. The miners have long been well-rewarded for their work, proud to wear their distinctive uniforms. But their glory days are over. The coal mines are finally to be closed - more than 50 years late. Scheduled for closure even before the second world war, when Walbrzych was the German town of Waldenburg, the mines were kept open for the war effort and then, when the land passed to Poland after the war, for 45 loss-making years to provide employment. More than 23,000 people - a quarter of the workforce, and nearly a sixth of the town's population - must eventually lose their jobs. Poland's shortage of housing means the miners cannot be relocated elsewhere, even though there is work available in other parts of Upper Silesia. For the miners, redundancy will represent a particular fall from grace. They are used to being pampered by the state - especially during the martial law, when their special shops gave them access to goods other people could not get. As they were paid so well, it is more common for a miner to be the sole breadwinner in a family than in other industries, and very few wives work. A big change in social attitudes will be required. The rest of the region's industry is none too healthy. The textile factories have lost much of their main market - the Soviet Union - while the electronics industry is having difficulty competing with western imports. Only one out of three porcelain factories in the area is near to being profitable. As some enterprises close, and others seek to streamline themselves in the battle for profitability, thousands more jobs are likely to be lost. The socio-economic problems are, however, only the beginning. The town suffers from some of the most severe water and atmospheric pollution in Europe. Gases and dust from coal-burning and the huge Walbrzych coking plant - high on the government's hit-list of the most polluting enterprises in the country - cause acid rain, as well as respiratory problems. A serious shortage of water means that in some parts of Walbrzych there is running water for only two hours a day. Of the region's river water, 2 per cent is of 'second-class' quality, according to Polish standards. The rest is not even suitable for industrial use. In such conditions, health experts say, there is a high cancer risk and danger of outbreaks of food-related illness such as salmonella. Along with the threat of cancer, some experts fear that the high quantities of carcinogens in the air and in food grown in the region could damage inhabitants' immunological barriers, by attacking the T-cells, or so-called 'soldier cells' of the body's immune system, in a similar way to the Aids virus. Then there is the subsidence. In their desperation to keep miners in work, the authorities allowed them to mine into the supportive pillars beneath the town of Walbrzych. The walls of residential blocks have started to crack, and one railway bridge has already sunk 10 feet into the ground. The town centre itself has been undermined, and even divine patronage has not been able to prevent the spire of the Church of the Guardian Angels from starting to lean. Worst of all is the uncertainty. It has been announced that the mines will close, and a liquidator has been appointed, but there has been no decision on when this will be. Neither the French consultants, nor Solidarity's special plenipotentiary, nor the town or voivodship administration have been able to come up with any concrete plan for restructuring the region. Young people, deeply uncertain about their future, are turning to crime and gang-fighting. One gang, the Depeszowcy, or fans of British pop group Depeche Mode - a band not noted for its cheery optimism - recently killed a heavy-metal fan by pushing him under a train. As Adam Gierak, a local journalist with the newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, puts it: 'Better to have certainty about bad things than uncertainty.' Mr Josef Gruszka, the harassed-looking Solidarity plenipotentiary, charged with drawing up plans for the future of the region, jokes: 'Sometimes I think to myself: should we buy ropes for everybody to hang themselves, so as not to suffer any more?' Yet the region does have possibilities. Closing the mines would free considerable sums of money from subsidies and miners' wages, to be spent on other things. The authorities are considering a scheme to give ex-miners loans, possibly interest-free, to set up small businesses. If the pollution can be controlled, land in the north-eastern part of the province is good for agriculture. Factories could be built to process and pack the produce. Without the pollution, the region could also attract tourists. To the south, the Sudeten mountains provide excellent skiing. Before the war, the German skiing team used to train near the town of Zieleniec, and there are nine former health spas in the region. Finally, the mines may yet provide a key to Walbrzych's recovery - but as sources of methane, not of coal. Both American and French companies have expressed interest in exploiting the sizeable reserves. The great lack is foreign investment. Dutch, Italian, Austrian, French and American companies have all been to the region to discuss investment or joint ventures. None has yet come forward with any money. One problem is that no framework exists yet for facilitating contact and negotiation between western companies and enterprises in Walbrzych. Mr Gruszka adds that local conditions and proposals must be clear before any deals are made with the west. 'I'm not xenophobic,' he says, but capitalism is not a game of cricket, it's poker.' On a wall in an alleyway in Walbrzych, someone has daubed the words Chwytaj dzien], the Polish equivalent of carpe diem ('Seize the day'). The town might do well to adopt it as a motto. When it comes to tackling Walbrzych's problems, there is no more time for dithering.</p>

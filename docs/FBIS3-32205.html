The delegation stopped at  Colombia Municipality where Raul and his companions talked with  Manuel Quesada, first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba  [PCC]. First, the good news: The sugar harvest is progressing at  101 percent of the plan and 40 percent of the production plan  has been completed. The Colombia Mill, which has meet every  production plan in the last 20 years, expects to do so again.  The mill is engaged in the sugar recovery program and to this  end will contribute the 16 recently created Basic Cooperative  Production Units, in addition to the state farm managed by the  Youth Labor Army [EJT], which has increased the yield of its  sugarfields by 10,000 arrobas per caballeria, and the Leningrad  Farming Cooperative with its 112 caballerias.    During a visit to cattle ranches, Raul points out the  negative aspect of extensive marabu weeds, saying that a  solution has to be found so that the 25,000 head of cattle yield  more milk and meat. [Politburo member Alfredo] Jordan explains  that a nationwide machete campaign is being waged against marabu  with the double goal of preserving the pastures and collecting  kitchen firewood for workers' dining halls and homes.    The report on defense is very encouraging. Colombia was the  first municipality of the Eastern Army area to achieve Ready for  Defense in the Second Phase status and its 17 defense zones are  attaining higher levels of readiness.    In Jobabo, we meet with Norge Rodriguez, first secretary of  the PCC. We proceed directly to the pride of the locals: the  Loma Alta state farm. This farm has 200 workers mobilized for  two years from the municipality -- population 50,000 -- and the  provincial capital. The 60 narrow-furrow caballerias of plantain  yielded 253,000 quintals in 1993. This year they expect to  surpass the 300,000 mark. The production of this, another state  farm, and eight farming cooperatives is enough to distribute 40  pounds of vegetables per capita a month to every person in the  municipality. The goal is to attain 1 million tubers,  vegetables, and grains in 1995 to meet the people's needs and  help supply the provincial capital.    Rodriguez, proud of the accomplishments of the municipality,  shows us the local wine factory which produced 189,000 bottles  in 1993 and plans to produce 300,000 in 1994. He spoke with  enthusiasm of the local food production and its highly diverse  service facilities.    On the outskirts of Las Tunas City is something new: modest  minidairy farms -- perfect to supply milk for children and the  elderly of nearby communities. There are 45 of these farms on  the periphery of the city. Horse-drawn carts distribute the milk  early in the morning. Housewives boil the milk as was customary  before the widespread implementation of centralized  pasteurization. Raul congratulated Misael Enamorado, first  secretary of Las Tunas Municipality, for this accomplishment,  trusting that shortly the other five communities will have their  own minidairy farms.    Windmills are becoming a common feature in the profile of  Las  Tunas City. The goal is to supply water, without using  electricity, to the organic gardens of various sizes appearing  in empty lots in the city. Because of the lack of resources to  build every windmill needed, locals have made use of  old-fashioned wells to draw water and irrigate the gardens by  hand. These lots provide fresh vegetables and direct sales to  the neighbors at standard prices. The vendor estimates the  weight, since they lack scales. This is a practical  antibureaucratic measure by the masses and for the masses.    In light of this fact, as well as the minidairy farms and  other efforts, Raul states with delight that this is a blow to  bureaucracy which is sometimes removed from reality and the  interests of the masses; a bureaucracy may be well-intentioned  but capable of destroying a revolution, as has unfortunately  already happened in other countries. Raul stressed that this is  not a fatalist statement because in the case of Cuba we are  lucky to have a commander in chief like Fidel, a sworn enemy of  bureaucracy and more aware than anyone else of the masses'  morale, hopes, and needs, and who trusts more than anyone else  the revolutionary spirit of his people. There is no sign of  disenchantment in Raul as he recalls some of the mistakes made  in agriculture. He affirms with optimism that the only positive  aspect of errors is the possibility of learning from them to  avoid repeating them.    Raul is accompanied by Central Committee members Julian  Lopez, first secretary of the PCC in Las Tunas, and Vilma Espin,  president of the Federation of Cuban Women, among others.</p>

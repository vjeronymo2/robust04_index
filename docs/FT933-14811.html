			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / State banks feel the pinch in Indonesia: Concern over quality of loans THE Indonesian government is preparing for battle with its recalcitrant state banks amid growing concern about their loans. A study by the World Bank, giving an economic overview to an aid donors' conference in Paris at the end of June, said in a section on the banking system that 'loan portfolio quality has deteriorated sharply since 1990. . . maintaining stability in the banking system is now the chief objective of financial policy'. This was followed by a leaked local report on the finances of the state banks, which accounted for over half the banking sector's total assets of Rp123,689bn (Pounds 39.7bn) at the end of 1992. Details of the report began to appear in the Indonesian press last month. Government officials deny it was drawn up by the central bank and will not confirm its authenticity, but say it could be the work of 'monetary authorities'. The report estimates that last December 32 per cent of state banks' loan portfolio of Rp71,701bn were non-performing - usually defined as having no interest paid for more than three months. It also says that Rp21,000bn in loans were made by six state banks to just 35 companies, of which 26 were in payment arrears on loans totalling Rp6,927bn. The state banks are renowned for having suffered years of incompetent and corrupt management. The problem they present to the government, however, is more than just bad banking practice. Many of the 26 companies allegedly in arrears are newly emerging, politically well-connected conglomerates, including three led by relatives of President Suharto. In its study, the World Bank criticises such conglomerates, pointing out their formation 'may not be to take advantage of competitive opportunities'. It suggests they are seeking excess profits from monopolies granted by the government. It says: 'The growth of conglomerates during the 1980s appears to have been much faster than could be sustained from retained earnings. . . the implication is that debt-financing has been a major source of growth.' The apparent result is an array of conglomerates - whose interests range from financial services to agri-business and petrochemicals - built upon state bank loans which, despite the borrowers' often monopolistic positions, have turned sour. Many bankers believe the conglomerates can afford to service the loans but they doubt the government has sufficient leverage to enforce repayment. As one business executive explains, 'many of the conglomerates see themselves as shareholders in President Suharto's regime'. Dr Sjahrir, managing director of the Institute for Economic and Financial Research in Jakarta, says: 'The only path by which you can control their power is through a more efficient market system, so that you have more competitive pressure for each conglomerate.' Bankers say, however, that the government is responding to the crisis. The government might intervene by forcing conglomerates to sell shares to state pension funds. The finance raised could pay off the conglomerates' bad debt and give the pension funds equity in some of Indonesia's largest businesses. The government has also taken up a suggestion in the World Bank study that 'lower interest rates would both improve financial soundness and spur credit growth'. Bank Indonesia has cut by one-third to an average 8.5 per cent the key interest on government bonds since the beginning of May and state banks have lowered deposit and lending rates. A sudden increase in credit, however, could result in a surge in imports, deteriorating balance of payments and inflationary pressures. Economists also warn that new credit provided by banks could itself become non-performing. They point out that many private banks - also burdened by non-performing loans - are owned by the same conglomerates indebted to the state banks and which have often used their banking subsidiaries to fund intra-group activities. A lowering of interest rates, therefore, is unlikely to pull the banking system back into line. Instead, the long-term solution lies in withdrawing the political patronage by which conglomerates have obtained state bank credit and the confidence not to repay. Whether the government has the stomach fully to engage the conglomerates remains to be seen.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The United States has agreed to offer Ukraine  economic aid worth $155 Mn, according to a report issued by the  American Embassy in Ukraine on Tuesday. According to the  document, the money is meant for denationalizing small business,  supporting health protection, law enforcement and greater  reliability of the operation of nuclear reactors at power  stations. Part of the credit is meant for purchases of farm  produce. The embassy claims Ukraine can get the aid immediately  after the U.S.A. signs appropriate agreements. It also reported  that the U.S.A. is ready to offer $175 Mn for ratifying the  START-I Treaty before Ukraine joins the nuclear  Non-proliferation Treaty. The size of the aid will depend on  the scale and speed of the dismantling of nuclear weapons.</p>

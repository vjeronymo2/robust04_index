Mikushin: "We Are Relying on Ourselves"]    [Text] Chelyabinsk--Several railroad managers have  already spoken in GUDOK about the results of work last year and  the beginning of this year, and analyzed results of the meeting  between railroad employees and V. Chernomyrdin, the head of  government. Our discussion on this topic today is with Ivan  Pavlovich Vorobyev, chief of the South Urals Railroad.    [Vorobyev] I will not repeat what has been said by my  colleagues from other mainlines, but the situation in transport  is really very serious. And this is directly linked with the  overall economic crisis not only in Russia, but the CIS  countries as well. I realize that the government and the  parliament want very much to stabilize the economic situation in  the country, but alas, there are no opportunities--primarily  financial opportunities--for this. Last year we were given  roughly 20 percent of the state subsidies needed. Judging by the  results of the past 2 months, we cannot receive this now, either.    [Mikushin] It appears that the government is counting on all  sectors of the national economy to support themselves, including  railroad transport.    [Vorobyev] That is true to a certain extent. But I also know  that the process of determining the most important and promising  sectors which require state investments (and which are  profitable for the country) is being continued. I do not think  the government will leave the railroads without support.    [Mikushin] What kind of specific assistance do you expect  from the top?    [Vorobyev] I have never believed that the ministry should be  "milked" endlessly: give, they say, give here and give there...  We can earn for ourselves, as the results of last year show. But  the picture changed drastically beginning in November: the  increase in federal and local taxes instantaneously "consumed"  all our profit, more than 60 percent of which we gave to the  budgets. Essentially, the state put the hen that lays golden  eggs on starvation rations.    All of us, both railroad workers and our clients, are being  squeezed by nonpayments. We are owed about 120 billion rubles  [R]. And we owe nearly R90 billion. It appears that the final  result is in our favor, but what kind of benefit is this, and  who benefits from it? Let us take the land tax as an example.  Last year we paid about R70 billion for this. But why so much,  we ask, if part of the transport service is unprofitable for us?  We are meeting the local authorities halfway, but they are  demanding more and more new deductions for their budget, at  times without any consideration for the problems facing railroad  workers.    [Mikushin] Ivan Pavlovich, would it not be better in this  case to shut down a number of unpromising routes? Even if only  to avoid losses. Then let the persons managing the oblasts and  rayons decide whether they need the services of the railroad or  not.    [Vorobyev] I have had the same thought many times. Let us  take the 200-kilometer Berdush-Druzhinino route. A pair of  freight trains and the same number of passenger trains use this  route daily. The same situation applies on the Miass-Uchaly  section, where the daily traffic consists of just 30 railcars.  On the railroad as a whole, there are about 1,500 kilometers  of such unprofitable routes. Without receiving any incomes, we  are still compelled to keep hundreds of people, locomotives, and  railcars there and maintain service. Based on market conditions,  routes such as these should be closed. But another question  arises: what is to happen in this case to the people living in  the towns, settlements, and villages along the mainline, where  there is practically no other form of transportation? So we must  think hard before making such a decision.    And a few more words about taxes. The regions which have  acquired a certain amount of economic independence are setting  rent, as an example, for the same land that is called "from the  lantern." In Kurgan we are paying the local budget R50 per  square meter, in Magnitogorsk we are paying R27, in Beloretsk  (Bashkiria) R10, and in Samara just R1 for the same area. Tell  me, please, is there any logic here? What basis are the local  authorities using in setting the prices for land?    I will not dwell on the problems of passenger service, since  my colleagues have already written about them sufficiently in  GUDOK. I agree fully with their conclusions that losses cannot  be covered just by raising the price of a ticket. This deprives  us of competitiveness with other forms of transportation. I will  stress once again: we need subsidies here both from the state  (for long distances) and the local budgets--for suburban  services. This is being done in all civilized countries,  incidentally.    [Mikushin] And just how do we resolve the nonpayment  problem?  By waiting for appropriate government decisions and the granting  of credits?    [Vorobyev] I have already stated. The minister does not have  a bottomless pocket. We can and should earn for ourselves. As an  example, this is the second year the railroad has been using the  system of mutual credits, when a client settles accounts with us  for transportation service with his products--metal scrap,  lumber, machine tools, machinery, consumer goods, produce, and  the like. We use some of these products for our own purposes,  and some we sell at a profit for us through commercial  structures.    Another way is by developing subsidiary and ancillary  activity. Over the past 2 months we have received over an  additional R8 billion through this activity alone. You will  agree this is a substantial addition. So Kurgan built its own  construction shop at the locomotive depot, where they are  turning out reinforced concrete collars for shafts, which are in  high demand. In the Zlatoust and Orsk divisions, subunits of  civil construction services have put flow lines into operation  to make a special beam used in building cottages and garden  houses. There is heavy demand for this material, especially  since the buildings made with it are resistant to cold and heat  and are fireproof.    [Mikushin] Since we have mentioned construction, tell us how  work in this area is proceeding on the railroad.    [Vorobyev] I will proudly note that we hold the leading  position in this indicator among Russian railroads. It is  sufficient to say that last year we commissioned about 150,000  square meters of housing, which is substantially above the plan.  The best results were achieved in the Kurgan, Chelyabinsk, and  Orsk divisions. But housing construction in Orenburg has been  cut back for several years, and the lines for apartments are  increasing every year. I think the division managers are chiefly  to blame for this. Now the question is: whether to cut back  housing construction or to enlist railroad employees' personal  funds for this. Unfortunately, there is no other way.    [Mikushin] Ivan Pavlovich, our railroad has suddenly become  a  border railroad. Has this had an effect on the transportation  process?    [Vorobyev] Unquestionably it has. Six border crossings have  already been established here, and each one has its own  customhouse. Naturally, this has entailed changes in technology:  additional structures are being established to receive freight  and keep a record of railcar crossings. But the Petropavlovsk  Division has turned out to be in another state's territory.  Calculations are not made in rubles there, but Kazakh (tenge),  which creates certain problems. Settlements are conducted at the  existing exchange rate. We are trying to maintain businesslike,  neighborly relations with Kazkhstan. I do not think it is in  their or our interests to disrupt the operation of the Transsib  and Turksib [branches of the Trans-Siberian Mainline].    The same may be said about refrigerated shipments, whose  volume has been reduced by more than 30 percent. Previously,  many dozens of our refrigerated units were found on railroads in  the Transcaucasus and Central Asia. Today they are being  returned in large numbers to their point of registration--the  Troitsk Depot. We want to preserve at least some of them.    [Mikushin] All the same, Ivan Pavlovich, will the railroad  survive under such extraordinary conditions?    [Vorobyev] The conditions are really extraordinary. I will  cite just one example. Prevously the Chelyabinsk Pipe Rolling  Plant unloaded 350 railcars per day. Today it unloads only 60.  We used to give the "Uraltrak" Association 200 empty cars every  day. Now it uses only two cars. And the same situation exists at  most enterprises in the Urals. Incomes are falling, of course.  But we do not plan to cut back either production or social  programs. And it becomes very annoying when the local  authorities put spokes in our wheels even in such an extremely  difficult situation. For example, a very zealous property  management committee from Miass, where there is a combined motor  vehicle and rail terminal, is suddenly putting it up for auction  after deciding to sell it to private interests. Why have the  people in Miass suddenly forgotten that the railroad built the  terminal with its own resources and funds?    I direct our specialists' attention to the fact that they  cannot remain idle in the situation today. They have to think  about how and where to earn something additional and how to  maintain high discipline on the railroad. Take the periods for  paying wages, for example. The Kurgan and Petropavlovsk  divisions are issuing money without delays, seeking every  opportunity for this. But in Orsk, Zlatoust, and Kartaly, wage  payments are being held up.    All the same, I look to the future with optimism. The  recession cannot continue forever. I hope the government will  finally find a way out of the crisis.</p>

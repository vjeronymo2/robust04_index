			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / International Company News: Svenska Handelsbanken recovers Svenska Handelsbanken underscored the momentum of its recovery from the Swedish banking crisis yesterday by announcing a near four-fold rise in profits for the first quarter. The bank achieved an operating profit of SKr1.23bn (Dollars 155m), compared with a SKr316m surplus in the same period in 1993. The improvement was entirely due to a 54 per cent cut in credit losses to SKr839m from SKr1.82bn. Before credit losses the result was marginally worse - a SKr2.07bn profit compared with SKr2.14bn - reflecting subdued lending levels and tighter margins. Overall income fell 1 per cent to SKr3.47bn from SKr3.51bn. Handelsbanken said credit losses now accounted for just 1.2 per cent of total lending, half the level a year ago. It also said problem credits had fallen sharply to SKr8.48bn at the end of the quarter compared with SKr13.7bn at the end of March 1993. At the end of 1993 problem credits were SKr9.70bn. The bank's capital adequacy ratio strengthened to 13.1 per cent at the end of the quarter, against 12.9 per cent at the end of 1993.</p>

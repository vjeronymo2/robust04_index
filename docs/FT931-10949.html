			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Third of employers 'impose pay freeze' ABOUT one in three of employers introduced pay freezes in the final quarter of last year, according to the Confederation of British Industry's latest pay databank figures. Over the same period, which saw Britain's withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism and a spate of large redundancy announcements, the CBI recorded average manufacturing pay settlements at only 2.8 per cent. Pay awards in the service sector in that quarter were 3.2 per cent. The government will welcome the further squeeze on private sector pay in view of its 1.5 per cent pay limit for the public sector. Although some of the low awards in the final quarter of last year might have been affected by the uncertainty following withdrawal from the ERM, subsequent settlements do not suggest that the downward trend has ended. National Westminster and Lloyds Bank announced last month that staff will be receiving no general pay increase, and the national pay deal for the footwear industry was 2.5 per cent. The latest settlements will mean further strong downward pressure on average earnings, which were still rising at an annualised rate of 5 per cent in November for the whole economy. Unit labour costs in manufacturing, rising at only 0.5 per cent in November could fall even further. The latest CBI figures say that manufacturers' productivity rose 3.9 per cent in the second half of last year, while basic pay awards averaged 3.5 per cent. Other pay analysts expressed some scepticism about the CBI pay freeze figures. Mr Alistair Hatchett, of the pay analysts Incomes Data Services, said that IDS had found that there was a slight increase in the incidence of freezes but it affected only about one settlement in six.</p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / International Company News: German watchdog challenges Allianz's might - Unravel the web of shareholdings controlled by Europe's largest insurance group THE German cartel office has made a tough decision: it is taking on the full might of the German financial establishment. This week, the Berlin-based monopolies watchdog decided that Allianz - Europe's largest insurance company - must reduce its stake in Dresdner Bank, Germany's second biggest. Allianz, conservative and publicity-shy, is one of the most powerful financial institutions in Europe - possibly the most powerful. It is by far the biggest participant in the German and the European insurance markets. It also exercises profound influence on German industry and financial services through a network of shareholdings worth, according to some estimates, DM400bn (Dollars 243.9bn). Dresdner Bank is the second biggest of Germany's big three banks. Along with Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, Dresdner holds considerable power over German industry. Together, it is thought that the Dresdner-Allianz axis holds powerful minority stakes in a number of very large German companies - including Bayer and Hoechst, two of Germany's big three chemicals giants; the MAN engineering group; the Lufthansa airline group; Metallgesellschaft; Heidelberg Cement; RWE and the Thyssen steel group - to name but a few of the holdings. The full reasons for the cartel office's decision have not, as yet, been made public - indeed, they have not even been communicated to the two companies concerned. However, it is clear, even at this stage, that the order will be strenuously resisted. It may take years for the battle to be resolved. At stake is the future shape of not just the German insurance industry but also the future pattern of relations between industry and finance in Germany. Under German anti-trust laws, companies must seek cartel office approval for any purchase of more than 25 per cent in another company. At that level, it is deemed that the acquirer starts to have significant influence over the management of the acquiree - and is in a position to block rights issues and acquisitions. The Berlin authority first became interested in the relationship between Allianz and Dresdner in the summer of last year when it emerged that Allianz had increased its stake in the bank to over 22 per cent, up from a hitherto disclosed level of 10 per cent. This followed an agreement in 1989 when Allianz and Dresdner decided to sell each others' services, cementing the relationship by taking a 10 per cent stake in one another. In this case, as in others, Allianz was scrupulously careful to keep its stake to below the 25 per cent threshold. However, Berlin has been looking at a web of other stakes which - it has now decided - give Allianz greater de facto influence over the management of the bank than is suggested by the 22.3 stake under Allianz's direct ownership. Last weekend, in a Der Spiegel magazine article, it was suggested that Berlin had decided that Allianz spoke for 47 per cent of the bank, almost a majority. This figure was at first confirmed by the cartel office, then denied. Allianz itself put out an angry statement saying - in essence - that the 47 per cent figure was wrong, and that its stake was 22.3 per cent. At issue is the influence which Allianz exerts over two investment companies which between them own 21 per cent of Dresdner's shares. These are Frankfurter Gesellschaft fur Finanzwerte (FGF) - with 10 per cent of the bank - and Vermo with 11 per cent. Allianz does not hold a direct stake in either of these two companies, but it does hold stakes in some shareholders. For example, it holds a 24.6 per cent stake in Bayerische Hypobank, one of Germany top five banks, which in its turn holds a 12 per cent stake in Vermo. Allianz also holds sizeable minority stakes - around the 10 per cent level, according to Der Spiegel - in each of Bayer, Linde and RWE, three industrial companies which are reported to control a further 36 per cent of Vermo between them. Similarly, Allianz holds no direct stake in FGF, which is owned by 14 insurance companies - other than Allianz - one property company and one chemicals company - believed to be Hoechst - none of which owns more than 10 per cent of FGF. However, Allianz does have stakes in some of these stakeholders - for example a 25 per cent cross-holding in Munich Re, the Munich-based reinsurance company. Together with Munich Re, it has a controlling interest in Hamburg Mannheimer, Germany's second largest life company after Allianz and a shareholder in FGF. Allianz maintains that it is nonsense to accuse it of controlling either FGF or Vermo when it has no direct stake. Even if account is taken of all its holdings, the stake still does not reach 25 per cent, it says. However, many analysts are convinced that Allianz really does pull the strings at Dresdner and other companies in which it holds stakes, irrespective of the formal level of its holdings. The Germans call this vorauseilendgehorsam - a structure of pre-emptory obedience. This means that these companies will never act against Allianz's wishes - acting as if they were majority controlled by Allianz, even if formally they are not. To illustrate this, there is speculation in the German press that Allianz has blocked Dresdner from setting up its own life assurance business ahead of the European Community-driven freeing-up of the heavily-protected German insurance market in 1994. Deutsche Bank set up its own life subsidiary in 1990 - reportedly much to the annoyance of its largest shareholder, which just happens to be Allianz, with a 10 per cent stake. Furthermore, Dresdner has used its 10 per cent stake in Aachener &amp; Munchener, Germany's second largest insurance company, to support the incumbent management in its bid battle against AGF, the French state-owned insurance company which has amassed a 25 per cent stake in its target. Is this not another example of vorauseilendgehorsam? Certainly Dresdner is acting in accordance with the wishes of an Allianz keen to keep foreign companies out of its home patch - the source of its profitability and the fuel for its recent expansion overseas. A battle between Allianz and the cartel office is likely to last years. Meanwhile, the biggest loser at this stage would appear to be Dresdner. The bank's shares fell by 2 per cent on Monday after the news was announced.</p>

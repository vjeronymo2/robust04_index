Section 23.1307 is amended by removing paragraphs (a) and (b); and by removing the designation from paragraph (c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 23. Section 23.1309 is amended by adding a new paragraph (a)(4) to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;23.1309 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Equipment, systems, and installations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) In a commuter category airplane, must be designed to safeguard against hazards to the airplane in the event of their malfunction or failure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 24. Section 23.1311 is revised to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;23.1311 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Electronic display instrument systems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Electronic display indicators, including those with features that make isolation and independence between powerplant instrument systems impractical, must: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Meet the arrangement and visibility requirements of &sect;23.1321. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Be easily legible under all lighting conditions encountered in the cockpit, including direct sunlight, considering the expected electronic display brightness level at the end of an electronic display indicator's useful life. Specific limitations on display system useful life must be contained in the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness required by &sect;23.1529. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Not inhibit the primary display of attitude, airspeed, altitude, or powerplant parameters needed by any pilot to set power within established limitations, in any normal mode of operation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Not inhibit the primary display of engine parameters needed by any pilot to properly set or monitor powerplant limitations during the engine starting mode of operation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Have an independent magnetic direction indicator and either an independent secondary mechanical altimeter, airspeed indicator, and attitude instrument or individual electronic display indicators for the altimeter, airspeed, and attitude indicator that are independent from the airplane's primary electrical power system. These secondary instruments may be installed in panel positions that are displaced from the primary positions specified by &sect;23.1321(d), but must be located where they meet the pilots' visibility requirements of &sect;23.1321(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Incorporate sensory cues for the pilot that are equivalent to those in the instrument being replaced by the electronic display indicators. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Incorporate visual displays of instrument markings, required by &sect;&sect;23.1541 through 23.1553, or visual displays that alert the pilot to abnormal operational values or approaches to established limitation values, for each parameter required to be displayed by this part. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

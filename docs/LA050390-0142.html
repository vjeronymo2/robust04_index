			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LOVE WITH A PERFECT STRANGER;  </P> <P> MATCHMAKERS: FROM INTRODUCTIONS TO BACKGROUND CHECKS, GO-BETWEENS STILL FIND  SPOUSES FOR SOME MEMBERS OF ETHNIC COMMUNITIES.  </P> <P> Arnie was shy. Until he was matched with Debra.  </P> <P> "She was the first girl I actually ever spent time with," said Arnie, a North  Hollywood Orthodox Jew. "I was so shy that one time a rabbi actually dialed her  phone number for me to make sure we talked."  </P> <P> Suresh Iyengar, a Sherman Oaks dentist, received a modern education at USC, but  he journeyed back in time to find a wife.  </P> <P> "I was an accomplished bachelor," Iyengar recalls about his 1973 visit to his  native India. "It was time to get a wife."  </P> <P> And Walid Dinkha, about to embark on his new life in America, figured that he  had found the perfect partner in his Iraqi neighborhood.  </P> <P> "I hadn't met her, but I knew the raw material, what she's made of, from her  family," Dinkha, of North Hollywood, said. "I knew her father was a fair man,  and that her mother would treat me like her own sons."  </P> <P> Together, all three men illustrate that, even as their own ethnic communities  have assimilated into the San Fernando Valley, they stick by the traditional  ways of finding their wives. Their marriages are carefully arranged, and while  both sexes have equal free will to back out or find someone else, the pressure  on them is often severe.  </P> <P> As the Valley -- and, seemingly, the rest of America -- resorts to video dating  and nightclub mixers, they cling to the past. They say it's the best way. It  keeps their communities alive and minimizes the chance of divorce.  </P> <P> "He and I have made it," said Iyengar's wife, Malathi. "But it doesn't end  there. We fit into the whole community. It's not just a marriage between us;  it's a bond between our families, and within our culture."  </P> <P> Said Michelle Linson, an Orthodox Jew, of North Hollywood: "I have unreligious  friends who told me recently that they wished someone had investigated their  husbands, and maybe they wouldn't be divorced now."  </P> <P> Dating, said Arnie's wife, Debra, can be hazardous to your mental and physical  health. That's why a more traditional approach, in which potential dating  partners are actually investigated by rabbis, makes a lot of sense.  </P> <P> "You're meeting people that someone else knows," said Debra. "You're not going  to go out with Jack the Ripper."  </P> <P> Orthodox Jews normally utilize the services of a shadchan, or matchmaker, who  seems to know everyone in the community. As the leader of the community's study  sessions, the local rabbi often plays that role.  </P> <P> In North Hollywood, that falls to Rabbi Zvi Block, dean of the Aisha Torah  religious school. He estimates that he has set up more than 100 couples in the  past decade who eventually married.  </P> <P> "What's the idea of dating? To go bowling? To go to a movie?" asked Block. "No.  The idea of dating for us is to find a lasting and meaningful relationship.  There are going to be problems but by matching up the right people, I can  minimize them."  </P> <P> Block offers matches on his own or listens to input from others. Often, someone  will approach him, asking if could find out whether a member of the opposite  sex might be interested in dating.  </P> <P> Block then reports the responses. He says that if one partner doesn't want to  see the other again, hearing the news from him can be more soothing.  </P> <P> Each party always has a choice.  </P> <P> "Many think that marriages between Orthodox Jews are prearranged, that they  meet under the canopy for the first time," said Barry Linson, Michelle's  husband. "That's a stereotype of what went on in Europe. Even non-religious  Jews have that impression. But they've always had a choice." (The impression  might have been encouraged by the 1960s play and movie, "Fiddler on the Roof,"  in which Tevye tries to arrange a marriage between his daughter, Tzeitel, and  the well-to-do middle-aged butcher she hardly knew.)  </P> <P> Block also becomes involved in developing romances even if he isn't the  original matchmaker. Recently, a concerned woman called him in need of  information.  </P> <P> "He has certainly impressed me as a sincere fellow," said Block, to the woman  who had just dated the man for the first time. "He's very strait-laced, very  learned. You can't go wrong."  </P> <P> Block doesn't hesitate to present discouraging information. "If I had  reservations," he said, "I might say that the person isn't as committed to  Judaism as he should be. I'm not here to slander people."  </P> <P> The Linsons are grateful for Block's assistance. Michelle Linson considered  herself a "poor judge of character" and needed an expert's opinion. She  encouraged the rabbi to meet Barry, her future husband, for lunch. "I wanted to  know if he was really who he pretended to be," Michelle Linson said. "I  remember calling the rabbi that same day. 'Is he for real? Is he as good a guy  as he seems?' "  </P> <P> By last month, Jonathan -- not his real name -- had spent a decade searching  for the proper mate. Twice before, he had even proposed to women but was turned  down. At 36, his doubts were mounting -- would he be a bachelor forever? The  constant sight of visiting homes on the Sabbath with happy marriages and kids  roaming everywhere was uplifting, and depressing. He quickly made it known to  friends in the community that he was searching for a wife. Soon, Marlene -- not  her real name -- more aggressive than most, called.  </P> <P> They went out for the first time in mid-March.  </P> <P> "Everything in my body said yes the first time we met," Jonathan said. "I knew  she was the one."  </P> <P> They dated again, and again. They spent hours each night on the phone. Each did  his or her obligatory background check with Rabbi Block and other religious  authorities.  </P> <P> In two weeks, they will be married.  </P> <P> "I was stunned when she said yes," Jonathan said. "I am so happy."  </P> <P> In Indian culture, there is no designated matchmaker. Each family, in its own  way, makes arrangements for their children. And while the tradition has lost  some of its stature in the last several decades because of advanced education  and modernization, many marriages are still arranged.  </P> <P> By 1973, when Suresh Iyengar returned to Bombay to find a wife, his parents had  prepared the groundwork; in just a few weeks, he would choose a woman from a  list of carefully selected candidates. He was a great catch -- primed for a  career as a professional in America.  </P> <P> He was set up with young women from well-respected families; still bound by the  ancient caste system, parents seek to match their offspring with members of the  same class.  </P> <P> Things did not go well. Either the women weren't ready to move to the United  States, or Iyengar wasn't impressed with their character. He was going to give  up. He had to return to America and his new life as a dentist. One more  candidate, his parents pleaded.  </P> <P> The two families got together. Iyengar and the last possibility, Malathi, then  only 19, talked briefly. They met again a few days later. By the end of the  week, they were married.  </P> <P> While there was significant pressure from both families for them to get  engaged, Suresh and Malathi reserved final say. (Rose Nair, an employee at the  government of India's Tourist Office in Los Angeles, says old-fashioned  arranged marriages, in which neither partner had a choice, occur these days  only in small countryside villages; in the larger cities, the practice is not  nearly as confining. In some cases, families pick future spouses for their  children before they even reach adolescence.)  </P> <P> When they finally settled in Sherman Oaks in the mid-'70s, life was not easy  for them, especially for Malathi. She missed her family and her country. She  was in a strange land, with a stranger in her bed.  </P> <P> "When we had to deal with problems," Malathi said, "I really didn't know him,  and he didn't know me, and that was tough. I was very unhappy for a long time.  You wonder, 'Who is this person?' "  </P> <P> Fortunately, Malathi received support from her husband's brother and sister,  who lived in America. She took classes at Cal State Northridge. She became a  free-lance artist. She fell in love with her husband.  </P> <P> "We had to make it work, and so we did," Malathi said. "When you are not open  to the idea of separating, as in our culture, it makes you look at things in a  different way. The relationship is solid. You don't just run away."  </P> <P> A similar dedication to the institution of marriage is shared by Iraqi men and  women who were set up by their families.  </P> <P> "If there are problems, you have to solve them," said Manier Isho, of North  Hollywood, who emigrated from Iraq in 1981; his nephew and brother returned to  their homeland to find wives selected by their families. "The family will even  get involved if necessary. Divorce does not happen."  </P> <P> As such, a heavy premium is placed by families on finding a spouse with good  moral character. Falling in love isn't as important as finding stability.  Parents often seek to set their children, especially daughters, up with someone  with a proven work ethic.  </P> <P> Dr. Matti Moosa, a professor of history at Gannon University in Erie, Pa., said  the tradition of arranged marriages in Iraq, as in India, is declining because  of advances in education and Western influences. "But because many feel Western  culture is decadent, they still want their children married the old way."  </P> <P> "By the time you get married, the love by itself isn't enough," said Walid  Dinkha, of North Hollywood, who met his wife in July, 1982; they were married  five months later.  </P> <P> Originally, when her parents proposed the marriage, Dinkha's wife, Lucy,  declined. She was in love with someone else. But the other man fell in love  with another woman, and Lucy was alone.  </P> <P> "And when I found out, that's when I told the family it would be OK to arrange  things," Lucy said.  </P> <P> They brought her Walid's photo. She was impressed. They spoke on the phone  constantly. Finally, a few months later, they met in person.  </P> <P> "When we met, I felt like I had known him for years," she said. "I knew things  would be OK."  </P> <P> And while, as Malathi said, life with a new man in America wasn't easy at  first, Lucy survived and is now happy.  </P> <P> They have three young boys. Will they arrange the marriages of their kids?  </P> <P> "I don't think they'll get married that way," Lucy said. "It will be very hard  to do that in the United States. Not these days."  </P></p>

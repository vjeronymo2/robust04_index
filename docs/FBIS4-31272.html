			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by krzem, irem, PAP: "premier@urm.gov.pl; Mr. Prime </F> Minister on Computer"]    [Text] If you have a computer, a telephone, and a modem  and pay 1.5 million zlotys [Z] to open an account on the  Internet and Z1.5 million a month in subscription fees, from  today on you can send your opinions to Prime Minister Pawlak.    It will be enough to put the following address:  premier@urm.gov.pl. You can also write it in  English--primeminister@urm.gov.pl.--and it will reach the  addressee as well.    The prime minister gave these addresses yesterday in the  government's holiday center in Lansk, during the Forum of the  Association for the Development of Open Systems, which was held  in Lansk. Pawlak is the second high-ranking politician who has  revealed his address on the Internet. The other one is U.S.  President Bill Clinton, who made his address available on the  Internet a year ago: president@whitehouse.gov. The first  message Prime Minister Pawlak sent was greetings to President  Clinton.    How does it work? All of the computers in the Office of the  Council of Ministers [URM] (including the ones that are on the  desk of the prime minister) are linked to one another by a  so-called network. Their users can send messages to each other.    Yesterday, URM joined the world Internet system, a huge  computer network that already includes 65 countries (such as the  U.S., Canada, the countries of Western Europe, Japan, and, for  over a year--Poland). In America, increasingly more companies  give not only their fax numbers but also their addresses in the  computer mail (so-called e-mail).    Where did the Internet come from? More than 10 years ago,  the Pentagon tasked research institutes and armament enterprises  with creating a system of computer communications. One  university after another joined the system so the network became  available to all scientists. Recently, it has even become  available to every owner of a personal computer, a modem, and a  telephone.    In Poland, the users of this network are mainly universities  and institutes--35,000 people in 220 institutions. The  installation costs are covered by the Scientific Research  Committee. Other users (a few dozen, including GAZETA) must pay  Z1.5 million to open an account in the network, and a monthly  subscription fee of Z1.5 million. The system is installed by  the Warsaw-based company ATM.</p>

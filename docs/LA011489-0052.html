			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BIOLA STANDS TALL IN CUTTING OCCIDENTAL DOWN TO SIZE  </P> <P> Occidental College Coach Brian Newhall has harped on his basketball team all  season about honing the fundamentals of the game -- like eliminating such  shortcomings as excessive turnovers.  </P> <P> But while Newhall might have some control over his team's grasp of the basics,  there was nothing he could do about the problems they faced Friday at Biola.  </P> <P> Biola turned out a front line of 6-foot, 6-inch forward Kevin Hood, 6-7 forward  Paul Horn and 6-9 center Ed Johansen -- all transfers from Division I programs  -- to dwarf Occidental and help the Eagles post their eighth consecutive  victory, an 88-77 nonconference decision.  </P> <P> "This was the first team that was bigger and stronger than we were,"  Occidental's John Keister said. "Usually I just release and (center) Chris  Anderson gets the ball."  </P> <P> But Keister, a 6-5 forward, and Anderson, a 6-10 center, did not go quietly.  Keister scored a game-high 25 points and Anderson added 20. But 6-2 Brett  Dennis, Occidental's other forward, was held to just 4 points while Biola  outrebounded the Tigers, 37-23.  </P> <P> Ironically, Biola cashed in on the height advantage at the one place where size  doesn't matter: the free-throw line. Because the Eagles passed inside on nearly  every possession, Occidental defenders were forced to foul. And Biola made the  most of its opportunities, converting 30 of 40 free-throw attempts.  </P> <P> Hood, a 1987 All-Big Sky selection at Montana who transferred to Biola last  semester, presented big problems for Occidental. He scored 20 points and  grabbed a game-high 12 rebounds. Johansen, who transferred from UC Irvine last  semester, finished with 15 points and Horn, who transferred from Mississippi,  had 19.  </P> <P> Still, Hood was dissatisfied with his team's play.  </P> <P> "It's frustrating," he said. "We should have blown them out. There isn't a team  in this district that can face a team like us."  </P> <P> The Eagles, who built a 5-point halftime lead, began to pull away about 10  minutes into the second half. Horn and Brandel Studevan combined for 6 free  throws and Studevan buried a 15-foot shot from the baseline to increase the  lead to 13, 62-49.  </P> <P> Trailing by 12, 75-63, Occidental (10-3) embarked on a 14-6 run with about 3  minutes to play. The surge was sparked by Jason Greenstein's 3-point shot.  </P> <P> But Occidental was forced to foul down the stretch and Biola proved deadly at  the line and cut short the Tigers' belated comeback.  </P></p>

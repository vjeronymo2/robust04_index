			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Tax rules for Peps attacked by insurers The favourable tax treatment of Personal Equity Plans has come under fire from the Association of British Insurers, which has called on the government to introduce a tax regime which does not direct savings into particular investments. The plea has been made in a private response to the Treasury as part of the government's review of savings. The association says tax breaks, if required, should be directed towards longer-term savings. It contrasts the tax neutrality towards which the government seemed to be moving until the mid-1980s as tax breaks were ended, with the policy since then of creating savings vehicles which can be tax-free. An individual can invest up to Pounds 9,000 a year in Peps, by putting Pounds 6,000 into a general Pep and Pounds 3,000 into a single company Pep. Sales of Peps are estimated to have reached Pounds 6bn in 1993-94. According to an ABI analysis the net income which a Pep can generate for basic and higher-rate taxpayers is greater than that which can come from any other capital sum, including personal pensions. It notes that in practice pensions and Peps are not in direct competition in the savings market, but highlights the advantage which the tax treatment gives Peps over putting money into equities, unit trusts and life insurance. The ABI paper makes the case for continuing the favourable tax treatment of savings through pension schemes. It says that given public concern about life companies' attitudes to regulatory standards and about the possible mis-selling of products, there would appear to be little political attraction for the government in introducing new tax breaks for life insurance. However, greater equality between different forms of savings might be achieved by imposing new limits on the amounts that can be invested tax-free in Peps and Tessas  - tax-exempt special savings accounts. Mr Stephen Dorrell and Mr Anthony Nelson, the Treasury ministers leading the exercise, have held several meetings with interested parties to seek their views, but no decisions are likely to be announced until the Budget on November 29.</p>

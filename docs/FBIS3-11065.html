The agreement will also permit the  conclusion of negotiations over payment of the total $35 billion  debt owed to private banks.    In addition, the conclusion of the longest and most  difficult  negotiations between the IMF and a Latin American country  constitutes a green light from the IMF to open within the next  few months a new phase in negotiations with the Paris Club. In  Paris yesterday -- according to sources at the French Treasury,  which is responsible for management of the Paris Club -- there  was no doubt whatsoever as to the final success of the  negotiations. The IMF directorate had already informally passed  the information on to its European members.    Cardoso last week received a phone call from IMF Managing  Director Michel Candessus, who gave assurances of the successful  conclusion to the negotiations. The agreement, according to the  same sources, also has strong political connotations, as has  been disclosed in Europe -- Paris and London -- because the  international financial community does not want to raise any  obstacles to the second stage of the Cardoso plan, or even to  the possible presidential candidacy of the finance minister.    This is not the first time that organs like the IMF and the  Paris Club have adopted a position of this nature. They  recently favored the Russian economic reforms of President Boris  Yeltsin, who was politically threatened by Communists.    The second stage of the Cardoso plan was a major economic  instrument in obtaining this favorable result, but the candidacy  of Cardoso was also a major political factor. Since the plan  was presented -- and even if some of the measures to fight  inflation and the public deficit were not as drastic as might  have been expected -- the prevailing trend has been to look for  a solution leading to the rapid implementation of the program,  evading possible obstacles that might jeopardize the minister's  political position. This was prompted by concern over the  probable victory of PT [Workers Party] candidate Luis Inacio  Lula da Silva and a possible default on the foreign debt.    These sectors are alarmed about the position taken by the  PT.  The agreement with the IMF, therefore, is a major political  victory for Cardoso, because it was obtained on the eve of his  possibly stepping down to run for president. International  financial circles expect that he will be replaced by someone who  is well known and who is devoted to resolving domestic problems.</p>

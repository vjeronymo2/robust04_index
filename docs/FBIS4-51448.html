			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Duanmu Laidi (4551 2606 0171 1229) and Fang </F> Jin 2455 3866]    [Text] Beijing, 26 May (XINHUA) -- A ceremony to present  letters of appointment to the third batch of advisers on Hong  Kong affairs was held at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing  this afternoon. State leaders, including Jiang Zemin, Li Peng,  Qiao Shi, and Zhu Rongji, attended the ceremony.    Lu Ping, director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office, said in his speech: We have successively  appointed two batches of advisers on Hong Kong affairs since  1992. The past two years' experience has shown that the  practice of appointing advisers on Hong Kong affairs has been  successful. Shouldering a profound sense of responsibility  toward the Hong Kong people and their future; utilizing their  own talents, experiences, and advantages in their familiarity  with various aspects of Hong Kong society; and applying various  formats and channels, the advisers have made many valuable  suggestions on some major issues concerning the final  transitional period and on matters regarding the transfer of  government in 1997 and a smooth transition of Hong Kong. They  have played a very effective role as a think tank in the work of  the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and the XINHUA NEWS  AGENCY Hong Kong branch, and even in affecting the central  people's government's decisions on Hong Kong affairs.  Meanwhile, Hong Kong affairs advisers have, by exerting their  personal influence, played an active role in publicizing the  Chinese Government's general and specific policies toward Hong  Kong; have publicized the basic law; and have reassured people's  feelings in general. Consequently, they have become an  important link and network that facilitate connections and  communications between us and the broad masses of Hong Kong  people.    Lu Ping said: The total number of the three batches of Hong  Kong affairs advisers has reached 141. The contingent has  expanded and has more extensive representativeness among its  members. Pursuing the principle that Hong Kong affairs advisers  have been appointed as individuals, we will listen to their  proposals, and various different suggestions and criticisms;  will make concerted efforts in unison; will properly perform the  tasks together so as to realize our common objectives -- a  smooth transition of Hong Kong and its long-term stability and  prosperity.    As 1 July 1997 draws near, not only the broad masses of Hong  Kong people have not weakened their confidence in Hong Kong's  future due to the Sino-British disputes over political system  issues, but they have strengthened it. More and more Hong Kong  people have demonstrated a profound sense of responsibility and  involvement for a smooth transition of Hong Kong. Many friends  have formed this conviction: Now that the Sino-British talks on  political system issues have broken down, we must rely on our  own strength [li liang 0500 6852] to ensure a smooth transition  of Hong Kong. Such conviction has further enhanced our  confidence in Hong Kong's future.    Lu Ping stressed: Comrade Deng Xiaoping had said as early as  a decade ago that "Hong Kong people will administer Hong Kong."  In other words, "Hong Kong people consisting mainly of patriots  will administer Hong Kong." He also pointed out that we should  create conditions for Hong Kong people to smoothly take over the  government during the transitional period. He urged "Hong Kong  people of various circles to make efforts in this regard." We  hope that upholding the stance on saying all they know without  reserve as masters of their own affairs, Hong Kong affairs  advisers will make valuable proposals on a smooth transition of  Hong Kong, on a successful transfer of government [zheng quan  shun li jiao jie 2398 2938 7311 0448 0074 2234] in 1997, and on  maintaining long-term stability and prosperity in Hong Kong.    Zhou Nan, director of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong  branch, presented the letters of appointment to the 49 new Hong  Kong affairs advisers.    Also attending the meeting were leading comrades Zou Jiahua,  Qian Qichen, Li Lanqing, Luo Gan, and Ji Pengfei.</p>

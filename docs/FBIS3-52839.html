A  correspondent of Message of Freedom Radio and Television reports  that in the first sermon of the Friday prayer brother Hekmatyar  delivered a comprehensive speech.    In a section of the speech he said: [words indistinct] There  should have been a government in Kabul but there is no  administration nor government. Over the past 20 months there  has been no security even around the Arg [presidential palace]  nor were the property, dignity, and life of the people safe.  Brother Hekmatyar added: Unfortunately the other side has  opted for the path of force, deception, and broken promises. A  ceasefire came to force in Tagab, but they started fighting in  Kabul a short time after that. For [words indistinct] we  proposed a plan but the other side rejected it. They wanted  [word indistinct] or Khiarkhan [a district northwest of Kabul]  government to continue. Tagab blood had not yet dried up when  they started more bloody fighting in Kabul.    The prime minister said: [words indistinct] every force and  mojahedin who believes in God and pities the nation shall take  each other's hands and take steps for a final action. God  willing the present fighting is the final battle which will  resolve the crisis of the country. Concluding his speech  brother Hekmatyar said: All those equations which ensured the  chance of the coalition's survival have been disrupted.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pristina, Yugoslavia, April 5 (TANJUG) -- The public  prosecutor in Pristina has ordered an investigation of six  ethnic Albanians suspected of plotting to set up an ethnic  Albanian paramilitary force in Serbia's province of  Kosovo-Metohija in order to detach it from Serbia and its parent  Yugoslavia and annex it to neighbouring Albania.    The suspects -- Fehmi Lestrani, 21, Skelzen Bajrami, 21,  Nexhmedinpsadriju, 31, Luan Heta, 23, Beqir Muleci, 38, and Isni  Franc -- are all in investigative detention.    In the course of 1992 and 1993, the group is suspected of  having undergone military training in Albania under the orders  of the self- proclaimed government of "the republic of Kosovo."  The training included instruction in the use of all sorts of  small arms, armoured personnel carriers, tanks and explosive  devices and in sabotage.    Many ethnic Albanians from Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro)  and  The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] have been  trained by Albanian army officers near Elbasan in Albania.    A strong separatist movement has been active for decades in  Kosovo-Metohija whose population is mostly ethnic Albanian. The  separatists allege human and minority rights violations in an  effort to justify their struggle for separation.    The Yugoslav police has irrefutable proof that dozens of  ethnic Albanians from the province have undergone military  training in Albania, but fears that many more have gone  undetected.    In mid-1992, eight ethnic Albanians received prison terms  for  smuggling into Kosovo-Metohija 74 automatic rifles, 14,000  rounds of ammunition and other military equipment from their  training camp near Tirana.    This and the latest case show that ethnic Albanians from  Yugoslavia and the former Yugoslav republics are being trained  in several camps in Albania, that the practice has been going on  for years and that such activities have been intensified of late.    Ethnic Albanian separatist leaders have recentty decided to  form a 40,000-strong paramilitary force, to help them in their  unlawful efforts to set up their own bodies of power throughout  the province.    A number of officials of the self-proclaimed defence  ministry  of "the republic of Kosovo" are soon to stand trial in Pristina.    "Defence Minister" Hajzer Hajzeraj and his lieutenants in  Pristina, Podujevo and Lipljan were directly subordinated to  Anton Kolaj, vice-president of the leading ethnic Albanian party  -- the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo -- who has fled the  province when the circle around him began to tighten.</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Letter: Horton had no knowledge for 'right answer' Sir, I believe Christopher Lorenz misses a point over the cultural changes and Robert Horton's departure from BP ('Oil and troubled waters', July 29). The comment of Horton's in Forbes magazine should not have been treated with dismay because of the arrogance it displayed but because of the simple fact that it was patently untrue within the context of the new BP culture. Horton no more knew what was going on at the coal face than any other director, so he could not get to the 'right answer' because he was not endowed with the appropriate knowledge. Within BP it is well understood among the converted that the new culture requires wholehearted support for it to take root. Many very effective managers with Horton's capacity and drive can be seen to bite their tongues rather than disrupt the obvious benefits that the cultural changes are bringing to the group. Some of them are completely aware that their natural style does have the power to bring the cultural changes to a grinding halt, or even catastrophically to reverse them. As the article said, it needed the mentality and drive of someone like Horton to move the BP group to the much needed cultural changes (these had in fact already been successfully started by the exploration business under the leadership of John Browne). But the very autocratic drive that got BP moving is also what the culture change had to eliminate. Drive is fine but autocratic drive is not. The new culture of empowerment says that executive management has the tools to set corporate direction but the workers at the coal face know all the problems and opportunities down there, so empower them to get on and exploit them. For many of us it is sad that we had to wait for so many years to see the uncompromising leadership necessary to move BP in the way that Horton and his colleagues have done. It is only a regret that the figurehead for the group's cultural change could not achieve it for himself. Charles McDowall, The Haughs of Clinterty, Kinellar, Aberdeen, AB5 0TN</p>

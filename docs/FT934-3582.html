			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / SW Bell in cable link-up with Cox Southwestern Bell, the US regional telecommunications group, and Cox Enterprises, the privately-owned media group, yesterday formed the latest multi-media alliance in the US when Southwestern agreed to invest Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.1bn) in a partnership which will own most of Cox's cable television systems. The deal follows a UK partnership between the two last spring when Cox took a 25 per cent stake in a cable television and telephone system run by Southwestern. Mr James Robbins, who heads Cox's cable business, said that 'after looking at many potential partners we realised the best match was with our existing partner in the UK'. Southwestern Bell, one of the seven Baby Bell local telephone companies, provides telecommunications services in Texas and neighbouring states. Atlanta-based Cox is a Dollars 2.5bn turnover media group with interests ranging from newspapers to television broadcasting stations. Under a memorandum of understanding, Southwestern will take a 40 per cent stake in the private US partnership, which will own 21 of Cox's cable systems, with about 1.6m subscribers in 16 states. The combined venture will have a market value of around Dollars 4.9bn and will be the sixth or seventh largest cable operator in the US. The partnership will exclude two Cox cable systems, in Oklahoma City and Lubbock, Texas, because Southwestern Bell provides a telephone service there. US law forbids telephone companies from owning cable businesses in their telecommunications service area. Cox has offered to place in the partnership various other cable interests, subject to separate negotiations. These could include a Dollars 500m investment Cox has agreed to make in QVC, the television home shopping network, to finance its hostile Dollars 10bn bid for Paramount, the US film and publishing group. The Cox deal is the latest example of US local telephone and cable companies forming alliances in preparation for the growth of a multi-media home entertainment industry. Cox and Southwestern said much of the telephone company's Dollars 1.6bn investment would help 'aggressively expand cable subscribership' and acquire interests in programming.</p>

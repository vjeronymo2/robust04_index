			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Business and the Environment: Cleaning up after the Party - Years of mining lignite have left eastern Germany with a severe pollution problem Nobody said it was going to be easy. Nobody said it would be cheap. Everybody agreed it was a mess. Cleaning up eastern Germany after 40 years of communist rule and, before that, several decades of rapid industrialisation presents an enormous challenge to the German authorities. One of the main challenges is healing the damage caused by extensive brown coal (lignite) mining. Vast areas of landscape were scarred by opencast mining and the air polluted as the fuel was burned in power plants. Until 1990, lignite mining affected 1,280 sq km, or 1.2 per cent of the land area of eastern Germany. These sites, containing a high level of sulphuric acid, were one of the main sources of eastern Germany's high levels of water and air pollution. The enormous range of measures needed to clean up the mess left by mining and other economic activities in eastern Germany was summed up in the basic targets set out by Germany's environment ministry in November 1990, a few months after unification. The paper listed tasks that required immediate action: Construction or modernisation of 35 municipal and 24 industrial waste treatment plants in the Elbe region; and construction of 27 sewage treatment plants near the Baltic Sea and the Oder and Neisse rivers; Construction of 6,200 km of new sewers and modernisation of 5,000 km of old sewers; Modernisation of 278 outdated plants - including 10 lignite burning power stations - 142 industrial power stations and 126 heating plants; Establishment of 10 hazardous waste treatment sites; Construction of five thermal units for the treatment of contaminated soils. The extent of these plans shows how damaging an impact industrial, water and air pollution had on the country as a result of the neglect of the infrastructure. Over the years, chemical plants were located around some of the opencast mines in what are now the states of Brandenburg, Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt. The brown coal could then be transported quickly and easily to industry, which could in turn dump its waste in exhausted pits or huge landfills. In the process of extracting the brown coal, the engineers strip-mined. The idea was to pump water out of the soil in order to get at the lignite. The problem was that once the mines were exhausted, the unchecked water levels rose. As this happened, the water soaked through layers of sulphuric acid or through waste dumped by local industry. Once the water reached the surface, it flowed into the rivers, streams and often the domestic water supplies. The task now facing the states and the federal government is how to close down some of the obsolescent lignite mines with the aim of making the surrounding land fit again for cultivation. Both parties, and the Treuhand, the agency charged with privatising and restructuring east German industry, have embarked on a long-term policy which will lead to land reclamation, as well as short-term job creation. As ever, the problem lies in the cost. In March, the federal government and the Treuhand put together a financial package to tackle these issues. The government will provide 60 per cent and the states 40 per cent of the cost of cleaning up 'local levels of contamination' or cases which do not endanger life. For the more difficult and often hazardous projects, such as cleaning up the brown coal and chemical sectors, the government will provide 75 per cent of the cost and the states 25 per cent. The total cost, spread over five years, will be at least DM15bn (Pounds 6bn). Yet, now that some of the financing has been arranged, Heiner Bonnenberg, one of the Treuhand's main experts on reclamation, says the costs for cleaning up eastern Germany are not as high as first estimated. In fact, he believes they were often distorted, partly so that investors, or their consultants, could exaggerate the environmental hazards in order to beat down the Treuhand's selling price. 'Of course, we could not ask the investor to pick up the environmental liabilities. At that rate, nothing would be privatised,' he says. Yet he and his colleagues believe that unrealistically high costs of environmental liabilities were built into the balance sheets. To prove his point, Bonnenberg says the Treuhand had been allocated DM800m this year for cleaning up industry, excluding brown coal. 'We have used only DM200m, partly because the clean-up is not as bad as we thought; and also the states, which initiate the instructions for the clean-up, have not actually asked us to press ahead,' he explained. But it is not as clear-cut as that. On the one hand, the visible effects of environmental damage have sharply decreased throughout eastern Germany as a result of the collapse of its industry, so perhaps the sense of urgency has faded correspondingly among the states. On the other hand, many states either have difficulties raising their share of the costs for the clean-up or simply do not have the personnel to evaluate the extent of the environmental damage. However this may be, the states have a political interest in land reclamation. Since many brown coal fields will soon be shut, the unemployment rate will increase. Before 1989, for instance, the fields of Laubag in Brandenburg, and Mibrag in Saxony-Anhalt, together employed more than 100,000 people. By next year, they will employ fewer than 30,000. To counter the effects of rising unemployment, the federal government has devised a programme in which former mining employees will be redeployed in job-creation schemes to gradually shut down the mines. 'Closing a mine is not as easy as you think. It is a very expensive undertaking,' says Helmut Ballon, one of the senior Treuhand officials responsible for privatising coal. 'Germany's Mining Inspectorate, which oversees the running and closure of mines, has very strict regulations for shutting mines. It is in our interests to meet them. We cannot sell the land until we have met all the requirements needed to reclaim or recultivate the land,' he explained. Inevitably, the cost of reclamation indirectly impinges on the selling price of mines which will be used for some time yet. Ballon cited the cases of Laubag and Mibrag: 'For each tonne of coal these mines sell, we must put some money aside for rehabilitation, otherwise the mines will never be released from their duties by the Mining Inspectorate. Of course, all burdens of rehabilitation will be left with us. If we consider the category of danger to human life, we reckon we will need about DM12bn to cover the worst environmental aspects of rehabilitating the areas surrounding these mines.' During the next five years, the Treuhand will spend DM1.5bn a year to rid the mines of the most dangerous environmental damage. With the co-operation of the states, it will employ 15,000 people on this, albeit on lower incomes. The scheme has two functions: it will deal as rapidly as possible with the worst dangers that attend mine closures, such as the rise in the level of contaminated water; and it will provide temporary employment of up to three years for each person. The results of cleaning up contaminated land can be seen in the Ruhr region in western Germany. Once the heartland of Germany's pre- and post-war industry, it has been transformed into a services sector and partial tourist attraction, helped by lakes formed with the water pumped out of the closed mines. Officials in Leipzig, the capital of the east German state of Saxony, want its surroundings to resemble the Ruhr, once the old mines are closed. There is even talk of Leipzig trying for the Olympic games some time in the next 20 years.</p>

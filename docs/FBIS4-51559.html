			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in  Japanese at 2258 GMT on 30 April, during its "News 2001"  program, broadcasts a live 26-minute panel discussion with  newly-appointed Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai. The  discussion is moderated by FNN announcers Yuji Kuroiwa and  Tomomi Seki; political commentator Kenichi Takemura and Keio  University Professor Yoshiaki Kobayashi also participate.    Kuroiwa first asks how Kumagai views the received opinion  that the Hata cabinet will be short-lived. Kumagai says people  tend to express sympathy, rather than congratulations, to him  for assuming the post of the chief government spokesman, when  they believe that current political conditions are the worst  ever. However, he says: "I am resolved to work to extract  politics from worst-case scenarios."    When asked what the top priority task for the new government  is, Kumagai mentions political reform and stresses the  importance of continuing reform efforts. He says: "I believe  completing political reform is the most important task for Prime  Minister Hata." He adds: "Finally, administrative and economic  reforms have also started. Reform is not merely a word on  everybody's lips, but is something to be achieved for Japan to  continue to exist."    Next, Kuroiwa asks for Kumagai's comments on people's  criticism that the new cabinet lineup was decided on only by  Hata, Kumagai, and Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Chief  Secretary Ichiro Ozawa. Kumagai denies the allegation, saying  that Prime Minister Hata heard the opinions of many other people  before forming the new cabinet. He then says it was inevitable  for Hata to give many cabinet posts to Shinseito and Komeito  [Clean Government Party] since the Social Democratic Party of  Japan [SDPJ], the largest among the ruling parties, has left the  ruling coalition.    Next, they discuss the issue of summoning to the Diet former  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's secretaries as witnesses to  investigate the scandal involving Hosokawa's receipt of a loan  from a private company. Kumagai says he thinks Hosokawa has  already assumed political responsibility for the stalled Diet  business caused by prolonged arguments over his loan, noting:  "It is not a matter for the Hata cabinet to decide how the issue  should be handled." But he predicts that Hosokawa's former  secretaries may be summoned to the Diet.    They turn to the issue of worsening trade ties with the  United States. Takemura says if the new government can ease  trade friction between the two countries over the next two  months, it will be a great achievement. Also, while showing the  results of his survey of Diet members on an indirect tax hike,  Professor Kobayashi says it is very important for Japan to  decide whether to implement the tax hike and bring the decision  to a Japan-U.S. summit meeting to be held immediately before the  Naples summit in July. The survey shows that 48 percent of Diet  members questioned support the tax hike, while 25.4 percent  oppose it. After hearing this, Kumagai notes that the coalition  platform agreed upon by the ruling parties and the SDPJ includes  a plan to implement the tax hike, saying: "In the process of  working out specific measures to implement the hike, we will  tenaciously work to persuade the SDPJ to return to the coalition  to carry out the policy platform with us."    Turning to the DPRK nuclear issue, Kuroiwa notes it is  highly  possible that if the United Nations Security Council [UNSC]  fails to adopt a resolution, Washington will independently  decide on economic sanctions against North Korea and ask Japan  and South Korea to participate as well. Kuroiwa then asks  Kumagai how Japan will respond to the U.S. call. Kumagai first  expresses the hope that the worst-case scenario be avoided in  dealing with the DPRK nuclear issue. He then stresses that  since negotiations between North Korea and the international  community to resolve the issue are in progress, he would like to  refrain from commenting on this issue. He says: "Because I am a  government official, I cannot comment on this at present. Also,  I cannot comment because we are now closely watching how  Pyongyang will respond [to the UNSC statement calling on the  DPRK to accept full inspections], which is due in early May."    Asked about the flagging economy, Kumagai says: "Frankly  speaking, I think it will take some time before we feel that the  economy is picking up, since the after-effects of the bursting  of the bubble economy still exist. But I believe the economy  has passed through its worst stage."    Concerning a possible alliance with the Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP], Kumagai says: "It may be possible for the  coalition to establish a grand union with the LDP if both sides  can agree on policies." But he stresses the importance of  forming an alliance with the SDPJ first, saying: "We have to  think about the SDPJ first. Because of our mistake, the party  had to leave the coalition. So, we will keep our door open to  them."    Noting that the enactment of bills on new constituency  boundaries for the House of Representatives is necessary to hold  the next general election under the new electoral system, which  is a combination of single seat constituencies and proportional  representation, Kobayashi asks Kumagai when he think these bills  will be enacted. Kumagai says: "It may be difficult to have  them passed before the end of May. At any rate, the coalition  platform says that the bills should be enacted before the end of  the current Diet session."    In the end, Kumagai says that while emphasizing cooperation,  the Hata cabinet will continue to uphold the torch of reform.</p>

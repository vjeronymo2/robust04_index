Chinese sources said barring last minute changes, Mr. Zhu  would replace premier Li Peng as the host of the press  conference to be given to the domestic and international press  when the plenary legislative session ends around March 25.  Joining Mr. Zhu at the press event will be vice-premiers Zou  Jiahua and Li Lanqing.    Mr. Zhu, who has been the major economic policy maker since  late 1992, will present Beijing's case for boosting macro-level  adjustments and controls.    Informed sources said premier Li would this year drop his  annual practice of hosting a press conference after each NPC  session, which he began when he became head of the Government in  1988. They said the spotlight on Mr. Zhu reflected the fact  that he had recovered from his relatively weak position at the  height of the austerity programme late last year, when he was  under attack from regional cadres and liberal economists.    The sources added it was very likely Mr. Zhu would hold on  to  his concurrent position of Governor of the People's Bank of  China until later this year. While upon assuming the post last  July, Mr. Zhu had indicated it would be a temporary arrangement,  it is understood he recently decided he had to hang on to the  position to ensure the success of banking and fiscal reforms.    No major personnel changes are expected to take place during  this NPC, analysts in Beijing said.    Two other major press conferences, to be hosted by  Vice-Premier Qian Qichen and First Vice-Chairman of the NPC,  Tian Jiyun would be organised in the course of the  fortnight-long congress. Mr. Qian, who as Foreign Minister  heads the Preliminary Working Committee handling the transition  of Hong Kong to Chinese control, will take questions on Hong  Kong. He will also discuss Macao and other international  affairs.    Mr. Tian will elaborate on the legislative agenda and put  emphasis on the NPC's growing powers of supervision over the  Government.    In addition, journalists will be able to meet ministers,  provincial and non-communist party leaders and entrepreneurs.</p>

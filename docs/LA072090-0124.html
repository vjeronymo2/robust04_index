			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Gillett Sells Baltimore TV Station: Gillett Group signed a letter of intent to  sell NBC affiliate WMAR-TV in Baltimore for $154.7 million to Scripps Howard  Broadcasting Co., a subsidiary of E. W. Scripps Co., the Cincinnati-based  newspaper publisher and broadcaster. Gillett Group, controlled by Denver  businessman George Gillett, has been under pressure to sell some of its TV  station holdings to reduce debt. The transaction is also one of the few sales  of a major-market TV station in the past year, after a slowdown in debt-driven,  leveraged media deals.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Newsbrief" program, presented by Patricia Glyn] </F>   [Text] [Glyn] We are joined now by a spokesman for the IFP  [Inkatha Freedom Party], Ed Tillet. Mr. Tillet, can you give us  first up your reaction to this mayhem in town?    [Tillet] Good day to you, Patricia. I just wanted to correct  some unfounded reports earlier on Newsbrief, linking today's  march to the IFP. The march is in fact a Zulu march. It has  been organized and initiated by Zulu headmen on the Reef. It  has absolutely nothing to do with the IFP.    [Glyn] Do you therefore distance yourself completely from  the  behavior of the people down there?    [Tillet] Well, let me just say at the outset that we have  rceived unconfirmed information from an intelligence source that  there was a deliberate plot hatched to disrupt today's march,  today's Zulu march, and that there were to be snipers positioned  in various areas, and also individuals, agents provocateurs,  planted in the march, that were intended to sow panic, mayhem,  destruction, and to fire indiscriminately at marchers, so that  it became impossible to know where the shots were emanating from.    [Glyn] But do you, Mr. Tillet, distance yourself from the  kind of behavior we have seen from this crowd today?    [Tillet] We completely distance ourselves from all forms of  violence whatsoever. It is very, very sad that there are agents  provocateurs that have allegedly tried to disrupt today's march,  evidently trying to provoke a counter-response. They have  achieved exactly what they wanted to achieve -- to sow panic,  mayhem, and destruction in central Johannesburg.    [Glyn] Our reporters there, Mr. Tillet, seem to indicate to  us that there are an awful lot of IFP supporters down there.  Should they be responsible for the violence, what will your  course of action be?    [Tillet] Well, I would like to ask your reporter on what  basis he or she comes to the conclusion that they are IFP  members, but, of course, we do concede that there must be some  overlapping between the Zulu marchers present and IFP members  and supporters among them. There's no doubt about that. But the  IFP as a political organization cannot be held responsible for a  march which has been organized and initiated by the Zulu headmen  in the Transvaal in support of their Zulu king's demands.    [Glyn] Are you suggesting that the IFP has no influence over  the Zulu nation in this part of the world?    [Tillet] Yes, it does have an influence, but you know, I  don't think that anybody was expecting the kind of sabotaging of  today's march. It's highly unfortunate and regrettable what has  happened, and I think that there will have to be an  investigation, a very senior police inquiry, into the events of  today that culminated in this morning's mayhem.    [Glyn] Well, when you were informed of the intention of  these  people to go on the march, did you make any kind of request to  their leaders for them to leave all their traditional weapons at  home?    [Tillet] Well, Zulus are perfectly entitled to bear their  traditional weapons. Those are cultural weapons, and I don't  think that that has got anything to do with it. I think that  that is a red herring and a smokescreen that is raised by  political opponents of the IFP and of the Zulu nation.    [Glyn] But given the explosive nature of a situation like  this, do you not think it would have been a good idea to make a  plea to these people to come unarmed?    [Tillet] Well, I think you are diverting the focus. Instead  of focussing on the agents provocateurs that allegedly started  the shooting, you are now focussing on individuals who are  exercising their democratic right to participate in a march in  support of their king's demands, albeit with traditional  weapons. Those traditional weapons have been handed down  through centuries. I cannot see how the IFP or any other  organization, for that matter, including the state, can expect  Zulus to abandon their traditional cultural heritage.    [Glyn] Ed Tillet, thank you very much for joining us today  on  Newsbrief. Mr. Tillet is a spokesman for the IFP.</p>

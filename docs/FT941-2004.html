			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Radio frequencies may be auctioned The government is considering radical proposals for management of the radio spectrum including the possibility of holding auctions and even creating a secondary market in spectrum assignments. The possibility of radical change came yesterday in a consultative document from the Department of Trade and Industry. The radio spectrum is the complete range of useful radio frequencies governing everything from radio and television to mobile communications, microwave telecommunications links and satellite services. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said yesterday that the document envisaged 'an extended role for the private sector in planning the spectrum and assigning frequencies'. The Radiocommunications Agency, which assigns frequencies now, would retain responsibility for a number of core activities that had to be performed by the government. The document comes eight years after a DTI report by consultants CSP International argued that the allocation of frequencies through licences designed to meet only the cost of regulation had led to the inefficient use of a scarce resource. The report suggested that the existing method of allocation should be progressively replaced by one 'which gives greater scope for the operation of market forces'. The DTI said yesterday that there had since been a big increase in demand on the radio spectrum. The DTI is asking for comments on two main options for the future, administrative pricing or selective auctions. Setting flexible fees linked to the types of frequency bands used or the efficiency of equipment would encourage users to apply for and retain only the spectrum they needed. What the DTI describes as 'a more radical approach' would involve the creation of a system of tradeable property rights in the spectrum. Auctions could either sell parts of the spectrum direct to users or rights could be sold to a private spectrum management organisation which would assign licences in either the fixed link or private mobile radio bands on a commercial basis.</p>

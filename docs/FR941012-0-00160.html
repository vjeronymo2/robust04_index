			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By stating the test in terms of ``threat'' and ``peril,'' the Supreme Court made clear in ATMI that economic infeasibility begins short of industry-wide bankruptcy. OSHA itself has placed the line considerably below this level. (See for example, ATMI, 452 U.S. at 527 n. 50; 43 FR 27,360 (June 23, 1978). Proposed 200 &mu;g/m3 PEL for cotton dust did not raise serious possibility of industry-wide bankruptcy, but impact on weaving sector would be severe, possibly requiring reconstruction of 90 percent of all weave rooms. OSHA concluded that the 200 &mu;g/m3 level was not feasible for weaving and that 750 &mu;g/m3 was all that could reasonably be required). See also 54 FR 29,245&hyph;246 (July 11, 1989); American Iron &amp; Steel Institute, 939 F.2d at 1003. OSHA raised the engineering control level for lead in small nonferrous foundries to avoid the possibility of bankruptcy for about half of small foundries even though the industry as a whole could have survived the loss of small firms. Although the cotton dust and lead rulemakings involved health standards, the economic feasibility ceiling established therein applies equally to safety standards. Indeed, because feasibility is a necessary element of a ``reasonably necessary or appropriate'' standard, this ceiling boundary is the same for health and safety rulemaking since it comes from section 3(8), which governs all permanent OSHA standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All OSHA standards must also be cost-effective in the sense that the protective measures being required must be the least expensive measures capable of achieving the desired end (ATMI, at 514 n. 32;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Building and Constr. Trades Dep't, AFL&hyph;CIO  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Brock,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 838 F.2d 1258, 1269 (D.C. Cir. 1988)). OSHA gives additional consideration to financial impact in setting the period of time that should be allowed for compliance, allowing as much as ten years for compliance phase-in. (See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United Steelworkers of Am.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Marshall,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 647 F.2d 1189, 1278 (D.C. Cir. 1980),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> cert. denied,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 453 U.S. 913 (1981).) Additionally, OSHA's enforcement policy takes account of financial hardship on an individualized basis. OSHA's Field Operations Manual provides that, based on an employer's economic situation, OSHA may extend the period within which a violation must be corrected after issuance of a citation (CPL. 2.45B, Chapter III, paragraph E6d(3)(a), Dec. 31, 1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To reach the necessary findings and conclusions that a safety standard substantially reduces a significant risk of harm, is both technologically and economically feasible, and is cost effective, OSHA must conduct rulemaking in accord with the requirements of section 6 of the OSH Act. The regulatory proceeding allows it to determine the qualitative and, if possible, the quantitative nature of the risk with and without regulation, the technological feasibility of compliance, the availability of capital to the industry and the extent to which that capital is required for other purposes, the industry's profit history, the industry's ability to absorb costs or pass them on to the consumer, the impact of higher costs on demand, and the impact on competition with substitutes and imports. (See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ATMI  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> at 2501&hyph;2503;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> American Iron &amp; Steel Institute  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> generally.) Section 6(f) of the OSH Act further provides that, if the validity of a standard is challenged, OSHA must support its conclusions with ``substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole,'' a standard that courts have determined requires fairly close scrutiny of agency action and the explanation of that action. (See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Steelworkers,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 647 F.2d at 1206&hyph;1207.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA's powers are further circumscribed by the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, which provides a neutral forum for employer contests of citations issued by OSHA for noncompliance with health and safety standards (29 U.S.C. 659&hyph;661; noted as an additional constraint in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Benzene  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> at 652 n. 59). OSHA must also respond rationally to similarities and differences among industries or industry sectors. (See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Building and Constr. Trades Dep't, AFL&hyph;CIO  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Brock,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 838 F.2d 1258, 1272&hyph;73 (D.C. Cir. 1988).) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

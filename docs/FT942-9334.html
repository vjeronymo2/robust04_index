			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / New Premier for Haiti Haiti's army-installed president named himself prime minister yesterday, hours after Mr Robert Malval, the premier named by ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, ordered government workers to ignore orders from the military regime, Associated Press reports from Port-au-Prince. Mr Emile Jonassaint, 81, issued the declaration in defiance of US growing pressure to restore Mr Aristide to power.  President Bill Clinton has not ruled out using military force to reinstall Mr Aristide, Haiti's first freely elected leader, who was deposed in a bloody coup in 1991.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Beijing, 5 Jan (XINHUA) -- The CPC Central  Committee Discipline Inspection Commission issued a circular on  30 December 1993 transmitting a notice from the Hebei Provincial  CPC Committee Discipline Inspection Commission concerning  mistakes made by Liu Qingfang, former secretary of the Lingshou  County party committee. The circular urges all localities and  departments, in conjunction with the current anticorruption  drive, to use the case of Liu Qingfang's expulsion from the  party on account of his mistakes in accepting gift money and  using it for his mother's ostentatious funeral, to conduct  education in party style and discipline among the large numbers  of party members and cadres, and to enhance their party spirit  and awareness, and their sense of organizational discipline,  integrity, and self-discipline.    The circular says: The expulsion of Liu Qingfang, a leading  county cadre, from the party for serious violation of  discipline, has once again admonished us that: 1) Communist  party members, and leading cadres at all levels in particular,  must constantly temper their party spirit, adhere to the  proletarian outlook on life and sense of value, constantly bear  in mind the party's objective of serving the people  wholeheartedly, be strict with themselves, and honestly perform  their duties. Only by doing so can they stand the tests of  governing, reform, and opening up; and forever retain political  integrity. 2) The party's leading cadres at all levels must set  an example in maintaining integrity and self-discipline. The  case of Liu Qingfang and other cases of violation of law and  discipline show that failure in self-discipline often leads to  corruption. Corruption, if unchecked, not only harms the  culprits themselves but also corrupts the party and blemishes  its image. It will also bring calamity to the country and the  people, and sow the seeds of trouble in the future if it is  allowed to spread. Therefore, leading cadres must take the lead  in maintaining integrity and self-discipline and guard against  becoming greedy, abusing power, trading power for money, and  using their position for personal gain. This is an essential  requirement and important safeguard in consolidating the party's  ruling status, developing the economy, promoting reform, and  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Party  organizations and leading cadres at all levels must be clearly  aware of this. 3) Leading cadres must earnestly practice what  they advocate, and they must promote new social ethics. Our  party has time and again stressed that socialism with Chinese  characteristics incorporates both material and spiritual  civilizations. An important responsibility of all leading  cadres is to work hard to build socialist spiritual  civilization; foster new social ethics; break away from corrupt  customs; and firmly resist the inroads of capitalist and  feudalist ideas in the course of promoting economic  construction. In the new situation of reform and opening up and  vigorous development of a socialist market economy, the vast  numbers of party members and cadres should not only maintain  integrity and self-discipline but should also take the lead in  promoting healthy practices and eliminating evil practices. They  should correctly guide and lead the broad masses in fostering  new social ethics and improving local atmosphere to create a  favorable social environment for reform, opening, and economic  construction.    The CPC Central Committee Discipline Inspection Commission  transmitted the notice issued by the Hebei provincial party  committee Discipline Inspection Commission on the mistakes made  by the former Lingshou County secretary, Liu Qingfang. [passage  omitted]    The notice issued by the Hebei provincial party committee  discipline inspection commission points out: As a leading party  cadre, Liu Qingfang should have observed party discipline and  maintained integrity in an exemplary way. Instead, to hold a  funeral ceremony for his mother in an extravagant way, he  accepted gifts of large amounts of money, used his position to  take bribes, and infringed on the economic interests of the  state and collective. His acts seriously violated party  discipline and created a very bad influence among the masses.  In light of this, the Hebei provincial party committee has  decided to expel him from the party.</p>

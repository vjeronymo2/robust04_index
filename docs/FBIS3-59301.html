			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lu Wenhuai (0712 2429 2037), Liaoning Population </F> Information Center: "Analysis of Extra-Plan Pregnancies of the  `Unintended' Type"]    [Excerpt] The term "extra-plan pregnancies" in the present  article refers to pregnancies that occur contrary to the birth  policy laid down in local (provincial, centrally controlled  municipality, and autonomous region) family planning  regulations. In recent years, a particular kind of extra-plan  pregnancies has come to the attention of the family planning  administration throughout the area of Liaoning Province and  Municipality. The intention in these cases of extra-plan  pregnancies is not at all to bear another child in excess of the  legal limit, but clearly, or not so clearly, the intention here  is otherwise. I call this phenomenon extra-plan pregnancies of  the "unintended" type. Even though occurrences are rather few,  they are on the increase, and they, furthermore, form an  important part of the larger group of extra-plan pregnancies in  the region. Undoubtedly, these extra-plan pregnancies of the  "unintended" type are a new problem that has arisen in the  present urban population and family planning administration, and  it deserves our attention and study.    1. Groups, Causes, and Characteristics of "Unintended" Type  Extra-Plan Pregnancies    There are mainly two groups of "unintended" extra-plan  pregnancies. In the first group the intention is to use the  extra-plan pregnancy as a kind of capital. When the government  agencies or the units concerned are after them to take remedial  measures, these people demand that certain economic problems or  social problems be resolved for them first, and that they would  take remedial measures only after that has been done for them.  The economic problems to which they ask for help, generally  comprise: their employment, their transfer to another line of  occupation, work, or work place, increases in wages or  allowances, asking for some kind of financial help, demanding  help in resolving some housing difficulty or to improve their  present housing, asking and to resolve some other economic  dispute. The social problems generally comprise: reinstatement  in a job after transfer or dismissal from an enterprise,  demanding punishment for unit leaders or other personnel whom  they accuse of "unfairness," and demanding resolution of other  social disputes. All the above methods, whether economically or  socially motivated, are conscious plans to get what they want by  means of an extra-plan pregnancy; they may therefore be  considered the "means to an end" type pregnancies.    The second group may be called the "accidental" type. There  had been no intention to get pregnant, yet pregnancy  unexpectedly occurred. They generally comprise: unexpected  pregnancies due to illicit cohabitation, unexpected pregnancies  due to prostitution, and unexpected pregnancies in cases of  marriages before the legal marriageable ages.    The occurrence and increase of the "unintended" extra-plan  pregnancies are not at all fortuitous phenomena. Let us first  look at them from the angle of social change and social  psychology. Reform and opening up are large social  transformations; they have upset the norms of traditional  behavior without establishing new behavioral norms. In this kind  of a transitional period from old to new, all kinds of complex  economic contradictions and social contradictions may arise. The  people's mentality also will undergo great changes, and some  people may develop an abnormal mentality and behave as if out of  control. For instance, people, who for a long time remain  unemployed in this society, are frequently developing serious  psychic depressions, while personnel let out of enterprises on  long leave may become suffering from inferiority complexes and  may act out their discontent in obnoxious ways.    Second, in some cases of warped mentalities and  out-of-control behavior, and prevelent, unhealthy social  practices, the effect is adding fuel to the flames. There are,  for instance, some responsible cadres in certain units who  handle cases unfairly, use public office for private gain,  misuse the powers of office, and subject people to injustices.  When things become critical, the people who have been treated  unjustly will try even the score by going to extremes. There are  also people who are afflicted with inflated egos, who place  money above all other considerations, who will turn right and  wrong upside down, and who viciously cause trouble for no reason  and use coercion against the party organization.    Third, the important position that family planning is now  occupying as a fundamental state policy gives some people the  wrong idea that here is a chance for bribery. At present, one  "negative vote" in matters of family planning can already  constitute a rigid indicator that will be critical in the  assessment of a particular unit's performance, which, in turn,  will have a direct bearing on the economic interests of the  responsible cadres and the entire personnel of the unit in  question. When people in such a situation will be looking for an  opportunity to stir up trouble and to intensify the  contradiction, they will think it a most powerful move to play  the "extra-plan pregnancy" card. In the past, in the course of  family planning and service activities, some agencies in charge  had indeed rendered warmhearted assistance to some households of  child-rearing ages that had gotten into genuine difficulties.  Such normal cases may have aroused in a small number of people  an abnormal and obnoxious motivation, having them erroneously  assume that it would be possible by means of extra-plan  pregnancies to "gain some illicit profit" and take undue  advantage of a situation for one's own benefit.    Finally, in recent years, changes have occurred in Chinese  social relations as to such concepts as chastity and marriage.  The dirty dregs of prostitution have resurfaced, and unmarried  cohabitation and underage marriages are widespread. This has had  the numbers of "accidental" type and "unintended" type  extra-plan pregnancies increase without any sign of abating, and  has become a social phenomenon that is causing grave concern.    The following are some of the characteristics of the  "unintended" type of extra-plan pregnancies:    1) Inferior quality of the relevant person as a work  subject.  Using extra-plan pregnancies as capital and as a means to make  unjustified demands against the party organization are generally  actions by a small number of people of inferior mentality and  low level of general education. Some of these people have done  time in the two institutions of "reform through labor" (reform  of criminals through labor, reeducation of juvenile delinquents  through labor), some are vagrant riffraff. Illicit relations  between the two sexes and subsequent pregnancies are also mostly  occurring among people of inferior personal quality.    2) The arduous nature of efforts at solution of the problem.  If the relevant person as a work subject is not of a somewhat  higher type, it is often the case that the conflict between the  individual and the party organization has sharpened to a certain  extent, that the individual believes that his problem cannot be  resolved in a normal way, and that he will then heartlessly  strike out in the wrong way and play the "extra-plan pregnancy"  card. Behind what outwardly appears a simple "extra-plan  pregnancy" phenomenon there is hidden in the background a  complex contradiction, and effective resolution of these types  of problems is a very thorny affair.    3) Widespread involvement of many departments and units. The  economic and social contradictions that are background to  "unintended" extra-plan pregnancies frequently involve many  sectors of society, such as public health, civil affairs,  industrial and communications, urban construction, public  safety, and judicial departments. The contradictions cannot  possibly be resolved by merely relying on the family planning  departments. These types of contradictions involve a large  number of large and small units of society. On the other hand,  during the economic reform, the leadership system of many units  has changed, the organizational structure has been abolished,  and personnel has changed. Some units have even been completely  abolished or merged, and all this has created many unbelievable  difficulties for the resolution of the said contradictions.    4) The changing nature in the types of objectives.  Regardless  of whether the "unintended" extra-plan pregnancies had been of  the "means to an end" type or of the "accidental" type, the  initial and original objectives of the persons involved may not  have been a childbirth in excess of the plan limits, but rather  to take on manifestly the role of an extra-plan pregnancy.  Following the many changes in such factors as the external  environmental conditions, the eruption of contradictions and  their treatment, the internal motivations in the pregnant  persons may also change. If the problem is not dealt with  appropriately, the objective pursued by the person having the  extra-plan pregnancy may change from the intention of not having  a childbirth to the intention of having a childbirth. Each case  of this kind of a "pregnancy situation"; therefore, entails an  extra-plan birth and the danger of it.    2. "Unintended" Extra-Plan Pregnancies Pose New Tasks for  the  Administration of Urban Family Planning    According to investigations conducted in a certain large  city  of Liaoning Province, it was found that although urban family  planning work been a primary concern in recent years,  nonetheless, many new situations and new problems gave arisen.  Although the "unintended" type extra-plan pregnancies  occurences are few, the tendency has been to develop from  nothing to something and from few occurrences to many  occurrences. For instance, in one city ward, from January to  May in 1992 and in 1993, there were 62 cases of persons with  extra-plan pregnancies doing ideological mobilization work,  along with the participation of the party secretary in charge of  family planning. A later analysis established that 38 cases  were of the "unintended" type, i.e. 61.3 percent. The analysis  showed that extra-plan pregnancies of the "unintended" types  were the highest, floating population was second, and  extra-plan pregnancies among personnel residents in who wanted  more children was third.

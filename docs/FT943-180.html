			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Observer: Modesty Lara Can anyone really believe themselves a failure after knocking up 2,066 runs in an English county cricket season? But Brian Lara reckons he let down his county club, Warwickshire, at certain crucial moments. In his latest newspaper column in his native Trinidad and Tobago, he singles out his score of 81 runs - a good one-day knock by anyone's standards - in the NatWest one-day final, which Worcestershire went on to win. Warwickshire, already having won the County Championship, and the Benson and Hedges Cup were thus prevented from cleaning up all the major titles. 'People praised my innings and said it was my biggest one-day score, but I felt guilty that I got out at the wrong time,' says Lara. However, one man who is happy that Lara got out when he did is Richard Flavell, a director of Lombard Risk Systems. Flavell, a maths wizard, came closest to guessing the difference between the number of first-class runs scored by Lara and the Footsie close on Monday September 19 - the final day of the English cricket season. Although Lara has nearly doubled his runs since the contest started in June and the index has only added 79 points, the Gifted One was still trailing by 1,013 points when the game ended. A Methuselah of Veuve Cliquot - courtesy of Simon Rostron, the City PR man who suggested the challenge - will be on its way shortly.</p>

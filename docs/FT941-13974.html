			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Keeping the European dream alive - The challenges facing Charterhouse following its change of ownership While optimistic by nature, Mr Victor Blank does not overstate the chance of him heading the first true pan-European merchant bank. 'That is the vision, but I do not suppose it will happen in my working lifetime,' says 51-year-old Mr Blank. Charterhouse, of which Mr Blank is chief executive, is now taking the first steps. It is in the first weeks under the 90 per cent ownership of Credit Commercial de France and Berliner Handels und Frankfurter Bank. The remaining 10 per cent is held by its former owner, Royal Bank of Scotland. Mr Blank's vision for his medium-sized City merchant bank is for it to form the investment banking arm of its French and German parents while drawing on its British roots. But for the foreseeable future, it will remain a UK bank operating with the support, and partial direction of its shareholders. Transforming Charterhouse will be a tough task. It does not have the capital strength and breadth of leading UK investment banks such as Schroders or SG Warburg. It has also suffered from a prolonged period of uncertainty over its ownership since the possibility of a sale emerged two years ago. Some of Charterhouse's competitors believe that it no longer has the power of the mid-1980s when it carved out a niche in mergers and acquisitions. 'I think they have rather withered on the vine, and the uncertainty over who owned them has been quite damaging,' says one rival corporate financier. Mr Blank's European vision is superficially attractive. It draws on some of the same logic that persuaded Deutsche Bank to acquire Morgan Grenfell in 1989. He hopes to attract cross-border advisory work from medium-sized companies of between Pounds 100m and Pounds 1bn market capitalisation. But Charterhouse has a lot to prove. Royal Bank lost Pounds 35.1m in selling the 90.1 per cent stake, including the writing-off of Pounds 23.1m goodwill. Profits for 1993 were only Pounds 20.2m - the same as two years ago - although the figure would have been higher but for Royal Bank's disposal accounting. Mr Blank is undisturbed by such unpropitious omens, arguing that the bank is finally capable of pursuing a clear strategy. 'We didn't have the size to go it alone, but we have set a marker. If any of our peer group think they can simply operate from these shores, they are barmy.' He thought of seeking European partners three years ago, when the mergers and acquisitions boom of the 1980s was ebbing. The bank had made a name for innovations - including several management buy-outs - but needed to find ways of developing its corporate finance and venture capital businesses. Commercial banks that bought investment banks in the 1980s acquired a reputation of managing them badly because they did not understand the deal-making culture. But Mr Blank believed that Royal Bank, far from crushing Charterhouse by trying to integrate it crudely, had not made the most of it. Charterhouse thought that it should take charge of some of Royal Bank's corporate relationships so that it could add its advisory and capital markets services to Royal Bank's lending; it could not agree the idea with its parent, however, and so asked for leave to seek an alternative strategy. This eventually led it to the deal with CCF and BHF. The French bank already had a significant merchant banking arm in its domestic market, but was looking to expand into London. The German bank wanted a way of learning some corporate advisory techniques alien to its home market. Mr Blank thinks that BHF benefits by watching Charterhouse and other City institutions at work. 'Merchant banking is a less sophisticated activity there. I think it was important for them to invest in London to acquire the skills they are going to need in their own market place,' he says. For CCF, the acquisition is more a means of establishing a London presence. Mr Jean Christian Metz, the CCF director on Charterhouse's management board, says it could not simply establish a subsidiary. 'You can never grow as fast in a country like Britain starting from scratch,' he says. For the moment, the most obvious day-to-day effect of the change of ownership is a video conferencing link established between London, Paris and Frankfurt to encourage a flow of information. Mr Blank says that the links mean that 'many times a day, people talk business to each other'. Even joined together, the three institutions may find it difficult to compete with more powerful rivals. These include not only Lazard Freres in Paris and Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt but US investment banks such as Goldman Sachs. Mr Blank says such powerful competition stimulates innovation. 'If you do not have a client list like Schroders, then you have got to have creative ideas,' he says. He believes that Charterhouse can carve a similar niche advising medium-sized companies that are looking overseas, similar to that which it achieved in the last decade in domestic buy-outs. As he admits, there is limited evidence after only a few weeks under new ownership. Charterhouse still has to work to show that its vision of pan-European merchant bank is more practical than other European dreams. Mr Blank will have plenty for which to strive in his working lifetime.</p>

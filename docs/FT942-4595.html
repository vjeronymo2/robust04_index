			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Brazil aims to deter price rises: Strict measures planned to back new currency Brazil is preparing tough legal measures to deter companies from raising prices after the country's new currency is introduced on July 1. The measures are also partly designed to deflect criticism that the government's economic stabilisation plan, launched last December to tackle near-hyperinflation, has benefited business rather than consumers. A so-called 'anti-trust' law was approved by the lower house of Congress on Tuesday and is expected to be passed by the Senate next week. The measures expected to be adopted include: Heavy fines or even prison sentences for those found guilty of implementing 'unjustified' price increases and 'excessive' prices; Companies controlling 30 per cent of a market will be defined as dominant and subject to special scrutiny; Mergers or alliances between companies controlling more than 30 per cent of a market will need clearance from a newly empowered watchdog, known as Cade. The law has been under discussion for a year but its implementation has become a priority only in recent weeks. The government fears that without such a law in place it will be powerless to deter companies from raising prices in the new currency, the real, thereby leading to another inflationary spiral. Heavy lobbying from the business community, which feared that the new controls could be too subjective and open to political abuse, led to some measures being watered down. Prison terms will now be handed down only if there is clear evidence of 'crimes against the economic order' and definite individual responsibility, which is expected to be difficult to prove. Analysts said the new law was important to deter outright price abuses especially since, following five years of deregulation, the government has less control over the economy. But some price rises, especially for services, will be impossible to prevent. In previous currency switches, the government has usually imposed some form of temporary price freeze. This time the government has shunned all such 'magic' measures. But some observers said the new law, if passed, would be important as a propaganda weapon to calm the doubts of consumers, who have seen inflation increase to about 45 per cent a month since plans to introduce the new currency were announced. Approval should stem criticism from the populist President Itamar Franco, who is unhappy about price rises and high interest rates. Any reduction in interest rates now would be dangerous because of the need for tight monetary policy following the real's introduction.</p>

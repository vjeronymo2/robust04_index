This could climb to $2.1  billion during the year if civilian and military public servants  demand their share according to the salary equity principle.  Labor Minister Walter Barelli, who worked out the figures,  regretted the decision. He considers it harmful to the economic  plan. In Washington, Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso  said he hopes "the Senate will have the political insight to see  that this measure cannot be approved now."    "It was an unforgivable and unjustifiable decision. We  cannot promote salary equality through speeches," Cardoso said.  "If the veto is overridden we will have to cut other expenses,  perhaps funds allotted to the Chamber of Deputies itself." The  minister said the government is aware that salaries in some  categories are too low, but this is not the way to solve the  problem. Barelli said the new measure means government spending  will amount to almost half what it expects to collect with the  IPMF [Provisional Tax on Financial Operations]. This will be the  case if all public servants demand and obtain equal treatment.    The labor minister made these remarks following a special  meeting of the Severance Pay Fund (FGTS) Oversight Board.  Barelli said the government is aware of the decision and is  preparing to face the problem, which he classified as a power  jurisdiction problem. Barelli said the issue is being analyzed  by the government attorney because it violates the principle of  salary equity, which is a constitutional tenet.    The greatest government fear is that the legislative branch  decision and the Supreme Court ruling might provoke a chain  reaction involving civilian and military federal employees.  They can use the same salary equity principle to get their  salaries raised the way it was done by the Chamber of Deputies,  overriding the presidential veto which reestablished the salary  ceiling for public employees as the amount earned by ministers.  The same can happen with the Supreme Court decision to move the  date for calculating the mean salary level for the past four  months from the 30th to the 20th of each month. The decision  will result in higher salary levels at the time of converting  them to URV's.</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Wessex Water rises 20% and meets expectations Fears that a false market in water shares would be created by leaks of forthcoming price increases appeared unfounded as Wessex Water ended the industry's results season yesterday. Wessex met expectations with a 20 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 103.3m and a 9.3 per cent dividend rise to 23.5p. This included a final pay-out of 15.5p, up by 9 per cent. Sales increased by 6 per cent to Pounds 217.2m for the year to March 31. Analysts expressed relief that there had been no leaks of the discussions water companies are having with the industry regulator Ofwat on price increases for the next five years. The companies had received draft increases at the end of May, but the figures will not be published until July 28. This had prompted complaints to Ofwat and the Stock Exchange that speculation could have led to a false market. The season showed water companies concerned above all with cost-cutting and treasury management. This will be increasingly important under the stricter pricing regime promised by the regulator. Companies will have to live with lower price increases, while facing increased capital commitments because of regulation and environmental concerns. On average, analysts said, costs rose by about 2 per cent against almost 6 per cent a year between 1990 and 1993. Wessex scored highly on cost control yesterday, showing a 2 per cent decline at the operational level. After allowing for higher depreciation, costs were held at Pounds 125m. The group's profits were boosted by a doubled contribution from the joint venture with Waste Management International. Wessex intended to continue pursuing acquisitions in the waste management division, having completed eight last year. Some Pounds 65m remained to fund expansion. The core utility increased operating profits by 14 per cent to Pounds 92.2m. Wessex ended the year with net cash of Pounds 39m. Fully diluted earnings per share rose to 60.4p from 60.1p. The shares closed down 17p at 586p. See Lex</p>

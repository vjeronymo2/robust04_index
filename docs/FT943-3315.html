			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Toyota to double car production in N America Toyota, Japan's largest car manufacturer, said yesterday it would raise vehicle production in North America by nearly 50 per cent, more than double engine production there and increase vehicle exports from the US to markets, including Japan, by 60 per cent by 1996. The announcement came as US and Japanese trade officials continued their last-minute negotiations over how to increase foreign penetration of Japan's vehicle market and reduce the country's huge trade surplus with the US. The US is poised to take steps towards imposing sanctions against Japan at the end of this month unless an agreement can be reached on several trade issues. US carmakers reacted coolly to the announcement. Ford said: 'The important thing is whether they're doing anything to improve the trade deficit. What would interest us is whether they can increase the amount of US-sourced material in the vehicles. Up to now, we feel they probably have less than 50 per cent North American content.' Toyota's announcement is also the most dramatic indication yet by a Japanese vehicle maker of the pressures the Japanese industry faces from a sharply appreciated yen, trade friction with the US and growing competition from US vehicle manufacturers in the world's biggest car market. In July, Honda, Japan's third largest carmaker, announced that it would spend Dollars 310m on expanding its North American operations to bolster car and engine manufacturing capacity as well as strengthening its research and development and sales facilities. Toyota said yesterday it would raise total North American vehicle production to 790,000 units in 1996, up from 533,000 last year. Eight years ago, production in North America was only 14,000 units. The boost in production will mean that more than 60 per cent of the company's US sales will consist of North American-built vehicles, compared with 46 per cent in 1993. The increase will come from its manufacturing facility in Kentucky, Toyota Motor Manufacturing USA (TMM), from New United Motor Manufacturing, its joint venture with General Motors, and from Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada. The company will not increase existing capacity in North America but will achieve its target by using a second line at TMM, which came on stream in March this year, and by raising productivity. Annual production at TMM will increase from 234,000 last year to 400,000 in 1996. Toyota's overall engine production in North America will more than double to 440,000 units from 207,000 last year. Engine production at TMM will increase from 207,000 units to 350,000 units in 1996, including V6 engines, while production at TMMC will increase with the addition of a new engine plant, to almost 90,000 units annually. Increased local production will lift exports from North America by 60 per cent from 50,000 units in 1993 to about 80,000 units. Exports from Japan to the US will fall by nearly 28 per cent in 1996 to about 400,000 units against 554,000 last year. Toyota emphasised that it would not cut employment in Japan to cope with the decline but expected a recovery in the Japanese market to keep its domestic factories occupied. The effects of the shift to North America will at least be felt among the hundreds of Japanese car and car parts subcontractors that depend on Toyota for their survival. In the past year and a half, 127 subcontractors have closed under the pressures of a high yen and declining production in Japan, according to Teikoku Data Bank, a private research company.

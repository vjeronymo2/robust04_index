			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / International Bonds: Cool reception for Austrian offering amid heavy CDollars issuance A BATCH of new issues in Canadian dollars dominated activity in the Eurobond market yesterday. Also, two more UK companies tapped the sterling market, still buoyant after last week's election win for the Conservative party. The three Canadian dollar Eurobonds, totalling CDollars 525m, met a mixed reception. A CDollars 250m 10-year offering for the Republic of Austria was widely criticised for its aggressive pricing. The bonds, launched by Paribas, were priced to yield 30 basis points above the 10-year Canadian government bond, as much as 10 basis points too tight, according to dealers. The proceeds were swapped into floating-rate yen. There is little outstanding 10-year paper in the sector, making the deal more difficult to price. Paribas also pointed out that Austria had no outstanding paper in the Canadian dollar sector, adding some rarity value to the transaction. But the deal suffered by comparison with another 10-year offering, by the Municipality of Toronto. The CDollars 125m deal via RBC Dominion Securities was priced to yield 87 basis points above the 10-year Canadian government bond. The deal met strong demand from European fund managers, and was sold out by the end of the day. However, Ontario-Hydro's global offering of 10-year bonds is currently trading at 90 basis points over the curve, and it would have been difficult to price Toronto far inside that spread, traders said. The half-point yield differential between Toronto and Austria, both triple-A rated, highlighted the aggressive pricing of the latter. Nevertheless, Paribas said the deal had met reasonable demand to close 99.72 bid, just below its fixed reoffer level of 99.78. Also in the sector, Mobil Oil Canada launched a CDollars 150m five-year deal via Goldman Sachs, priced at 62 basis points above the Canadian government bond yield curve. The deal is expected to take a while to place, since it is aimed at retail as well as institutional investors. In the sterling sector, John Lewis launched a Pounds 100m six-year deal via NatWest Capital Markets. It met strong demand from UK investors, who are familiar with the credit and therefore not deterred by the lack of an official rating. The deal was priced at 79 basis points above the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 1998. The proceeds of the issue will be used to refinance borrowings under a multiple option facility which matures in the following year. A Pounds 125m long-dated issue for P&amp;O arranged by Barclays de Zoete Wedd also met demand mainly from UK institutions. For both companies, the rally in the gilts market following the election brought their funding target levels within reach. A number of other UK companies are also eyeing the market, as absolute funding levels fall. However, unattractive swap rates are likely to continue to deter non-sterling based borrowers. Meanwhile, a Dollars 100m convertible bond offering for Korea's Samsung Electronics met a less than enthusiastic reception. The poor performance of east Asian stock markets deterred investors.</p>

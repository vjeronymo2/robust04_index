			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following review of the 29 April  issue of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in  nature.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. Israel's Rabin Seeks Russian Accord Against Islamic  Movements    2. Asyut Residents Criticize Police Handling of Islamic  Groups    3. Sudanese Vice President, Others Address Islamic  Conference    4. Party Official Attacks Regime, Notes `Islamic Solution'    5. Doctors' Union Holds Conference in Support of Bosnian  Muslims  <H5>  ISRAEL'S RABIN SEEKS RUSSIAN ACCORD AGAINST ISLAMIC MOVEMENTS </H5>   In an approximately 140-word front-page report by Mahmud  Bakri under the heading "U.S.-Russian-Israeli Agreement To  Confront the Islamists," AL-SHA'B claims to have learned that  Israeli Prime Minister Rabin's talks in Russia dealt with an  agreement to confront the "growing" Islamic movements in the  region. Information indicates, Bakri adds, that there is an  intention to sign a strategic agreement between Israeli and  Russian intelligence services in this regard, the first such  accord between the two countries. Bakri states: "The  information confirms that the Israeli proposals in this respect  include one about finding a formula for tripartite cooperation  involving Russia, Israel, and the United States within an  integrated plan called "Handling Security in the Middle East."    The plan stipulates a tripartite cooperation based on  halting  all forms of agreement and military engagement between Russia  and the Arab countries for fear that some Islamic trends may  gain control over the sources of some of these weapons.    Bakri notes that the plan also provides for penetrating the  security of some religious institutions and calls for interest  in the role of research and information. The author concludes  by saying that the tripartite plan's details are not yet clear  but the U.S. side approved it earlier.  <H5>  ASYUT RESIDENTS CRITICIZE POLICE HANDLING OF ISLAMIC GROUPS </H5>   A 180-word front-page report by Jahal Imbabi says that Asyut  residents have denounced police excesses against the population,  the violation of human rights, mass punishment, random shooting,  and the wounding of innocent people. In interviews with  AL-SHA'B, the report adds, people from various part of Asyut  affirm that the police have handled the Islamic Group's  "excesses" with their own "excess" against the population, which  paid for "both sides' mistakes."    Imbabi claims the residents also criticized the state media  policy and pointed out that undermining the legitimate parties,  violating the trade unions, weakening al-Azhar's role, and  rigging elections have found the youths lose hope in change  through the ballot box.  <H5>  SUDANESE VICE PRESIDENT, OTHERS ADDRESS ISLAMIC CONFERENCE </H5>   In an approximately 1,000-word report on pages 1 and 7 by  Qutb al-Arabi from Khartoum on the opening of the 14th session  of the Islamic Propagation Organization [IPO], the paper says  the Sudanese vice president, Major General al-Zubayr Muhammad  Salih, the chairman of the IPO Board of Trustees, Marshal  'Abd-al-Rahman Siwar-al-Dhahab, and Qatari Shari'ah College Dean  Yusuf al-Qardawi addressed the delegates.    In his speech, the Sudanese vice president defended the  Sudanese Government and Islam, saying: "The Sudanese Government  has devoted itself to God in defense of Islam and the oppressed  everywhere. The threats of the United States and the West do  not frighten us because God is with us. We will not submit to  the enemies of Islam and there will be no concessions on any of  God's commandments unless it is over our dead bodies."    He gave his "assurance" to the Islamic nation that the  Islamic regime in Sudan is "firm and able to confront the  Islamic nation's enemies." He said: "We are a peaceful nation,  do not wish to fight anyone, and have nothing to do with  terrorism. But we have truly revived the spirit of jihad in the  Sudanese people so that they can be vigilant and can defend  themselves against any potential aggression."    In his address, the IPO official denounced the "world order  that is hostile to Muslims." He noted that UN Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali halted a NATO decision to attack the Serbs in  Gorazde because a British soldier had to be moved from there.  Thus the UN secretary general was "concerned about one British  soldier, yet did not care about 70,000 Muslim men and women  besieged in Gorazde."    Defending the Sudanese Government and its Islamic policy,  the  Qatari Shari'ah College dean addressed the conference, saying  Sudan will not bow and will only kneel before God. He added  that Sudan will offer a great deal to the shari'ah so that it  can live a "sound Islamic life." The author notes that the  mufti of Albania was among those who addressed the inaugural  session.   <H5>    PARTY OFFICIAL ATTACKS REGIME, NOTES `ISLAMIC SOLUTION' </H5>   Labor Party Secretary General 'Adil Husayn writes an  approximately 3,000-word article on page five strongly  criticizing the prime minister and other government officials  for "corruption and mismanagement."    In his article, Husayn cites the government's "failed"  policies in various economic, industrial, agricultural, and  other spheres and accuses the prime minister of covering up  fraud and corruption. He claims that the government acts on  orders from world financial institutions and disregards people's  interests. He says: "We" reject the U.S. "instructions" on  Egypt's economy and adds that the IMF and World Bank promote  their instructions on the grounds that these instructions  represent the "Anglo-American school's" successful experiment in  market economy. He remarks that what is good for the United  States is not necessarily good for other countries. He says  that the "Anglo-American school's principles of materialism and  consumer inclination," which do not strike a balance between  capital owners and the nation's interests, are not compatible  with the "Islamic solution" in economics.    From the mere economic point of view, he says, a worker  offers more effort as his loyalty to his establishment increases  and as his sense of security and stability strengthens. He then  claims that the "Anglo-American School" says the opposite and  that "Asian experiments" led by Japan have proved that what "we"  advocate on the basis of "Islam and tradition" is right.    Toward the end of his article, the author suggests:  "Prolonging this situation is impossible. If national dialogue  will not serve as a means to change this situation then it will  be no more than a waste of time. At the very least the nation  requires a guarantee for its humanity, demands rulers with  resolve and a clean hand, and demands safety for its physical  wellbeing, honor, and property." He adds: "At most, we should  move toward a comprehensive change that will restore Islam to  its dominant standing while all the religious Egyptians turn  toward building a new civilization and a strong state that  integrates and unites with its Arab brothers."    He claims: "We" do not agree with the advocates of violence,  their methods or their vision of an Islamic solution, and asks:  What is the use of rejection if there is no better alternative  way?    The author concludes by contending: "The nation wants  change; it wants it peacefully. But if you do not meet its  wish, an explosion is inevitable."  <H5>  DOCTORS' UNION HOLDS CONFERENCE IN SUPPORT OF BOSNIAN MUSLIMS </H5>   In an approximately 420-word report on page 7, AL-SHA'B's  Khalid Yunus says various men addressed a "mass popular  conference" organized by the Doctors' Association in support of  Bosnian Muslims.    In his address, Dr. 'Abd-al-Hayy al-Faramawi, professor of  Koranic interpretation at al-Azhar University, attributed the  "tragedy" of the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina to the Muslim  rulers' weakness and languor, which have led to the loss of  Palestine, Eritrea, Somalia, Burma, Kashmir, and finally  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Al-Faramawi is quoted as saying that  resolving the Islamic nations' causes can be achieved by rulers  who are conscious of such causes and want to see the  "inviolability of Islamic blood" and respect for the ulema and  the nation's belief in the "sanctity of all forms of jihad."    Addressing the conferees, Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali said:  "History repeats itself. As Jerusalem fell amid the silence of  the Islamic world, Bosnia falls today while no member country of  the Islamic Conference Organization moves." He is cited as  adding that the European countries and the United States do not  know the "language of conscience" but know only their interests.  He is also quoted calling for applying the Koran so that the  nation can emerge from its predicament.    Dr. Ahmad al-Malat, deputy general guide of the Muslim  Brotherhood, also addressed the conference, stressing the  importance of every Muslim performing his duty toward "his  brothers" in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He said: "The Islamic  nation--both the rulers and the governed--has not played its  role toward this unarmed people, although they belong to Islam,  with which they conquered various parts of the world."</p>

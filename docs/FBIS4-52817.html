			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 12 (YONHAP) -- The United States and  North Korea held working-level talks in New York Thursday but a  few issues were left dangling that make future prospects  uncertain, sources here said after the contact.    Gary Samore, director of nonproliferation at the State  Department, and Kenneth Quinones, from the North Korea section  at the Department, attended the one-hour mid-level contact with  Han Song-yol, counselor for political affairs at the North  Korean Mission to the United Nations, officials said.    North Korea refused to say whether it has started changing  the fuel rods at its 5-megawatt reactor or whether it will  postpone the process, according to the officials.    It instead urged the Americans to open the next round of  North Korea-U.S. high-level dialogue so that this issue can be  negotiated, they said.    Postponement of the refueling is a condition for  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection of North  Korean nuclear facilities. The agency told Pyongyang earlier  this week it would send an inspection team "on the assumption"  that North Korea was deferring the changing of the rods.    Officials here said the uncertainty over the nuclear reactor  and the rods is making the IAEA uneasy about sending the  inspection team.    They said it remains unclear whether the agency will go  ahead  and send the team to Pyongyang this weekend or wait for an  official reply from North Korea before deciding on the dispatch.    "It's more correct to say that the situation right now has a  lot of unclear issues than to say that it is uncertain," said  one official.    Although speculation has it that the North Korea-U.S.  high-level dialogue will take place late this month, there is a  chance the meeting may be put off until June.</p>

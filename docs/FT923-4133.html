			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / IMF warning on burdens carried by Polish economy A VISITING IMF team has warned that Poland's economic recovery is still threatened by deteriorating public finances, the effects of this year's severe drought and the low profitability and high debt of most state-owned enterprises. However, the team said it was encouraged by a sharp growth of industrial production, lower inflation and rising exports and yesterday praised the Polish government for putting together an 'impressive' package of economic stabilisation measures. The package should lay the foundation for sustained growth and restore financial equilibrium, said the IMF team which was completing a week of talks. The assessment clears the way for formal negotiations next month on a new letter of intent. The aim of the Polish government is to finalise a new 15- to 18-month IMF loan agreement before the end of the year followed by a resumption of debt reduction talks with commercial bank creditors represented by the London Club. Mr Michael Deppler, deputy director of the IMF's European Department who led the mission, said the public finance adjustment problem reflected three years of rising expenditure on pensions and other social programmes and declining revenues. Social spending rose from 11 to 21 per cent of GNP between 1989 and 1992 while state revenues fell from 36 per cent of GNP in 1989 to 26 per cent of a lower GNP this year. 'The solution is to raise revenue and cut spending and that is what the government plans to do,' he added. The finance ministry plans to raise turnover taxes prior to the introduction of a value added tax next year, impose a 10 per cent surcharge on 75 per cent of Polish imports and allow inflation to erode the real value of tax allowances and pensions. The government also plans to improve the management of state enterprises, speed up mass privatisation and restructure the finances of both banks and enterprises.</p>

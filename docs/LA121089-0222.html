			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFING / EVENTS IN THE NEWS THIS WEEK.  </P> <P> A 10-square mile area of La Habra, Brea and Fullerton will be sprayed again on  Tuesday night with malathion as state agricultural officials plot strategy  against the Mediterranean fruit fly infestation. A new infestation area around  La Habra Heights will also be sprayed that night. County agricultural officials  reported Thursday that trappers had discovered a fertile Medfly in Westminster.  The latest finding could result in a drastic expansion of the insect's path of  infestation. The insect was found 10 miles farther south than the only previous  detection in Orange County.  </P> <P> Residents in the area to be sprayed should cover their cars because the  insecticide can cause blemishes or discoloration.  </P> <P> The Medfly, which can infest more than 250 kinds of fruit and vegetables, has  been under attack in Los Angeles County since summer. Despite the malathion  spraying, the infestation has spread and now involves about 250 square miles.  </P></p>

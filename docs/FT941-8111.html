			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: Aberfoyle to raise ADollars 82m Aberfoyle, the Australian mining company, has passed the interim dividend and launched an ADollars 82.3m one-for-four rights issue after staying in the red in the six months to December, writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney. Higher output and improved lead and zinc prices helped the company to a 31 per cent sales boost to ADollars 55.2m (USDollars 39.4m). . Its loss for the half was reduced to ADollars 2.6m from Dollars A5.8m. Depreciation provision eased to ADollars 6.9m from ADollars 7.8m and exploration write-offs fell to ADollars 7.9m from ADollars 8.7m. New shares will be issued at ADollars 4.35 each.</p>

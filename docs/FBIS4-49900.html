			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Abdul Rahman Sulaiman] </F>   [Text] Beijing, May 11 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Countries of  Southeast Asia should have no fear of a wealthy and strong China  and they should instead welcome it, Malaysian Prime Minister Dr.  Mahathir Mohamed said Wednesday.    The prime minister said the countries would tend to benefit  in the long term of their ability to share the wealth through  trade and economic interaction with China.    He told an international business gathering of the world's  top corporate leaders here that the Chinese had now found an  answer to their political and economic needs in what they termed  the socialist market economy.    Dr. Mahathir, who flew here after a successful meeting with  U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington, dwelt at length on  Malaysia's early experience in managing its economy and the  obstacles it faced, democracy, and China's current economic  modernization efforts in his address on the theme "The Socialist  Market Economy of the People's Republic of China: An ASEAN  Perspective" at the 1994 China summit meeting.    He said although he was no expert on China, he had followed  with a great deal of interest over the last 68 years of his life  as an individual the great events occurring in and around China.  He said: I have read substantially about China's last 2,000  years. But I'm by no stretch of the imagination an expert on  China.    I cannot imagine that I know more about Chinese policy than  the Chinese leadership and its wealth of advisors.    Nevertheless, he intuitively understood what China was  attempting to do, why it was doing it, and how it was going  about the entire process of revolutionising its society and  building towards a place of pride and comprehensive prosperity  for its people in the 21st century. He believed his views were  shared by other leaders in ASEAN and East Asia.    This was because almost all countries in East Asia were  trying to do the same thing in the best way they knew how given  the complexities of their own specific situations, the enormous  obstacles, and the incredible opportunities before them.    Dr. Mahathir said China was right in sticking to its brand  of  socialist politics while espousing a version of the market  economy.    This was so because it had managed to avoid the kind of  economic and political anarchy the Soviet Union suffered. It is  right because it is apparently more successful economically. It  is growing and growing very fast, he added.    He cautioned the Western powers against being too fearful of  a prosperous China. He said although a rich China would spend  much more than what it is now spending on its military forces  and, thus, [words indistinct], historically, Beijing had not  exhibited any consistent policy of territorial acquisitiveness.    He added: Its neighbours may have lost some disputed  territory, but full invasion and colonisation has not been a  feature of Chinese history. This differs very much, of course,  from the European record. He said the question of Chinese  aggression occupied much of the Western mind because,  historically, hegemony and violent or peaceful occupation of  territories had always been the West's approach to  self-preservation and wealth. As a result, they naturally  suspected China of having similar ambitions.</p>

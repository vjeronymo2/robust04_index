			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Census '94"] </F>   [Text] Although the census entered its 3rd day, Albanian  census clerks are still not doing their part of the job in some  cities (Kumanovo, Kicevo, Debar). The census has also not yet  started in the part of Makedonski Brod, inhabited by the  Macedonian Muslims and the Turks. The situation in Tetovo is  the same despite the fact that all preparations are completed,  because of Article 30 of the Census Law. The census in Gostivar  has also not begun although the training of census clerks has.  The operation in Debar did start but the census committees  asked for a delay. In parts of the Skopje central settlement  inhabited by heterogeneous populations, census clerks refuse to  go in twos. In all remaining cities, the census operation is  carried out normally.    Meanwhile, representatives of PDP [the Party of Democratic  Prosperity] and the Albanian Liberal Alliance-Democratic Party  met with the Council of Europe's experts in parliament  yesterday. The resident of the expert team (Verner Haug) stated  there were no objective reasons to boycott the census and  parties refusing to take part in it would have to take on the  entire responsibility, regardless of their reasons. As for  demands by Albanian parties for postponement of the end  deadline, he said it might be a solution for overcoming all  current problems. He pointed out it would be better to have a  little longer-lasting census than to have no census at all.  However, he stressed this was only a suggestion on which the  Macedonian Government and parliament will have to bring a final  decision about.</p>

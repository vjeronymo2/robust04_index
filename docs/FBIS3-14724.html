			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by B. Krimi: "Innovations and Limitations of the </F> New Investment Incentive Code"]    [Text] On 21 December 1993, the Chamber of Deputies adopted  the new "investment incentive code" and its application texts.  This new law, filling a legal vacuum that prevented a restart of  investments (in marked decline in the past two years), proposes  to provide more consistency, security, and profitability to  onshore and offshore investments.    For this, the new legislation will guarantee investment  security, mobility, and profitability. Security will be achieved  by instituting three fundamental freedoms: freedom to invest,  freedom to transfer profits, and freedom to transfer capital to  complete the project. Eagerly awaited for at least two years,  the new code will harmonize in a single text the incentives  provided by the five previous codes (industry, agriculture,  services, tourism, and regulations concerning trade and  international brokerage).    From the start, the new code differs from the previous codes  by its global character, by its perfect adaptability to the  growth objectives of the eighth plan (1991-1996), and by its  goals: to rehabilitate business and provide impetus for private  investment. Roughly, the new code (which does not cover the  mining, energy, and finance sectors because of their specific  nature) aims mostly to revive direct foreign investment, to  provide impetus for local investment, and to link both kinds of  investment to exports.    The sectors concerned are: agriculture and fisheries,  manufacturing industries, civil engineering, tourism, artisanat,  transport, education, vocational training, culture-related  production and industry, youth activities, child welfare,  health, environmental protection, real estate development, and  other activities and services specified in the decree.  <H5>  The Code Contains 6 Innovations </H5>   First, the code no longer targets sectors, but businesses  irrespective of the field in which they operate. However,  special attention is given to agricultural, aquicultural, and  fishery companies, followed by export companies, decentralized  businesses, and ecology-related projects. Businesses overlooked,  or even penalized, by the code will be found in the tourism  sector. Professionals see in this a deliberate decision on the  part of the government to slow down investment in that sector.    Second, the new code draws up a new list of priority  activities eligible for tax and financial incentives provided by  the State. There are seven of them: exports, regional  development, agriculture, technology transfer, environmental  protection, incentives for young entrepreneurs to create small  to midsize businesses or start small trades, and finally  consolidation or support investment.    Third, there are two classes of incentives: common  incentives  and specific incentives. The latter will be granted exclusively  to the above-mentioned priority activities.    Fourth, tax and financial incentives provided by the State  will also extend to the sociocultural environment of the  production apparatus. Incentives will thus be granted to  entrepreneurs wishing to invest in ecology, vocational training,  education, or cultural activities.    Fifth, incentives will be granted only to achieve a dual  goal: to make businesses aware of their responsibilities and to  encourage them to stop borrowing and to modernize their  equipment.    Sixth, State subsidies and bank interest rate rebates will  be  replaced by premiums: a specific premium, and another  complementary or additional premium.  <H5>  Three Common Incentives </H5>   -- Companies and individuals who contribute to the capital  of  businesses created in the sectors covered by the code will  automatically be granted a tax exemption for 35 percent of their  net taxable revenues or profits.    -- Durable goods required for the purpose of the  investment--with the exception of passenger cars other than  those intended for Sahara or hunting tourism--will enjoy a  reduced customs duties rate of 10 percent while taxes of  equivalent effect, the value-added tax, and the consumption duty  on imports will be waived provided that equivalent durable goods  are not available in Tunisia.    -- Third tax incentive: businesses may choose to use the  diminishing values method to depreciate production equipment and  facilities with a useful life in excess of seven years. Through  this incentive, the government intends to encourage businesses  to modernize their facilities and to acquire new technologies.  According to the code, this provision is not retroactive;  therefore, it will apply only to equipment and facilities  acquired after promulgation of this code. As for specific  incentives, they will be granted to priority activities.    Agriculture is the favorite sector of the new incentive  code.  Previously granted incentives were consolidated and extended to  agricultural product processing industries, fisheries,  packaging, and to the forestry sector.... Premiums will be  granted directly to farmers as soon as their projects start.  Seventy percent of the profits and revenues invested as  contribution to the capital of an agricultural company will be  tax exempt.    Note also that investments in the agricultural sector fall  into three classes: Class A, investments made by small farmers;  Class B, investments made by midsize farmers; Class C,  investments made by large farmers. Class-A and Class-B projects  will receive two investment premiums, one specific premium and a  complementary premium, in addition to the common incentives.    The specific premium, that farmers [sic] will also receive,  will be granted solely to finance investment components:  purchase of agricultural machinery, installation of irrigation  systems leading to water savings, secondary irrigation for grain  crops, water and soil preservation work, seed propagation and  production, creation of ranges and areas for pasture and to  plant forage and forestry bushes and shrubs.    Agricultural investments made in regions with a difficult  climate, and fishery investments in areas with underdeveloped  resources may receive an additional premium. Investments made to  develop areas designed for aquicultural or geothermal projects  will receive a premium representing the State's payment for  infrastructure expenditures.    As far as exports are concerned, 70 percent of the profits  and revenues invested as capital contributions will be tax  exempt, instead of 100 percent previously. Profits generated by  exports will be 100-percent tax exempt for 10 years, and only 50  percent after that period. Another incentive: each exporting  company may recruit four foreign management-level supervisors  and sell 20 percent of its production on the local market, as  long as it pays import customs duties. As an exception,  agricultural and fishery companies will be considered as  exporting companies if they export 70 percent of their  production.  <H5>  Exports and Technology Transfers </H5>   The code also contains an important innovation: it  eliminates  the distinction between fully and partially exporting companies.  For the first time, regional development will enjoy State tax  incentives. Materially, investors who choose to operate inland  will enjoy a full 10-year tax exemption for profits generated by  investments in industry, tourism, and some services. Note that  this 100-percent tax exemption will be reduced to 50 percent at  the expiration of the first 10-year period.    Other incentives to regional investment are premiums  consisting of a State participation in the cost of projects,  studies, and development work in industrial and tourism areas.  The State will pay the employer's social security contribution  for a period of five years. Construction and real-estate  development companies will enjoy a 50-percent tax exemption if  they have to provide community facilities.    Technology transfer and technological expertise are the  other  priorities of the code. The code provides incentives for any  business taking steps to improve its supervisor ratio  (recruitment of senior technicians, etc.) and the skills of its  supervision personnel.    For the first time, environmental protection and the fight  against pollution are entitled to State subsidies/premiums. The  latter will be granted to businesses that invest in waste and  garbage processing and treatment. They involve exemption of  customs duties and taxes of equivalent effect on imported goods  that have no equivalent in Tunisia and are deemed necessary to  complete the project.    Finally, the institution of tax and financial incentives  designed to promote support or consolidation investment. The  objective is to encourage vocational training centers,  educational institutions, and construction and real-estate  development companies to invest in activities lying at the  periphery of the production apparatus (continued education,  low-rent housing, etc.).    The code provides miscellaneous incentives that may be of  "special interest" for the country's economy or for border  zones. The additional incentives that may be granted involve tax  exemption for a period of up to five years, State participation  in infrastructure expenditures, investment premiums amounting to  5 percent of the amount invested, and the waiving of duties and  taxes on facilities required to complete the investments.    As a result, the new code is both open and flexible.  Everything will hinge on direct negotiations between the  investor and local authorities. All things considered, the code  offers la carte service.  <H5>  Reactions of Economic Operators </H5>   This being said, economic operators as a whole did not react  well to the new code. They saw it as a net reduction of  investment incentives. As an indication, operators mention the  elimination of the bank interest rate rebate, which  manufacturers prefer to the State investment subsidy or premium,  and the 10-year limit on the full tax exemption of profits and  revenues and its reduction to 70 percent of profits of revenues  instead of 100 percent as previously.    We should recognize, however, that Tunisian entrepreneurs,  used to State subsidies and excited for some time at the  prospect of getting new incentives under the new code,  exaggerate a lot when they go so far as to link the restart of  investment to the institution of zero tax on capital goods and  duty-free import of passenger cars.    For the government, eliminating the (10 percent) customs  duty  is unacceptable for a very simple reason: under nondual-taxation  agreements between Tunisia and its partners, local or  nonresident entrepreneurs will be liable one way or the other to  taxes levied by one of the two partner countries. In that case,  why should Tunisia deprive itself of it?    The main objection that can be formulated against the new  code is that it does not address current mutations and  requirements. If we are to believe Mr. Ferid Tanfous, foreign  trade and transfer director at the Central Bank of Tunisia,  investors are rather more interested in the secondary sector  (stock market, etc.), hence Tunisia's interest in working  already now to deregulate investment in the secondary market. It  is not at all irrelevant to recall here that any purchase of  stocks and shares on the secondary market is still subject to  preliminary official approval.    In addition, although the new code is intended to be clear  and easy to understand, it includes very vague "formulations"  leading to conflicting interpretations. For instance, it is  punctuated with expressions such as "subject to...," "provided  that...," "businesses may...." Such expressions, which will be  defined more precisely in applications texts, indicate that  enjoying State incentives or premiums is a mere possibility; as  a result, they may discourage entrepreneurs who, in their  investment decisions, look first of all for a crystal-clear  nondiscriminatory legal system.    Another limitation or inadequacy of the new code is that the  new legislation gives too much importance to financial  incentives and overlooks other parameters that are equally  important when it comes to improving the competitiveness of  businesses, namely capital and personnel productivity, continued  education, total quality, management methods, working  conditions, etc.    To quote the head of the Tunisian employers association, Mr.  Hedi Jilani, this investment incentive code "is a piece of goods  designed for local and external consumption. It will be  evaluated and judged not by the government or even by the  deputies, but by the market for which it was written."</p>

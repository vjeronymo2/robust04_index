			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban June 16 SAPA -- The African National Congress  in KwaZulu/Natal will boycott the first sitting of the  Provincial Assembly if it is held in Ulundi, ANC Legislature  Member Mike Sutcliffe said on Thursday [16 June]. He was  responding to a recent decision by the Inkatha Freedom Party  [IFP], which holds the majority in the legislature, to hold the  sitting in Ulundi between June 28-30.    Dr Sutcliffe said the interim constitution designated  Pietermaritzburg as a provisional capital, and "under no  circumstances are we going to Ulundi". He said it was  "unconstitutional and unilateral" of the IFP to decide on Ulundi.    Earlier this week, the three ANC MECs [members of the  executive committee] boycotted an Executive Committee meeting in  Ulundi, following calls by their organisation to refrain from  acknowledging Ulundi.    Dr Sutcliffe said the capital issue, and the ANC's full  response to the IFP decision, would be discussed at an ANC  caucus meeting on Friday. He said legislators should decide on  the capital in an unemotional way, and consider what was in the  best interests of the people and the province.    Earlier the ANC warned of a constitutional crisis in the  province if the capital issue was not resolved. The ANC said  the province could not be governed effectively without  "provincial unity".</p>

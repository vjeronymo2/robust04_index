			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Drive to restrain Crimean separatists A GROUP of senior Ukrainian politicians yesterday visited the contentious Crimean peninsula, in an effort to restrain separatism and ease Ukrainian-Russian strains over the region. Crimea, transferred to Ukraine from Russia in 1954, has long been a sore point between the two republics, with each advancing claims to the Black Sea region. On Monday, Crimeans put forward a third option, complete independence, when the Republican Movement of Crimea initiated a petition to call for a referendum. The Ukrainian team, led by the deputy chairman of the parliament, Mr Volodymyr Hryniov, negotiated a conciliatory communique with Crimean leaders, proposing a meeting between Ukraine and Russia, with Crimean participation, as soon as possible. Disturbed by growing discontent in Crimea, facing fuel shortages and transport problems, the Ukrainians offered Crimea generous conditions if it agreed to remain part of the republic. The communique calls for Ukraine and Crimea to negotiate a division of political powers within the next month. Senior Ukrainian officials say they will be willing to offer Crimea everything apart from military, monetary and foreign policy. In a clause surely attractive to the Communist old guard which still controls Crimea, the Ukrainians conceded that all property on the Crimean peninsula should come under control of the Crimean government. 'Stable relations between Ukraine and Russia have no price,' Mr Hryniov told Crimean deputies. 'Even the Black Sea fleet would not be too high a price to pay.' In addition to its importance for Ukrainian-Russian relations, 'Crimea is a litmus test for development of democracy in Ukraine.' But standing in the shadow of the Lenin statue which still dominates Simferopol's central square, angry Crimeans were more concerned about daily living than democracy. Most, who narrowly supported Ukrainian independence in the December 1 referendum, were confident Ukraine had better economic prospects than Russia. But Ukraine's ineffectual economic reform has disenchanted many. The Republican Movement of Crimea hopes to collect signatures from 180,000 disappointed Crimeans. If the group succeeds by April 3, the autonomous republic will hold a referendum to determine if it should become fully independent.</p>

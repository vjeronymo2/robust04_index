			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. ROLE IN BUILDING IRAQI WAR MACHINE  </P> <P> A telling item in the Aug. 8 Times: The U.S. may agree to sell Saudi Arabia 40  F-15 fighters in a deal heretofore blocked through the efforts of lobbyists of  the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee. Isn't it interesting how our  policy toward a country suddenly changes when we need it?  </P> <P> As America hurriedly seeks to forge a world consensus on Iraq's aggression in  the Middle East, it wonders why Jordan is reluctant to join in the chorus of  condemnation, and why Saudi Arabia is reluctant to accept our forces. Of  course, now that our oil interests in the region are threatened, we need those  countries. But what have they or any of the other moderate Arab countries  gotten from us in 45 years of hurry-up-and-wait Middle Eastern policy? Nothing.  History doesn't begin with yesterday.  </P> <P> JAMES KELTY  </P> <P> Cambria  </P></p>

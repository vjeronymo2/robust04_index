			<p>Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tsuyoshi Nakai, Head of International Research </F> Exchange Division, AIST, MITI]    [Text] In order to stimulate joint international research  between Japanese corporations and foreign public research  organizations, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  (MITI) has adopted a policy to establish a new support system  for 1994. The content of the support system is described by Mr.  Tsuyoshi Nakai, head of the International Research Exchange  Division, Agency of Industrial Science and Technology (AIST),  Ministry of International Trade and Industry.    What is the specific content of the new support system?    "Preferential treatment will be applied in the taxation  system for required R&amp;D expenses when private Japanese  companies  undertake joint research with foreign government research  organizations. Specifically, a 6&percnt; tax deduction of R&amp;D  expenses, including personnel costs, is being considered. The  implementation of revisions to the tax system is targeted for  1994."    Does it matter which research organization in whatever  country is the partner for joint research?    "We are not planning to impose limitations to specific  countries. Associations with government research organizations  of the United States or research laboratories of the European  Community (EC) are both acceptable. Even foreign financed  enterprises which have research laboratories in Japan are  targets for preferential treatment."    Why has this kind of support system been deemed necessary?    "Regardless of whether a country is developed or developing,  there is a high degree of interest overseas in the technological  development strength of Japanese corporations. The desire  throughout the world is to improve their country's technological  strength by performing joint research in industrial technology  fields where Japanese corporations are strong.    "On the other hand, actions like restrictions by Japanese  corporations on the expansion of R&amp;D expenses in the recent  depressed economy are occurring. Its influence on joint research  with foreign organizations has begun to appear. While responding  to the wishes of the world, in order to advance the  technological strength of Japanese corporations through joint  development, a new support policy was deemed necessary."    Japan has been criticized by other countries for hitching a  free ride on the results of basic research.    "This support policy will be promoted while giving  sufficient  thought so as not to invite this kind of misunderstanding. For  example, when government research laboratories in the United  States and Japanese corporations embark on joint research, we  would like to finalize decisions after appropriate supporting  measures have been adjusted and decided in cooperation with the  United States government.    "Cooperation in industrial technology fields is a principal  item in the Comprehensive U.S.-Japan Economic Conference.  Concrete joint research themes will be future topics of  discussion. The new support system will prepare for the  participation of Japanese corporations in this kind of research  planning."</p>

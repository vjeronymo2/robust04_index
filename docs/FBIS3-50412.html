			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] The leading representatives of the  Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] gave a news conference in  Bratislava today. After the news conference, Zuzana Stukovska  asked KDH Chairman Jan Carnogursky for an interview.    [Begin recording] [Stukovska] Your colleagues said at a news  conference today that cooperation between the castle [the  president] and the government is not functioning. [passage  omitted]    [Carnogursky] As to President Kovac's visit to Poland, it is  obvious that the government did not cooperate with the president  as it should have. I think that Prime Minister Meciar's  statement yesterday [26 January] that he had learned about the  visit too late is not an excuse. The visit was agreed during  the Visegrad summit in Prague. Economics Minister Ducky was  present at the talks between President Kovac and President  Walesa and therefore it was his duty to inform Prime Minister  Meciar. Meciar cannot use the excuse that some of his ministers  knew something but did not tell him. He is responsible for the  whole government.    The visit must have been organized with the help of the  Slovak Embassy in Warsaw, which is under the control of the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs--part of the government. If, in  spite of this information and the preparation, the government  failed to prepare documents on the agreements that were expected  by the Polish side, this casts doubt on Prime Minister Meciar's  claim that Prime Minister Pawlak did not want any meeting  between ministers this month. The agreements ought to have been  ready, and, when the presidential office voiced the wish that  Minister Ducky should accompany the president, I think it was  the duty of the government to organize his participation.  [passage omitted]    [Stukovska] If tension accumulates, there is danger of an  explosion. What can be done? This is a question for you as a  parliamentary deputy.    [Carnogursky] This latest affair with the president's visit  to Poland is an obvious failure of the government; therefore,  the deputies of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia should  draw its' own conclusions. Sooner or later, the issue of a vote  of no confidence in the government will come to the fore.    [Stukovska] Do you think that this could happen during the  current session of parliament?    [Carnogursky] It is not likely.    [Stukovska] [passage omitted] What are the chances, in your  opinion, that the bill on large-scale privatization, which has  been discussed and criticized so much, will be passed?    [Carnogursky]] [passage omitted] The Slovak papers have been  saying for a few days that, if the government bill on  large-scale privatization is passed, this will mean that  political and economic power will be concentrated in the hands  of the government--that is to say, in the hands of one man,  Prime Minister Meciar. Commentaries in these papers, which are  not in the hands of the KDH, do not welcome the adoption of this  law. We agree with them. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (10): When directors are liable - The risk of court action is increasing Alan Bottomley says most directors and senior managers of UK companies are just not frightened enough. 'The legal aspects of caring for the environment need to be taken much more seriously,' he warns. 'The personal responsibility of directors is going to become an increasingly important area and people running companies need to become much more aware of what they may be up against.' Mr Bottomley is senior partner of Hammond Suddards, one of the 'big five' firms of corporate lawyers in Leeds. Many large law firms have set up units of specialists in environmental law during the last few years but what makes Hammond Suddards especially qualified to comment is that ICI outsourced its environmental litigation work to the firm in 1992. Lawyers hoping for more clients are no different from any other salespeople, so their claims should always be treated with caution, if not scepticism, but there appears to be evidence to support Mr Bottomley's case. The case is this: fines on companies for pollution offences are having a slow impact; but directors and senior managers carry personal legal responsibility for the actions of a company, its employees and its agents. Therefore, enforcement bodies are increasingly likely to 'go' for individuals and try to obtain large fines against them - or even prison sentences. Mr Michael Shepherd, one of Hammond Suddards' litigation team and a specialist on legal and court procedure, says that in some fields such as waste disposal, gaol sentences have already been handed down. Many companies have written environmental policies which are meant to show that directors and senior managers take their responsibilities seriously and expect the company's employees and agents to do the same. Based on precedent in other fields of law, many believe this will protect directors and senior managers if something goes wrong and a pollution offence is committed 'down the line' without their knowledge. Whether a criminal act by an employee or agent is the action of a company depends on his or her state of mind, intention, knowledge or belief, as well as the facts and circumstances. If the law requires a guilty mind as a condition of an offence, the company will be guilty if the directors and senior managers intended to commit the offence, but not if they had no such intent and the offence was committed by a junior employee who is not an officer of the company. Tesco v. Nattras in 1972 is the latest precedent of three relied upon in support of this. Here, a supermarket ran out of cut-price chickens being advertised nationally on special offer. The supermarket manager substituted chickens from stock labelled at a higher price and Tesco was prosecuted by a local trading standards officer. The case went through the appeal system, where the final decision was that Tesco was not guilty because the senior management had no intent to commit an offence and the local supermarket manager was too lowly in the organisation to make the company liable. Mr Stuart Bell, a Hammond Suddard lawyer specialising in environmental policy, says this gives many directors and senior managers a false sense of security for two reasons. The first is that many pollution offences are absolute, and therefore do not require a guilty mind for companies and individuals to be charged. Mr Bell says most environmental law specialists believe the trend will be for increasingly more pollution offences to become absolute ones. There will be no defence against them, only a plea of mitigation. The company without a well-defined environmental policy will be in trouble. The second reason he advances is of a discernible trend by legislators - in effect, the government - to make personal responsibility much more important in corporate governance. The Food Safety Act of 1990 gives a clue as to developments. It says if an offence is proved to have been committed with the consent, connivance or through neglect by a director, manager, secretary, or any other similar officer of a corporate body - or anyone purporting to act in such capacity - the person is guilty and liable to punishment. Similarly worded sections are now included in the Acts of Parliament covering health and safety at work, consumer credit, company law, financial services, trade descriptions, water resources, planning, fire precautions, crowd safety, insolvency and environmental protection. This means having a written environmental policy may not be enough. It has to be applied and supervised right up to boardroom level. Procedures also have to work at all times. For example, having an environmental officer acting as internal policeman may not be enough if there is no procedure to cover for his or her holidays. It means a site foreman cannot turn a blind eye to where an outside contractor dumps a load of waste - nor the directors of the company involved claim that it was nothing to do with them because they did not know. All parties must have taken reasonable precautions to ensure safe disposal eventually took place. Concerted attempts to stop illegal waste disposal - particularly dumping of toxic waste - are already under way. 'Cowboy' operators who have charged for long haulage to legal dumps, or for digging holes to bury waste, but have then dumped illegally and locally, or at surface level, have been successfully prosecuted recently and gaoled. Some environmental lawyers believe the directors of companies that hire such operators may be next, 'to encourage the others'. An attempt is also being made by the authorities to establish a precedent that will supersede Tesco v. Nattras as far as environmental law is concerned. The case involves pollution of a waterway via an underground culvert on a new housing estate, and whether the directors and senior managers of the company involved can be held responsible for it. National Rivers Authority v. Alfred McAlpine Homes (Southern) is now in the appeal system. If the NRA wins, environmental law at least will greatly increase the onus on corporate officers for what happens 'down the line' - however remote from head office. Is all this the scare tactics of lawyers trying to drum up more business? Mr Bell warns: 'Large numbers of companies have no policy on waste minimisation, waste reduction and waste disposal. Big companies are OK but many medium-sized and smaller ones have no idea at all. 'When you look at the figures, the number of prosecutions is very small compared with the number of breaches. But the number of prosecutions has doubled year on year since the National Rivers Authority came into being in 1989.' Penalties are also likely to be stiffer. Although they are limited to Pounds 20,000 and six-month sentences in magistrates' courts, fines are unlimited in the crown court, where gaol terms of up to two years can be imposed. In addition, companies can be made to pay for putting the pollution right - and this may cost much more than any fine. Incidentally, fines and remediation costs are not chargeable against revenue for tax purposes - they come straight out of profits. Mr Shepherd also says environmental pressure groups are likely to bring their own prosecutions, as Greenpeace inflicted on ICI last year. Greenpeace did not win, but it demonstrated a new avenue for making companies more environmentally responsible. The question for directors and senior managers is whether they can afford not to take the lawyers' warnings seriously.</p>

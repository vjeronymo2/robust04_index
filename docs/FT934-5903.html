			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Who gets paid, and when Sir, Stewart Dalby states in his article 'Agents move into the driving seat' (Management, November 24) that 'principals will no longer be able to delay paying their agents simply because they have not been paid'. While the regulations are by no means clear (on this point as on many others), the view that we have taken is that principals can delay paying their agents until after they have been paid by their customers provided they have done everything they need to do; it is only where the principal has not performed his side of the sale transaction on time that payment may be due to the agent regardless of whether the principal has been paid. With respect, this seems the more logical interpretation. The new rules are sufficiently onerous to principals without seeking to make them more so.

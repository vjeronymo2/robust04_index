			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Paola Di Caro: "The Red Intelligentsia Flunks </F> Spaventa: Enough With Eternal Lent!"]    [Text] Milan -- It is not exactly a new idea. However, the  man himself is certainly a new discovery as far as the Left is  concerned: former Budget Minister Luigi Spaventa, Silvio  Berlusconi's defeated challenger in Rome's leading constituency  in the March election. The idea, which was launched by Venice  progressive mayor -- philosopher and left-wing critic -- Massimo  Cacciari, consists of organizing a shadow cabinet, to be headed,  in fact, by Spaventa, a nonpartisan man with liberal democratic  ideas.    An old structure, therefore, and a new man to revive an  opposition which, according to Cacciari, must become an  alternative force to the government as soon as possible.    An immediate "yes" -- also on behalf of the other  progressive  mayors -- came from Catania's leading citizen Enzo Bianco:  "Spaventa suits me fine, and I also agree with the idea of an  `opposition government' acting as an interface." The  progressive intelligentsia, however, did not find the proposal  all that appealing. Luciano Canfora said: "This is an attempt  to find a shortcut, a mechanism to win. Setting up a government  led by Spaventa -- whom I very much appreciate but who  nevertheless lost the contest with Berlusconi -- means setting  up a government which would be very similar to the right-wing  government, albeit without all those nasty mugs around. What is  the point of building such a Left?"    The same question was being asked by Pietro Barcellona,  chairman of the Center for Research on the State: "Spaventa  does not convince me in the least. I appreciate him, but I do  not think we can convince the left-wing grassroots to keep Lent  eternally." The example given was clear enough: "During the  election campaign, the Left asked for continuous sacrifices,  whereas Berlusconi was offering lottery tickets to his voters."  In any case, "the first step is social opposition at grassroots  level." Political expert and former Socialist European deputy  Gianni Baget Bozzo agreed with this view: "For a shadow cabinet  to work, real unity would be needed among the Left with a view  to forming the government, but no such unity exists with  Communist Renewal and Rete. Particularly if led by Spaventa --  who represents continuity with [Former Prime Minister] Ciampi --  a shadow cabinet would confirm the split within the Left by  forcing it to confront the real issues faced by a government."  This is why "the Left should remain an opposition force, in  order to stay united."    "A shadow cabinet makes sense if it includes the whole  opposition, otherwise it is weak," constitutional expert and  former PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] deputy Augusto Barbera  asserted. "It only makes sense if it includes the democratic  Catholics. This is why we must wait for the PPI [Italian  Popular Party] congress in July, in order to understand whether  they want to conduct opposition based on party agreements, that  is to say, with the aim of replacing the MSI [Italian Social  Movement] in the government, or an alternative-type of  opposition, joining forces with the Left." However, a shadow  cabinet with the PPI would mean losing "two of the First  Republic's myths, namely the Left's unity, and the Catholics'  political unity," because Communist Renewal would be lost on the  way, and the PPI would certainly split. Who could lead the  shadow cabinet? "Spaventa might do," Barbera said, "but then,  in such a context, so could Prodi [chairman of the Institute for  Industrial Reconstruction]."    "Prodi? An interesting name, as indeed is Spaventa's,"  Social Christian leader Ermanno Gorrieri said. However, he  appeared to entertain some doubts: "I am not entirely convinced  by the idea of a shadow cabinet. In short, the search for unity  must be based on a common ethos, and this requires time.  Besides, will Communist Renewal be included or not?" He also  had doubts about making overtures to the PPI: "It must be done,  but I wonder whether a shadow cabinet would be the ideal means  of doing so. Putting pressure on the PPI by calling for a  united front may have the effect of pushing the PPI further away  from us."    A flat "no" came from former PCI [Italian Communist Party]  exponent Napoleone Colajanni: "The Left's crisis cannot be  solved by means of shadow cabinets, even more so considering  that, according to Cacciari, such a government would have to be  led by Spaventa because the latter challenged Berlusconi. Well,  seeing the result of the contest, it seems a rather ill-omened  choice to me."</p>

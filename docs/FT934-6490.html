			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Poland gives priority to public offers Poland's new centre left government will be giving 'top priority' to public share offerings to boost the development of the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE), writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. Mr Marek Borowski, deputy premier in charge of the economy, told a conference on 'How to become a publicly quoted company' that the 22 companies quoted on the WSE had better results than state-owned or private companies. The high turn-out at the conference reflects growing domestic interest in share offers as a way of raising capital in the wake of a continuing 10-month boom on the WSE. This has lifted share prices eight-fold, capitalising the market at around Dollars 1.8bn. WSE regulators estimate that one-third of the trading is done by foreigners, who own 20 per cent of the shares. The WIG indicator rose 5.2 per cent yesterday to 8,680.</p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Letter: No wastage in commercially minded construction quango Sir, I read with interest your article, 'Resurgence of quangos defies Thatcherite initiative' (January 14). The Construction Industry Training Board (CITB) does not receive direct funds from the government but collects a statutory levy from the construction industry and contracts with Training and Enterprise Councils and Local Enterprise Companies for further funding of training schemes. The CITB is controlled and run for the benefit of the industry by senior executives of the construction industry, two trade unionists and two representatives of further and higher education. The inference in the term quango is of a flaccid organisation with no commercial controls, which wastes government and public money. This certainly does not apply to the CITB, which is run on commercial lines, with up-to-date management controls. There are direct links with the industry, through the Federations' Advisory Committee and our network of 13 regional advisory committees which includes one for Scotland and one for Wales. We have an independent audit committee conforming with the Cadbury Report and which reports direct to the main board of the CITB. On the question of accountability, an annual consensus is sought by government from the industry before parliament is asked to renew our statutory powers in the Annual Levy Order. The essential factor that motivates the CITB is the need to give 'value for money'. Finally, in the difficult climate that the construction industry operates under at this moment, it is agreed in the industry that without the CITB very little training would take place and many thousands of young people would be on the dole rather than pursuing training towards a craft qualification. If we are a quango, we certainly do not warrant the implied criticism of your article. Clifford Chetwood, chairman, CITB, 24-30 West Smithfield, London EC1A 9JA</p>

			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / North-west sees patchy recovery The largest companies in north-west England are struggling out of recession, but with a performance that is far from uniformly good, according to an analysis of local companies. The analysis, aggregating the results of the 127 quoted companies reporting to the London Stock Exchange and those of private ones filed with Companies House, shows lacklustre results from the region's two conurbations - Greater Manchester and Merseyside - but strong contributions from Lancashire, the Potteries and Cumbria. The research, by accountancy firm KPMG and Insider, a regional business magazine, has been published as North West England plc in the style of an annual report. Mr Alan Benzie, head of KPMG corporate finance in the north-west, says in the report that the financial sector was the strongest in the last year, with leisure and media industries also doing well. There were 'creditable performances' in electricals, retailing and textiles. However the food sector was flat while chemicals, industrials, property and construction all struggled. Aggregate turnover rose 5.5 per cent but operating profits were only 1.5 per cent up. Cheaper money saw interest paid fall 8.7 per cent. Recovery was confirmed by improved investment in fixed assets, a 10 per cent increase in depreciation provision, and an increase in stocks of 4.3 per cent, reversing the de-stocking trend of the recession. Jobs continued to be shed with a 1.9 per cent fall in numbers employed. Total pay rose 4.7 per cent, well ahead of an inflation rate of about 3 per cent. 'Fragility and patchiness' is one of the principal messages of North West plc. Mr Benzie says flickering trading conditions are improving slowly but there is some way to go before there is a 'sustainable glow'  - and national and international factors, not the north-west's own efforts, will be decisive. Trafford Park, the Greater Manchester industrial estate, appears to have reversed the decades of decline that prompted the government to put it under an urban development corporation in 1987. A census of companies in the park shows a net increase of 126 since 1991, bringing the total to 1,314. New businesses accounted for 360. The rest were relocations. North West England plc.

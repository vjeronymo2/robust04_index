			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tehran, Jan 27 (AFP)--The presence of two million  Afghan refugees in Iran has drained the country's resources and  poses a threat to its national security, an Iranian newspaper  warned on Thursday.    Responding to an appeal from the UN High Commissioner for  Refugees Sadako Ogata for a halt to the repatriation of refugees  from Iran and Pakistan, the English-language TEHRAN TIMES said  the Islamic republic was no longer able or "obliged" to host  them.    "The nature of the Afghan refugee problem has changed since  the liberation of the country from the former Soviet Union," it  said. "The world should not expect us to treat the refugees with  the same urgency when they are victims of factional infighting  in their country."    The paper warned Iran's national security was "threatened"  and that the country could no longer afford spending its  resources on the large number of refugees there.    "Our security forces are engaged daily in clashes with  Afghan  drug smugglers disguised as refugees," it said. "What would  Western countries do under the same circumstances?"    The Afghan capital Kabul has been hit by a new surge in  fighting since January 1, which has left some 10,000 people dead  or wounded and forced thousands to flee the country.    Troops loyal to President Borhanoddin Rabbani have been  pitted in a fierce battle against combined forces of  Uzbek-Pashtun warlord Abdol Rashid Dostam and Prime Minister  Golboddin Hekmatyar.    Ogata warned on Tuesday that the civil war raging in  Afghanistan could trigger a new influx of refugees into Iran and  Pakistan and called for a halt in the repatriation process.    Her message was contained in a letter read out to ministers  at a meeting of the 10-member Economic Cooperation Organisation  (ECO) in Tehran.    Ogata said she did not expect the international community to  fund the repatriation process as long as fighting threatened the  lives of the returnees.    She warned of the "tendency of many governments to close  their borders when faced with the threat of refugee influxes,"  and called for borders to remain open for "people who require  international protection."    With UNHCR help Iran and Pakistan have stepped up efforts to  repatriate Afghan refugees who fled the 14-year civil war in  Afghanistan. Iran says the refugees have been encouraged but  not forced to return.</p>

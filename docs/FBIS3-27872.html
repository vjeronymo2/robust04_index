			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 1 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa on Tuesday [1 February] called on a government panel to  make all- out efforts to create a new vision for restructuring  Japan's agriculture.    The Agricultural Administration Council, an advisory panel  to  the prime minister and farm minister, is expected to discuss  ways to help Japanese farmers, particularly those growing rice,  to survive in the face of growing international competition.    In December last year, Japan agreed to gradually open its  heavily protected rice market as part of a deal struck in the  Uruguay Round of global trade talks.    The panel is expected to examine the various aspects of the  nation's agriculture, from the nature of farm areas to product  prices and distribution systems. It is scheduled to issue a  mid- term report by the end of July.    Hosokawa attended the first day of the panel meeting  Tuesday,  along with Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Eijiro  Hata.    Hosokawa stressed that the government is set to take all  possible measures to help Japanese farmers.    Hata pledged that his ministry will ensure stable  production,  particularly of rice, on the basis of the panel's  recommendations, and will maintain balanced demand and supply as  well as prices.    Members of the panel said they should examine the Foodstuff  Control Law, other related laws, and ways to revitalize farm  areas.</p>

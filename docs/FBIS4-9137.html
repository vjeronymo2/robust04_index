			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Ion Cristoiu: "A Dangerous Precedent for the </F> Social Democracy Party of Romania"]    [Text] One cannot say that the new ministers who emerged  after the latest governmental reshuffle have started on a left  foot. At least this applies to their relations with the press.  At the Ministry of National Defense, Minister Gheorghe Tinca,  for instance, boosted up the press bureau, which is now holding  news conferences on a weekly basis. If we also consider the  fact that they appointed a young lady whose looks are crushing  the male journalists as the ministry's spokesperson, we can see  that we are dealing here with an attempt by the diplomat  Gheorghe Tinca to seduce the press by all means. Even if the  charm cast by the lady officer (with the grade of major) can  seriously affect the professionalism of the journalists, the  shrewdness of the new minister of defense is to be preferred  over the obvious hooliganism of other dignitaries vis-a-vis the  press. The decision to do everything possible in order to have  excellent relations with the press can also be noticed in the  case of the other two dignitaries appointed in the wake of the  recent governmental reshuffle. At his latest meeting with the  press, Doru Ioan Taracila, the minister of interior, satisfied  the journalists' taste for the sensational. Minister of Justice  Iosif Gavril Chiuzbaian tried hard, along political and  journalistic lines, to convince the journalists that they have a  friend in him. But there is another interesting thing about the  three newly appointed ministers. Immediately after their  appointment, each one of them became the target of some press  attacks. At least the Ministry of National Defense came under  all sorts of attacks. In spite of all that, none of the new  ministers resorted to violent replies or, even worse, to banning  the access of adverse journalists to the departments they are  heading. Are we dealing here with people who are more  intelligent that their government colleagues? Are these people  more aware of the fact that the press is a power in today's  Romania? Regardless of the answer, one can only welcome their  attitude toward journalists, since it proves that they are aware  of journalists' vanity and also concerned with their public  image. Of course, the three are but at the start of their road.  It is not excluded that, following the example of other  dignitaries, they might lose their smiling kindness toward the  press after it continues to criticize them rightly or wrongly.  Anyhow, until there is proof to the contrary, we do not err in  stating that the new dignitaries seem determined to turn the  press into their ally. During his broad campaign of trying to  win over the journalists to his side, Iosif Gavril Chiuzbaian  held a long news conference yesterday, where he announced, among  other things, that he plans to propose Judge Corneliu Turianu  for a leading position in the justice department. The new  minister seems determined to repair all the mistakes made by his  predecessor, Petre Ninosu, prominent leader of the Social  Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR]. Yesterday's announcement is  a serious blow to one of Ion Iliescu's most humble servants.  First came his unexpected dismissal. Then came his failure at  the vote in the Senate [for the position as Senate vice  president]. Now, the new minister is canceling a decision taken  by Petre Ninosu. We are thus witnessing a happy moment of  justice being done to a wronged man. Corneliu Turianu was  illegally removed from the presidency of the Bucharest Military  Court by the former justice minister. A certain part of the  press jumped, so to say, to Corneliu Turianu's defense. Petre  Ninosu's political friends violently reacted to this rightful  stand taken by the independent journalists. Now, life is giving  credit to those who condemned Petre Ninosu's decision. Another  act of destiny seems to be the downfall of Iosif Gavril  Chiuzbaian's predecessor. In real life, all sins must be paid  for. Petre Ninosu is also paying for the injustice he has done.  Nevertheless, aside from all this, the PDSR is faced with a  most pressing problem, which belongs more to the realm of  metaphysics than politics. In spite of everything, Petre Ninosu  is one of their people. I realize that they could do nothing to  keep him in the post of minister of justice. I realize that  they could not promote him to the position of vice president of  the Senate. However, what I cannot understand is why they do  not jump now to defend the decision taken by Petre Ninosu with  regard to Corneliu Turianu's case. This because the statement  of the new minister of justice is extremely ominous for the  PDSR. It demonstrates to all present ministers that a time may  come, after their departure from their posts, that their  decisions can be canceled. Not by opposition ministers, but  even by other PDSR ministers. This might make quite a few of  these dignitaries think twice before they place their party's  interests before the interests of the country.</p>

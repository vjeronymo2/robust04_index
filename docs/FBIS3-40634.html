			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The inevitable has happened. And as President  Clinton succinctly remarked: America has succeeded in opening up  the world market for its products. At least, the American  President is being honest.    True, as GATT Chief Peter Sutherland said, "I am convinced  that today will be seen as a defining moment in modern economic  and political history which would mean more trade, more  investment, more jobs and larger income growth for all."  Economists believe all this trade liberalisation holds out the  promise of expanding global output by $6 trillion over the next  decade, $1 trillion of that in the United States.    It certainly is a defining moment in modern economic and  political history. It is not difficult to see why. In developing  countries, food security has become a central element of food  and agricultural policy. But in none of these 132 countries  agriculture is a commercial activity. Traditional agriculture,  in which small and medium-sized farms still predominate would be  washed away as if by a catastrophic flood. Consequently, large  populations would be uprooted and swept into urban slums.  Nowhere will this be more clearly evident than in an over  populous country like India.    Despite the advances made in food production, it is  estimated  that over 200 million people living in poverty in India now  suffer from chronic hunger. Whether an increase in export  products would improve the pathetic living standards of poorer  sections of the population is a question that has been  conveniently avoided. The Commerce Ministry has taken pains to  explain that India's trade is expected to go up by nearly $2  million per annum due to the general expansion of the world  trade. Some of the gains will certainly "trickle down" to the  poor.    While the "trickle down" theory no longer holds any  credibility, what has not been explained, and for obvious  reasons, is what will happen to the remarkable famine-avoidance  strategy that has been developed over the years. In the event of  cheap food being dumped into India, the very first casualty will  be the food security system. The GATT agenda, which when  embodied into an international agreement, will subvert India's  laws that protect national interests and promotes self-reliance.    A little known fact is that the Draft Final Text of the GATT  contains a proposal to establish a new international  institution--the Multilateral Trade Organisation--which will  have powers to require national parliaments to alter legislation  that is `GATT inconsistent'. Future laws must also pass this  litmus test, thus requiring parliaments to seek approval of GATT  headquarters before initiating legislations. And it is here that  the people of India can exercise their franchise. They have done  so in the past and will certainly not fail the nation again.    Ever since the Paddock brothers predicted in the '60s that  at  least half of India would be led to a slaughter house by the  end of the '70s, India has successfully managed to prove the  "prophets of doom" wrong. Take a look at history and you find  that it was replete with drought, famine and hunger. Between  1770 and 1880, as many as 27 famines and food scarcities were  recorded. More than 20 million people had perished from hunger  and malnutrition--in the 20 famines that struck India between  1850 and 1943.    It is not as if the weather gods have been particularly  benevolent after the colonial masters left the country's shores.  Perhaps the widespread drought that struck the northern and  central parts of the country in mid-80s was the severest in the  20th century. And yet the country was able to tide over the  crisis without seeking any foreign aid. For a nation, which only  a few years ago was written off by Paddock brothers, this was no  mean achievement.    Didn't Peter Sutherland say that the consensus on Uruguay  Round is a defining moment in modern economic and political  history.  <H5>  Battleground </H5>   Trade in food has been a battleground for competing  interests. It never distinguished between protection of  corporate and northern interests and protection of long-term  interests. This is nothing new. Nor are the powerful nations of  the North likely to desist from the pursuit of their interests.  Governments of the developing countries have rarely risen to  thwart the covert designs of the rich nations. They have failed  us in the past and have betrayed us once again.    Only popular pressure has a hope of putting world trade  discussions onto a different track, where global sustainability  takes priority. GATT poses vital challenges to all who are  dedicated to improving food quality and security, to defining  the environment and to promoting public health and fair trade.    The additional 40 million hungry in India an aftermath of  GATT trade liberalisation, is not merely a statistical data. It  involves people who have no other means of existence. Unlike in  the West, the poor in India will not be paid for keeping their  marginal lands fallow. In the United Kingdom, for instance, some  farmers are getting as much as pound 100,000 a year for not  cultivating their lands. Over pound one billion is being paid to  farmers in the European Community for what is popularly called  as "Set-Aside." As if this is not enough exports estimate that  the amount of "Set-Aside" in the UK could almost double under  the GATT agreement.    The hope for survival rests with the people.</p>

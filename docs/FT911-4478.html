			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Management: The hapless and the paradox - The unhappy lot of non-executive directors Wanted: a large army of experienced, independent-minded, part-time businesspeople to infiltrate boardrooms across the UK. Ability to restrain unbridled chief executives an advantage. This, or something close to it, was the message yesterday from the UK's institutional investors, which between them own two thirds of all UK listed shares. Acting through their recently-reconstituted umbrella body, the Institutional Shareholders' Committee, the institutions were adding their voices - the most important yet - to the debate on corporate governance. This has developed as a curious side issue to the debate on relations between companies and their shareholders. Its origins can be traced to two causes: the seemingly endless arguments about short-termism (whether or not the providers of capital are unwilling to take a sufficiently long-term view of their investments); and a lingering feeling that some of the excesses of recent years should not be repeated. What makes the debate on corporate governance odd is that the institutions appear to want it both ways. They want to regularise the way some companies are run, particularly by reining in some of the more powerful chairmen/chief executives. But in the process they do not want to lose any of the shareholder gains that can be generated by strong, entrepreneurial leadership. There is a noticeable sound of barn-door slamming in all of this. Periods of corporate or financial excess are generally followed by reregulation. Come the next boom period, these lessons are quickly forgotten. If the institutions can't have it both ways, then it is a fair bet that, come the next bull market, they will forget many of the lessons they are now preaching in the scramble not to be left out. In the meantime, it is to non-executive directors that the institutions have turned. These hapless people are expected to labour under the institutions' own unresolved paradox; they must at once bear equal responsibility with other directors for a company's performance, but they must also act as an internal check on the power of executive directors. The ISC's paper, The role and duties of directors: a statement of best practice, contains ample evidence of this paradox. Non-executives, it says, should be independent. This is defined as 'free from bias, involvement or partiality'. Yet the paper also comes down firmly on the side of unitary boards, rather than the two-tier structures seen in countries like Germany. It says: 'All directors have an equal responsibility in helping to provide their company with effective guidance and leadership and it is recognised that they must, and in almost all cases do, act at all times entirely in the best interests of the company.' Is it really possible for a non-executive to bear all the responsibility that this suggests and yet remain 'free from bias, involvement or partiality'? Leading members of the ISC admitted yesterday that this was expecting a lot. 'An increasing amount is being expected of non-executive directors,' said Michael Sandland, chairman of the ISC and chief investment manager of Norwich Union. He said that the pool of available talent was probably not big enough to provide suitable high quality directors for all UK companies, and suggested two ways of easing this shortage: companies should make more of their senior executives available to act as non-executives elsewhere, and companies should pay non-executives more for their efforts. 'The traditional Pounds 5,000, Pounds 10,000 or Pounds 15,000 is not enough, given what is expected these days,' Sandland said. Who, though, will decide how much to pay the non-executives? This is yet another paradox at the heart of the ISC position. Non-executives, who are expected by the ISC to set the pay levels of executive directors, will themselves be paid by the executives. Any guesses on the effect that has on the level of executive pay?</p>

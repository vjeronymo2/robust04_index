This  has been a topic of discussion among the British people  recently. Although the Britain of today cannot be compared with  that of the past, the Major government is still doing its utmost  to continue pursuing "three-circle diplomacy," that is,  conducting activities within the three links of developing the  Western European Union, maintaining the special relationship  between Britain and the United States, and preserving the  British Commonwealth, as proposed by Winston Churchill and first  put into practice by Foreign Secretary Earnest Belvin. If we  say that Churchill's pursuit of "three-circle diplomacy" was  effected through a series of measures, we can also see that the  times and situations have changed, and the Major government  seems unable to pursue "three-circle diplomacy" as it wishes and  finds it difficult to go any further.    In developing its relationship with Europe, Britain seems to  be hesitating and marking time. Although Prime Minister Major  repeatedly claimed to place Britain in the "heart of Europe," it  has always been regarded by the European Union as a half-hearted  member. Since the end of World War II, Britain has taken a  position toward European union which is different from most  countries on the European Continent. With regard to the goals  and orientation of building Europe, the mainstream faction of  most governments of the EC members -- including France, Germany,  and so on -- represented by Jean Monnet and Delors, has taken  the building of an integrated European economic and political  entity or a supranational European union as a basic goal, since  the early years of European unification movement until the  subsequent effort to build an integrated European community.  Britain did not favor this proposition, however, and still has  reservations on the goal of developing the EC into a union as  proposed by the Maastricht Treaty. With regard to the presence  of the United States in Europe, it maintains that the United  States should remain in Europe to balance the strength there,  but France and Germany hold that "Europe belongs to the  Europeans." The United States supported the suggestion that  Germany be admitted as an additional permanent member of the UN  Security Council early last year, but Britain and France have  reservations on this issue. With regard to the war flames that  are spreading in the former Yugoslav regions, Britain, France,  and Germany all have considerations of their own.    The "special relationship between Britain and the United  States," which has been maintained for many years, is not so  "special" now. Before the gunsmoke of World War II had lifted,  former British Prime Minister Churchill proposed establishing a  "special British-U.S. relationship" in his speech in Fulton in  the United States, hoping to use the United States to prop up  its appearance of "might." During the Cold War period, the  actions of the Western alliance were generally determined by  unanimous agreement between the two countries. However, the two  special allies have harbored ill feelings toward one another for  some time recently. Prior to Christmas in 1992, President-elect  Clinton made an excuse to avoid meeting the British prime  minister who was visiting the United States at that time, which  cast a dark shadow over British-U.S. relations. In February of  the next year when Major once again visited the United States,  he failed to repair the "special relationship," and differences  between the two sides became even more prominent--they stuck to  their own arguments on the issue of trade talks between Europe  and the United States, had acute differences in their views on  airdropping materials in Bosnia- Herzegovina, and engaged in a  battle of words on the issue of Northern Ireland. The United  States denounced British actions in Northern Ireland as  "violations of human rights," and Britain criticized the U.S.  intention to send a peace corps to inspect North Ireland as  "interference in its internal affairs." It appears that  people's views on the "special relationship" have changed under  the situation of increasing friction and conflicts between the  two sides economically and politically, although both consider  it necessary to maintain such a "special relationship."    Britain has made a comprehensive effort to maintain the  increasingly weak British Commonwealth. With each member of the  Commonwealth currently going its own way, however, the decisions  made by the conference are not binding on the member countries.  When the conference of the British Commonwealth was held in  Cyprus last year, the newspapers in the host country stated that  the "themes of the conference are irrelevant and pointless," and  that the British Commonwealth was "no longer a major force in  international politics." In Australia, an irresistible wave of  republican sentiment is surging forward, and Australian Prime  Minister Keating has repeatedly proposed that Australia should  appear in the international arena as an "image of independence,"  should become a republic before the year 2000, and should change  its national flag, which is similar in design to the British  ensign, in due time.    There are profound root causes for the challenges that the  British "three-circle diplomacy" is facing.    Britain was once very glorious, but this glory has become  history. Economic statistics show that British industry has  been in an accelerated decline, and its proportion in  international manufacturing production, trade, and GNP have  fallen sharply. Over the past few years, the country has been  bogged down in a serious economic recession and so far has  lacked the strength to recover. Just as the British magazine the  ECONOMIST has stated, "Britain's real significance has been on  the wane to a considerable extent." Economic reality has made  people realize that "its position of strength of the past is  gone forever."    The radical changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe,  the reunification of Germany, and the conclusion of the Cold War  have fundamentally changed the international environment which  Britain has relied upon to maneuver and carry out its foreign  policies. First, the end of the Cold War noticeably weakened the  British position and influence. Being a victorious nation in  World War II and the second largest economic power in the  capitalist world in early post-war years, and backed up by the  "special British-U.S. relationship," Britain played an important  role in the formation and development of the international  political and economic order after World War II. With the lapse  of the Cold War era, however, the importance of the military  factor in the relations of the Western alliance have declined,  while that of economic factors has risen remarkably. Thus, its  political superiority -- based on its military capability and  its role in the defense of the West -- has been deteriorating  imperceptibly. Moreover, united Germany has grown to be the  number one economic power in Europe and occupies an increasingly  important position of leadership in the EC with every passing  day. As a result, in foreign affairs the United States is  leaning more toward Germany as the days go by. Second, U.S.  foreign policy specialists maintain that the "future of the  world lies in Asia." Asia's position in the U.S. global  strategy has risen somewhat, and the relationship between the  United States and the Western European countries, including  Britain, is facing new readjustments.    Although Britain's national strength is far from what it was  in the past, the British Government has not redefined its  position and policy goals according to the new international  pattern. Conversely, it has continued to pursue Churchill's  "three-circle diplomacy." This is a tough problem for British  diplomacy. Therefore, the British press maintains that Britain's  foreign policy goals are in urgent need of further  readjustment." A senior British Government official also said a  short time ago that Britain will lose its international  influence -- which it still possesses -- unless it reevaluates  its foreign policy goals and refrains from sticking its nose in  everybody's business.</p>

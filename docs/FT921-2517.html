			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Britannic Assurance ahead 37% BRITANNIC ASSURANCE, the life assurance group, yesterday announced total net profits for 1991 of Pounds 24.7m, an increase of 37 per cent from 1990. The figures included an exceptional transfer from its industrial life fund of Pounds 4.9m. Life business profits excluding this transfer increased 21 per cent to Pounds 19.5m. The transfer, which was made to bring Britannic's bonus payments for industrial branch contracts in line with the bonus structure for its ordinary savings contracts, increased the funds available to shareholders. Britannic therefore paid a final dividend of 20.3p (17.3p) bringing the total for the year to 29.5p, up from 25.3p. This was slightly ahead of some expectations, and the shares rose against the market trend from 847p to 852p. However, analysts said that the exceptional transfer was not solely aimed at maintaining dividends, and that the results pointed to promising underlying strength. Mr Roman Cizdyn, insurance analyst at Smith New Court, said: 'The really important point to make is that they are already generating significant profit from personal pensions which they sold during the recent boom. There is some genuine growth in these results, based on recent management action.' The total underwriting loss for the general branch was Pounds 6.81m, compared with Pounds 5.89m in 1990. This included losses on property of Pounds 4.96m, and on motors of Pounds 1.55m. Mr Alan Richards, insurance analyst at James Capel, said: 'The underwriting loss is 26 per cent of premium income, much in line with the industry average.' He was predicting a surplus next year of Pounds 24.5m, and a dividend rise to 33.5p.</p>

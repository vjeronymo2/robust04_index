			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CITY WORKERS OCCUPYING 5 TRAILERS PURCHASED AS HOUSING FOR HOMELESS  </P> <P> Five of the 102 mobile homes purchased two years ago by the city of Los Angeles  as shelters for the homeless are being used as temporary offices for city  employees, including some who work in San Pedro and Wilmington.  </P> <P> The Board of Recreation and Parks Commissioners voted last week to formalize a  little-known deal among the city's Housing Authority, the Community  Redevelopment Agency and the Department of Recreation and Parks. Under the  arrangement, the parks department has been unofficially using the five trailers  as offices since early this year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'It Is Upsetting to Me'  </P> <P> "It is upsetting to me," said Toni Reinis, southern region director of the  California Homeless Coalition, which was one of several homeless groups that  supported purchasing the trailers from a Utah power company. "I would like to  see homeless families being sited because that was the purpose of the  trailers."  </P> <P> The Housing Authority originally had been instructed by Mayor Tom Bradley to  put the 102 trailers on land at public housing projects. When opposition of  some project tenants made that task difficult, then-Housing Authority Executive  Director Leila Gonzalez-Correa last fall offered to lend the five trailers to  the parks department.  </P> <P> "We really needed the additional office space," said James E. Hadaway, general  manager of the Department of Recreation and Parks. "I was talking to the head  of the Housing Authority one day, and she said they were available."  </P> <P> Bradley spokesman Bill Chandler said the mayor supports the arrangement because  the five trailers were unused and in storage. To date, the city has made 61 of  the trailers available to homeless families. The remaining trailers are being  stored in a maintenance yard near Torrance, city officials said.  </P> <P> "It wasn't like there has been a great demand from people asking for the  trailers (to house the homeless)," said Michele Roth, a spokeswoman for the  Housing Authority. "We have had requests, but we have had difficulties placing  them."  </P> <P> Georgiann Rudder, who oversees city parks in the harbor area and Westside, said  the trailers provide badly needed office space, storage facilities and rest  rooms for maintenance employees in different parts of the city.  </P> <P> Rudder said the trailers give her work crews greater flexibility in caring for  parks in the department's Pacific region, which extends from Mulholland Drive  to Point Fermin. With trailers in both the Westside and South Bay, she said,  crews are able to save time.  </P> <P> Under the agreement with the parks department, the Housing Authority can  reclaim the five trailers on 30 days' notice. Chandler said that provision  guarantees that the trailers will be available for transitional housing as soon  as the city finds sites. In the meantime, he said, the city is also saving  storage costs for the trailers, although he did not know how much.  </P> <P> "The trailers program is working, and it will continue to expand," Chandler  said. "We will place 15 more in the near future. We are getting very close."  </P> <P> As of last month, according to city statistics, 178 families have been housed  in the trailers since the first ones were placed at Ramona Gardens housing  project in northeast Los Angeles early last year. With the assistance of local  agencies, 75% of the families have found permanent housing during their stay in  the trailers, city officials said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Activists Object  </P> <P> But the city's success in helping homeless families by providing the temporary  housing only makes the arrangement with the parks department more difficult to  swallow for some activists for the homeless.  </P> <P> "If they can use them on recreation and parks property for offices, why can't  they use them for homeless families on recreation and park properties?" asked  Reinis, of the homeless coalition. "If they were able to site them for offices,  they definitely should have been able to site them for families."  </P> <P> Others said they would rather see the trailers housing homeless families but  had no objection to the city's using them in the meantime.  </P> <P> "I hate to see any resources being wasted when they can be used for something,"  said Lynn Davis, director of housing services for Volunteers of America, which  provides social services for homeless families in five trailers in Hollywood.  "There is a tremendous need for the trailers, but I think there needs to be  care taken to find the most appropriate sites."  </P> <P> Chandler said the city has conducted an extensive search for available sites,  but, he said, the parks property now being used for the five offices is not  appropriate for homeless families.  </P> <P> "It is not simply a factor of finding a piece of property where you can fit a  trailer," he said. "The whole point of this program is offering job training  possibilities and helping to get the head of the homeless families to enter the  work force. There certainly is a lot that goes into providing the services for  the people who would live in the trailers."  </P> <P> Reinis agreed that social services are important, but said it is also important  to get families off the streets and into the trailers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'First Priority'  </P> <P> "The first priority is getting them all placed, then we can start looking at  the most appropriate placements and the programs," Reinis said. "We have got to  get these things out of storage."  </P> <P> The deal that made five trailers available for the parks department was  approved by Housing Authority commissioners in October, and a short time later  the CRA's housing director also endorsed it. CRA consent was necessary because  the agency paid for the trailers with $1.4 million from a replacement fund for  low-income housing torn down during Bunker Hill redevelopment.  </P> <P> "They just wanted to make sure we had no problem with it," said John Maguire,  the agency's deputy administrator for housing services. "Technically the  agreement (to purchase the trailers) says they are supposed to be used for  housing. I didn't have a problem with an interim use."  </P> <P> The five trailers are being used in a variety of ways.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Used by Crews  </P> <P> The trailer near Rancho Park, sandwiched between a red-brick office building  and a cluttered storage yard, serves as home base for landscape, tree trimming  and park maintenance crews that take care of parks and other city property  throughout the Westside, Rudder said. The brown and beige two-bedroom trailer  houses several filing cabinets and desks and serves as a crew room, where  workers get their morning assignments, she said.  </P> <P> A second trailer has been placed on blocks in a parking lot behind Rudder's  office at the Pacific region headquarters on north Palos Verdes Drive North in  San Pedro. Although the administrative building is just 7 years old, Rudder  said the department has already outgrown it.  </P> <P> The Palos Verdes Drive trailer serves as home base for craftsmen -- plumbers,  carpenters and electricians -- who work at parks, libraries and other city  facilities in the harbor area, she said.  </P> <P> A third trailer has been placed at the end of a dusty road near remote parking  lots at Harbor College in Wilmington. Rudder said the trailer is used by  paving, earth moving and tree trimming crews that take care of the grounds at  parks and other city properties.  </P> <P> Two other trailers have been placed closer to downtown Los Angeles. One, near  Atwater Park, serves as an office for the director of swimming and his staff  because of a shortage of space in a nearby parks building. The other is used by  maintenance employees for offices and storage near E. G. Roberts swimming pool  on Pico Boulevard.  </P> <P> "This new trailer we have made just a world of difference," said George  Stigile, maintenance supervisor for parks in the department's metropolitan  region. "It was really kind of a godsend. It gave us an ability to do a better  job and service the community. We were really cramped for space before."  </P></p>

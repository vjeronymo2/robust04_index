			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TILTING BUSINESS TOWARD THE LONG TERM;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: AMERICA IS HURT BY SHORT-TERM THINKING. SIX THINGS WOULD TAKE CARE OF  THAT, BUT THEY COME WITH A PRICE TAG AND RISK.  </P> <P> I've said that Washington and Wall Street should get a big share of the blame  for the short-term thinking that pervades the American economy. Businessmen are  guilty, too, but they don't set the rules. Here, from one businessman's point  of view, is how the rules should be changed.  </P> <P>  -- Encourage companies to invest long-term. The big 1986 tax cut really just  shifted more of the burden from individuals to corporations, which lost their  tax credits for capital investment. Those credits should be reinstated, and the  depreciable lives of capital investments should be shortened. The double  taxation of dividends (the company pays and so does the shareholder) should be  eliminated.  </P> <P> And the Federal Reserve has to bring interest rates down so American  businessmen can afford longer-term investments. I pay three or four times as  much for capital as my Japanese competitors do, and that means I've got to get  my return three times as fast.  </P> <P>  -- Increase the savings rate. But first there has to be money to borrow, and  the low savings rate in the United States denies us the capital we need for  economic growth. It starts with a tax system that punishes savings and  investment and rewards consumption. We should begin to shift the tax burden  from the passbook to the credit card. When new revenue is needed, tax  consumption.  </P> <P> IRAs and 401-K savings plans were among the best ideas Washington has had in  years. But then the government limited the tax incentives. They should be  opened up again.  </P> <P>  -- Reward patient money. The money that is going into savings these days too  often simply chases the fastest return. It doesn't sit still long enough to  help fund long-range development.  </P> <P> It looks as if a capital gains cut will be put off until next year. Fine. Let's  take the time to get more imaginative and stagger capital gains rates to reward  long-term investment. How about a 40% tax on assets sold within 90 days, 28% on  those sold between 90 days and five years, and no tax at all on assets held  more than five years? Would that turn a few speculators into farsighted  investors?  </P> <P> Too much of the country's savings is tied up in the takeover game. That doesn't  build American industry; it just cashes some of it in. We should require stock  to be held for six months or a year before voting rights can be exercised, and  eliminate interest deductions on debt picked up in an unfriendly takeover.  </P> <P>  -- Encourage research and development. Lower interest rates would also help  here, but we need to do even more.  </P> <P> We need to rewrite the anti-trust laws to allow companies to do joint R&amp;D.  The laws were written to promote competition within the United States, but now  they're restraining competition between the United States and its economic  rivals overseas.  </P> <P> In the auto industry, for example, we should be allowed to conduct joint  research in areas like safety, clean air and fuel economy. Companies overseas  do it. When Washington passes another regulation, American companies all have  to meet it independently while our foreign competitors put their heads (and  their bankrolls) together to meet it more efficiently.  </P> <P> Tax credits for research would help. So would a closer partnership between the  government and our universities to promote research. And we need more  protection from patent pirates overseas for the research that we do.  </P> <P>  -- Promote exports. American companies don't have enough incentives to build  long-term export operations. Volatile exchange rates make it extremely risky,  for one thing. And we do nothing to encourage exports through our tax or trade  policies. Our competitors overseas do.  </P> <P> A 10% tax credit for U.S. exports would be roughly the level of incentives our  competitors get through their tax systems when they send goods to us. We should  consider it.  </P> <P> Of course, the key to more exports is open markets abroad. That's the  government's job, and we've been wimps on this issue long enough. We've got the  weapons to blast open some of those closed doors, and we should use them.  </P> <P>  -- Create a more stable business environment. Nothing discourages long-term  thinking like short-term uncertainty. Why spend millions on a new plant that  may not pay for itself for 15 years if, in the meantime, somebody changes the  tax laws or flip-flops on environmental, safety or other regulations? Why do it  if energy prices might shoot through the roof or drop through the floor? Or if  interest rates and inflation might whipsaw the economy?  </P> <P> If there's one big, overriding reason that we can't see more than a few months  ahead, it's our $3-trillion national debt and the inability of the federal  government to rein in its chronic deficits.  </P> <P> Interest on that debt soaks up about 83% of the country's total savings, and  even worse, it forces the politicians to do one unnatural act after another.  This year they pretended that $96 billion of new debt wasn't there, by putting  it "off budget."  </P> <P> It is there, of course, and when the piper shows up to get paid, he could turn  the whole American economy upside down. There simply will be no long-term  stability in this country as long as we keep adding to that debt.  </P> <P> We aren't short-term thinkers in this country because we can't see to the  horizon. We can see that far, all right, but we don't want to. We're afraid of  what we'll see. And for good reason.  </P></p>

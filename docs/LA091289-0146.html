			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. EXPANDS PRESSURES ON GEN. NORIEGA  </P> <P> The United States said today it has expanded economic sanctions against Panama  in an effort to force strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega out of office.  </P> <P> State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the measures included  withdrawing Panama's 1989 sugar quota and widening the list of Panamanian  companies and individuals associated with Noriega to whom Americans will be  barred from making payments.  </P> <P> The United States first imposed sanctions against Panama last year but so far  they have failed to budge Noriega, who is under U.S. indictment on charges of  illegal drug trafficking.  </P> <P> "All of these actions are a direct result of Gen. Noriega's continued  unwillingness to respect the will of the Panamanian people by stepping down and  permitting the installation of a freely elected government," Tutwiler said.  </P> <P> Tutwiler said Panama's 1989 sugar quota of 30,537 metric tons has been  reallocated to other countries, which she did not name.  </P> <P> The loss of the sugar quota denies the Panamanian government close to $15  million in revenue, she said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> O'REILLY STEPS DOWN, PLAYERS SAY;  </P> <P> BRUIN COACH DIRECTED 1 TRIP TO STANLEY CUP FINAL IN 2 YEARS ON JOB  </P> <P> Bruins Coach Terry O'Reilly resigned today after two full years behind the  bench and one trip to a Stanley Cup final, according to players.  </P> <P> "We had no forewarning really," said Bruins forward Bob Joyce. "He told us, and  it is a surprise."  </P> <P> The news came after a closed-door meeting with Bruins General Manager Harry  Sinden. Boston was knocked out of the second round of this year's National  Hockey League playoffs by Montreal in four straight games.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Can't Be Confirmed  </P> <P> Neither O'Reilly nor the Bruins could immediately be reached for confirmation  of the players' reports.  </P> <P> Although Joyce called the resignation a surprise, other players who gathered at  Boston Garden today said there have been indications for weeks that O'Reilly  was considering stepping down.  </P> <P> "He let us know toward the end of the season" that he was considering leaving,  said Bruins rookie forward John Carter.  </P> <P> Center Ken Linseman said, "I think during the middle of the year he was getting  pretty frustrated with all the injuries. . . . He was a players' coach. He  tried to work real hard and treat the players really fairly."  </P> <P> The Bruins said they enjoyed having O'Reilly, a recent Bruins player, as their  coach. But they said the job took a toll.  </P> <P> Among the pressures off the ice, O'Reilly has a son who is battling a liver  ailment and may need a transplant.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Suspended for Several Games  </P> <P> O'Reilly was suspended this season for several games after becoming involved in  a brawl at a game in New Jersey.  </P> <P> "Even when he took the job (in November, 1986) I remember saying, 'It's great  for me, but I don't know if it's great for him,' " Linseman said.  </P> <P> Speculation as to O'Reilly's successor centered on Mike Milbury, coach of the  Bruin's American Hockey League team in Maine, and Bruins assistant coach John  Cuniff.  </P> <P> "A lot of the players are disappointed," Joyce said. "He was definitely a  player's coach. He was a motivator. He wasn't a technical coach."  </P></p>

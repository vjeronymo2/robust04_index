			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article from the "Seven O'Clock Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff arrived in  Santa Fe de Bogota and immediately the hornets' nest went wild.  His strong statements against President Cesar Gaviria and other  government officials forced the president to reply to the  controversial judicial official's criticism. Gaviria spoke in  terms stronger than the ones Colombians are used to hearing from  him. [begin recording]    Reporter: What is happening with Prosecutor  General Gustavo de Greiff?    Gaviria: In terms of our relationship, we have  differences of a juridical nature, and we believe some of his  decisions have been inappropriate. That is all.    Reporter: Mr. President, is your government  servile?    Gaviria: Yes, the prosecutor's portrayal of the  president was a bit offensive. I regret his use of such brazen  language. I will not answer him in similar terms at any time.  Colombia is starting to experience difficulties in the United  States for statements that, as the prosecutor himself has noted,  the president had warned him about.    Reporter: Skeptically, it has been said that you  did not give the prosecutor your full support because you were  safeguarding your election to the OAS post.    Gaviria: I believe the prosecutor has secretly  managed to spread this rumor. I believe it is extremely unfair.  Ours is a balanced, reasonable position. Our doubts are based  on the law, or simply based on what is appropriate. We are not  going to abandon our position simply because this type of  argument is being raised. In this specific case, I believe we  are doing great harm to the country by exploiting these  sentiments instead of explaining our decisions.    Reporter: Has the prosecutor's statement upset you?    Gaviria: I believe it is in Colombia's best  interests that we present a clear and consistent policy on drug  trafficking to the international community. This would be good  for the country. We want to incorporate the country into the  world economy and into world markets. It is highly desirable  that this country have a good image abroad. It is very  desirable for Colombians that Colombia have a good image abroad.  You can be sure that, despite all the ruckus and confrontation,  the country's interests, in the long run, are rooted in this.  [end recording]    Prosecutor Gustavo de Greiff stated in a communique issued  today, that, during his stay in the United States he denied to  the media that he had offered pardons to drug traffickers.  Prosecutor General de Greiff also said judicial cooperation  could not be accepted if it was conditioned on having to hold  prior consultations on the decision to use certain evidence with  a country that supplied such evidence--in this case, the United  States. The prosecutor also urged U.S. authorities to stop  their unjustified attacks on Colombian officials, especially  him. He called on the U.S. Government to continue cooperating  by exchanging evidence to further the struggle to end the  worldwide scourge of drug trafficking.</p>

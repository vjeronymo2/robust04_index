			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Government plan creates 200 homes MORE THAN 200 homes have been created by turning vacant property above shops into comfortable flats, housing minister Sir George Young said yesterday. He said that of the Pounds 5m allocated to the Flats over Shops scheme in its first year of operation (1992/93) the indications are that almost all of it, Pounds 4.7m, had been spent. Sir George, visiting a scheme in Brixham, Devon, said: 'Bringing flats over shops back into residential use not only contributes to the growth of available housing for rent, it also brings life back into our town centres, improves shop front security, and turns a drain on a landlord's resources into an assured income. 'This scheme has encouraged shop owners to recognise the potential financial gains which can be realised by bringing into use accommodation over retail premises.'</p>

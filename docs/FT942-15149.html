			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / The Lex Column: BSN Mr Antoine Riboud, BSN's chairman, is renowned for sticking his fingers in every pie in the French food industry. The fusion of BSN's prepared food businesses with those of Saint Louis is another example of his deal-making skills. The merged company, to be managed by BSN, will emerge as a powerful competitor to Nestle and Unilever in one of the most attractive growth areas in foods. Substantial cost savings should result from shaving a combined FFr5bn raw materials bill. Further economies of scale should come in product innovation and marketing. It may also help the rationalisation process at the Vivagel frozen foods business, which BSN snapped up in December after Unilever broke up Ortiz-Miko. Saint Louis will be pleased to have solved a strategic dilemma. By itself, its food business has a relatively weak market position and is facing extreme competitive pressures. Saint Louis will retain a 34 per cent stake in the merged venture. But it would be no surprise if BSN emerged with full control once the stand-still agreement expires. By then, BSN should have got to grips with the assets and know exactly how much they are worth. The chief snag for BSN is that the deal further increases its exposure to France just as it tries to tilt the business towards emerging markets. Nestle and Unilever have both been active in developing countries for decades and have established strong local businesses. It will take immense management effort and financial resources for BSN to recapture lost ground.</p>

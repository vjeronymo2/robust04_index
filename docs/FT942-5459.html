			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Weak market forces UPF to reduce flotation value UPF Group, the manufacturer of vehicle chassis frames, has cut the value of its flotation by one third to Pounds 40.9m as a result of the weak new issues market. The Pounds 20m reduction in its valuation is another disappointment for a company which has struggled since it won its independence through a Pounds 32m management buy-out from the collapsed Parkfield Group in 1990. It was forced to refinance in 1992 because of bad debts and significant problems with a new production line. The refinancing diluted the management stake from 21 per cent to 4 per cent. The past 18 months, however, have seen substantial growth in its core business, manufacturing chassis for the 4x4 market, primarily for the Land Rover Discovery and Vauxhall/Opel Frontera. These account for 70 per cent of turnover, and UPF remains significantly dependent on continued growth of the 4x4 market. Mr Keith Evans, chairman and chief executive, said that BMW's acquisition of the Rover group provided scope for increased sales, through improved distribution in both the North American and German markets. The company will raise Pounds 7.5m after expenses from the placing of 7.87m new shares, out of the total 17.88m share placement, priced at 108p each. The funds will help reduce bank debt to Pounds 5.5m. Mr Evans and Mr Tim Bell, finance director, are selling half their 1.73m shareholding, raising Pounds 933,736, compared with the original Pounds 75,000 cost of the entire stake. The remaining shares are being sold by the venture capitalists, primarily Phildrew Ventures. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.1m are forecast for the 12 months to end-August, against Pounds 1.5m in 1992 and losses in the previous two years.</p>

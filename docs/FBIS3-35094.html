The step has been taken under the Unlawful  Activities Prevention Act. The JKLF was declared an unlawful  organization by a notification of the Home Ministry two years  ago.    In the Kashmir Valley, four hard-core militants belonging to  an outlawed outfit were killed in an encounter with the Army  near Tangmarg in Baramula District yesterday.

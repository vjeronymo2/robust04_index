The  meeting touched on the efforts to provide stability and peace in  Somalia and to reach a peaceful settlement to end the civil war  there.    Major General Aidid praised Sudan for its solid stand and  for  its unlimited support, which the Somali people have been  receiving throughout their ordeal.    Mr. Khalifah expressed Sudan's readiness to continue  supporting the Somali brothers in the implementation of the  resolutions of the reconciliation conference currently being  held in Nairobi, in which all the Somali factions are  participating, by means of the provision of technical and moral  assistance, by placing Sudan's resources at the disposal of the  Somali brothers and hosting any meetings which they deemed  appropriate to hold in Sudan.

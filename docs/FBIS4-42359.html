			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Labor Minister Evangelos Yiannopoulos believes  that national elections might be held in May 1995 because the  Political Spring and KKE [Greek Communist Party] will not reach  agreement with the government on electing a president.    Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos indirectly  criticized the labor minister, stressing that the government  always had the prospect of a four-year term. Yiannopoulos said:  "National elections will most likely be held when the  president's term expires in May 1995. I hope the parties will  agree on the election of a new president to avoid new elections,  but I am afraid we will have national elections."    Commenting on Yiannopoulos' assessment, the spokesman said:  "We have repeatedly said, as can also be seen from the  parliamentary and political facts, that the government had the  prospect of a four-year term from the outset. Besides, the  least of the Greek people's demands is political stability and  on this basis it elected the country's government last October."    In a statement yesterday, during the presentation of a  social  tourism program, the labor minister questioned the other  parties' goodwill (particularly Political Spring and KKE) toward  a common candidacy (Samaras spoke about a premature discussion  and Papariga about disorientation) and predicted elections.

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Company News: French media shake-up intensifies CANAL PLUS, the French pay-TV station, and the media arm of Lyonnaise des Eaux, the water and construction company, plan to invest in MCM/Euromusique, the French version of the MTV pop video cable channel. The planned deal is the latest in a series to have been mooted on the French media scene in recent days. Earlier this week, Canal Plus announced it was joining forces with TF1 and M6, two other French TV stations, to create a news channel - a French counterpart to CNN, the successful US round-the-clock news service - in place of La Cinq, the collapsed TV channel. Meanwhile, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian media mogul and one of the main shareholders in La Cinq, hopes later this week to announce plans to rescue the station. Mr Berlusconi, a controversial figure whose activities in France have been viewed sceptically by the French government, dismissed the proposed French news channel as 'unworkable'. He claimed his proposals would create a service with 'strong news input'. The news of Canal Plus and Lyonnaise's investment in MCM/Euromusique comes at a sensitive time for France's cable system, which is struggling financially in the face of low audiences figures. Lyonnaise, one of the heaviest investors in cable, faces losses of around FFr400m (Dollars 74.1m) on its cable operations this year. Lyonnaise will take 11 per cent and Canal Plus 15 per cent of MCM/Euromusique, which forms part of the French government's attempt to prevent France's cable networks from being dominated by foreign programming. Existing investors include Generale des Eaux, another water company involved with cable, and PolyGram and Sony.</p>

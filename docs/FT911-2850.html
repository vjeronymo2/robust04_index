			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei regains ground on bargain-hunting Tokyo SHARE prices rose for the first time in three days as bargain-hunting by foreign investors and trust funds helped recoup morning losses, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed up 84.82 at 26,123.68, down 1.6 per cent on the week, after a high of 26,256.04 and a low of 25,994.28. Buying by investment trusts brought the index back above 26,000. Volume fell to 300m shares ahead of the Golden Week holiday next week. The market will be closed on Monday. Losers led gainers by 508 to 444 with 186 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section issues rose 5.40 to 1,957.96 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell by 1.22 to 1,478.16. Bargain-hunting by US pension funds pushed up big board issues. Nippon Steel gained Y9 to Y473 and Hitachi added Y10 to Y1,200. Asahi Chemical, which gained ground on Thursday on reports of a merger with Toyo Jozo, the liquor and foods company, fell Y62 to Y788 on profit-taking. Toyo Jozo lost Y10 to Y1,090. Index-linked buying by arbitrageurs buoyed up foods and financials. Ajinomoto rose Y40 to Y1,560 and Fuji Bank added Y70 to Y2,680. Investors took profits on electricals which had recently been sought on hopes of a recovery in the US economy. Sony fell Y150 to Y6,200 and Pioneer Electronic lost Y70 to Y4,860. Aoki, the construction company, gained Y18 to Y788 on individual interest. Other contractors were also firm on short-term interest. NT&amp;T, the benchmark of market sentiment, lost Y11,000 to Y941,000, falling below Y950,000 for the first time since January. The second section fell 24.95 to 3,312.43, but the OTC market gained 29.43 to 3,139.72, as investors focused on newly-listed issues. Horai, a dairy producer, gained Y1,000 to Y6,000 and Tescon, a electronic parts maker, added Y1,000 to Y8,000. Speculative issues fell further on news that a speculator had gone bankrupt. Nihon Nohyaku, the most active issue of the day, fell Y150 to Y2,100. The issue had been popular recently on rumours of speculative interest. Japan Steel Works gained Y25 to Y700 on individual buying. Traders said that rumours that the company is raising funds through equity financing also helped the issue. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 250.77 to 28,752.21 on volume of 22.1m shares. Roundup A NUMBER of markets brightened up in the Pacific Basin yesterday, with foreign buying, technical considerations and domestic financial economics advanced as reasons for the main winners, in Hong Kong, Australia and Seoul. HONG KONG saw turnover rise from HKDollars 1.17bn to HGKDollars 1.47bn as the Hang Seng index closed 31.42 higher at 3,625.80, 1.1 per cent lower on the week. Property shares posted sharp gains, traders attributing the upturn partly to bargain-hunting, especially by foreign funds. AUSTRALIA rose 1.3 per cent with industrials in the van. Overseas buying was noted as the All Ordinaries index added 19.3 to 1,537.8, 1.1 per cent up on the week. Turnover was boosted by the exercise of April options, virtually trebling from ADollars 241m to ADollars 712m. SEOUL recovered after two days of decline, the composite index adding 7.93 to close at 634.29, 0.9 per cent higher on the week. There were hopes of improved local liquidity, following corporate payments of Won1.4 trillion in value added tax. TAIWAN ended mixed on the day and usefully better on the week, the weighted index closing 27.33 points and 3.5 per cent higher respectively at 5,941.15. SINGAPORE had a similar tale to tell, the Straits Times Industrial index closing 4.47 higher on the day, and 1.9 per cent better on the week at 1,558.41. NEW ZEALAND firmed in moderate trading Friday, with foreign buying again moving the market following the decline in domestic interest rates.

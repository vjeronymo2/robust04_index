			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Russia unravels For nine months, Russia's economic policy has been constructed around a myth: that an economy can be stabilised gradually. The government feared the political consequences of a more radical approach. Instead, it has spent months trying to foster belief in a more user-friendly alternative. This week's fall in the rouble is only the most recent evidence that the package is unsellable. The currency will fall further as long as its value is tied to the success of a bankrupt policy. The 21.5 per cent fall in the rouble on Tuesday left President Boris Yeltsin looking for scapegoats. Mr Sergei Dubinin, the acting finance minister, has been sacked. Central bank chairman Mr Viktor Gerashchenko may go with him. Part of the blame for the government's lack of credibility lies with individuals. The tacit relaxation of monetary controls over the summer came as a result of individual ministers giving in to the constant pleas for assistance from agricultural and industrial producers. More broadly, evidence of state corruption continues to mount. But changing the individual policymakers will do nothing if there is not a fundamental reform of economic policy to go with it. There must be a stable macroeconomic framework if Russia is to achieve sustainable long-term growth. Stability means winning the battle against inflation, and winning that battle means establishing a strict set of monetary and fiscal guidelines to which ministers can credibly adhere. Few - whether inside or outside Russia - believe that the current approach can deliver this stability. Reducing inflation, without the benefit of a nominal anchor for prices, such as a fixed exchange rate, has meant months of attempted monetary restraint, supported by necessarily high real interest rates. High interest rates, in forcing more producers into bankruptcy, fuelled the very pressures for monetary stimulus which policymakers were already in a weak position to resist. But high rates also cost the government dear, by raising the cost of servicing government debt. The longer they prevail, the more likely it is that the government will resort to further inflation in order to lower that burden. Thus, whether or not members of the government actively fuelled the fall of the rouble - as President Yeltsin and others have suggested - it is the logical consequence of anti-inflationary policies which lack both the will and the means to deliver. The west can do more than watch. Under the auspices of the IMF, there must be a clear offer of large-scale financial support for any government willing to make a decisive break with the incremental, escapist approach of recent months. Support for a social safety net is vital, as is a fund to back the rouble, which would psychologically underpin a commitment to peg the exchange rate and make it fully convertible. But only a reformed government could make it worth defending.</p>

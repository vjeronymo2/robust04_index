			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sotiris Mikhail] </F>   [Text] Within the framework of a budget submitted to the  House of Representatives and the new Greek-Cypriot defense  doctrine, the government is ready to purchase new, modern arms  systems, including heavy battle tanks.    The purchase of heavy weapons, which will cost several  million pounds, falls within the framework of increasing the  country's defense capabilities to bring them in line with Greek  capabilities.    According to exclusive information, the purchases may be  made  directly and from new sources because many countries are now  willing to sell heavy weaponry.    The Cypriot Government has already sounded out several  countries that are willing to sell Cyprus the most modern arms  at very competitive prices.    A senior official said that there is great competition today  in the arms industry sector and many countries are trying to  sell their arms systems.    We have been informed that Cyprus began discussing the  possibility of purchasing arms systems from France, Italy,  Spain, South Africa, Singapore, and the former socialist  countries. It appears that Russia has been contacted about the  purchase of a specific modern arms systems by the method of  counterbalance trade. That is, Russia is willing to sell arms in  exchange for products it needs, such as citrus fruit and grapes.    The same officials added that the prospects are very good  and  it is hoped that the two countries will reach an agreement.  <H5>  The Procedure </H5>   The House of Representatives Defense Committee yesterday  discussed the new procedure for purchasing arms systems that has  been prepared by the Defense Ministry. The defense and finance  ministers attended the meeting. The new procedure provides for  the establishment of a Senior Design and Programming Council,  which will make suggestions about the needs of the National  Guard at a ministerial committee.    The Finance Ministry will become directly involved because  it  will be handling the payments for the arms. For the first time  it was asked that the National Council's consent not be  necessary for the purchases. An advisory committee will be  established for all issues.</p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Private View: The Reverend Soapbox - Lord Soper, Britain's best-known preacher, is 90 next year. He explains why he still speaks every week at Hyde Park and Tower Hill 'KNOCK it off, Soapy]', yelled a pugnacious little man in front of me. 'Get back to the nursing home where you belong, you old windbag]' Lord Soper seemed not to hear. He was leaning forward on his step-ladder to dispute with someone on the far side of the small crowd. He looked very frail and his voice was weak against the wind. The Rev. Donald Soper, Methodist minister, 90 next January, may not be able to dish it out quite as he used to - but he can certainly take it. With occasional absences, he has spoken at Tower Hill in London every Wednesday since 1926 and at Speakers' Corner, Hyde Park, every Sunday since the the late 1930s. Why on earth does he go on doing it? I went to the run-down offices of the West London Methodist Mission at a church not far from Oxford Street. Britain's best-known preacher was sunk in an old armchair. 'Do you mind if I don't get up?' he said as he held out a hand. If he seems vulnerable in the open air, Soper is imposingly venerable indoors. The clarity and frankness of his conversation testifies to the rigours of nearly 6,000 open-air confrontations - what he calls 'the fellowship of controversy'. 'You can't get away with it in the open air as you can in church,' he said. 'And don't I know it] I remember one little docker. He used to sit on the wall beside me at Tower Hill (I stood on the wall for 30 years) and when I'd been particularly obtuse - I can hear him now - he would say to the crowd in an admonitory phrase: 'Now is that clear?' And of course I knew damn well it wasn't' He regrets the loss of his docker audience at the Tower ('very intelligent and very vociferous') and the fact that he can no longer get an echo from across the river Thames. Speakers' Corner was always more raucous and has become even rougher with the appearance of 'professional' hecklers who go from pitch to pitch in the hope of creating a fracas. There was one in particular, he said, whose language about women in the crowd was downright pornographic. Why don't the police remove him? 'I have never called in the police and I never will. I hate to say this: but I think I can see most of 'em off. You must be careful not to give the impression that I'm cocky about it. But it's a fairly low-grade intelligence you're dealing with and if you can keep them to what they are saying you can generally get the better of them. 'One thing has to be admitted. I used to imagine it was the coruscating quality of my mind. Now I've discovered when my voice is not nearly as good as it used to be . . .' Are you getting too weak to take them on? 'No. I'm physically disabled in some respects: for instance my legs are very bad. But I think I've got enough sense to realise that you should give up rather than dry up. You want to go out with a bang, not a whimper.' What puzzles, I said, is why you should go on doing it. 'I am a Methodist preacher and I suppose in some respects I'm peculiar in that I never wanted to do anything else. I never had any doubts - impudence, of course, impudence - but no doubts that I was going to offer myself to the church to be a preacher. Therefore you can say I'm an addict. Or you can say I have a calling. But I'm committed. And that's not a credit to me. It's just a condition.' After a degree from Cambridge, a PhD from London and ordination, Donald Soper was pitched into the working-class world of London's Old Kent Road. He found himself answering questions that no one was asking. It was the same at Tower Hill. 'The first question I was asked was about Karl Marx, and I'd never heard of him. I told them I didn't want to give them a hasty answer,' he chuckled. 'I have a continuing conviction that a great many in contemporary society are not evangelised in any sense because they don't go to the places where the gospel is preached. And when they do go - I don't want to be unkind - they are not necessarily brought into touch with the kingdom of God.' I'm surprised you don't feel after all these years that what you do makes not a ha'porth of difference. 'That, of course, is a temptation, particularly when you've had a bad time in the open air. You think, what the Hell's the good of it? 'I don't want to sound pious or prudish but my responsibility is not so much to count scalps as to proclaim something which I believe it is my duty and my calling to proclaim. Therefore I am not hag-ridden by the question of results.' Wouldn't you say people today are more godless, more greedy? 'I think they are.' So you should be in a state of some despair. 'I could easily fall for that feeling. I quite often find it very difficult to keep my pecker up. On the other hand I have evidence of the help I have been to people who have not at the time expressed any thanks but, meeting them casually, sometimes years afterwards, have said they have been influenced and altered in their conviction.' It felt wrong to be provoking an old man. Then I reflected that Lord Soper has faced worse - much worse. He expatiated on war, how armed violence had infected our lives and how violence had been allied to sex. ('I can speak with authority on sex for I'm nearly 90'). Sex had become such a dominant ingredient of our diet that our stomachs could not take it. 'In violence and sex we are in peril of an almost terminal condition.' Why did we get into this condition? 'The Christian church always had an inkling that original sin isn't a sufficient explanation, that total depravity is much nearer the mark. This may sound a little pompous and sentimental but I think we're going to Hell because we're not saying our prayers.' Why did we stop saying our prayers? 'Because the invitations of a modern society, whether they are fulfilled or not - you've only to think of the advertisements - create a different atmosphere. The peasant in an Indian village has very little to hope for, very little to encourage him to greed or to the prospects of advancement. 'We are in a world where the invitation to pleasure or to happiness is very largely separated from the responsibilities that go with that quest for happiness. That is to say, pleasure, ultimately, is self-defeating. 'You can be a good capitalist and practise self-interest, pride, but you can't be a good citizen - a socialist, as I would use the word - unless you have a sense of moral responsibility. We are clever enough, almost, for anything now. But we are certainly not good enough.' Since you've mentioned socialism, I said, let me pursue a defeatist line. You stand for socialism and pacifism and both have taken a severe hammering. 'You say 'hammering'. It depends who's doing the hammering, how he's wielding the hammer. You don't discredit socialism by recognising the collapse of Communism. What you do, in my judgment, is realise you've taken the word socialism too easily. 'The socialism I believe is that which emerges from the teaching of Jesus, particularly from the sermon on the Mount. I never believed in socialism as state capitalism. I don't believe in the nonsense that we are all equal and there is some divine quality of the proletariat and so on.' After discoursing on the ethics of capitalism and socialism Soper concluded: 'I have no doubt that Christianity has not succeeded. But I am more than ever convinced that we're in a hell of a mess now and that things are getting worse. And they are getting worse because we are refusing to consider the alternative to the kind of system which some people have profited by.' He accepted my labelling him an anachronism, adding that it was a characteristic of Christianity. 'I'm by no means as lonely when I think of the saints as I am when I think of the hecklers.' He described the physical and psychological handicaps of age. 'When you're looking forward there's always the inference that you can put it right if it's wrong. When you get to my age, you look back and you realise that things which were open-ended are now shut. And it's not a very pleasant experience.' So that's another temptation to despair? 'It is, yes. You refer to this quite a lot. I would be insincere if I said that I'm not sometimes disappointed and rather bewildered that things haven't gone better. But I still have this quite dominating background of obedience. I find it is health-giving not worrying the whole time as to how you are getting on.' Would you confess that your appearances at Tower Hill and Hyde Park have become a matter of pride? 'Of course. Let's be quite clear about that. I believe I ought to be there, however badly I do. It is a matter of self-interest. I am serving a part of myself which probably I ought to be more humble about.' Which bit of you? 'Well, I'm fairly good at it. I've been a long time at it. And I've got into the habit of doing it. And though I would indignantly repudiate the idea that those are sufficient motives I've never been silly enough to say that I'm not a mixture of motives.' So there is a certain vanity attached to it? 'Y . . . es. Vanity, if you like. Yes. You're putting me in the confession box and I will take your priestly office and accept it straight away that I'm a mixture of good and bad, of pride and humility. But I find the resolution of this complexity is the question of obedience. 'That is to say, I believe I must do it.'</p>

Borovkov; place and date not  given: "Evasive in the Meantime"]    [Text] [Borovkov] First of all, I would like to find out  what are the duties of the Interior Ministry parliamentary  secretary.    [Mucins] The interior minister and I are the political  leaders of the ministry, while Colonel Staris, Interior Ministry  state secretary, is the highest "uniformed" official in our  department. There are three major groups of my official  functions. First of all, I am responsible for relations with  the legislature. There are a lot of committees in the  parliament and Minister Kristovskis himself is working in one of  them. Thus, at the sessions of committees, and even sometimes  at the Council of Ministers, I have to represent the interests  of my ministry. I sometimes speak at plenary sessions on behalf  of the council, including the presentation of certain draft  laws. Secondly, the parliamentary secretary takes part in the  sessions of the Council of Ministers and its three committees.  For example, I have recently reported on adopting a new  progressive system of penitentiary institutions. We are  eliminating camps and adopting the system of prisons. Finally,  the third direction of my activity is so-called ministerial. It  includes the drafting of documents, for example the ministry's  charter, reorganizing our structures, and the like. Alas,  whether someone likes it or not, sessions take up half of my  working time.    [Borovkov] To what extent does the legal footing correspond  to the current realities?    [Mucins] Unlike other people, I have nobody to blame for  this. If a necessary law does not exist I am the very person who  is supposed to draft it. However, the analysis of criminal  activities in the Republic shows that there is a need for  certain corrections in the legal sphere.    [Borovkov] What kind of corrections?    [Mucins] Take car thefts for example. It is easy to reach a  conclusion about improving the procedure of trading and  registering cars, adopting other measures. Last year, more than  1,800 cars were stolen and only 10 percent of those thefts have  been investigated. This is much less than in other categories of  crime.    [Borovkov] Does organized crime exist in Latvia?    [Mucins] Of course there is organized crime, and car thefts  are a prime example. What is organized crime? First of all,  this is a sociological rather than legal term. We will hardly  have an article on organized crime in our criminal code. It is  enough to have an article envisioning responsibility for being  an organizer of a crime. However, we have had virtually no  cases where we could prove this crime. Frankly speaking, we  have only been arresting small fries. On the basis of  operational data, we can only guess that this or other person is  an organizer of a specific robbery, murder, or case of  racketeering. Organized crime means a precise division of  duties. Speaking of car thefts, there are people who learn that  a new car has been registered (this also means that information  leaks occur), others learn where the car is being kept, still  others steal it, drive across the border, sell it, and so on.    [Borovkov] What about the term "Mafia," which is so loved by  the press?    [Mucins] We are using this term to denote the merging of  organized crime with state structures. For example, the merging  of criminal groups with the militia was noticed as far back as  the 1970's. This trend has hardly been decreasing ever since.  It must be at the same level, if not higher.    [Borovkov] However, almost the entire bureaucratic machine  has been replaced in Latvia.    [Mucins] I cannot cite any facts or concrete accusations in  this regard, but the trend remains. We keep this in mind. A  hundred hares do not amount to a single horse; a hundred  suspicions do not amount to a single fact. In one particular  case, an investigator acted as a middleman between an executive  body official and a man who wanted to privatize a facility on  favorable terms. However, these kinds of crimes should be fought  by special structures. Regular police methods do not work. The  police here work like a fire brigade, rushing to those places  that are already on fire. Thank God, we somehow manage to do  this, but we need specialists who could work on prevention,  analyze data, and plan in advance.    [Borovkov] Speaking of fighting economic crime, how are  things going in this regard, given that the Department for  Fighting Thefts of Socialist Property has been disbanded?    [Mucins] This is both good and bad. People from the  department joined other structures, because they would not be  able to work up to the new economic realities. On the other  hand, we must form a structure for fighting thefts of not only  socialist but all kinds of property, corruption, fake  bankruptcy, and the like. However, we need new people with a new  kind of knowledge. When we are through reorganizing the general  structure of the ministry, we will get down to reorganizing  individual departments.</p>

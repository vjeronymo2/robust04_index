			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Ex-Swans workers awarded payouts Unions representing 300 Swan Hunter shipyard workers, who lost their jobs last July when the company went into receivership, have won compensation from a Newcastle upon Tyne industrial tribunal of between Pounds 250,000 and Pounds 750,000 depending on further litigation. The full order, which is nearer Pounds 1m, is not realisable because the company is in receivership. Mr Stefan Cross, of Brian Thompson and Partners, the solicitors representing the GMB general union at the tribunal, said that other cases against the Department of Employment were to be heard. They will challenge the way the department made payments from a redundancy scheme. Five unions launched claims on behalf of some 1,400 workers who lost their jobs at the company. More than 1,000 unfair dismissal cases remain outstanding and a further 400 claims against the employment department are being pursued. The Swan Hunter cases are typical of recent big receiverships, such as those at Leyland Daf and Ferranti, where employees have been dismissed at short notice in contravention of legal requirements that workers be given 90 days notice of redundancy.</p>

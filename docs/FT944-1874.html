			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Bids The 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales were put on bid alert on Wednesday when Trafalgar House announced it was considering an offer for Northern Electric. If it goes ahead analysts expect mergers and takeovers involving other companies. The government made clear that it will not allow a bid to be complete before March 31 when its bid-blocking 'golden share' in each of the recs expires. Trafalgar is still considering its options but it seems likely to go ahead with a bid, probably in the New Year. Northern's shares reached 1010p at one stage last week, valuing the company at Pounds 1.25bn. Trafalgar, attracted to Northern's steady stream of earnings, will probably have to pay considerably more than that to win what is certain to be a contested takeover battle.</p>

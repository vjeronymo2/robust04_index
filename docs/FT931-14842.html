			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Iron ore groups in Australia and Brazil cut prices to EC, Japan IRON ORE producers in Brazil and Australia have been forced for the second successive year to cut prices at the end of the annual round of contract talks with steel customers in Europe and Japan. Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the Brazilian state-controlled company that is the world's leading exporter of iron ore, has cut the price of its exports to German steel producers by 10 to 12 per cent. CVRD suggested this would set the pattern for its prices for the rest of Europe - where Germany is the group's biggest customer - and for agreements with Japanese and South Korean steel companies when contracts were renegotiated in April and May. Following CVRD's lead, Hamersley Iron of Australia, owned by CRA, cut 11 per cent from the prices of fines ore for delivery to Japanese steel mills and 9 per cent from lump ore. Robe River, part of North Broken Hill, another Australian natural resources group, agreed a cut of 12.79 per cent with its Japanese customers. CVRD revealed that the German accord contained a price reduction for pellets to Dollars 28 a tonne, down from Dollars 31. High grade sinter material from the Carajas site, will go for Dollars 18.15 per tonne instead of the previous Dollars 20.65 while southern sinter will be priced at Dollars 16.90 a tonne, down from Dollars 19. A CVRD official noted that the price reductions marked the continuation of a trend dating from last year, when prices fell by 7 per cent for pellets and by nearly 5 per cent for sinter. Lower demand, reflecting the world recession and its manifestations in the steel sector, is primarily responsible for the price falls, which reversed an upward trend that had started in 1989. Germany consumes about 13 per cent of Brazilian exports, roughly the same as South Korea. Japan is the most important market for CVRD's iron ore. CVRD's output of iron ore declined last year to 86.8m tonnes, of which 60.4m was exported. In 1991, the company produced 93.6m tonnes, of which 66.8m tonnes was shipped abroad. Mr Rod Kinkead-Weekes, Hamersley's managing director for sales and marketing said: 'Since 1988 the same fines price changes have applied to Australia and Brazil and to have departed from the 11 to 12 per cent price cuts already agreed by the Brazilians in Europe would have compromised our competitiveness.' He said Hamersley was likely to ship more iron ore to Japan than in 1992 since Japanese crude steel production was expected to rise slightly.</p>

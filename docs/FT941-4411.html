			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Election battle starts in Milligan's constituency Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday opened his party's campaign for the Eastleigh by-election in Hampshire caused by the death of Conservative MP Mr Stephen Milligan last month. Mr Ashdown pledged to set out an honest and positive alternative to Conservative policies. He said Eastleigh would give voters a chance to pass their verdict on the past two years of Tory government. He said: 'Eastleigh will soon be able to tell John Major that people in Britain want a fundamental change of approach.' The normally safe Tory seat, which Mr Milligan won with a majority of nearly 18,000 two years ago, will be fought by Mr David Chidgey, Liberal Democrat candidate in the last two general elections. The Conservatives lost a local council seat last night in the constituency of Eastleigh. Voting was Liberal Democrat, 473; Conservatives 212; Independent 154; Labour 60. An inquiry ordered by Metropolitan Police Commissioner Paul Condon, conducted by up to 15 detectives over about five days, concluded yesterday that police acted 'correctly and thoroughly' in releasing details of Mr Milligan's death, Motoko Rich writes. But Mr Condon said a review of procedures for passing on information to the media had been started in the wake of the controversy surrounding police contacts with the press. Asked whether MPs were to blame for leaks to the press, Mr Condon would only say the 'bulk of the information came from Westminster' where 'hundreds' of people had snippets of stories to pass on.</p>

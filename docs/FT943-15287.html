			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / International Company News: Laidlaw improves in most areas Better third-quarter results in the waste management, recycling and transportation businesses of Laidlaw were slightly offset by a small decline in hazardous waste operations. The company blamed this on landfill problems in South Carolina and pressures on pricing. Overall, Laidlaw, one of North America's top three waste management groups and a Canadian Pacific associate, earned USDollars 38.9m, or 14 cents a share, in the three months ended May 31. This compares to a 1992-93 third-quarter loss of Dollars 33.6m, or 12 cents, after a special Dollars 75m after-tax charge reflecting a write-down in the value of Laidlaw's interest in ADT. Without the charge, the period showed net profit equal to 13 cents a share. Third-quarter revenues this time were Dollars 579m, up 6.5 per cent. The lower Canadian dollar reduced the total by Dollars 11.5m. Margins rose sharply in solid waste management and recycling, reflecting North American recovery and restructuring. The bus transportation group continued to expand. For the first nine months of fiscal 1994, net profit was USDollars 93.9m, or 34 cents a share, against USDollars 43.4m, or 16 cents.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 22 (YONHAP) -- Washington has begun to  look into the damages on its industry following Seoul's virtual  ban on American sausage imports at the recommendation by U.S.  sausage producers to invoke Super 301 trade sanctions against  Korea, a trade official here said Sunday.    The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) recently asked sausage  manufacturers to submit details of their damages resulting from  Korea's massive disposal of American sausages, the official said.    USTR also requested the producers to state their complaints  and recommendations following Korea's shortening of shelf life  to 30 days from former 90 days.    The American Sausage Producers Association had advised  Washington to designate Korea as a priority foreign country in  accordance with the Super 301 trade act for Seoul's cutting  shelf life of American products and then disposing of them on  the grounds that they are hazardous to public health.    "I think USTR began to investigate into the problem in order  to present documental proof that Korea's action was unfair in  future trade talks," the official said.</p>

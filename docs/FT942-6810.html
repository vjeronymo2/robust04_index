			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Diplomat opposed war in Vietnam: Obituary Mr George Ball, the diplomat who battled against the widening of the Vietnam war by the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, has died, aged 84. A lawyer by training who served in the war-time Lend Lease Administration created to help the UK against Germany, Mr Ball was recruited by President Kennedy in 1961 on the basis of his European expertise to serve as assistant secretary of state for economic affairs. Within a year, he was number two in the department and, in spite of many internal disagreements over US policies towards Indochina and Cuba, remained there until his resignation in 1966 shortly after crucial decisions to expand the war were agreed over his opposition or in his absence. He later served briefly as interim US ambassador to the UN at the tail-end of LBJ's term. Years later, Mr Ball wrote that US intervention in Vietnam had been 'a defeat for our political authority and moral influence abroad and for our sense of mission and cohesion at home'.</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Reluctant US leans to China - Clinton ponders sanctions to show concern on human rights The process has been something of a fiasco, but in the next week or so President Bill Clinton is expected to announce he has decided to renew China's continued privileged trade access to the US market. Mr Clinton will not evince much enthusiasm for extending China's Most Favoured Nation trading status. This is because he knows Beijing has hardly fulfilled conditions laid down in his executive order of May last year for 'overall, significant improvement' in its human rights behaviour. The vexed question for the administration is what conditions it might attach to MFN renewal this year to assuage likely criticism of US capitulation to China, or whether it should attach conditions at all. Among the options are restrictions on US imports of items made by the People's Liberation Army, including assault weapons, or, more broadly, selective bans on goods made by Chinese state enterprises. While sanctions against the PLA may have some appeal politically in the US, such a step would not inflict much harm on the overall trading relationship, beyond antagonising an influential element of the Chinese heirarchy. PLA-made exports to the US total about Dollars 200m (Pounds 133m) out of Chinese exports amounting to more than Dollars 30bn. The bulk of these PLA items are civilian products such as textiles and toys and would therefore be difficult to distinguish from run-of-the-mill Chinese exports. The administration would also face immense difficulties applying selective sanctions against state enterprises. Not least of the problems would be arriving at a suitable classification for such enterprises, since many are in the process of being transformed into corporations, stock-holding companies and joint ventures. Mr Clinton and his advisers, principally Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, have no easy choices in arriving at a face-saving formula for MFN renewal that would on the one hand penalise Chinese human rights misbehaviour and on the other avoid actions jeopardising US business prospects. Judging by Mr Clinton's public statements recently, he is leaning towards renewal. He said earlier this month that withdrawal of MFN would harm both China and the US. The administration's fumbling performance on the MFN issue contrasts sharply with Chinese self-confidence. China has yielded little to US concerns about human rights in spite of Mr Christopher's attempts to put a favourable gloss on developments. While there may have been progress on issues like an end to the Chinese export of prison-made goods and access to jails for the International Committee of the Red Cross, Beijing has shown little restraint in pursuit of dissidents. Human Rights Watch/Asia reported this week the number detained after the 1989 Tiananmen Square killings was much greater than hitherto recorded. It also reported widespread torture of political detainees.</p>

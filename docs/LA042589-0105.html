			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 1988 LEGISLATIVE RACES: $40.4-MILLION SPENDING SPREE  </P> <P> Candidates for the state Legislature spent $40.45 million during last year's  general election cycle, almost a 26% increase over the 1986 general election  figure, the Fair Political Practices Commission reported on Monday.  </P> <P> The FPPC report showed Assembly candidates in 80 races raised $24.71 million  and spent $30.33 million. Senate candidates vying for 20 upper house seats  raised $8.38 million and spent $9.88 million. As these figures suggest, many  candidates must continue fund-raising after election day to pay off sizable  campaign debts.  </P> <P> Sen. Cecil N. Green (D-Norwalk) and Republican Don Knabe, a former Cerritos  city councilman and chief of staff for Los Angeles County Supervisor Deane  Dana, waged the most expensive fall campaign, spending a total of $2.35  million.  </P> <P> The incumbent successfully defended a Senate seat that he won in an expensive  special election only a year earlier.  </P> <P> Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) reported spending  $1.9 million, most it to help other Democrats get elected. Roberti gave Green  $600,000.  </P> <P> On the Assembly side, the most expensive race was the $1.85-million contest  between Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg (D-Sacramento) and losing Republican  challenger Larry Bowler, a Sacramento County sheriff's lieutenant.  </P> <P> Next in line was a $1.81-million campaign between Republican Curt Pringle, a  Garden Grove planning commissioner, and Democrat Christian F. (Rick) Thierbach,  a Riverside County prosecutor who lives in Anaheim.  </P> <P> Pringle won the contest to replace the late Assemblyman Richard Longshore  (R-Anaheim), who died the day after he won the GOP primary nomination.  </P> <P> Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) reported spending $2.74  million, but he also transferred most of his money to other Democratic  candidates.  </P> <P> Proposition 73, a campaign financing initiative approved by the voters last  year, prohibits the transfer of funds by legislative leaders to their  colleagues.  </P> <P> It also limits contributions by individuals and businesses to $1,000 each  fiscal year, political action committees with two or members to $2,500, and  broad-based political action committees that have been in existence for more  than six months and have 100 or more members to $5,000.  </P> <P> Senate leader Roberti and Speaker Brown have filed lawsuits contending that  Proposition 73 is unconstitutional.  </P></p>

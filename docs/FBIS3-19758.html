			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] President Soares is in Brazil. He does not tire  of advocating a good relationship between all peoples of the  Lusophone countries, and he backs the community being prepared.  Among other advantages, it will carry a significant weight at  the UN, which could help many people in the future. These were  Soares' words in an exclusive interview with Renascenca. Ines  Saldanha also spoke to President Soares about the political  contacts he has been having and of Itamar Franco's visit to  Portugal.    [Begin recording] [Soares] First of all, at the invitation  of  Vice President Itamar Franco, we are preparing a major meeting  to be held in Lisbon and a major meeting of Lusophone countries  at a head-of-state level. [passage omitted]    [Saldanha] You place great importance on the July meeting of  Lusophone countries, and I know that that is related to the  importance you give to a greater weight of those countries in  the UN. Do you think that could help Portugal in matters such  as Indonesia?    [Soares] Of course. They all have come out, and even Brazil  recently came out very clearly in favor of East Timor and in  favor of its self-determination. This carries some weight. But  I am thinking beyond the present. I am thinking of the future.    [Saldanha] Are you thinking of the community of Lusophone  countries the Brazilian ambassador talks of?    [Soares] Exactly. I am thinking of a community, a  Luso-Afro-Brazilian community that could have an important  specific weight in the 21st century.    [Saldanha] And do you think that is viable considering the  conditions in Mozambique and Angola?    [Soares] Precisely, what I want is a joint plan by Portugal  and Brazil to help our African brothers, who are in a bad  situation but will be great nations in the future.    [Saldanha] Have you invited President Itamar to visit  Portugal before the end of your mandate?    [Soares] Naturally, it has been confirmed that he will visit  in June. Before the summit of heads of state, he will come on a  bilateral state visit to Portugal, and I will have the honor of  receiving him in Lisbon. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / International Company News: Medway Ports poised to float early next year MEDWAY PORTS, the subject of a Pounds 37m management and employee buy-out last year, is preparing for a stock market flotation - probably at the beginning of next year. Despite flat turnover because of recession, the Sheerness-based company has markedly increased profitability since the trust port was privatised. For the 10 months to December, Medway made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.5m on turnover of Pounds 25.2m. In the first six months of this year, pre-tax profits have jumped to Pounds 4.5m. Mr Peter Vincent, chief executive, attributes this to 'a traumatic process of coming into a new world. We had to change our cost base from fixed to variable.' This involved sharply reducing the number of the company's workforce who are employed on a permanent basis from about 600 at the time of the buy-out to the current level of 270. Catering and security were quickly contracted out, but Mr Vincent said the company still employed just as many people on some days - the difference was that men were hired from local contractors as and when needed. He said: 'We have moved from two-shift to three-shift working, giving round-the-clock coverage. We also have complete flexibility - an employee can be driving a fork-lift truck one day and painting a buoy out in the harbour the next.' Sheerness avoided containers and has instead concentrated on three distinctive markets - cars, fruit and forest products - where it can offer quality service. The company expects to receive full BS5750 accreditation by September. Mr Vincent said traffic levels were flat and rates had been squeezed, but nonetheless the company had made excellent progress. It has appointed Charterhouse Bank to advise on a flotation, but does not rule out the possibility that it might be bought by a larger group. Mr Vincent said: 'If it was a safe pair of hands, we'd have to look at it very seriously. I see Medway as part of bigger group in the long-term, whether we build it up ourselves by acquisition or find a partner.' The buy-out was completed in March last year and financed by Dollars 20m of loans, Pounds 15m of preference shares and Pounds 2m of equity. Two-thirds of the workforce subscribed for shares. Mr Vincent said all existing workers are being granted options, so that they all have a stake in the flotation.</p>

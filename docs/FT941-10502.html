			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Observer: Off line Poor old British Telecom. Its young rival, Mercury, really does seem to be running rings round it in the public relations battle over its biggest ever single price cut. No sooner had Michael Hepher, BT's group managing director, addressed the nation yesterday morning on BBC radio's Today programme, than up popped a man from Mercury saying his company was also cutting its prices. Hepher then moved across to BBC breakfast TV, only to find himself sparring with Terry Rhodes, Mercury's director of competition strategy. Hepher, keen to maximise the impact of what should have been BT's biggest publicity coup in years, had agreed to carry on the debate with Mercury on ITN's lunchtime news. However, when BT heard that Mercury chief executive Mike Harris had delegated one of his flunkies, the indefatigable Rhodes, Hepher bowed out. BT's press office said last night that Hepher had wanted to debate the subject with the 'organ grinder, rather than the organ grinder's assistant'.</p>

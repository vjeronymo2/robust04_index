			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Investing in debt - Doing the Splits MEZZANINE Capital and Income Trust 2001 is one of the most unusual funds in the split capital sector. It has a very small portfolio of investments; it invests mainly in debt, not equities; and it concentrates on unquoted companies in the US. But this unusual formula has proved successful. The capital shares of the trust have been the best performing of all investment trust shares over the last five years, with a rise of 276.6 per cent to June 1. The trust was formed in 1986, raising Pounds 28m, at a time when leveraged buyouts (LBOs) were a highly popular financing tool in the US. LBOs involve managers raising debt to finance the takeover of companies from their shareholders. It was argued that giving managers an equity stake in the business would encourage them to work hard and efficiently; furthermore, the high level of debt would 'concentrate their minds' on generating cash to pay the interest. MCIT buys, as its name suggests, the mezzanine level of debt. Mezzanine debt is not secured by assets but pays a higher yield than secured debt, to reflect the higher risk involved. (It is known as mezzanine because it is the layer between debt and equity). The trust also buys equity stakes in the buyout companies, giving it the prospect of capital growth should the company be sold to a competitor or float on the stock market. The image of leveraged buyouts suffered in the late 1980s, because of a few prominent corporate failures and the downfall of junk bond king Michael Milken. To date, the portfolio has had no failures; the managers, US group Jordan/Zalasnick Advisers, claims this is because of its experience and its concentration on private companies. The income shareholders are entitled to all the revenue of the trust; the capital shareholders receive no income. The capital entitlement of the shares is more complicated. The first claim on the assets goes to the capital holders to the extent of Pounds 1 per share; the next claim goes to income holders, also at Pounds 1 per share; after that, assets are split 90 per cent to the capital shareholders and 10 per cent to the income holders. According to Robbie Robertson, of NatWest Securities, there are more than enough assets to repay the capital shareholders at the current share price of 178p. If the assets grow at 5 per cent per annum, the capital shareholders will receive a gross redemption yield of 10.9 per cent; 10 per cent asset growth translates into a gross yield of 17.1 per cent per annum. For income shareholders, zero growth in assets and dividends would result in a gross redemption yield of 3.8 per cent per annum; 5 per cent asset growth would translate into a yield of 9.2 per cent per annum, says Robertson. As the accompanying bar chart shows, the dividend was cut in the year to March 31. This reflected a restructuring at one of the group's investments, American Safety Razor, which issued payment-in-kind notes. American Safety Razor has floated on the NASDAQ exchange in the US, with the result that Dollars 7.5m debt has been repaid, including the notes. As a result, MCIT is paying a special interim dividend of 4p per share, more than making up for last year's cut. The trust has a highly concentrated portfolio with just nine stocks. The ninth was only announced this week - LePage, a tape and sealing products maker, where the trust is investing Dollars 9m in a combination of debt and equities. Valuation is always a key issue at a trust which has large unquoted holdings. MCIT values its debt at cost and then relies on an independent valuation of its equity investments by the US group Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. DLJ, in its report for the year ending March 31, indicated a range of values from Dollars 31.1m to Dollars 34.9m; MCIT adopted the lower figure. To date, when investments have been realised, MCIT has achieved an uplift on the balance sheet valuation. According to John Korwin Symanowski, of brokers S G Warburg Securities, the portfolio structure is: loan notes 39.5 per cent; preference stock 4.3 per cent; unlisted equity 22.5 per cent; listed equity 16.1 per cent; and cash 17.6 per cent. The concentrated portfolio of the trust makes it higher risk, and its dollar assets means British investors also face an exchange rate exposure. Nevertheless, the record-to-date has been excellent. Key facts. As of March 31, the trust had net assets of Pounds 56.4m (including Pounds 12.36m of cash). The manager's fee is 1.5 per cent of net assets per year. The trust is due to be wound up in December 2001. Board. John Green-Armytage, the chairman, is a former managing director of the Guthrie Corporation. Other directors are: Gary Brass, managing director of Consulta, a private investment advisory company; Edwin Goodman, a general partner of Hambro International Venture Fund; James Jordan, an executive with the Jordan company; and Andrew Withey, senior investment strategist with James Capel Investment Management.

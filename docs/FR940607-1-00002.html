The rule is being promulgated to implement the directives of section 545 of the Immigration Act of 1990 (``IMMACT''). Both time and number limitations on motions to reopen proceedings or to reconsider decisions have been proposed in accordance with section 545(d) of IMMACT, and will reflect the intent of Congress to streamline the deportation proceedings of aliens in the United States. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments must be received on or before August 8, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Please submit written comments to Gerald S.

Under the proposed rule, a party may file only one motion to reopen proceedings, and one motion to reconsider a decision of an Immigration Judge, the Board of Immigration Appeals (``Board''), or a Service Officer. A motion to reopen proceedings must be filed within 20 days of the final administrative decision or within 20 days of the effective date of the final rule, whichever is later. A motion to reconsider a decision must also be filed within 20 days of the decision or within 20 days of the effective date of the final rule, whichever is later. Under the proposed rule, provisions concerning motions to reopen or reconsider have been condensed into one section under 8 CFR 3.2. A new &sect;3.8 will concern fees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board has previously addressed issues relating to the effect of an alien's loss of lawful permanent resident status on a motion to reopen proceedings to apply for or to further pursue an application for relief under section 212(c) of the Act. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., Matter of Cerna,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interim Decision 3161 (BIA 1991) and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Matter of Lok,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 18 I&amp;N Dec. 101 (BIA 1981),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> aff'd on other grounds, Lok  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> INS,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 681 F.2d 107 (2d Cir. 1982). These decisions have recently been the subject of litigation and conflicting court rulings. Subject to all of the other requirements pertaining to motions to reopen, the proposed rule will permit reopening of proceedings to consider or further consider an application for relief under section 212(c) of the Act if the alien demonstrates that he or she was statutorily eligible for such relief prior to the entry of the administratively final order of deportation or exclusion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are several exceptions to these general rules, as required by section 242B(c)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1252b(c)(3). An alien who is ordered deported  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in absentia  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> who can demonstrate that his or her failure to appear was due to exceptional circumstances may file a motion to reopen the proceedings within 180 days of the final order. An alien who is ordered deported  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in absentia  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> without receiving notice of the proceedings, if notice was required, or who was in federal or state custody at the time of the proceedings and could not appear, may file a motion to reopen without regard to the above time limitations. The filing of a motion to reopen proceedings or a motion to reconsider a decision will not serve to stay the execution of any decision, unless the motion is filed by an alien who was ordered deported  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in absentia,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> pursuant to 8 CFR 3.23(b)(5). As in the past, an alien who files an asylum claim that arises after the initiation of deportation proceedings against the alien where the claim is based upon an alleged change in circumstances in the country of the alien's nationality may move to reopen the proceedings at any time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When a party appeals a decision, the notice of appeal must meaningfully identify the reasons for the appeal in order to avoid summary dismissal. The notice must indicate whether the party will be filing a brief and whether the party desires oral argument before the Board. An appellant will be provided 30 days in which to file a brief unless the alien concerned is detained, in which case the appellant will be given 14 days to file a brief. The Immigration Judge or Service Officer may specify a shorter time in which to file a brief, but only the Board may extend the time for filing, and then only up to a total of 90 days for good cause shown. An appeal may be withdrawn by either party. In the event the alien concerned leaves the United States after taking an appeal but prior to a decision, the appeal will be deemed withdrawn. An appeal will not be permitted when an order of deportation or exclusion has been entered  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in absentia. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rule more clearly outlines when the notice of appeal should be filed with the Immigration and Naturalization Service and when the notice of appeal should be filed with the Office of the Immigration Judge. The proposed rule also replaces the reference to discontinued Form I&hyph;290A with reference to the currently used Form EOIR&hyph;26 for filing an appeal from a decision of an Immigration Judge and Form EOIR&hyph;29 for filing an appeal from a decision of a district director. The proposed change will eliminate the requirement that the notice of appeal be filed in triplicate. Parties will still be required to file the original notice of appeal with the office having administrative control over the record of proceeding and serve a copy of the notice of appeal on the opposing party. The proposed rule will clarify that a notice of appeal will not be considered filed until the notice is actually received in the office having administrative control over the record of proceeding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rule clarifies that the period for filing a Notice of Appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals of Decision of Immigration Judge (Form EOIR&hyph;26) is extended from 10 to 13 days where the decision of the Immigration Judge is served by mail. The proposed change will clearly define the event that commences the running of the period for filing an appeal and will reiterate which form should be used to file an appeal and where to file the form. These proposed changes will help unify practice and procedure throughout the country and will restrict the ability of parties to reopen or continue proceedings indefinitely. These goals are consistent with the directives of section 545 of IMMACT (8 U.S.C. 1252b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule is promulgated as a proposed regulation to allow for comments prior to implementation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, 2 May, BNS -- The Central Electoral Committee  extended the deadline for accepting lists of candidates by 9 May  in a number of regions. It also decided to convene a meeting of  election coordinators, Budget Minister Janis Platais and MP's to  tackle the financial problems of elections.    As reported, the Central Electoral Committee requested the  related institutions to increase the funding for the elections.  Platais said the claim was ungrounded.    Electoral Committee member Dzintars Rasnacs stressed that  the  work of regional commissions may be hampered by the lack of  resources and the financial shortfall may even obstruct the  organization of local elections. The committee plans to inform  about the situation Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs if the  resources are not allotted soon.</p>

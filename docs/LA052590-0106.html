			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: HE WAS PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION AND MADE THEM PAY THE PRICE  </P> <P> In dealing with Oakland's Rickey Henderson, Boston catcher Tony Pena discovered  that it doesn't pay to play it straight.  </P> <P> After a game in which Henderson hit a game-opening home run off Red Sox pitcher  Eric Hetzel, Henderson told the Boston Globe: "When the count was 3-and-2, Pena  was out there yelling, 'Throw the ball right down the middle. I want you to  throw the ball right down the middle and let him hit it.'  </P> <P> "I thought that maybe they were trying to trick me. They'll do that sometimes  with you. I thought he probably would throw me the curve, but he threw me the  fastball, and I hit it out. When I got back, Pena said, 'I didn't mean hit it  like that.' "  </P> <P> Add A's: Outfielder Dave Henderson, always looking for an edge, told the  Oakland Tribune: "Mike Witt was one of the toughest starting pitchers in the  league three years ago. Well, I watched him and watched him, and found that his  finger stuck out a little bit on his breaking ball. He doesn't do that  anymore."  </P> <P> More A's: From St. Louis Cardinal pitcher John Tudor, revealing that Oakland  tried hard to sign him after he left the Dodgers: "Anyone in their right mind  would want to play for the A's, being the world champions. But not being in my  right mind, I didn't want to learn a new league."  </P> <P> Of his stay in Los Angeles, he said: "Nothing against the ballpark, nothing  against the team, but I'm not a patient person. I don't like sitting in  traffic. I don't like waking up in the morning with my eyes burning. That  lifestyle was not for me."  </P> <P> Trivia time: Who is the only driver to win the Indianapolis 500 in three  decades?  </P> <P> Call of the wild: Blazermania has overtaken the city of Portland, and Trail  Blazer media director John Lashway wondered if it had gone too far when he  answered the press room telephone during the final playoff game against San  Antonio.  </P> <P> Lashway: "This woman on the other end had gotten the number, I don't know how.  Suddenly she starts tearing into the officiating. She wants me to get a message  to referee Joey Crawford that he stinks."  </P> <P> How about it?: Cincinnati Red outfielder Paul O'Neil, on the crackdown on  oversized gloves: "Back in the old days, players used their bare hands instead  of gloves. If you had big hands, did that mean you couldn't play."  </P> <P> Mark it down: From Chicago Coach Mike Ditka, promising that Mark Carrier, the  Bears' No. 1 draft choice from USC, will be a starter at safety: "If anyone  keeps Mark off the field, he'll be on his way to Canton."  </P> <P> Canton, Ohio, is the home of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.  </P> <P> Who asked that?: Said New York Giant Coach Bill Parcells, when somebody asked  if he was concerned that Lawrence Taylor might hold out: "He's only the best  player we've got. It wouldn't bother me at all."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Bobby Unser, in 1968, 1975 and 1981.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Raider executive Al LoCasale, on the reacquisition of former Navy  running back Napoleon McCallum from the San Diego Chargers: "It's an  unbelievable deal for us. When we traded him, he was an ensign. Now we get him  back as a lieutenant." HARLEY TINKHAM  </P></p>

Mr.  Mandela said, during the last leg of his election tour of  northern Transvaal, that pressure must also be brought to bear  on the government to force Bophuthatswana to change its views.    [Begin recording] [SABC correspondent Estelle Pienaar] Mr.  Mandela said he is concerned over the situation in  Bophuthatswana. He said he would prefer to resolve differences  with Bophuthatswana President Lucas Mangope through dialogue,  but it now appeared as though further talks would yield nothing.    [Mandela, in English] A great deal of pressure is going to  be  put on Mangope. I would have preferred Mangope to have agreed  on a solution before he is forced to capitulate by pressures,  but it appears now that that (?force) is inevitable.    [Pienaar] Mr. Mandela has now ended his election tour of  Venda. It is still an independent state, but will soon become  part of the new South Africa. This afternoon Mr. Mandela's tour  of the northern Transvaal also came to an end. Tomorrow  President F. W. de Klerk will follow Mr. Mandela's footsteps and  visit the same province.

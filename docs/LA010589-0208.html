			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WYSE TO CUT WORK FORCE BY 15%  </P> <P> Wyse Technology, a maker of personal computers and terminals, said today that  it plans to cut its 3,800-person work force by 15% and expects to report a loss  for the nine months ended Dec. 30.  </P> <P> Wyse, based in San Jose, also said its president and chief operating officer,  Phillip E. White, has resigned to join Informix Corp., effective today.  </P> <P> The company said the work force reduction, which will take place through  layoffs and attrition, involves about 560 positions worldwide. About 400 are  being eliminated in its Far East manufacturing operations, with the balance  from other divisions.  </P> <P> Wyse said the reduction is being implemented in light of its third-quarter  revenues, which the company previously said would fall below $100 million,  yielding a loss for the quarter ended Dec. 30. The company said it now expects  revenues of between $60 million and $70 million for the third quarter and a  loss for the nine-month period.  </P></p>

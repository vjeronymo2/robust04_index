			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Asylum clash in Bonn coalition Chancellor Helmut Kohl's liberal and conservative allies quarrelled yesterday over how to curb the right-wing violence which has struck Germany, Reuter reports from Bonn. The liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) protested against conservative calls for stiffer laws, believing existing laws strong enough to deal with an eruption of racist and anti-Semitic attacks. In turn, Mr Kohl's allies in the Christian Social Union attacked the FDP for opposing moves to scrap Germany's generous political asylum law and halt an influx of refugees. Bonn announced plans to reassign 1,300 federal bureaucrats and 200 retired military officers to help process a backlog of over 400,000 requests for asylum.</p>

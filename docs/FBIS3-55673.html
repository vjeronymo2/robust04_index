He is Yuriy  Tikk, a Defence Ministry adviser, government spokesman Ain  Saarna told reporters on Friday. His area of responsibility is  law enforcement in the town which was closed to foreigners until  recently.    Paldiski is the country's only place which held no local  elections and Tikk will represent the central government until  local self-management is introduced there.    Various estimates put the number of town residents from  6,000  to 7,000 with 1,200 of them belonging to the Russian naval base  there. There are about 200 ethnic Estonians who are eligible to  stand in local elections.    The envoy is given two weeks in which to draft proposals for  solving the town's problems. Simultaneously, the Interior  Ministry is instructed to register all town dwellers by the end  of March and the Justice Ministry given two weeks to put forward  proposals on the legal basis of local self-government.    Colonel Raul Luks who was appointed by President Lennart  Meri  as military administrator of Paldiski has been at work since  January 1. He is responsible for any decision making linked to  Russian pullout from the town.    A trainload of machinery and equipment needed for  dismantling  nuclear reactors crossed the Estonian-Russian border en route to  Paldiski on Friday, the spokesman said.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Pereira--Last year's 519 murders and the discovery  of mutilated cadavers in recent months reflect a level of  violence unknown until recently in Risaralda's capital. And  while the coffee crisis persists, investments are being made in  large buildings and businesses.    The influx and expansion of drug cartels in the region have  produced these disparate indicators. The sectional director of  the DAS [Administrative Department of Security], Javier Restrepo  Orrego, upon taking this position this week, emphasized that  efforts need to be made to keep this phenomenon from continuing  to disrupt the citizens' tranquility.    To date, 3,090 violations of Law 30 of 1986--possession,  distribution, or sale of narcotics--have been recorded. This  represents 41.44 [as published] of all crimes in this region  during a 10-month period.    The 519 murders account for 63 percent of the homicides  reported in 1993 by the Forensic Medicine Institute. Only 13 of  the 827 autopsies listed the cause of death as "natural causes."    Criminologists say this could be seen coming. According to  the National Police, in 1992 the city of Pereira had the highest  crime rate in Colombia, with 211 crimes for each 10,000  inhabitants, compared with the national average of 64 cases.    On the average, 750 crimes are reported per month in  Risaralda. In suburban and rural areas, in one month the police  found the dead bodies of seven men with no identification. The  corpses had been mutilated and had multiple bullet wounds. In  some cases, after they were identified it was determined that  they had been killed as a result of criminal business deals.  These investigations have been hampered by a lack of evidence.  <H5>  The Drug Mafia: a Challenge </H5>   In January 1994 there were 50 violent deaths reported, 10  more than in the same month of 1993, according to the Forensic  Medicine Institute.    Risaralda's governor, Roberto Galvez Montealegre, speaking  of  the breakdown of public order, said that his administration has  been concerned and that even though things are under control, it  is still possible that the situation may worsen with the  presence of the drug traffic and insistent pressures from FARC  [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] gangs in the  northwestern part of the department.    Lieutenant Colonel Libardo Diaz Ortiz, the police commander,  was unwilling to provide partial statistics on crime in the last  two months "in order to avoid disputes with other regional  organizations."    In his first official statement as DAS director, Restrepo,  who had served as deputy regional director, said his major  challenge will be to take action against the drug Mafia  operating in Risaralda and the northern part of Valle, for which  he will have the agency's full support.    Last December the manager of the Civic Company of Pereira (a  private organization), Felipe Lopez Hoyos, said the expansion of  new businesses and the proliferation of restaurant and fast food  franchises were being used to "launder hot money."    Moreover, in the controversy about doubling the real estate  tax in Pereira, Mayor Ernesto Zuluaga Ramirez said the soaring  growth in land and construction prices, caused by the presence  of an irregular economy--attributable to drug trafficking  investments--justified the highly unpopular rise in the property  tax rate.    From an approximate value of 150 pesos per square meter in  some parts of the city, the tax rate has risen to at least 750  pesos.    Pereira Chamber of Commerce statistics say private  investment  rose 195 percent (almost quadrupling) in 1993 compared with  1991, from slightly over 3.400 billion pesos to 9.479 billion  pesos last year.    This seems strange, as the region's major economic activity,  coffee, is experiencing its most severe earnings crisis, while  textiles and the clothing industry are barely sustaining their  traditional level.</p>

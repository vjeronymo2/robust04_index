			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 19 Apr -- State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin  today met with PLO Executive Committee Chairman Yasir 'Arafat.  During the meeting, Yasir 'Arafat expressed confidence that the  Russian side will render necessary assistance in implementing  the recent agreements between the PLO and Israel, of which  Russia and the United States are cosponsors. At the same time,  Yasir 'Arafat noted that there have been recent "attempts to  depart from the agreement and to push the Russian Federation to  the sidelines in this process."    For his part, Ivan Rybkin told journalists after the meeting  that "the Russian side favors the unconditional implementation  of all UN Security Council resolutions concerning a peace  settlement in the Middle East." The State Duma chairman said he  hopes the agreement between the PLO and Israel "will be  implemented without double standards." "I hope the last Israeli  soldier will soon leave the occupied territories and free  parliamentary elections will take place there to which the Duma  will send its observers," Ivan Rybkin said.</p>

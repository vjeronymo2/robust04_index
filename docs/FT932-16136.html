			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / The coming struggle for a growth market: Angus Foster on GE Capital's move into European trailer rental For three years TIP Europe has been struggling as an also-ran in the European trailer rental market. But yesterday's bid by GE Capital, if successful, could kick-start the fortunes of the company and make for an intriguing battle with the market leader, Tiphook. First, though, GE Capital must convince TIP Europe's shareholders to accept a bid when their company is close to the bottom of its cycle, at a price where many will lose money. One analyst said neither TIP Europe's shareholders nor its management would be proud of the offer price. 'But how long can they wait before continental Europe, and therefore the share price, recover?' he asked. TIP Europe's troubles started in 1990 when, after two years of boisterous expansion, it was hit by falling revenues in the UK as recession took hold. The company breached a banking facility, which prompted a refinancing and the arrival of a new chairman, Mr Jim Davis, and chief executive, Mr David Callear. Since then the company has fought to control costs and has been reducing its fleet size, even though this means it will benefit less from an eventual economic recovery since it will have to buy new vehicles. Analysts also suspect it has neglected important spending on information technology and allowed its fleet to grow old - its vehicles are on average 1.5 years older than Tiphook's. In the meantime, Tiphook has consolidated its position as European market leader. It is estimated to have about 35 per cent of the market, compared with 19 per cent for TIP Europe. Tiphook has more vehicles in all European markets except Spain and has built up a dominant share of the important German market. GE Capital's entry into Europe had been expected since the expiry in 1991 of a 'non-compete' agreement it inherited with the acquisition of Gelco, owner of US trailer rental company Transport International Pool. This last company had earlier sold TIP Europe to its management, so GE Capital's bid would reunite the two halves of the operation. Mr Robert Agans, chairman of GE Capital's modular space and TIP divisions, said the plan was 'to grow TIP Europe as fast as we can'. This would include annual spending of Pounds 40m to Pounds 50m on new trailers, which would conform to the latest EC specifications and be capable of cross border rentals. The company would therefore move closer to Tiphook, which has sought pan-European clients while TIP Europe saw Europe as a collection of local markets. Assuming a modest turnaround in Europe's economy, he expected the fleet to grow from 17,000 to 23,000 trailers by 1997. This compares with Tiphook's fleet of 33,000 vehicles. GE Capital would also bring in from the US its own sales and marketing executives, and some new management. Spending would be increased on computers, although the company's US systems would be suitable. 'Competition with them (Tiphook) will get more intense, but it will be at the service level, not the price level,' he said. GE Capital and Tiphook already know each other well from the container rental market. GE Capital's container rental division, Genstar, is the largest in the world while Tiphook's is number two. Mr Robert Montague, chairman of Tiphook, said the European and US distribution markets were very different. 'We are already here in Europe and have already built up a network,' he said. Nevertheless, Tiphook's shares fell 25p to 335p on competition worries yesterday. Both companies have room for growth in the longer term. Some analysts say the continental trailer rental market is under-developed compared with deregulated markets such as the US and UK. Rented trailers make up about 8 per cent of total European trailers, compared to about 25 per cent in the US. The rest are owned. Although European barriers still exist - for example cabotage prevents some cross border return trips - these barriers are slowly coming down and most analysts expect the European figure to pass 15 per cent by the end of the decade. One analyst said GE Capital's entry into the market would be annoying for Tiphook, but not necessarily damaging. 'These people are used to competing and competition should open up the market quicker,' he said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] On 26 February Eugenio Sanabria Cantero,  president of the ruling National Republican Association, ANR  [Colorado Party], justified the administration's decision to  repress peasants who blocked highways "because principles and  laws in effect cannot be violated." The ruling party leader  emphasized that the Colorado Party cannot "take credit" for the  administration's positive actions alone, but rather "accept the  good along with the bad."    Following the official ceremony marking the anniversary of  ANR founder General Bernardino Caballero's death at the Heroes'  Memorial in Asuncion, Sanabria Cantero was asked about the  repression of peasants. He answered: "As the ruling party we  cannot take credit for just the positive aspects of the  administration's performance, but rather accept the good along  with the bad."    The Colorado Party president stated that he justifies  everything the administration may do to prevent violations of  the principles and laws in effect. Sanabria Cantero asked the  journalists: "Do you believe it is proper for the peasants to  block the highways?"    He added that repression cannot be treated separately from  the peasant problem, the attitude of the peasants should be  taken into account. The Colorado Party leader emphasized that  citizens who voice just demands will always have the party's  support, provided they do so within the framework of the law.    It appears, however, that Sanabria Cantero contradicted  himself on the subject of Colorado Party support for the  peasants. After the confidential session of the Colorado Party  Executive Board on 23 February, he reported that the leadership  of the Colorado Party had decided to come out in support of the  peasants who are having land problems and are demanding better  prices for their products, namely, cotton.

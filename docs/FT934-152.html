			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Co-ops take the high road to marketing success - Scottish farmers are increasingly turning to collaboration Ten years ago a handful of trout farmers in south-west Scotland decided to join forces to market their produce through a co-operative. It proved a runaway success. Today Scot Trout processes 3,000 tonnes of farmed trout a year, representing 80 per cent of the Scottish market and 20 per cent of the UK market. Its annual turnover is Pounds 12.5m. Initially selling trout straight from the farm to the market, it has moved into gutting and filleting and is investing Pounds 1.6m in better processing facilities over the next three years. 'We're now looking at what we can put back on the fish by stuffing it, enrobing it or turning it into goujons,' says Mr David Hogg, chief executive. Scot Trout is one of the most prominent of the farmer-owned co-operatives that have become flagships of the Scottish food industry and the envy of farmers' leaders south of the border, where collaborative ventures have a more chequered history. Faced with the possibility of reduced subsidies for European producers, Scottish farmers are increasingly turning to collaboration to give them muscle in a fiercely competitive marketplace. Mr Maitland Mackie, a farmer near Aberdeen, produces about 10,000 pigs a year. 'I market, as I believe everybody should do, through a producer group which collects similar type pigs for the best market for that type of pig,' he says. As with farmed trout, about 80 per cent of Scottish pig production is sold through co-operatives, a level comparable with some sectors in France or the Netherlands, agricultural exporting countries for whom co-operatives are the norm. Scottish co-operatives handle over 50 per cent of vegetable output, nearly half of cereal production and 30 per cent of farm supplies, but less than 10 per cent of cattle and sheep from hill farms. The farming co-operative has a long tradition in Scotland. The oldest, Tarff Valley, which still supplies the industry with feeds and fertilisers, was set up in 1903. 'Farmers are better at co-operating in Scotland,' says Mr Alastair Alexander, marketing director for the Scottish National Farmers' Union. 'Needs must. We're far from the markets and our land and climate are pretty tough.' The country's 100 or so co-operatives are grouped under the umbrella of the Scottish Agricultural Organisation Society, which lobbies on their behalf and offers advice on how to improve sales. Collective turnover amounts to some Pounds 500m, equivalent to about a third of Scottish farm output. Nearly half its funds are provided by the government, the rest by a levy on members and consultancy fees. In England, the National Farmers' Union is looking for a way of encouraging domestic collaboration now the government has turned Food from Britain into a purely export promotion body. 'SAOS is a very interesting example,' says Mr David Evans, director general of the NFU. 'Whether something like that would work in England is debatable.' While there are success stories in England, interference by farmers in the management of co-operatives has been partly blamed for the failure of some collaborative ventures. Mr Edward Rainy Brown, chief executive of SAOS, says his organisation tries to overcome this by defining clearly the roles of board and management in nascent co-operatives and emphasising the farmer-directors' responsibility to the co-operative rather than to their individual farms. Co-operatives can cover many aspects of farming. Machinery rings, where farmers pool their equipment and labour and hire it to each other, are becoming increasingly popular. The first started with 23 members in the Borders about five years ago and 2,000 farmers now belong to 12 rings across the country. 'The co-operatives provide a counter to the virtual dominance of the supply sector by large national groups,' says Mr Rainy Brown. Some co-operatives in different sectors are banding together to share administrative costs. In south-west Scotland, Tarff Valley is working with a machinery ring, a lamb marketing venture and a co-operative offering farm secretarial services. This trend should help co-operatives keep an eye on the wider scene, says Mr David Douglas, agricultural manager for Clydesdale Bank. 'There's a real danger that co-operatives could compete against co-operatives and that's going to take away from the original aims,' he argues. The most successful co-operatives have, however, been able to wring advantages for their members from the powerful retail sector. ANM Group, the largest agricultural co-operative with 8,000 members, recently agreed that its Aberdeen Meat Marketing subsidiary would supply Wm Low, the Scottish supermarket group, with 60 per cent of its red meat requirements for the next 12 months. 'It's unique,' says Mr Brian Pack, ANM Group's chief executive. 'It's usually done on a week-to-week basis.' Mr Donald MacRae, agricultural specialist at TSB bank in Edinburgh, believes ANM points the way to the future. 'SAOS should be encouraging the big co-operatives to be bigger,' he says. 'We need a concentration on the farming side to match the power of the processors and retailers. A strong buyer demands a strong seller.'</p>

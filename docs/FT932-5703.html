			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Decline in copper stocks forecast COPPER STOCKS on on the London and New York metal exchanges would start to fall in the second half of 1993, a drop caused by present strong demand in the US, Mr Richard Osborne, chairman of Asarco, one of the world's biggest integrated producers of non-ferrous metals, predicted yesterday. Copper demand in the US at present was stronger than at any time since the last quarter of 1991, he said. US official statistics tended to lag behind copper in giving an indication of the US's economic health and the reasons for the very sharp rise in US demand would not be clear for some time, according to Mr Osborne. But the US recovery was more than making up for a 3 per cent drop in demand from Europe while Japan's move out of recession had already started. Mr Osborne told the Association of Mining Analysts in London that Asarco expected net copper exports from the former communist countries to fall from about 310,000 short tons in 1992 to 285,000 tons this year. The drop would help the western world copper market move back towards balance - the supply surplus should shrink from 180,000 tons to about 54,000 tons. Mr Osborne also predicted a 'fairly sharp rise' in lead prices later this year as production cuts so far totalling 130,000 tons took effect. Asarco estimates an 85,000 tons deficit in the western world's refined lead market in 1993 in spite of net exports from the former communist countries rising from 91,000 last year to a 101,000 tons. He was more pessimistic about zinc. Mining cuts would eventually take their toll on high-cost smelter output but stocks were so high that it would take a long time for them to fall to a level that would push up prices. Asarco forecast that the western world supply surplus would shrink from 259,000 to 48,000 tons. Planning permission has been given for a Dollars 65m lead-zinc mine at Galmoy in County Kilkenny, the largest base metal mine to be developed in Ireland for 20 years. Owned by Arcon International Resources, the mine is scheduled to produce 70,000 tonnes of low-cost zinc a year.</p>

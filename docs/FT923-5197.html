			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (32): So many willing hands - Luisetta Mudie views Asia's rising stars LAST June, US aircraft manufacturer McDonnell Douglas signed a contract with a Chinese corporation to co-produce 40 commercial jetliners for use by Chinese airlines. This was the largest co-production contract ever signed between China and a US company, and the agreement provides for up to 130 additional jets to be supplied at a future date. The deal is indicative of a wider trend, which has seen leading aerospace companies flocking east to manufacture parts and assemble aircraft, lured by cheaper labour and the promise of soaring demand for passenger aircraft in the region into the next century. Analysts say that deals such as the McDonnell Douglas/CATIC link-up will become more and more commonplace, as fledgling Asian aerospace industries demand the transfer of technology and management know-how in return for low-cost manufacturing and access to an increasingly young and educated workforce. McDonnell Douglas is no stranger to China. Since 1985 the same Chinese company, China National Aero-Technology Import and Export Corporation (CATIC), has delivered 28 MD-80 147-seater passenger jets to Chinese airlines from its plants in Shanghai. China has also landed Dollars 125m worth of business making parts for Boeing 757 and 737 jets. Competition among aerospace giants for joint venture contracts with would-be Asian aircraft manufacturers is stiff, and negotiations are often hampered by such thorny issues as technology transfer and threats to job security back at home. Offset programmes, whereby an agreed amount of offset 'credit' accompanies an order for aircraft, entitle the buyer to supply the agreed value in parts to the aircraft company, and are a common form of agreement. Taiwan has only recently begun to take full advantage of the benefits of offset. Although economically in better shape, it is several years behind most of its neighbours when it comes to attracting lucrative aerospace business. To date there is only a handful of companies currently engaged in production of parts for aircraft. Its home grown fighter plane, the IDF, was largely concocted out of US-modified fighter parts. By contrast, South Korea has aggressively promoted its aerospace industry for more than 15 years, spearheaded by the country's flag-carrier airline, Korean Air. The airline set up its aerospace division in 1976, concentrating at first on manufacture and assembly of aircraft, notably the McDonnell Douglas 500D helicopter for domestic and overseas markets. Daewoo and Samsung have complemented Korean Air's contracts, with the former producing wing and fuselage parts for a range of Boeing jets and the latter engine components for the US's F-16 fighter jet. This last is part of an offset agreement linked to last year's purchase by the South Korean government of Dollars 5bn of F-16s from the US. Taiwan has the technological capability to supply aircraft manufacturers with a range of parts, but a lack of co-ordination among the island's myriad small specialist companies has limited the progress of the aerospace industry. A lack of sophistication in handling aerospace deals has, according to Taiwan Aerospace president Mr Denny Ko, also been a handicap in negotiating a proposal to acquire a Dollars 2bn stake in the commercial aircraft business of McDonnell Douglas. Both the government and the private sector in Taiwan were put off by the ill-health of the Douglas Aircraft commercial sector finances. Taiwan Aerospace's proposal to postpone a direct equity investment and link loans to orders for the MD-12 has left the two sides facing each other over a stalemate. However, 'there are plenty more fish in the sea,' says Mr Ko. Since the deal appeared to founder, both Boeing and British Aerospace have visited Taiwan, both to discuss offset programmes. Boeing recently awarded its first contract to a Taiwan supplier, and is to set up a quality training and testing laboratory on the island, in conjunction with the Taiwan government. Boeing forecasts that China alone will need Dollars 25bn to Dollars 35bn of new jetliners between now and the year 2010. The expanding Asian market will inevitably attract increasing attention globally as the region continues to experience economic growth. The aerospace industry will form a significant part of that growth.</p>

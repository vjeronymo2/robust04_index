			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. MOVES TO IMPROVE TIES TO NICARAGUA  </P> <P> The Bush Administration today moved toward restoring normal relations with  Nicaragua, announcing it will soon lift sanctions, return an ambassador to  Managua and assemble a package of economic aid.  </P> <P> A key lawmaker briefed by President Bush said the package could amount to  hundreds of millions of dollars.  </P> <P> White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the United States is ready to help  at "re-integrating Nicaragua into the international economy."  </P> <P> But, in a message that seemed primarily aimed at the Contra rebels long  supported by the Reagan and Bush Administrations, Fitzwater urged restraint. He  reiterated a U.S. call for an immediate cease-fire "under U.N. supervision and  that it be strictly respected by all sides."  </P> <P> Fitzwater's comments backed up the Administration's message to Contra rebels to  "cool it" and avoid provoking a hostile Sandinista response from loyalists to  defeated President Daniel Ortega.  </P> <P> "We have always anticipated that the resistence would demobilize and repatriate  under conditions of political freedom and personal security," Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> The President's spokesman said the Administration will respond to the changes  in Nicaragua's government with a series of steps designed to normalize  relations.  </P> <P> "We intend to lift economic sanctions soon," he said, referring to a series of  economic and trade sanctions in place since 1985.  </P> <P> While saying he could not give a precise timetable, he added: "We are examining  not only the narrow aspects of U.S. trade sanctions but are looking at the full  range of economic options aimed at re-integrating Nicaragua into the  international economy."  </P> <P> Fitzwater also said that "we would expect to return an ambassador there" and  that "we are looking at U.S. economic assistance."  </P> <P> Although the United States has continued to maintain formal diplomatic  relations with Nicaragua, there has not been a U.S. ambassador in Managua since  1988.  </P> <P> Bush invited President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro to send economic aides  to Washington to discuss the aid package and economic restructuring, Fitzwater  said.  </P> <P> The spokesman also said Bush called former President Ronald Reagan on Monday  night "to acknowledge his years of support for the cause of freedom in  Nicaragua."  </P> <P> Earlier, Bush summoned Democats and Republicans in Congress to the White House  for a briefing by Secretary of State James A. Baker III on the developments.  </P> <P> "The President indicated that there would be a dramatic and swift change in  policy" by the United States, said assistant Democratic leader Alan Cranston of  California. "What we can do in terms of aid depends upon what Congress can find  along with the Administration in a very tight budget situation."  </P> <P> However, Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) said, "You're talking about hundreds of millions  of dollars" over a four- to five-year period.  </P> <P> He suggested creating an "emerging democracy account" in foreign policy aid to  deal with countries emerging from communist or totalitarian rule.  </P></p>

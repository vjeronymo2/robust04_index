			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / UK Company News: BP pulls out of Egypt with Dollars 125m oil disposal BRITISH PETROLEUM said it will pull out of Egypt with the sale, announced yesterday, of its oil production assets to Repsol Exploracion, a subsidiary of the Spanish state oil company, for Dollars 125m (Pounds 69.8m). The sale is part of the company's drive to focus on its core exploration areas and to withdraw from countries where it has failed to reach a critical mass. It follows BP's departure from the Qatar gas project last week. The assets sold include its 33.33 per cent stakes in two oil concessions containing the Ras Budran, Ras Fanar and Zeit Bay fields where BP's share of production is 15,000 barrels a day. BP has been exploring in Egypt for 15 years, but the company was not a significant presence in the country's oil industry. The company has retained its 25 per cent stake in the El Qar'a gas project which is still under development.</p>

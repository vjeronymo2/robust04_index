			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / British Coal reveals loss of Pounds 588m BRITISH COAL warned yesterday that more pits may have to close as it announced losses for last year of Pounds 588m and outlined its most pessimistic prognosis yet for coal sales. Mr Neil Clarke, chairman, said that if electricity generators ran down coal stocks at the rates they had indicated, there would be room in the market for only about 8m tonnes in the next two years. That is less than half than that expected when the coal white paper was published three months ago. In addition Mr Clarke said that sales would be concentrated heavily in 1994-95. 'Unless we can get more sales of coal to generators then some closures will be required,' he said. He would not predict how many, but executives at British Coal believe the corporation will struggle to provide a future beyond the end of this financial year for more than a handful of the 12 pits reprieved in March. Mr Clarke said it was also possible that some of the 12 could replace 19 pits previously considered to be core mines. In the year to March 27, operating profits improved for the third consecutive year, up Pounds 123m to Pounds 545m. But a net profit of Pounds 185m in 1991-92 turned into a Pounds 588m loss as exceptional costs - including providing for pit closures, the loss of 21,000 jobs since October and writing down assets - amounted to Pounds 1.02bn. Turnover fell from Pounds 3.99bn to Pounds 3.88bn. Deep-mine profits rose by Pounds 127m to Pounds 341m. Mr Clarke's forecasts assume that the generators will decrease their stocks from 33m to 10m in the next two years. The scale of British Coal's sales problem is highlighted by the amount of coal being stockpiled at pit heads. Between 150,000 and 250,000 tonnes are being stored each week. Mr Clarke said that 18 companies had paid the Pounds 10,000 bond necessary to allow them to take part in the first stage of the bidding to run 19 pits no longer wanted by British Coal. None was an international mining company. Mr Clarke's salary rose from Pounds 228,900 to Pounds 234,360. Mr Kevan Hunt, employee relations director, said the highest-paid miners were now earning more than Pounds 50,000 a year.</p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: RPM buys coatings concern RPM, the Ohio-based coatings, sealants and adhesives group, has acquired Martin Mathys, a privately owned Belgian coatings company. Terms were not announced. Martin Mathys, which distributes its products in Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands, had sales of Dollars 24m last year. The group also had Dollars 18m cash in the balance sheet, according to Chase Manhattan Bank, its advisers. 'This is an extremely profitable and lean family-owned organisation in a lacklustre sector, enjoying earnings before interest and taxes equivalent in recent years to between 14 and 16 per cent of turnover,' said Mr James Conley, a vice-president at Chase. He said the multiple was much higher than multiples in most recent deals in the industry. The acquisition is RPM's largest so far in Europe. The company already has some industrial operations in Europe, having recently acquired two Rust-Oleum businesses in the Netherlands and France.</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Base metals prices end lower after see-sawing day - Market Report Base metal markets finished a day of see-saw movements largely lower at the London Metal Exchange as prices responded to short-term speculative influences. But traders said markets such as COPPER and ALUMINIUM retained a sound undertone and were ready to retest the upside resistance at which their recent rallies had stalled. London Commodity Exchange robusta COFFEE futures finished near the day's highs on the back of renewed talk about possible frosts in Brazil this weekend. But COCOA prices, which notched up good gains during the morning session, succumbed later to technically-inspired selling. 'There are a few bears out there,' said one trader. 'When cocoa was knocked by selling pressure, the support turned out to be pretty weak.' Compiled from Reuter</p>

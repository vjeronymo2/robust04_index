			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Iraq and UN prepare for oil sale talks IRAQ and the United Nations are expected to resume talks later this week on the possible sale of Dollars 1.6bn worth of Iraqi oil but no definite date has yet been set, a UN spokesman said yesterday, Reuter reports from New York. The spokesman also announced that the UN team would be led by Mr Giandomenico Picco, the assistant secretary-general who led efforts to secure the release of hostages held in Lebanon. Mr Picco, an Italian national, will replace Mr Kofi Annan of Ghana, the assistant secretary-general who headed UN negotiators at previous talks with Iraq in Vienna in January but has since been assigned other duties. The UN announced last Friday that the oil talks would resume this week, but gave no precise date. The announcement followed a meeting between Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, and Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, who had been taking part in a Security Council debate last week on Iraq's alleged failure to comply with council resolutions requiring the scrapping of its weapons of mass destruction. Iraqi sources in Baghdad said earlier yesterday the Vienna talks might begin next week rather than this week, since Mr Aziz had not yet returned home and reported to his government. Iraq is bound by UN economic sanctions imposed after its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. The Security Council last September authorised the sale of Dollars 1.6bn of oil over a six-month period to enable Baghdad to buy nearly Dollars 1bn worth of humanitarian supplies, to begin feeding a UN Gulf war reparations fund, and to pay for the destruction under UN supervision of Iraq's weapons potential. Baghdad has so far rejected the plan on grounds it would be of limited benefit while violating the country's sovereignty. Some council members have expressed readiness to renew the oil sales scheme in some form, after it expires on March 18, but may first wish to await the outcome of the next round of talks in Vienna.</p>

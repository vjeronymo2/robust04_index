			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Siebe paying Pounds 22.7m for two lossmakers Siebe, the international controls group, yesterday unveiled its second acquisition in as many weeks with the announcement of plans to pay Pounds 22.7m in cash for two lossmaking appliance controls companies. Siebe is buying Appliance Controls Technology, with operations in the UK and US, for Pounds 13m and 75 per cent of Eliwell of Italy for Pounds 9.7m. Last month it paid Dollars 90m for Triconex of the US, which makes shutdown systems for the oil and gas industries. Mr Allen Yurko, Siebe's chief executive, said the purchases would strengthen the group's product range. 'They particularly expand our presence in the laundry, dishwasher and refrigeration segments of the market.' Both companies bring some debt, although Siebe would not specify the level. ACT incurred a loss last year of Pounds 700,000 on sales of Pounds 23.1m. Eliwell's losses in the last 12 months were Pounds 500,000 on sales of Pounds 17.1m. Siebe said the losses were largely due to heavy spending by both companies on research and development. The UK company also has the option to purchase the outstanding 25 per cent of Eliwell within three years.</p>

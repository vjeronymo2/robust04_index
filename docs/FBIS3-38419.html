			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Marie-France Cros: "Condemning the Embargo </F> Against Cuba"]    [Text] SP [Flemish Socialist Party], PS [Walloon Socialist  Party], CVP [Christian People's Party], PSC [Social Christian  Party], Ecologist, Agalev [Live Differently] and Volksunie  [People's Union] deputies have submitted a resolution proposal  to the Chamber to object to the U.S. embargo against Cuba,  propose the signing of a general agreement on economic and trade  cooperation with the island, and increase humanitarian aid to  its people.    The proposal stems primarily from foreign policy  considerations. "The U.S. boycott of Cuba no longer has any  reason to exist" at a time when communism has collapsed, believe  the signatories to this proposal. Now that the Soviet Union has  ceased to exist, Cuba's population is the principal victim of  Washington's policy. The embargo "in fact stops Cuba from  developing positively" and, on 24 November 1992, the United  Nations General Assembly (with the exception of the United  States, Israel, and Romania) called for it to be lifted.  <H5>  Our Trade </H5>   But the text submitted to the Chamber is also a response to  domestic considerations. Since 1992, Washington has tightened  its embargo as well as the Torricelli Law, which imposes trading  restrictions on third countries. U.S.-owned or controlled  companies based in Belgium cannot trade with Cuba, which is a  barrier to Belgium's trade and "could even result in a second  embargo on Belgian exports to the United States."    Although the Chamber of Representatives "is concerned by the  human rights situation" in Cuba, it must "increase dialogue with  Cuba at the European level with a view to promoting the process  of reform which has already begun."</p>

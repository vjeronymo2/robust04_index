			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Today was black Wednesday [1 June] for the ruling  coalition in the Senate. The government coalition was divided  over the chairmanships of the parliamentary committees and the  previous negotiated agreements were thrown out the window.  During the contest for the chairmanship of the public works  committee the Northern League voted with the opposition. This  was a bitter blow for the government. Of the 13 committees,  three have gone to the ruling coalition and five to the  opposition. The chairmanships of the other five committees will  be decided tomorrow. Giovanni Masotti will explain exactly what  happened:    [Masotti] Today was a day of upheavals and the unleashed  political earthquake has set alarm bells ringing within the  ranks of the ruling coalition. A summit meeting of the  government parties has been called for this evening. Giulio  Maceratini, the head of the National Alliance Senate grouping,  has called for fresh Senate elections to choose new candidates.  The Senate is the thorn in the side of the ruling government  coalition.    The ruling coalition was unsuccessful in its tactic of  trying  to impose its will on the Senate despite the lack of an overall  majority. Its tactic had, however, worked twice before; first  with the election of the Senate speaker, Carlo Scognamiglio, and  then during the government confidence motion.    Why was the government defeated today? One of the main  factors in the defeat was the creation of a new Senate grouping,  the Democratic Left, which has overturned the numerical balance  and has sown tensions within the ranks of the Freedom Alliance  by accentuating internal divisions. Furthermore, we are in the  middle of an election campaign and stances are becoming more  intransigent.    The strongest evidence of this intransigence came during the  election of the chairman of the highly important public works  and telecommunications committee. For days this committee had  been the object of a showdown between the Northern League and  Forza Italia. In the end the League's candidate, Erminio Bosco,  was elected with the help of the opposition parties. In other  words, all the previous agreements were thrown out of the window.    The same thing happened during the election of the chairman  of the foreign affairs committee. Giovanni Spadolini had  support but yet was unable to obtain the votes of the  opposition--only those of the government. He did not obtain  enough votes and a fresh election will be held tomorrow. The  former speaker of the Senate immediately withdrew his nomination  for the post. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Arts: Today's Television You might have thought that Darwinian evolution would ensure that the utterly credulous were bred out of the human race, yet it does not seem to happen. Today we look on in astonishment as American viewers dutifully post millions to American telly evangelists who splurge it on wine, women and song. People have learned nothing, it seems, since 1830 when preacher John Wroe managed to convince his followers in Ashton-under-Lyne that god had told him to take seven virgins into his household for his 'comfort and succour'. You or I would have said 'Pull the other one, it plays the wedding march' yet, according to the opening episode of Mr Wroe's Virgins, (9.25 BBC2) acquiring his 'helpers' was no trouble at all. Today's episode tells the story of Joanna who wants to be a missionary but is prevented because she is a woman. Two programmes which I missed are repeated tonight: Victoria Wood (8.30 BBC1) is from the 1989 series which were not stand-up routines or skits but rather like single episode sitcoms. Dispatches (9.00 C4) repeats the award-winning programme about children living on the streets of St Petersburg.</p>

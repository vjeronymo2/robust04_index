			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Zdenko Vranjes] </F>   [Excerpt] Following lengthy talks late last night, Croat  and Muslim Bosniak representatives in Gornji Vakuf signed a  final agreement on the release and exchange of POW's on an  all-for-all principle. The implementation of the agreement is  to start tomorrow, when the Muslim side is to release 73  Croatian Defense Council [HVO] members from a prison in the  eastern part of Mostar and 294 Croats from a prison in Bugojno,  while the Croat side will simultaneously release 500 Muslim  detainees from Rodoc near Mostar.    Two Muslim army helicopters that have been kept in  Medjugorje  are to be returned to the Muslim side tomorrow, or after they  have been serviced.    The second part of the agreement envisages that isolated  persons -- civilians -- should be relocated on Tuesday, 22  March. This refers to several hundred Muslims from Rotilje near  Kiseljak and Croats from the French UN Protection Forces  [UNPROFOR] base in Catici near Kakanj. It has been agreed that  on Tuesday the Muslim side should release six POW's from Gornji  Vakuf, while the Croat side should release all prisoners from  Ljubuski, Capljina, Prozor, and a heliport near Mostar.    It has also been agreed that Croat and Muslim  representatives  will meet again on Thursday [24 March], which is the deadline  for the preparation of an exchange of all the POW's held by both  sides in the area of central Bosnia.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 24 Apr (PL) -- It was learned here that  a group of illegal Cuban emigrants, whose boat was rescued two  weeks ago in Mexican waters, tried to escape the Mexican Navy's  custody but were intercepted and returned to port in Isla  Mujeres.    A note issued by the Mexican Navy Secretariat states that  despite the authorities request and all the facilities given  them to continue their trip safely, 62 of the 85 Cubans on the  rescued boat, sailed off toward Miami.    The boat, which sailed "without authorization and in  violation of all dispositions and recommendations that banned  them from departing the port in Isla Mujeres," was intercepted  by the Mexican authorities. During the operation the Cuban boat  collided with a Mexican Navy vessel participating in the  operation.    According to a report by an EL DIA correspondent, as a  result  of the crash, three persons were injured on the Cuban boat,  including a pregnant woman and a child.    Meanwhile, the Navy Secretariat explains that following the  incident, the Cuban boat was returned to Isla Mujeres but that  the occupants chose to remain on board.    "The Mexican authorities reiterated, once again, their  determination to handle the situation in strict compliance with  the law and protecting the human rights of the illegal Cubans,"  the note adds.    The communique stresses that Mexico "cannot allow the boat,  Ferrocemento 25, to sail from Isla Mujeres" and adds that this  decision was made to avoid endangering the lives of the  occupants of the boat, which is not seaworthy.    Before the attempted escape the Mexican authorities had  given  the 85 Cubans permission to remain in Mexico legally for 180  days and to take them to a place where they would be safe and  where they could complete the procedures aimed at definitely  resolving their situation.    However, according to the press, this official offering was  rejected by the group of Cubans who are determined to reach the  United States by boat.</p>

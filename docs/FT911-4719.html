			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / UK Company News: Copymore rises to Pounds 0.9m in worsening conditions PRE-TAX profits at Copymore, the USM-quoted office equipment supplier, rose from Pounds 142,000 to Pounds 931,000 during 1990. Sales improved by Pounds 1m to Pounds 29.52m. Under worsening market conditions, measures to restore profitability included centralising management and administration, tighter controls on working capital and the reduction and restructuring of borrowings. The two small regional dealerships acquired in March 1990 had increased the company's installed base to 22,000 machines. Both traded profitably but the writing down of goodwill reduced retained earnings by Pounds 530,000. Mr Stephen Matthews, chairman, said 'the group remains fundamentally strong and optimistic', having made an encouraging start to the current year. An extraordinary loss of Pounds 225,000 represented the discontinuation of two underperforming business lines. Earnings per share rose from 0.8p to 4.9p. A proposed final dividend of 1.7p leaves the total unchanged at 2.5p. Borrowings at the year-end totalled Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 5.1m).</p>

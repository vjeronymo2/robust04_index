			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 'RAP' VIDEO WEARS AN ORANGE VEST  </P> <P> A new "rap" music video featuring television teen heartthrob Richard Grieco  asks young motorists to drive safely around California Department of  Transportation highway workers.  </P> <P> "Caltrans workers lay their lives on the line every day just so you can cruise  through life in the fast lane," says Grieco, star of "Booker" and "21 Jump  Street" and celebrity spokesman for Caltrans' "Give 'em a Brake" campaign.  </P> <P> Copies of the 4 1/2-minute video, with rap music by "New Choice," a female trio  from Sacramento which recently signed a recording contract with Warner  Brothers, were sent to 1,700 California high schools last August for use in  driver's education classes, Caltrans spokeswoman Tracey Weatherby said.  </P> <P> The video will get its Sacramento premiere Monday night at a comedy club.  </P> <P> Radio and television advertisements based on the video are being produced and  will be shipped to broadcasters over the next several weeks, she said.  </P> <P> "We wanted to speak to the students in their own language about the dangers of  highway work," Weatherby said. "Our main message is to respect and protect our  highway workers and themselves as well.  </P> <P> "Our intention was to speak to them, instead of talking down to them or  preaching to them," she said.  </P> <P> The "Give 'em a Brake" program was started in 1982 after 19 Caltrans highway  workers had been killed in 10 years by errant drivers who strayed into the work  zone.  </P> <P> Since the program's inception seven years ago, five Caltrans workers have been  killed by motorists.  </P> <P> Weatherby said the new video, developed with the aid of the California Assn.  for Safety Educators, will help teach a new generation of drivers to look out  for highway workers.  </P> <P> "We have a captive audience there (in school). They are learning the proper  procedures of driving. If we can teach them, then we'll have a whole new  generation of drivers who will respect the people trying to improve the  conditions of the highway," Weatherby said.  </P></p>

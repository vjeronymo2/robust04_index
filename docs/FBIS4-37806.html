			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 23 Jun (MENA) -- Interior Minister Hasan  al-Alfi has stated that recent achievements by the security  forces in various confrontations with the terrorist and  extremist elements require the security forces to be more  vigilant and to exert greater efforts to achieve the security  and stability sought by society and help with construction and  development.    He said the security bodies have halted the acts of  terrorism  and extremism but have not reached "the final point." He  stressed that the security bodies are determined to uproot the  remnants of the deceived and corrupt elements so as to protect  the homeland and citizens from their evil.    Speaking today at the graduation of the first group of  graduates from the Police Commissioners Academy, the interior  minister said the security forces are not operating alone in  combating terrorism; they are backed by the people's forces and  supported by the masses, who have realized the real nature of  this evil group and what is really going on behind the scenes.    The interior minister said that efforts and achievements  have  been made in other security fields, such as the political and  criminal fields, similar to the achievements in the  confrontation of the elements of terrorism and extremism. He  stressed that the ideological and media confrontation, together  with the courageous security fight, have played an effective  role in exposing these criminal elements to the masses.    He praised the graduates of the Police Commissioners  Academy,  hailing their introduction as a boost to the police presence in  the Egyptian street.</p>

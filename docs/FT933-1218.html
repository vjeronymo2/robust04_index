			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (11): The focus shifts from fraud - Banking supervision / The new challenges facing supervisors JUST as the past five years have proved a turbulent period for banks, in much the same way supervisors have also faced a generous share of challenges. The effects of the biggest upsets - crises of state banking systems in the US, and the closure of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International - are still being felt. Yet, the fact that the main subject to be discussed by international bank supervisors at the IMF/World Bank meetings will be derivative financial products, rather than fraud or loan quality, indicates that they are gradually turning their attention to future rather than past challenges. The Dollars 4 trillion over-the-counter swaps and options market from which banks and securities houses have gained large profits this year exercise supervisors for obvious reasons. There has not yet been a mishap, but the extent of risk is unknown, and derivatives link many financial markets. The problem for bank supervisors is that derivatives are being used by a growing number of companies to hedge their risks. Some risks may simply be eliminated, but others are being taken on by banks. This raises the possibility of the supervisor's worst fear: systemic financial failure. The difficulty for supervisors is twofold. They must assess the systemic risk, and ensure that banks control individual risks. Despite the optimistic tone of the recent G30 report on derivatives, Federal Reserve supervisors in particular have expressed doubts whether banks are wholly in control. The increasing use of derivatives has led to more weight being placed on the capital strength of banks that take on counterparty risk. That builds on a trend established by the Bank for International Settlements in 1988 when it laid down minimum capital adequacy standards for credit risk. Work is still under way by the Basle committee on banking supervision to establish the amount of capital which banks will have to set aside against risks in foreign exchange, securities and derivatives trading. That could add up to a percentage point to the capital held against risk-weighted assets. The protection of the world financial system is the motive offered for such work. But the other reason is the pressure to establish a level playing field between regulatory regimes. There is pressure to level regimes among countries and among financial institutions. The development of a single European market is one factor stimulating harmonisation across borders. A series of EC banking directives will take effect in the next few years, one of the most important being the large exposures directive that could limit some underwriting exposures. However, the BCCI collapse has thrown up tricky problems in harmonising regulation across borders. One is the difficulty of matching standards of who is a fit and proper person to run a bank; the second is the fact that countries have different laws on claims on insolvent banks. The directors of BCCI were clearly not fit to run a bank in hindsight. But drawing up common definitions of competence and probity to apply in different countries with widely varying financial customs is a stiff task. Basle supervisors are now trying to do so, with modest expectations of success. The second problem is that US law regards the parts of an insolvent bank within its borders as separate entities from the core of the bank in another country. This means that US creditors are regarded as having separate claims on the US assets and overseas assets of a bank such as BCCI. European countries, including Britain, treat cross-border insolvent banks as single entities into which all assets are pooled for distribution to creditors. If different countries regard their creditors as having varying rights, this will undermine attempts to harmonise supervision. Apart from these obstacles to cross-border harmonisation, US banks in particular complain that they are hindered by stricter burdens of regulation than other companies. They also chafe at the lack of regulation of institutions such as GE Capital and AT&amp;T, which offer financial services. Discontent at unevenness between the strict supervision of banks and at lack of control over other types of company offering financial services is likely to grow in Europe. This will, in turn, increase the pressure on banking supervisors to justify their activities, and the way they restrict banks. Together with the troubles of national banking systems, and debates about the monetary independence of central banks, this has contributed to questions over whether central banks should combine depositor protection and supervision, or even whether they should carry out the latter. The Federal Reserve has faced criticism from Congress over its supervisory role and calls have been made for it to be hived off; the Bank of England's competence as a supervisor has been attacked over BCCI; in New Zealand, there has been a move to replace supervision with stricter financial disclosure. In contrast, Scandinavian countries have moved to put bank supervision back under the control of central banks rather than separating it under commissions following the region's banking crisis. Central banks are now seen as more reliable observers of systemic risk in the financial system. The new thrust of concern on market rather than credit risk may help central banks to retain supervisory powers because of their oversight of financial systems. But it could also lead to more calls for banking and securities regulation to be harmonised under a single supervisory structure. The barriers to achieving such an aim were illustrated in May when the Basle committee published separate proposals on allocating capital to market risks because it had failed to agree common standards with securities regulators under the International Organisation of Securities Commissions. All this suggests banking supervision may have emerged from crises of credit risk and fraud in the past five years only to face more complex tasks. The rise in the range of products traded on financial markets means supervisors could struggle to keep up.</p>

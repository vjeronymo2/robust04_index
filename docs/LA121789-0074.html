			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PICTURE AND STORY BOOKS;  </P> <P> DISCOVERING OURSELVES IN OTHER PLACES, OTHER TIMES  </P> <P> "Read a story," my mother once told me, "and find out who you are. Or write  one," she added, "for the same reason." What she was talking about was the  strong connection that readers and writers have to story, the connection that  compels you to read or write to find a piece of yourself there somewhere; an  image or smell perhaps that takes you back to another place and another time.  </P> <P> When a book has this "Ah!" factor, you can read it time and again and still  startle yourself with recognition. These six picture books are about  connections, different though they may be: two nonfiction books connect us with  place, two others with time -- we see us ourselves in old tales; another is  about friends, and the last looks at how we become who we are . . . if we're  lucky.  </P> <P> William T. George's Box Turtle at Long Pond (Greenwillow Books: $12.95),  illustrated by Lindsay Barrett George, is a lovely mix of story and information  (I never knew that box turtles couldn't swim!). A simple yet lyrical account of  a day in the life of a box turtle, it begins with a wonderful full-page spread  of the mist-covered pond we soon will explore. We are invited into the small  but dramatic world of the turtle as he survives weather, a curious raccoon and  the rigors of food gathering. The art is so astonishingly detailed that more  than once my hand went out expecting to touch grass, a birch log, or rock. This  book is about connection to place, but it is also about the connections among  the creatures who live at Long Pond.  </P> <P> Jim Arnosky's splendid In the Forest (Lothrop, Lee &amp; Shepard Books: $13.95)  is a portfolio of paintings and text that revere and respect the forest and the  power it has for change. Here are forest secrets revealed (the beaver hidden in  his winter lodge) and kept (the brook disappearing underground, the grouse  camouflaged by a copse). "If you can't find the bird in the painting, I'll  understand," writes Arnosky. "I never would have noticed it myself if it hadn't  flown." Through the conversational narrative and the magnificent oil paintings,  Arnosky's intimate connection to the forest becomes ours. Because of this book  I will walk in my forest with new eyes and ears.  </P> <P> We see ourselves in It's Too Noisy! (Harper/Crowell: $12.95), Joanna Cole's  retelling of an old Jewish folk tale. A farmer lives in a little house with his  noisy family and wishes for peace and quiet. The farmer seeks out a wise man  who wields ancient wisdom to help the farmer to appreciate the loving clamor  that surrounds him. The text is rhythmic, and Kate Duke's numerous watercolor  illustrations evoke a world where much more is happening than words can depict.  While the farmer doubts the Wise Man's words, for instance, the Wise Man's cat  -- just as smart as a cat can be -- smiles reassuringly. My favorites are the  pigs, who, unlike most humans, are wise enough to be as happy at the beginning  of the tale as they are at the end.  </P> <P> Tales of a Long Afternoon (E. P. Dutton: $13.95), Max Bolliger's retelling of  six of Aesop's fables, weaves a fox, a raven, a turtle, a hare, a peacock, a  crow, a dog, and a wise lion and mouse together in a community of friendship,  but not until their very human faults bring out the worst in them. Aesop's  tales have been retold by many, but Jindra Capek's stylized paintings are  especially good at showing their timelessness. The volcano that erupts during  the central conflict smolders at story's end, for instance, showing us that  envy, jealousy and vanity may erupt at any time again. This story will play  itself over and over.  </P> <P> In Margaret Wild's Mr. Nick's Knitting (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich: $12.95), Mr.  Nick and Mrs. Jolley are not only close friends but also kindred spirits --  they both knit. Mr. Nick knits "sweaters, big ones and small ones, for his 22  nieces and nephews, who grew bigger every year," and Mrs. Jolley (the "very  untidy knitter") knitted toys "like hedgehogs and kangaroos, monkeys and  lions." When Mrs. Jolley is ill and lonely, Mr. Nick knows exactly what to do,  as only a thoughtful and imaginative friend would. Dee Huxley's illustrations  glow with color, and there is a wonderful sense of freedom and movement in the  pattern of this book, as if it might have been put together by a joyous  knitter.  </P> <P> Natalie Babbitt has written and illustrated a story that is deceptively simple.  Revealing more with each reading, Nellie: A Cat on Her Own (Farrar, Straus  &amp; Giroux: $11.95) focuses on a marionette cat who lives "in the cottage of  a clever old woman" and only dances when the old woman pulls the strings for  her. Nellie is content -- content enough not to wish for anything more than she  has -- until a worldly cat named Old Tom enters Nellie's life. A free spirit  who knows more about life than Nellie ever knew to ask and is not afraid to say  so, he tells her, "It would be better if you danced all on your own." "I could  never do that," Nellie responds, but when the clever old woman dies, she has no  choice. It is Tom who says what is, for me, the most important line in the  story when he takes away Nellie's strings. "If I don't," said Big Tom, "they'll  get in the way and tangle up."  </P> <P> Connections? After reading "Nellie" I suddenly remembered my adolescent  daughter looking up at me and asking once: "Just when are we grown up anyway?"  Maybe there's still time to give her this book. This story, illustrated by the  author's lovely, serene pictures filled with light, is about the risks and the  joys in growing up to be strong and independent. It is for all ages. And for  all parents.  </P></p>

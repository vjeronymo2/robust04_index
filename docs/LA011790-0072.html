			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NO TIME FOR A TIME BOMB  </P> <P> Bryan's out. Terry's in. And the Washington Capitals go their Murray-Murray  way.  </P> <P> Let's see if I've got this brother-for-brother swap straight. Bryan-the-elder  has one of the 15 best records of any coach in the history of big-time  puck-swatting. He has gotten a once-inept franchise routinely into the National  Hockey League playoffs, though never into May.  </P> <P> The Capitals are oh-for-the-'90s and on an eight-game losing streak, but the  town has not gone after Murray's scalp with any passion. Most of us were  perfectly content with owner Abe Pollin's explanation for the slide:  </P> <P> "When you lose two players, your number one and number two defensemen (Rod  Langway and Scott Stevens), and then Neil Sheehy, it hurts."  </P> <P> Pollin said that five days ago.  </P> <P> Was he pleased with Bryan?  </P> <P> "Sure."  </P> <P> Not pleased-as-punch happy, of course, but seemingly satisfied to the point of  allowing loyal and competent Bryan the courtesy of another run at the playoffs.  Same with most fans.  </P> <P> Bad timing.  </P> <P> Over the weekend, Pollin learned from his main hockey man, General Manager  David Poile, that Bryan is a lousier coach than he or nearly anyone else had  imagined. He agreed with Poile that a firing was in order.  </P> <P> "Fourth worst record in the NHL" slightly more than halfway through the season,  Poile said toward the beginning a recitation of Bryan's bumbling. Twentieth "of  21 in power plays. Not one of our players is near the top of the leaders in  scoring.  </P> <P> "Our strength used to be our goals-against average. ... There is not one thing  we can hang our hat on. There is not one player in the eight-game losing streak  that I can say has come to the front, that has shown any improvement."  </P> <P> Poile was not being mean. His manner while announcing Bryan's firing included  enough staggered breathing to indicate the break with Bryan after seven full  seasons had been difficult. Poile even offered the best perspective on the only  productive coach the team has known:  </P> <P> Bryan "has contributed as much ... as any other person or player who has played  or been a part of this organization. In '82-83, his first full season, the  mandate was to make the playoffs or this franchise would be history. Bryan  Murray was the coach who led the Caps into the playoffs."  </P> <P> So Bryan saved the franchise.  </P> <P> That and 343 regular-season victories have earned him an enormous amount of  goodwill. Still, after each of the last few seasons, the Capitals failed to  fulfill expectations in the playoffs, and Bryan's future as coach was  questioned.  </P> <P> No one would have been surprised had Poile fired Bryan after the team lost to  the fourth-place Flyers in the first round of the playoffs last year.  </P> <P> Instead of bouncing Bryan, Poile gave him a two-year contract.  </P> <P> Slightly more than seven months into that contract, Poile uses his hook. In  Washington, all that matters is the playoffs. When the wounded mend, the team  could begin a serious surge. Even failing to repeat as Patrick Division  champions might not be all that bad.  </P> <P> Why?  </P> <P> Well, the New Jersey Devils finished fourth in the division two years ago and  skated into the conference finals during the playoffs; the Flyers repeated that  feat last season. Chicago was another fourth-place team that got hot late and  made the conference finals in the playoffs.  </P> <P> As to how even one injury can cripple a team, Pollin need look no further than  his own basketball team. With John Williams, the Bullets are a playoff team  capable of finishing proudly on the plus side of .500; without Williams, the  Bullets are scarcely better than the NBA's expansion babies.  </P> <P> Should Wes Unseld be fired?  </P> <P> No way.  </P> <P> One devoted Capitals fan the other day said he hoped Bryan would allow the  injured players to move into the lineup slowly, so as to give the youngsters a  chance at the maximum experience and put as many fresh legs as possible onto  the playoff ice.  </P> <P> Except for Poile, patience was the prevailing attitude.  </P> <P> "You deal a lot with your instincts," Poile said. "What you see. How you feel.  How you think people are improving or not improving. And you make a decision."  </P> <P> Poile talked about his hardest conversation in sport: "When you trade a player,  at least he has a contract and he's going to another team. What I was saying to  Bryan Murray was: 'You no longer have a job.' "  </P> <P> If Bryan must go, why is Terry-the-untested the correct replacement? All Terry  did, it seems here, was learn close to everything about the sport from Bryan.  </P> <P> "There is a substantive difference in the two people," Poile said. "In manner  and coaching philosophy."  </P> <P> Terry has been terrific in two seasons with the minor-league Skipjacks,  successful with younger players against teams stocked with veterans who ought  to be superior at that level.  </P> <P> One reason for the strange switch might be called the Quadruple Bang Theory.  Most changes jump-start most teams for a while; by that time, Terry will have  had time to implement his style; then Langway and the others will be at full  strength; shortly, the playoff adrenaline will kick in.  </P> <P> Poile admitted "tremendous risk" with his move and added: "This is not an exact  science. At the end of the year, you could be writing it was the wrong  decision. It was my decision ... a tough call."  </P> <P> Over and over, Poile talked about timing, about the time and place having to be  right to bring a new coach behind the bench. Poile now has put his neck on the  line as never before, it says here, because timing on this one was terrible.  </P></p>

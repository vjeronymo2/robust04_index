			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Letter: Who will pay for education? Sir, One of the many questions not even raised in the recent Government White Paper on the future of the education service, 'Choice and Diversity', is the relationship of the council tax to expenditure on education. The government clearly envisages the eventual demise of local education authorities. The Funding Agency for Schools will largely take over the LEA function. Who will then be responsible for raising the council tax to finance its part of the education service? Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary, NASUWT, 5 King Street, London WC2</p>

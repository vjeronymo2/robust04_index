			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Stanislav Sergeyevich Shatalin, </F> president of the International Reform Fund and academician  secretary of the Russian Academy of Sciences Economics  Department, by Sergey Lomakin; from the "Utro" program -- live]    [Text] [Lomakin] Now as I warned you earlier, our guest is  Stanislav Sergeyevich Shatalin, president of the International  Reform Fund and academician secretary of the Russian Academy of  Sciences Economics Department. The topic of our discussion, of  course, is the report prepared by the Reform Fund and the  Russian Academy of Sciences Economics Department, which is  entitled "Social and Economic Transformation in Russia: The  Contemporary Situation and New Approaches." As I understand it,  it is an analysis of the past two years and a forecast for  actions in the future.    [Shatalin] Yes, indeed, the report analyses what has  happened during the past two years and makes the initial  conclusions, that the tasks set by the government to reform our  economy have not been fulfilled. I would like to be understood  correctly. We -- I mean myself, naturally, and my colleagues  and work comrades -- are all supporters of a market economy.  These are not empty words and so I totally reject any labels in  this regard. Problems about changing to a market economy do not  exist. This must be understood once and for all. Nobody  supports a retreat and there is no going back.    In this sense, as we see it, our report gives a fairly  concentrated view of [words indistinct]. What do they consist  of? We declare -- or demand if you wish -- that there needs to  be a distinctive public agreement, a social agreement, between  all levels of society on the social cost of the reforms. There  must be parameters, such social indicators as living standards;  spending on science, on health, on culture, on education; the  employment level; and other parameters which any reformer in  carrying out any policy, be it a monetary or nonmonetary or  supra-monetary policy, must not exceed. He must...    [Lomakin, interrupting] In other words, something must be  immutable.    [Shatalin] Something needs to be like a wall which cannot be  destroyed. It is a limit within the framework of which you have  a right to act. Do everything else you want, reform the  economy, but this is the boundary which cannot be crossed.    We consider that the people should be told honestly and  frankly what will happen and when, without deceit, in a sober  and calm way. I cannot say that we have said everything, but  nevertheless we have outlined the main contours of economic  development. We support the creation of a socially oriented  economy. This is not demagoguery. This kind of economy was  created by (Ludwig Herford) and economies of this kind exist in  Europe and beyond. This is a highly efficient economy and in  terms of its motivation and development vectors, so to speak, it  is aimed at putting people at the forefront, at ensuring a  social orientation and motivation. In other words, we would  have an economy which clearly works to improve the standard of  living and which organically combines economic efficiency and  social justice.    It is extremely difficult to find a balance between these  two  facets. The world has searched for it as have entire  civilizations. Europe, Sweden, Austria, France, and Great  Britain are searching for it. And in this, everything depends  on professionalism, not on ideological affiliations.  Professionalism permits the fusion of economic efficiency with  social justice. We support the idea of adequate government  intervention, intervention which distinguishes between various  spheres. The agrarian sector is one thing while financial and  credit policy is another. Pricing policy is one thing while  taxation issues are another. There are also foreign economic  relations, and so forth. Adequate solutions must be found in  various spheres and these are mechanisms of government  regulation of the economy.    We oppose revolution. Enough. Whoever it is, I do not want  to name any names now. I do not want to associate the reforms  being carried out in Russia with any names. This is not the  crux of the problem. The crux of the problem lies essentially  in what we are doing. What we began doing in 1992 is, if you  wish, a new revolution. Berdyayev, who I am very fond of, said  that revolutions are never successful. The course of the  economic revolution in Russia during the past two years shows  that Russia's latest revolution has not been successful.    [Lomakin] Excuse me, I have to interrupt you since we do  not have all that much time, but I have a question which I am  simply obliged to ask you. I have the Saturday, 29 January  issue of IZVESTIYA and its front page headline reads: Gorbachev  Era Economic Advisers Propose Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin a New  Life in the Old Style. It deals with your report, prepared by  Stanislav Sergeyevich Shatalin, Abalkin, and Petrakov, but to  put it mildly very little of your report comes through here. So  this is the first criticism to be leveled at it. Have you  published your report anywhere? Have you read this article?    [Shatalin] Yes, I have read it. My colleagues showed it to  me today after their Sunday day off. It includes a lot of lies  and distortions. It says that IZVESTIYA was the first to get  this report. This is a lie. The first real copy of this  report, not a manuscript of the report, was received by Russian  Federation President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin on Friday, 28  January. Yesterday we sent this report to the Russian  Government. The report was sent to the Federal Assembly and we  plan to send it to all the papers, and so forth. I do not know  how IZVESTIYA managed to get this report.    Moreover, you know, there is another unpleasant side to  this.  This kind of criticism immediately gives the discussion an  unbusinesslike tone. After all, we are talking about problems  which are vitally important to Russia and the people and this  kind of criticism does not help a calm discussion of the  problems. It creates a neo-Bolshevist tone. I would say that  rather than write Gorbachev Era Economic Advisers Propose  Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin a New Life in the Old Style, they  should have written Enemies of the People Propose Yeltsin and  Chernomyrdin a New Life in the Old Style. It would have given  it more sting, right? It is understandable, because this kind  of newspaper is already calling us enemies of the people.    Since you mention IZVESTIYA, I will add that previously I  respected it very highly and the journalists and staff who work  there too. You know that, unfortunately, now more and more  newspapers...[pauses] I have forgotten its name. Previously it  was DEN, now it is called POZAVCHERA [DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY], I  cannot remember, or POSLEZAVTRA [DAY AFTER TOMORROW]. I cannot  remember exactly. This does not do the paper any credit.    I do not know how my colleagues will react to this  criticism,  that is their problem. I am not at all surprised that certain  names are being bandied around. The main thing is that this  kind of statement is an obstacle to the real task.    [Lomakin] Stanislav Sergeyevich, would it not be better to  wait until the specialists actually read the report and become  familiar with it, until the president has familiarized himself  with the report and the government and parliamentary deputies  familiarize themselves with it, and then discuss it. I think  that this would be the normal course of action.    [Shatalin] This is precisely what we expect. We are not  monopolists. We write about this honestly. We do not have a  monopoly on the truth and nobody else does. We support a really  calm, professional discussion of this report without any  political hysterics and, if there is anything sensible in it,  that can promote the beginning of a real market reform of our  economy, personally I would only be happy.    [Lomakin] I am sure that is exactly what will happen.  Stanislav Sergeyevich Shatalin, academician and president of  the International Reform Fund. Today we talked about the report  which this fund, together with the Russian Academy of Sciences  Economics Department, has presented to the top people in our  state for discussion. Thank you.    [Shatalin] Thank you.</p>

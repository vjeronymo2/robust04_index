			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Beijing Political Situation" column article by Jen Hui-wen </F> (0117 1979 2429) on 8 June in Beijing: "Strategic Differences  Within the State Council on the Issue of Returning to GATT"]    [Text] China has set two major objectives for its foreign  trade and economic relations this year. One is to win extension  of the most-favored-nation status from the United States, and  the other is to strive to restore China's contracting status in  GATT (called "returning to GATT" hereafter). At present, the  first objective has been achieved. As for returning to GATT,  Tong Zhiguang, vice minister of foreign trade and economic  cooperation who has represented China to attend the relevant  talks many times, said in March that China might return to GATT  by August on the grounds that the planned economic structure,  which used to be the greatest obstacle to China's return to  GATT, was no longer a problem after the establishment of the  socialist market economic system was written into the PRC  Constitution. Moreover, China has adopted a series of measures  to reform its foreign trade system. Beginning this year, the  system of assigning mandatory business quotas was terminated,  and the system of assigning export quotas and licenses has also  been replaced with a system of tender invitation. Import duties  have been gradually lowered, and the overall foreign trade  system has basically met GATT requirements. China has basically  built up the framework for returning to GATT. However, in late  May, Peter Sutherland, GATT director-general, said that it would  be possible for China to return to GATT by 1 January next year,  but this would still be an extremely difficult task because the  decisive power is in the hands of other signatory states to GATT  and the time for China's return to GATT will be decided  collectively.    China has spent eight years applying for a return to GATT.  Certain progress was made in this regard, but the process was  full of twists and turns. The issue thus once again aroused a  debate inside the State Council. The debate was focused on  whether China should strive to return to GATT at any costs.    According to sources in Beijing, when talking about the  issue  of returning to GATT at a meeting of responsible officials in  late May, Vice Premier Li Lanqing said that China now still  cannot return to GATT not because China has not made sufficient  preparations but because the United States is putting up  obstructions for political reasons; China must not give up the  principle of "balanced rights and duties" in order to return to  GATT. He said: "In order to return to GATT, China has done all  that it should to meet GATT requirements in terms of  institutional structures and operational regulations. China  still cannot return to GATT not because China is still short of  any hard and soft conditions. It is because the United States  deliberately makes things difficult for China according to its  political strategy and imposes harsh terms on China. Some West  European countries also follow the United States. It seems that  we were too optimistic about returning to GATT in the previous  period. Now we should more calmly consider this issue, and see  which measures are unrealistic and out of keeping with our  national conditions and which measures may expose our country to  unnecessary impact after returning to GATT. We should be better  aware of all this and make corrections in order to prevent  losses we should not incur.    Zou Jiahua, another vice premier of the State Council, also  pointed out that although it is still necessary to create  conditions for returning to GATT at an early date, we cannot and  also should not make any promise we cannot fulfill at the  current stage; still less can we behave like a supplicant  begging for favors. He said that according to what he learned  from his visit to the United States in May, after returning to  GATT, China's machine-building, car-making, textile, and  food-processing industries may be facing new difficulties, so  they should take sufficient precautions and countermeasures  against the unfavorable factors.    Some people in economic and trade circles in Beijing said  that in the process of returning to GATT, China must seek the  common point (or compromise point) between the demands of  existing GATT contracting parties and China's acceptability  degree. The remarks of the two vice premiers, Li Lanqing and  Zou Jiahua, show that China would, as usual, continue to adhere  to the principle of "balanced rights and duties," and would  never pay any costs in exchange for the return to GATT. If  other contracting parities set forth unusual, discriminatory,  and harsh terms for China's return to GATT, China will certainly  make no compromise and adhere to its own position. In reality,  the process of China's return to GATT is contingent on the  political environment more than on the negotiations. When China  clearly sees the other side's demands, it will come to  understand that it cannot be overanxious for a quick result and  should only try to gradually knock open the door for the return  to GATT through making steady progress.    According to sources, Zhu Rongji, member of the Standing  Committee and the CPC Central Political Bureau and also vice  premier of the State Council, held that China should still  actively create conditions for returning to GATT. In early  March, Zhu Rongji instructed Chen Jinhua, minister of the State  Planning Commission, Wang Zhongyu, minister of the State  Economic and Trade Commission, and Wu Yi, minister of foreign  trade and economic cooperation, to jointly draft an outline  about the main problems and measures for China's return to GATT  in 1994 in order to submit the outline to the State Council for  deliberation after the end of the Second Session of the Eighth  National People's Congress.    Zhu Rongji's main viewpoint  was: The return to GATT will provide more favorable conditions  for China's across-the-board opening and involvement in fair and  free trade and business competition, and this will also remove  the political obstacles set by the United States and Western  Europe to China's foreign trade. Moreover, the cost of  returning to GATT within this year will be smaller than that in  two or three years. Therefore, China should continue to strive  to return to GATT at an early date. For this purpose, China may  now act according to GATT rules, and should overcome  difficulties in adapting domestic systems to them. In order to  return to GATT, China may first make certain compromises. The  concessions will serve the purpose of gaining greater benefit.    According to sources, Zhu Rongji's opinion on returning to  GATT as soon as possible was supported by CPC General Secretary  Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng, who is also a member of the  Standing Committee of the CPC Central Political Bureau, and was  also supported by many experts in GATT affairs.    In Beijing, an expert in GATT affairs said that Zhu Rongji's  idea was reasonable. If China makes certain concessions and  carries out reforms in certain fields where conditions are not  ripe enough for the purpose of returning to GATT, this will  force the United States to show its hand on the issue of China's  return to GATT. China will then be able to know its real  intention, and will adjust its industrial structure and better  orient its reforms in the fields of foreign trade and customs  tariff to the world practice. Thus, even if China cannot return  to GATT within this year, it will have better internal  conditions for returning to GATT next year. It will then be  more difficult for the United States and its Western followers  to find any excuses.    As for the United States using political factors to make  things more difficult for China, the expert said this was a  bargaining tactic that the United States would certainly use.  If China is too inflexible and thus enables Taiwan to be  admitted to GATT ahead of China, then the political factors will  become more complicated.    China may be facing the impact of its return to GATT in  various realms. For example, the growth rate of the national  economy may be slowed down, basic industries may be affected,  the number of jobless people may increase, China's renminbi  currency may be further devalued, and the shortage of foreign  exchange worsen. The expert said that one should not overreact  to such problems, because they will also appear even if China  postpones its return to GATT one or two years. It is better  that the pains come earlier than later. China may promote its  reform and development through the return to GATT.    The expert stressed that precisely proceeding from such  strategic considerations, China announced the termination of  issuing import licenses and quotas to 195 commodities on 25 May  after it announced the termination of import control over 283  commodities. This not only showed China's sincerity for  returning to GATT, but also pushed Chinese enterprises to the  forefront of the international competition. China will have a  stronger bargaining position in the talks on its return to GATT.  If the United States allows China to return to GATT earlier,  China may lower the tariffs earlier; on the contrary, China's  tariffs will not be lowered and the American goods will find it  hard to enter the Chinese market.    The expert added: China's relations with GATT and the future  World Trade Organization are two-way relations. That is, China  needs them, and they also need China. China can now survive  without the support of the world's free trade organization. In  such circumstances, if the United States does not make positive  responses and adopt a realistic approach, it will certainly be  facing heavy pressure from American business circles and be  asking for trouble.</p>

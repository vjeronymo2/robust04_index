			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> SCHOOL CLINIC ISSUE DESERVES RECHECKING  </P> <P> From what I have observed thus far, the Nintendo computer game system comes  with a more comprehensive set of instructions and programs than parents and  educators acquire with children. In Nintendo, guidelines are tidy and clearly  mapped out, and the player needs only to comply with the instructions to  perform skillfully.  </P> <P> Oh, were it only so with parenting and education. With innumerable variables  such as personality, behavior, intelligent quotient and economic factors,  decisions affecting children become so much more onerous. Every decree must be  weighed carefully and eventually re-evaluated when the timing is suitable. When  the issues immersed in the judgment are emotional and controversial, time bears  an important role in determining when best to approach the topic again.  </P> <P> "Time crumbles things; everything grows under the power of time and is  forgotten through the lapse of time," Aristotle wrote.  </P> <P> Almost three years have elapsed since the San Diego Unified School District  considered establishing health-care clinics at some high schools. Funded by a  private foundation, the centers would have been staffed by professionals who,  depending on the program adopted by the district, would provide physical  examinations, immunizations, counseling and birth control information.  </P> <P> The district appointed a committee of 30 people from business, educational,  health and religious sectors to listen to the public's opinion, examine the  needs of the community, study similar programs in other school districts and  make a recommendation to the school board. The committee made a favorable  recommendation to the school district.  </P> <P> The board considered the recommendation of the committee, listened to more  community debate and assessed that the public was unwilling to accept the role  of the school district in this form of health care.  </P> <P> But after three years, and two new board members, it's time to reconsider  issue.  </P> <P> It is fitting to bury the anger and emotional drama that accompanied the idea  of school-based health clinics and approach the topic again in a caring milieu.  Sufficient time may have passed to allow the various interest groups to  approach the issue with facts, and without the distraction of emotion.  </P> <P> The school district will now have more data to present to the community.  Educators can interpret the effectiveness of similar programs in parallel  communities. Does there still appear to be a need for the clinics in San Diego?  </P> <P> Three years will have allowed religious factions to show how the alternative  programs they suggested have been implemented and whether they have met the  needs of adolescents.  </P> <P> Three years will have given the medical community and affiliated groups an  opportunity to relate how their programs have dealt with the issue of  adolescent medicine.  </P> <P> And, in three years, the legions of adolescents and parents will have grown,  affording another group an opportunity to study and discuss the issue.  </P> <P> Now is the time for the parents who supported the clinic to determine if their  reasoning was accurate. Do they have specific examples where health care on  campus might have helped a teen-ager? Moreover, it is an occasion for the  parents who opposed the program to render their opinions. May we hear again  from the mother of the ninth-grader who saw no need for such support. How have  the subsequent years influenced her conviction?  </P> <P> And this mother of four, who now has two high school students? How have the  three years affected my views? Bobby McFerrin, the Grammy nominee, sings to me,  "Don't worry, be happy," my dear friend tells me to pray more, but I am not  calmed by what I read, hear or see.  </P> <P> Am I alone in my belief that, although we counsel our children, preach to them,  monitor their activities and love them, we still need and benefit from the  assistance of other professionals?  </P> <P> Three years later, like other parents, I am chanting "say 'no' " to drugs and  alcohol, capitalizing on the merits of abstinence with regard to teen-age sex,  stressing good nutrition and asking that wet towels not be left on the bedroom  floors. Yet, I am still finding wet towels on the bedroom floors.  </P> <P> I have sat with the anxious friend whose daughter had anorexia nervosa and  wondered about other young people. I have heard of the football player who  works at gaining weight or the wrestler who attempts to lose weight to wrestle  in a different weight class. While discussing vitamins, nutritional supplements  and diuretics, I observe adolescents consuming mass quantities of nachos and  diet soda.  </P> <P> I have heard the whispered talk of the young girl who needed an abortion and  questioned how this might have been prevented.  </P> <P> I have delivered the liturgical reading at the funeral of the friend who died  from AIDS and prayed that I would not have to see another mother's anguish.  </P> <P> I have applauded the PE teacher who introduced the topic of scoliosis and  discovered the young girl's advanced case. I have been told of the curious  teen-ager, who, after studying the circulatory system in a science class, had  his blood pressure checked at a local shopping center. Three days later,  cardiac surgery saved his life. How many others?  </P> <P> And I have winced in the midst of a discussion about the child admitted to a  drug and alcohol treatment program as another parent quipped, "Well, I know  that none of my teen-agers would ever use drugs or drink alcohol."  </P> <P> I have seen teen-agers weep over the suicide of a friend and watched parents  and teachers question how they might have helped.  </P> <P> The re-evaluation of school-based, health clinics in the San Diego Unified  School District. It's time.  </P></p>

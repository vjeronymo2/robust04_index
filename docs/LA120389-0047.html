			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOGS NEED LOVE, AFFECTION TOO  </P> <P> Reading that Robert Fulghum ("King of Kindergarten," Nov. 26) profoundly hates  dogs was a shocker.  </P> <P> He is in a position to influence. I hope he isn't trying to spread the hatred,  because my dog's companionship and affection have made my life contented.  </P> <P> The article mentions his bouts of depression. He needs a dog.  </P> <P> ARTHUR PEARSON, Seal Beach  </P></p>

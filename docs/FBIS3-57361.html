Is That Not a Lot?"]    [Text] On 21 January before leaving for the electoral  districts, State Duma deputies demonstrated what seemed to me to  be two important qualities which they have acquired in two weeks  in parliament: the ability to wage a factional struggle and an  unexpected capacity for compromise.    ...There were two apparently separate questions to be  resolved: the approval of the composition of the Geopolicy  Committee and the vote on the inclusion of deputy Andrey Makarov  in another committee -- the Committee on Legislation. Both  questions were put to the ballot the day before. Then there was  a proposal to vote on both questions as a package: We scratch  your back, you scratch ours.    I would venture to suggest that this spectacle was not  without a certain drama. Suffice it to say that the words  "motion carried" were heard only after...the fourth vote. The  breakthrough was achieved in the following manner. Initially  Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the chamber who was conducting the  session, admonished the deputies, and not for the first time:  This attempt to bamboozle one another will get nowhere. He was  followed by Vladimir Volfovich who said: If you do not approve  the Geopolicy Committee, what compromise will its nonexistent  members be able to make?    Subsequent events disproved the well known saying that might  makes right. Thanks to some maneuvering the factions were able  to elaborate a package of proposals on cadre questions and  furthermore, according to Deputy Viktor Zorkaltsev, deputy  chairman of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation  Central Executive Committee, they will be able to agree on  specific draft laws.    This idea was graphically illustrated by a second episode at  the session. This was a discussion of a State Duma statement on  events in Yugoslavia. When the session rejected the proposal by  Yevgeniy Ambartsumov, member of the International Relations  Committee, to postpone it until consultations are held with  representatives of the Foreign Ministry, the question raised  then was what version of the statement should be adopted: The  one proposed by the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, the  Communist Party of the Russian Federation, and the Agrarian  Party of Russia or the version offered by Vladimir Lukin,  chairman of the International Relations Committee? Here again  the democrats demonstrated an exceptional tactical flexibility.  Initially they adopted Lukin's proposal with a paragraph from  from the alternative draft on lifting the economic blockade  against Yugoslavia. But then they prevented the inclusion in  the statement of a paragraph proposed by a representative of the  Liberal Democratic Party of Russia demanding the withdrawal of  the UN forces from Yugoslav territory.    I asked Gennadiy Burbulis, a "Russia's Choice" deputy,  whether the interfactional squabbling will not be a hindrance to  legislative activity and he stated with the utmost clarity:  There is every reason for separating the political struggle,  which is inevitable in the State Duma, from the pragmatic  activity of a parliament consisting of professionals.    There is one final event in the State Duma's life which has  done very little to establish an image for it that is different  from that of the former Supreme Soviet. The majority lacked the  strength to resist some tempting privileges.    They should not complain from the rostrum about the lack of  objectivity of the press which latched onto Deputy A. Volkov's  rejected amendments. Yes, they rejected a remuneration of  $3,000 and a personal car equipped with a radio. However, at  the suggestion of S. Baburin, who remembers past privileges,  they returned to the automobile question and awarded themselves  a car each but without a radio.    Meanwhile, at the same session objections were raised to the  expansion of State Duma structures. Nevertheless, in addition  to the State Duma secretariat, which includes the apparatuses of  the committees, the offices of the chairman and deputy chairmen,  the State Duma conference, and so forth, the apparatuses of the  factions and groups of deputies not belonging to the Secretariat  will also provide backup for the deputies' work. Furthermore,  each deputy can provide himself with a whole staff of assistants  -- up to five people. And all this is at the taxpayer's  expense....</p>

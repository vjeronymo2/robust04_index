			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Enlarged Perkins Foods tops Pounds 24m PERKINS FOODS, the acquisitive produce, frozen and chilled food group, yesterday announced a 34.4 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 24.3m for 1991 and the purchase of Rowleys Frozen Foods for up to Pounds 5.9m. Fully diluted earnings rose by a more modest 15.5 per cent to 11.9p. After reporting a 47 per cent rise in half year profits to Pounds 10.5m, growth slowed in the second half. Mr Michael Davies, chairman, said that although economic conditions were weak, demand for food remained strong and he looked for-ward to 'another successful year'. Mr Howard Phillips, chief executive, said that organic profits growth - which he definded as excluding acquisitions made in 1991, though not those in 1990 - had been 9 per cent. He said that Perkins was no longer an acquisition-led company, and even without takeovers earnings growth would be above average. Group sales were 32.7 per cent higher at Pounds 260.1m. Interest receivable was Pounds 2.7m (Pounds 2.9m) but Mr Ian Blackburn, finance director, said there would be an interest charge in the current year as the group moved into a net debt position. The tax rate fell to 30.5 per cent (32.2 per cent) but Mr Blackburn said this would rise again in the current year. The fresh produce division increased sales by 17 per cent to Pounds 114.9m, but operating profits grew by 7 per cent to Pounds 7.6m. Mr Phillips said that earn-outs on acquisitions in the division had ended in 1990 and been replaced by bonuses for managers. There was a sharp fall in profits from the mushroom division for the second year running, to Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 1.6m) because of pricing pressure in canned mushrooms. Profits from frozen foods rose 88 per cent to Pounds 10.7m helped by acquisitions made at the end of 1990. Chilled foods profits were also boosted by acquisitions, rising 71 per cent to Pounds 4m. The purchase of Rowleys involves an initial payment of Pounds 600,000 of which Pounds 200,000 is in cash and the rest in convertible DM preference shares. Up to Pounds 5.3m more will be payable depending on future profits, and this will be met through the issue of ordinary shares. A final dividend of 2.6p makes a 4.3p (3.8p) total. COMMENT It is wise to be sceptical about companies such as Perkins, after the experience of Albert Fisher and its likes. On the positive side, its relatively short history has been a tale of good earnings growth with few hiccups. Where things have gone wrong - such as with mushrooms - the problems have been containable. However, the earn-out deals have left a series of potential time bombs in terms of deferred consideration, involving share issues and the DM convertibles. Some of the costs of acquisitions have been neatly tucked away below the line in the preference dividends. There are further troubles to come if every earn-out has to be replaced by bonuses to keep the acquired management. Pre-tax profits this year might reach Pounds 30m, but between a higher tax rate and more shares in issue, earnings per share may only grow by about 11 per cent. A prospective p/e of 11 1/4 is not generous to Perkins, but a premium rating has yet to be earned.</p>

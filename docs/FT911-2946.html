			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Observer: Deja vu Meanwhile Sir Jeremy Morse confesses that Lloyds Bank's losses on Harry Goodman's International Leisure were the worst since the collapse of Clarence Hatry's empire in 1929. If only more senior bankers had such past mistakes indelibly inscribed in their memory, clearing bank shares would be a much better investment. Lloyds had a Pounds 2.2m exposure to Hatry, a 1920s wheeler dealer, and ended up losing just Pounds 620,000. Lloyds' official history concludes that at a time of buoyant stock market activity more could have been done to determine borrowers' worth. 'Yet it is not always easy to devise procedures that are completely foolproof against rogues, clever and cunning in their deception.' The sums of money lost may get bigger, but the excuses still sound the same.</p>

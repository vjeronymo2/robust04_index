			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London's robusta COFFEE fell steadily in the morning after opening down as expected against New York, which fell steeply on Friday. When the New York market again found the going sticky on its opening yesterday, London's May contract briefly tested a new recent low at Dollars 870 a tonne before retrieving Dollars 872 per tonne - its bottom of two weeks ago. There was some confusion over the likely impact of any failure of the ICO talks on a new international coffee pact, due to finish tomorrow, to reach agreement. Base metals edged away from earlier lows during afternoon LME trading, although prices mostly closed lower, reflecting overall depressed sentiment. Dealers said three-month COPPER continued to hold just above Dollars 2,160 a tonne, but was loth to push much higher, following Friday's technical breakdown. News that mining sources in Zaire expect the country's 1993 copper output to fall to 80,000 tonnes, compared with Gecamines earlier forecasts of 150,000 tonnes, had little impact as European traders are used to irregular supplies from Zaire.

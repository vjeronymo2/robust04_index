Chen Xitong,  secretary of the municipal party committee and Mayor Li Qiyan  gave important speeches.    Recently, some citizens have noticed the rise in the prices  of grains and cereal oil and some grain shops have failed to  guarantee normal supply. The municipal party committee and  government have paid great attention to this and have promptly  adopted measures and devised plans.    In a speech, Li Qiyan pointed out: Pricing is a major issue,  affecting the immediate interests of the masses and the smooth  progress of reform, which we must give great attention. The  grain and pricing departments and all districts must  conscientiously implement the central guidelines and immediately  adopt economic and necessary administrative means to stabilize  the prices of grains, cereal oil, vegetables, meat, and eggs.  It will be good for the overall situation and stability when  prices are stable. The grain departments should have a sense of  the overall situation, do their work well on their own  initiative, and should not only consider the interests of their  own departments and trades. At present, some state grain shops  have taken the lead in raising grain prices. This is a very  serious problem that must be checked. He stressed: To develop  the socialist market economy, the government grain and cereal  oil management departments and state enterprises should have  something to do. They must conduct macroeconomic regulation and  control and give play to their role as the main channels. Some  comrades are confused about this, so they must seek unity in  ideology and understanding. All departments and various  districts and counties should make concerted efforts, adopt  practical measures, effectively stabilize the commodity prices,  keep abreast of the market information and grass-roots situation  in a timely manner, and guarantee that the masses will have a  happy new year and Spring Festival.    Executive Vice Mayor Wang Baosen also gave a speech in which  he noted: At present, there is an ample supply of grains,  cereal oil, and other commodities across the municipality and  the market supply will be guaranteed. State-run grain and cereal  oil departments should give play to their role as the main  channels. Meanwhile, the municipal authorities will adopt  resolute measures; implement strict measures to set the prices  of grains, cereal oil, vegetables, meat, and eggs, which are  essential for residents; and will sell some major variety of  vegetables at a fixed price. The marketing unit must strictly  implement these measures and the relevant departments must  strengthen inspection and strictly investigate, handle, and  expose those units that recklessly raise prices.    In his speech, Chen Xitong stressed: The socialist market  economy must have a sound macroeconomic regulation and control  system. We must seek unity in the understanding of this.  Leaders at all levels and all departments must conscientiously  study the decisions of the central authorities on some issues  concerning the establishment of the socialist market economic  system and never forget their own functions in macroeconomic  regulation and control. These arbitrary price increases in some  units are absolutely man-made. Now that the grain reserves are  abundant, the production is fine, and the purchasing situation  is good, what makes them increase prices? This is caused by  their abnormal market prediction psychology. Some grain  departments failed to promptly adopt measures to keep the prices  stable and misunderstood the meaning of market economy. They  believed that decontrolling the grain prices means not  interfering with the prices regardless of the consequences and  that market regulation and control means following the beaten  track. All these understandings are wrong. The socialist  market economy is not a nongovernment economy, but one with  macroeconomic regulation and control. This practice is a good  chance for study. We should learn how to successfully conduct  macroeconomic regulation and control in the course of developing  the socialist market economy.    Chen Xitong pointed out: We should combine reform with  stability; give simultaneous attention to reform, development,  and stability; and guard against one-sidedness. Arbitrary price  hikes will affect other sectors, the stable situation, and the  good environment. Beijing is the capital. All departments,  districts, and counties should have the sense of the capital,  consider the overall situation, make concerted efforts, adopt  effective measures, stabilize the prices of grains and cereal  oil; and let the common people enjoy an ease of mind in buying  and have a happy new year and Spring Festival. This is a good  thing we can do for the masses.    Municipal leaders, including Zhang Baifa, Duan Bingren, Meng  Xuenong, Duan Qiang, and Fan Yuanmou also attended the meeting.</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Trans World up 54% to Pounds 1.74m - Oyston's plan to sell stake may lead to a battle for control Trans World Communications, the independent radio group where former chairman Mr Owen Oyston's 24 per cent stake is for sale, reported a 54 per cent jump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.13m to Pounds 1.74m for 1993. But the shares slipped by 13p to 165p yesterday, having risen by more than 60 per cent in the last month. Mr John Whitney, chairman, would not speculate on where Mr Oyston's shares might go. 'Only time will tell,' he said. Mr Oyston's plan to sell his stake may lead to a battle for control of the company involving Emap, the publishing group which owns almost 30 per cent of the shares, and the Guardian newspaper group which has 20 per cent. The Guardian is unable to increase its stake under current rules on cross-media ownership. But these are expected to be relaxed later this year following a review by Mr Peter Brooke, the heritage secretary. At present, Trans World can own only one more major local radio licence and will be applying for an FM licence for London in the spring. Mr Whitney predicts the rules will be changed to allow newspaper groups to own radio stations and that the market share limit will be raised to 25 per cent. Shares in radio companies have risen sharply over the last few months on hopes of a wave of takeover bids and signs of a strong recovery in advertising revenue. Trans World recorded an 11 per cent increase for the year, pushing total sales up by Pounds 1.15m to Pounds 13.3m. Operating profits jumped by Pounds 678,000 to Pounds 1.71m, but a return to a near-normal tax charge of 28 per cent left earnings at 3.1p. A final dividend of 1p lifts the total to 1.3p (0.8p). COMMENT Even after boiling over yesterday, Trans World shares are trading on a frothy 53 times historic earnings. But the rating should fall sharply this year. Given that three quarters of the company's costs are fixed, it would require advertising growth of only 15 per cent - compared with industry forecasts of 20 per cent - for profits to top Pounds 3m, reducing the multiple to about 30. Relaxation of ITV ownership rules pushed television ratings almost as high and that for a sector which is losing advertising share, while independent radio is starting to make the inroads it has long promised. Add Mr Oyston's stake to the mix and there may be life in the shares yet.</p>

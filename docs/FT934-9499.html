			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: Western Mining warned on accounts WESTERN Mining Corporation, the diversified mining group, has revealed that the presentation of its year-end results has fallen foul of the Australian Securities Commission (ASC), the country's stock-market watchdog. The warning came less than 24 hours before its annual meeting. In a statement made jointly with the ASC, the company noted its preliminary final statement on September 2, 'dealt firstly with the company's profit results by reference to equity-accounted profit and group consolidated profit before abnormals, and subsequently dealt with equity-accounted profit after abnormals. 'After receiving a complaint, the Australian Securities Commission assessed the matter and concluded that undue emphasis has been given in WMC's public announcement to the equity profit before abnormal items of ADollars 165.9m', it continued. The ASC is now asking WMC to change the order in which it deals with its profit results, so that consolidated profits after tax and abnormals become the first item in public announcements. Last time, this would have shown a surplus of ADollars 64m (USDollars 42.9m), compared with a loss of ADollars 8.5m in the previous year. WMC defended the previous prominence given to equity-accounted profit on the grounds that 'the significance of the company's Alcoa holding should be identified to shareholders', but said that it would in future meet the ASC's request.</p>

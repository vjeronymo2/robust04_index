			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / EC seeks more troops for Bosnia peace force: Owen attacks US over failure to offer ground support THE EUROPEAN Community called yesterday for stronger UN peacekeeping forces to defend 'safe areas' in Bosnia, including the recruitment of troops from Moslem countries, Scandinavia and the former Soviet Union. EC foreign ministers backed the recruitment plan in Luxembourg after Lord Owen, the EC mediator, warned of a risk of Serbia and Croatia carving up Bosnia and creating a new 'Palestine' in Europe for the Moslem population. The move came as fighting in the region intensified, with Moslem forces capturing the strategic city of Travnik. Heavy civilian casualties were reported and 20 surrounding villages destroyed. About 700 Croat soldiers from Travnik who surrendered to the Bosnian Serbs have been interned in the notorious Manjaca prison camp, a former detention centre for Moslems closed after an outcry in the west about its squalid conditions. EC ministers will present the initiative to Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, in Luxembourg today, amid thinly veiled disappointment that the Clinton administration has only offered air cover. The absence of US troops has cast doubts on the effectiveness of the safe-area plan, and Lord Owen criticised the US decision to hold back. 'If UN peacekeeping is to succeed, it is debilitating if the US, as the most powerful country in Nato, is not prepared to put in ground forces.' Nato is due to discuss the issue in Athens tomorrow. Today Mr Christopher is expected to be questioned closely by the Europeans on whether the US intends to contribute ground forces in the event of a political settlement as hoped for in the Vance-Owen peace plan. The drive to expand the UN peace-keeping force is to be led by Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, UN secretary-general. It marks a desperate effort to plug the gaps in the peace-keeping force, which has been stretched to breaking point by the recent upsurge in fighting. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, sought to remove doubts about the effectiveness of safe areas. He said he was confident that new rules of engagement could be quickly drawn up so that UN forces could defend themselves under attack, if necessary by calling on US, UK or French air power. Mr Hurd added that 'safe areas' were not a magic solution to the conflict in former Yugoslavia. 'They are only a temporary, first step aimed at keeping people alive,' he said. The original idea of appealing for a wider international force, including the sensitive issue of Moslem troops, appears to have come from the UK and France, the main contributors to the UN peace effort. Both say they are unwilling at present to go beyond their contingent of 2,200 and 5,500 troops respectively. British and French officials listed at least half a dozen countries to be solicited for troop contributions: Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, as well as Morocco, Tunisia, Pakistan and unnamed Scandinavian countries. Turkey's position remains questionable due to Greek sensitivities and the risk of a wider Balkan war. Estimates of how many troops will be required to defend the 'safe areas' also varied between 5,000 and 30,000 troops, with the French and British keen to avoid measures that might be either too provocative or risk sucking their own troops into the conflict. Lord Owen presented the putative international force as an 'east and west European initiative' with the Nato alliance acting as a strategic planner, first for defending the designated 'safe areas' and later for implementing the Vance-Owen plan.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The offers conveyed to us by the members of the  contact group that concerned the territorial division were not  meant to impose a solution, but to merely mediate. This is what  Momcilo Krajisnik, chairman of the peoples' assembly of the  Srpska republic, stated for the SRNA news agency after the talks  with the contact group for former Bosnia-Herzegovina in the  French town of Talloires.    According to him, during this meeting the Serbian  negotiating  team pointed at the harmful effects of the provision that  stipulates the territorial division of 51 against 49 percent and  emphasized that this cannot be discussed in advance. We believe  that percentages, without taking into account the quantity and  the quality of territories, mean nothing. The members of the  contact group acknowledged this with understanding, Krajisnik  pointed out. He added that nothing qualitative and new has been  accomplished regarding the finding of a solution to the crisis.    It is also characteristic of this meeting, Krajisnik  specified, that the members of the contact group wanted to hear  new ideas and proposals of the Serbian side to convey them to  the governments of their countries. We have pointed at the  problems that we have been encountering lately and the Croatian  and Muslim side not being willing to accept the end of  hostilities, which definitely increases tensions on the  territory of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, Krajisnik emphasized  and added:    We are encouraged by the fact that the contact group has  acknowledged our view that the most important task is to end  hostilities. The group has promised to mediate for as quick as  possible establishment of peace with the Muslims and the Croats.    In the opinion of the chairman of the assembly of the Srpska  republic, the meeting in Talloires can under no circumstance be  called negotiations, bearing in mind the platform of the  peoples' assembly of the Srpska republic according to which  there can be no continuation of the talks until the Serbian side  has received an equal treatment and the sanctions have been  lifted.    We will need to invest many more efforts as there is a  difficult battle ahead of us before the final solution. The  differences in opinions are great and, with some of their  radical statements, the Muslims are making the achievement of  the final agreement more remote, Krajisnik said after the talks  in Talloires, SRNA reports.</p>

Lu and Lilian Wu] </F>   [Text] Tegucigalpa, Jan. 27 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan  will change his itinerary and visit the Bahamas after winding up  his trip in Honduras Friday [28 January], Jason Hu,  director-general of the Government Information Office, said  Thursday.    Lien originally planned to leave Tegucigalpa Friday and  return home via San Francisco.    The Bahamas, however, had been keen to have Lien visit while  he was in Latin America, and so Lien agreed to a one-day  stopover, according to Chang Ping-nan, the ROC ambassador to the  Bahamas.    Lien and his 17-member entourage attended the inauguration  of  new Honduran President Carlo Roberto Reina on Thursday. The  ceremony was held at Tegucigalpa National Stadium and lasted  four hours.    Lien later met with Nicaraguan President Violeta de  Chamorro.  He greeted Chamorro on behalf of President Li Teng-hui and  expressed his appreciation for Nicaragua's support of the ROC in  the international community.    Nicaragua and six other Latin American countries submitted a  letter to United Nations Secretary-General Butros Butros-Ghali,  asking that the ROC's UN bid be put on the agenda for the  General Assembly in September. The request was later voted  downed.    Chamorro said that she was honored to be able to speak up  for  the ROC in the international community and said she would  continue to do so. She also invited Li and Lien to visit  Nicaragua.    Lien also met briefly with Belize President Manuel Esquival  and Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio. Esquival  expressed the hope that relations between Belize and the ROC  could be cemented. He also said that Belize's vice premier and  foreign minister will visit the ROC soon.</p>

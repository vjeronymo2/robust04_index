			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Yeltsin steps up battle with Speaker IN A dramatic raising of the stakes in his power struggle with parliament, President Boris Yeltsin has demanded that all state authority be centralised under the executive branch of the Russian government. A draft 'agreement between the executive and legislative powers of the Russian federation', sent yesterday to Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary Speaker, demands that parliament refrain from any actions which would restrict the government's handling of the economic crisis. It also calls for the 'subordination' to the government of the central bank, the Bank of Foreign Economic Affairs and the Foreign Trade Bank, as well as the Committee of State Property, a parliament-controlled body which oversees state enterprises, all of which have operated policies independent of and usually hostile to the government. The plan, outlined on Wednesday by Mr Sergei Shakhrai, a deputy prime minister, would effectively neutralise parliament, which has consistently blocked the government's and the president's reform programmes. Preliminary reactions from deputies were that it stood no chance of being approved - a view which signals a deepening of the already bitter and dangerous struggle between Mr Yeltsin and Mr Khasbulatov. The draft says the government must immediately bring forward the most urgent economic measures, and lays down that 'all draft decrees and draft laws concerning budget expenditures will be subject to the government's agreement.' Ministers complain that parliament has fuelled inflation by passing expenditure bills, especially for social benefits. Under an agreement between Mr Yeltsin and Mr Khasbulatov this week, a joint presidential-parliamentary commission must find a formula for a division of powers by the end of the month. However, the uncompromising tone of Mr Yeltsin's first draft makes the prospect of any agreement doubtful - while both sides fear the country is heading towards authoritarian rule.</p>

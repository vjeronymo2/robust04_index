			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / S Korean economy faces a rejig / A look at politicians' plans SOUTH KOREA'S well-entrenched bureaucrats might pale at Mr Chung Ju-yung's vision of the finance ministry as a kind of policy research institute, to which he would grant 'a role in formulating the budget and monetary policy'. Under his approach, the powerful Economic Planning Board could also expect its days to be numbered. The founder of the Hyundai industrial conglomerate, who is standing for president in elections on Friday, has won nationwide support through his brash promises of smaller government, open markets, lower borrowing rates and trebled per capita income in five years. Yet Mr Chung is simply expressing the most extreme version of what is recognised by the two more established candidates, Mr Kim Young-sam and Mr Kim Dae-jung, as a transformation vital for Korea's economic progress. It is generally recognised that Korea has to loosen bureaucratic shackles on the economy, open up financial markets, and improve productivity and technology if it is to sustain its growth. Though the economy has expanded by an average of 8 per cent a year in the five years of Mr Roh Tae-woo's presidency, a fall to a 3.1 per cent annual rate in the third quarter caused widespread alarm. Mr Roh's economic leadership is dismissed as weak by most politicians. Mr Suh Sang-mok, an economic adviser to Mr Kim Young-sam, the ruling party candidate, says: 'Korea has a bicycle economy - if the speed is too slow, you fall off.' The top priority, he says, is improving the international competitiveness of Korean industry, which has sagged as a result of labour unrest and rising wages. The platforms of all three candidates reflect the belief that five-year plans and direct government control of the economy, with bureaucratic sanction needed for most important corporate decisions, are no longer suitable given Korea's advanced stage of economic development and democratic freedom. Mr Park Jae-yoon, another adviser to Mr Kim Young-sam, says: 'We believed implicitly that the economy could grow by itself along the previous development path. But that was wrong. So now we have to change the nature of the economy.' Mr Yoo Jong-keun, an adviser to Mr Kim Dae-jung, the leading opposition candidate, says: 'If we want full commitment to democracy, then we have to have a full commitment to the free market system.' The candidates plan reform in several key areas: Financial liberalisation. Tightly controlled interest rates, credit allocation, and curbs on capital flows create distortions - for example, deposit rates are artificially low and borrowing costs artificially high, especially for smaller companies. All candidates would accelerate the current official timetable, under which significant financial reforms are postponed in 1997. Mr Chung would free all interest rates immediately, while Mr Kim Young-sam is likely to be more wary of causing disruption through rapid reform. Chaebol reform. The family-owned industrial conglomerates dominate the economy at the expense of smaller companies and have prospered through subsidised loans. Mr Roh's attempts to use credit controls and to encourage them to focus on a few core businesses have produced few results. All candidates aim instead to fragment the chaebol by strict application of inheritance tax, encouraging owners to sell some of their holdings on the stock market; and by enforcing anti-trust laws. Mr Chung takes the most radical approach, promising to dissolve the chaebol  -he is setting an example with plans to distribute Hyundai group companies among his six sons. Banking reform. All candidates would cease government appointments of private sector bank chairmen and top executives. Government-mandated low interest loans to sectors officially deemed strategically important, from agriculture to high-technology industry, would be gradually phased out. Slimmer bureaucracy. As part of a drive to make the economy more market-led, Finance Ministry powers would be curbed. All candidates promise to study the role of the Economic Planning Board, which once directed the economy through five-year plans. Industrial competitiveness. Inadequate spending on research and development have hampered Korea's progress towards higher-technology industry which would keep it ahead of other rapidly developing countries. The candidates would, through tax incentives, raise total Korean research and development spending from 3 per cent to 5 per cent of gross domestic product. Financial disclosure. All candidates favour 'real-name' accounting, which would prevent concealment of financial assets. This would raise tax revenues, but could cause liquidity problems in financial markets. Laudable though these plans may be, seasoned economists are sceptical about the candidates' commitment to them and about their timing. Korea's regulated economy gives officials great power. Mr Lee Hahn-koo, president of Daewoo Research Institute, says: 'Since 1975 the government has said it wants to deregulate and have a private sector-led economy. But actually more and more regulations have accumulated.' However, the challenge for the next president will be to push through economic reform. If he does not, Korea's progress up the league of industrial nations will be at risk.  -------------------------------------------------------                   SOUTH KOREAN ECONOMY  -------------------------------------------------------                              1989   1990   1991   1992* GDP growth%                   6.2    9.0    8.3    5-6 Inflation%                    5.6    8.6    9.7    4.0 Current a/c Dollars bn**     +5.1   -2.2   -8.8   -4.5  ------------------------------------------------------- ** +surplus; -deficit* Government estimates  -------------------------------------------------------</p>

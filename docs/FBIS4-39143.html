			<p>BFN     [Text] A Georgian military working group involved in  bilateral talks in Moscow on the Abkhazian conflict has returned  to Tbilisi. The group included General Guram Nikolaishvili and  General Gia Vashakidze, Georgian deputy defense ministers; and  Vladimer Chikonani, the commander of the Georgian interior  troops. Jaba Ioseliani, the head of state's representative, led  the group.    In accordance with the document of 14 May on a cease-fire  and  the disengagement of forces, the participants in the Moscow  talks carried out the precise delineation of the peacekeeping  troops' deployment areas and marked these on the map.    At the first stage of conflict settlement, peacekeeping  forces will enter and take control of an area which is 78 km  long, between [placename indistinct] and Ochamchire, and 56 km  wide, between Tkvarcheli and (Atskura). Thirty control posts  and five checkpoints will be set up and four mobile groups will  be deployed throughout this territory. The headquarters of the  joint command will be in Sukhumi. The UN representatives who  are now working in the area as observers will be attached to the  peacekeeping forces deployed in the area.    The peacekeeping force will include troops from the Russian  Federation's Leningrad, Volga, and Ural military districts.  These troops will start entering their areas of deployment from  next week. Later, CIS peacekeeping forces will also be  introduced.    It should be noted that the leaders of almost all CIS  countries have supported the decision to deploy peacekeepers.    As Vladimer Chikovani pointed out, it is now difficult to  speak of the so-called buffer zone any more, since the  peacekeeping forces will enter and take control not only of a  (?strip) along the Inguri river but also of an area of 2,184  square km around Gali. The area will include such large places  as the towns of Gali and Tkvarcheli, and the villages of Zemo  Okumi, Kvemo Okumi, Ghumurishi, Saberio, Sabedao, Otobaia, and  Achigvara.    In answering our correspondent's question about the safety  of  returning refugees, Mr. Chikovani said that good working  conditions have been created for the UNHCR and that the  peacekeeping forces are legally entitled and have the ability to  control the situation in any settlement in the Gali region.    Generals Aleksandr Sokolov, Yuriy Kozlov, and Aleksey Khapin  represented Russia in the working group. The Abkhaz delegation  included Anri Jergenaia, Ardzinba's personal representative and  brother-in-law, as well as Sergey Dabar and Sultan Soslaniyev.</p>

			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Asean ready to accept Vietnam Foreign ministers of Asean said at the weekend they were ready to accept Vietnam as a member, but did not set a date, writes Victor Mallet in Bangkok. Asean was established in 1967 by countries seeking to protect themselves from the spread of communism. Vietnam still has a communist government, but the cold war has ended and Asean wants eventually to embrace all the countries of the region to form a common front on economic and security issues. Vietnam's entry may be delayed by concerns over its willingness to implement mutual tariff cuts under the proposed Asean Free Trade Area.</p>

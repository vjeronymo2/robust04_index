			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL DELIVERIES;  </P> <P> VOLUNTEERS PROVIDE FOOD BASKETS TO FEED THE NEEDY A HOLIDAY MEAL  </P> <P> Nine years ago, college instructor Susan Silbert and some of her students held  a raffle and raised enough money to provide about 70 Christmas dinners for  needy families.  </P> <P> Today, Silbert operates on a different scale. This morning, she and hundreds of  volunteers plan to distribute 2,500 food baskets, which they hope will feed  more than 12,000 needy people.  </P> <P> On three evenings last week, she and her legion of helpers -- children,  teen-agers, adults and senior citizens -- gathered in a hangar at Santa Monica  Municipal Airport to sort and package food for the baskets.  </P> <P> "This has grown not so much because the need has grown so significantly, but  because more people want to give. And this provides an avenue for them to  participate in something meaningful," Silbert said in an interview.  </P> <P> Indeed, what began as a modest undertaking by a small group of classmates has  blossomed into an incorporated nonprofit organization called One Voice with a  network of hundreds of volunteers and year-round programs to help the  disadvantaged.  </P> <P> "We knew that the need did not just exist on Dec. 25," said Silbert, who is  director of the group. "What happens is that when you do something, it grows."  </P> <P> Silbert, who grew up in Brentwood and now lives in West Los Angeles, said her  group has provided an avenue for participation, particularly for affluent  people.  </P> <P> "Being rich doesn't mean you don't care," she said. "It's just that people  don't know how to help. I think people find meaning in their lives by helping  others."  </P> <P> Most of the volunteers participate in the group's collection and distribution  of Christmas food baskets.  </P> <P> The group pays for some of the food and supplies, but the majority of it is  donated.  </P> <P> Jack Berlin, whose company, Potato Sales, provides One Voice with produce, has  been involved with the group since the beginning.  </P> <P> "I never saw so much enthusiasm as I saw in Susan," Berlin said.  </P> <P> The scene Wednesday night inside the chilly, cavernous hangar -- the use of  which was donated by its owner, Judy Barker -- was reminiscent of Santa's elves  preparing for Christmas: Volunteers, bundled up in coats and scarves, busily  worked in groups of five to eight around portable tables. The sounds of  Christmas songs blared in the background as some sang along.  </P> <P> Each food basket distributed today contains a turkey, canned food, fresh  vegetables, fruits and pies.  </P> <P> Silbert said that as the number of people being served has grown, she and her  helpers have made a special effort to keep the quantity of food generous and  the quality high.  </P> <P> "We treat these people like our own families," she said. "You don't put family  at the end of the table and give them crummy food. We provide top-quality  food."  </P> <P> As he sorted and packed the food Wednesday night, Ray Michaud, headmaster of  the private John Thomas Dye School in Bel-Air, said he has been a volunteer for  five years and got his school involved four years ago.  </P> <P> "I was looking for something for a hands-on, concrete experience for our kids,"  he said as he placed yams in a bag with the assistance of his son and other  students from the school. "This provides that, and I think they love it. This  is an experience in unconditional love."  </P> <P> At another table, Mary Sidell and her daughter, Devin, 10, were packaging  oranges.  </P> <P> Volunteering, Sidell said, gives children a chance to see first-hand that there  are others less fortunate.  </P> <P> "It's not in the realm of their everyday experiences," she said. "That's why  it's important that they know there is a need out there."  </P> <P> "I want to help the homeless," Devin said.  </P> <P> Tanya Lopez, a talent agent who was one of Silbert's original students and who  is now on the board of directors of One Voice, said her participation provides  balance in her life.  </P> <P> "This is a real touchstone for me," she said. "This reminds me of what is  really important in the world. People are searching for something to do to make  the world a better place to live. You just have to give them a little  direction."  </P> <P> Silbert, a former sociology teacher who had taught at several area colleges,  began her fund-raising and food collection efforts out of her West Los Angeles  home as a year-round emergency aid program, responding to requests from area  social workers.  </P> <P> She started with a few Head Start programs serving the inner-city area and  began providing Christmas dinners to families of Head Start students, all of  whom fall below the federal poverty level (which now is an annual household  income of $12,700 for a family of four).  </P> <P> She incorporated her program in 1982, and opened an office in Santa Monica. She  now has an annual budget of $100,000 -- all through private donations -- and a  paid staff of five.  </P> <P> Silbert said she has funds only to last through June, and for the first time  will have to concentrate on fund-raising. But for now, she is focused on  distributing the Christmas food baskets.  </P> <P> "This is more than just giving them food, we give them hugs," she said. "If the  families we are giving food to have not been hugged four or five times by the  volunteers, then we feel we failed."  </P></p>

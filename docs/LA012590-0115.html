			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CLARK SCORES 37 TO HELP CANYONS ROUT FAVORED MOORPARK, 108-87  </P> <P> Aaron Clark, Canyons' 6-foot-3 off guard-turned-center, displayed a split  personality Wednesday night at Moorpark.  </P> <P> Clark was Mr. Inside and Mr. Outside as he scored 37 points with a combination  of power moves in the lane and outside sharpshooting, including three  three-point baskets.  </P> <P> Rather than exorcising this offensive demon, though, Moorpark endured an  exercise in futility, falling to Canyons, 108-87, in a Western State Conference  game.  </P> <P> Canyons (10-14, 3-4 in conference play), one of the highest-scoring teams in  the state, rocketed to a 52-41 halftime lead and rode home on the shoulders of  Clark, who scored 20 second-half points.  </P> <P> "I was hitting everything from inside to outside," said Clark, who recently was  moved to center.  </P> <P> "He really played well for an off-guard," Canyons Coach Lee Smelser said of  Clark.  </P> <P> Moorpark point guard Sam Crawford literally drew "aahs" with a spinning reverse  layup early in the second half, but his 23 points and 10 assists went for  naught.  </P> <P> "We didn't play well tonight, just had a concentration problem," Moorpark Coach  Al Nordquist said. "As things went on, we began to press individually."  </P> <P> Greg Taylor led Moorpark (16-7, 4-2) with 24 points and 13 rebounds.  </P> <P> Three other Canyons players joined Clark in double figures.  </P> <P> Larry Allbritton scored 23 points and added 10 rebounds.  </P> <P> Nick Sanderson and Steve Valenzuela scored 18 and 16, respectively.  </P> <P> Moorpark was coming off an impressive 17-point victory over Glendale and is  heading into a game Saturday against conference leader Valley.  </P></p>

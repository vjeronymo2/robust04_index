			<p>BFN     [Text] On 8 June, a top official of the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI] explained a view that in  an attempt to end negotiations in priority areas prior to the  Japan-U.S. comprehensive economic talks, it is likely that  ministers, including Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and MITI  Minister Eijiro Hata, will visit the United States and hold  ministerial meetings with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey  Kantor and other secretaries.    Regarding goals of the negotiations, the same senior  official  said that "details of a report, which will be submitted to the  Hata-Clinton talks, will be worked out in deputy ministerial  talks before the [Naples] summit." In this way, he explained  the idea of producing some results before the summit in the four  priority areas -- government procurement, auto and auto parts,  insurance, and export promotion and competitive power.</p>

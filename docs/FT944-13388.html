			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Decline in premium on UBS registered The lack of sustained recovery in the dollar, treasuries and the Dow weighed inevitably on domestic bond markets and on bourses yesterday. Early rebounds in European equities were cut back hard, disappeared altogether or turned into further losses, writes Our Markets Staff. ZURICH took a pragmatic, and painful look at the dollar and a weaker Wall Street, and dropped the SMI index by 17.5 to 2,477.2. Sandoz registered fell SFr10 to a new 1994 low SFr612 after its news of a 3 per cent rise in nine-month sales, aminimal gain emphasising the way that dollar depreciation has bit into European growth rates this year. At the same time UBS registered fell SFr13, or 4.4 per cent to SFr282 with the bearers down only SFr5 at SFr1,230, thus reducing the premium on the registered from 19.4 to 14.6 per cent; professionals said that this reflected the increasing prospect of the UBS board, which wants to create a single class of registered share, winning its power struggle with Mr Martin Ebner's BK Vision. FRANKFURT offered a futures-led, technical rebound on the session, the Dax index rising 45.87, or 2.3 per cent to 2,020.50. About half of the recovery reflected post-bourse gains on Tuesday. By the end of the afternoon, however, the mood was looking much less ebullient, with the Ibis-indicated Dax up 13.60 at 2,009.45. The December Dax future moved from 2,030.0, up 13.5 at the session's close to 2,017.5, up a solitary point at the end of the day. Turnover eased from DM7bn to DM5.5bn. The share of the day was Mannesmann, up DM11 at DM385.50 with a major foreign order reported after a period of weakness. Mr Michael Geiger at NatWest Securities in London said that NatWest had estimated an earnings rise for Mannesmann from DM28.10 in 1995 to DM44.60 in 1998, by which time more than half of group profits should come from the mobile telephone side of the business. PARIS stayed in positive territory, the CAC-40 index finishing 7.12 higher at 1,831.54 after a fall from a session high of 1,852. Turnover remained modest at FFr3bn. Accor was lifted FFr38 to FFr545 following an analysts meeting, and in spite of reporting first half figures earlier in the week which were at the lower end of expectations. Paribas Capital Markets commented that it had provisionally cut its forecasts for the hotel group, and thought it likely that the dividend would be cut in 1994 and 1995. However, the broker concluded that it was mildly positive on the stock, thinking that most of the bad news was now in the share price although it warned that a big rights issue was likely in the near future. The group said that it intended to make divestments totalling FFr2.5bn by the end of 1995, and to cut long term debt to FFr22.4bn by the end of this year and to FFr21.5bn by the end of 1995. AMSTERDAM wavered before the AEX index put on a marginal 0.95 to 399.15, after a high of 401.63. James Capel observed that Amsterdam had been one of the best European equity markets in the third quarter, helped by better than expected half year results and optimistic management statements. But, the broker warned, following 'a very strong period of prolonged outperformance within Europe, the equity market could gradually become the victim of profit-taking and asset reallocation by international investors'. Foreign investors, particularly from the US and UK, turned sellers of the market during the second and third quarters. Capel concluded that while a rally was to be expected in the short-term following the good batch of company reports, a pause in activity was likely in the first quarter of 1995. Nedlloyd saw more bargain hunting following falls last week, up a further Fl 3.00 or 6 per cent to Fl 52.20. DSM rose Fl 1.90 to Fl 146.80, ahead of next week's third quarter results. MILAN fell back slightly in a dull session. The Comit index drifted down 3.37 at 610.41. Trading in Fiat and Generali accounted for about 30 per cent of the day's total turnover of L500bn, with the former rising L5 to L5,995, and the insurer losing L413 to L36,700. Olivetti shed L42 to L1,752; Goldman Sachs considered the stock fairly valued in the L1,800 to L2,100 range, said that it was maintaining its 'market performer' rating on the stock and remarked that the prospects of a rights issue were likely to put a constraint on long-term performance. MADRID registered yet another low for the year, the general index falling 0.65 to 288.65 in turnover of Pta20bn. There were winners, on the margin. Santander, in banks, and Endesa in utilities produced nine month figures and rose Pta45 to Pta5,010 and Pta20 to Pta5,520 respectively, Santander on profits up 5.6 per cent excluding the Banesto acquisition and Endesa on a 13.5 per cent gain at net level. WARSAW continued to mourn the imposition of a 0.3 per cent transaction tax, and the Wig index fell for the fourth time in succession, by 237.4 or 2.8 per cent to 8,259.7. Turnover dropped 17 per cent to 579bn zlotys. The steel trader, Stalexport, fell on its initial listing to 335,000 zlotys cum dividend from an issue price of 340,000.

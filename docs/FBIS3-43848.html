			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] There are very strong historic links between Angola  and Cuba. The two peoples have been united in very difficult  and complex circumstances. That was said today by Cuban Foreign  Minister Roberto Robaina prior to his departure for Harare at  the end of a two-day working and friendly visit to Angola.    [Begin recording] [Reporter] Mr. Minister, I would like to  know what Cuba expects from your visit to Angola and other  African countries?    [Robaina in Spanish] Cuba expects from Angola and other  African countries what we expect from the world. When someone  thinks that we expect a solution to our problem from Angola, the  world or any particular country, please, the solution to Cuba's  problem depends first and foremost on the Cubans themselves and  a mechanism that it maintains with many in the world. There is  nothing in particular, least of all Angola in view of the  difficulties we know it is facing, which holds the solution to  our problem. The solution to our problem does not lie in those  quarters only. Cuban expects from Angola and the world what  Cuba also advocates to the world -- understanding and (?sincere)  respect.    [Reporter] Mr. Minister, would you like to characterize the  current state of relations between the Cuba and the United  States, bearing in mind that despite the blockade the United  States has an interest office in Havana?    [Robaina] Well, relations with a country can be  characterized  when they are in place. When that is not the case, it is very  difficult to characterize relations because there are no  relations between Cuba and the United States. (?Like the United  States,) Cuba has always stood (?for legal) [words indistinct]  Cuba is willing to deal with the whole world, including the  United States, but only on one condition -- absolute respect.  If there is no absolute respect, we will have nothing to do  with the United States.    [Reporter] Mr. Minister, we have also learned of a certain  exodus of Cubans to the United States. The latest case to be  widely reported in the Western media was about the Cuban  sportsmen who took part in the Central American Games. What  prompts such an exodus?    [Robaina] I think my country is a Third World country. It is  the same thing that prompts poor countries of the world, the  difference being that none of them is as famous as Cuba. None  of those countries (?is as politicized) as Cuba. Cubans have  the same difficult reasons like other peoples. They have been  capable of giving in to a degree of pressure and to promises,  but they are insignificant when compared to the millions of  people who continually cross the U.S. border, namely Haitians  [words indistinct] I do not think any of them is as famous as a  Cuban. It is sufficient to have a Cuban and have scandal, a  show [preceding word in English]. [end recording]</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / The Guinness Appeals: 'Ambivalence' over Roux highlighted AN appeal court judge yesterday referred to the 'ambivalent attitude' of the prosecution towards Mr Olivier Roux, the former Guinness finance director and the principal prosecution witness. Mr Justice Ognall said he was 'very troubled' about the status invested in Mr Roux at the trial last year. Mr Roux had admitted having known about an allegedly unlawful share support operation mounted by Guinness during its takeover battle for Distillers, so why had he not been an accomplice as far as the Crown had been concerned, the judge asked. Mr John Chadwick QC, for the Serious Fraud Office, replied that Mr Roux had consistently said he had not regarded what was done during the bid as dishonest. How, the judge asked, did a witness's assertion that he was not dishonest alter his status? Mr Chadwick said that if Mr Roux had been treated as an accomplice from the start, that would have taken the decision from the jury: they had to decide whether they believed his evidence as to the honesty of the support operation. Mr Justice Ognall said: 'I suspect that at least some of the mischief that has arisen in this particular case may have arisen because of the ambivalent attitude of the Crown towards Mr Roux and his role in this enterprise.' Mr Chadwick said the Crown had to form a view as to whether a person had accepted his criminality. Mr Roux clearly had not, and the Crown had taken the view that this was something to be left to the jury. The exchanges came on the fifth day of appeals by Mr Ernest Saunders, former Guinness chairman and chief executive, Mr Anthony Parnes, a City stockbroker, and Mr Gerald Ronson, head of the Heron group, against their convictions and sentences. The appeals continue today.</p>

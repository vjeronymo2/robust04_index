			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Healthy People 2000: The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity for setting priority areas. This program announcement, ``Community Prevention Coalitions Demonstration Grants,'' is in keeping with objectives in the priority areas of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs, and educational and community-based health programs, including objectives relating to the workplace.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants may obtain a copy of Healthy People 2000 (Full Report: Stock No. 017&hyph;001&hyph;00474&hyph;0; or Summary Report: Stock No. 017&hyph;001&hyph;00473&hyph;01) through the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402&hyph;9325 (Telephone: 202&hyph;783&hyph;3238).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Non-Use of Tobacco: The medical dangers and high risk of addiction associated with firsthand use of tobacco products have been thoroughly documented. Moreover, data presented in leading medical journals (for example, New England Journal of Medicine, June 10, 1993) and reported widely in the press, associate environmental exposure to tobacco smoke (passive smoking) with increased rates of cancer and other pulmonary diseases among people of all ages and with increased rates of asthma among children. Further, scientific evidence supports the connection between the use of smokeless tobacco products, such as chewing tobacco and snuff, and cancer of the mouth, jaw and throat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Critical questions now facing public health experts concern the most effective methods for preventing youth from using tobacco products and for preventing and/or reducing infants' and children's exposure to smoke in both public and private environments. A combined approach involving public policy, media awareness, and prevention education strategies appears to be a promising way to address this serious problem; however, careful development, implementation, and evaluation of specific tobacco use prevention strategies is required to establish their efficacy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CSAP recognizes that its target populations are vulnerable to a variety of preventable health and social problems, including substance abuse. Therefore, CSAP believes that preventative education, policy and media advocacy leading to environmental and social change concerning use of tobacco products must be a priority for grantees. Further, CSAP strongly encourages all grantees to provide smoke-free programs and work environments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Part II_Program Description and Model, Eligibility and Application Receipt Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Program Description: Based on these early indications of the impact of community-wide coalitions, as well as a national need to develop promising, innovative approaches to drug abuse prevention, CSAP will consider applications that provide a strategy for testing the effectiveness of the model described below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the long term and difficult nature of establishing community partnerships (Altman, Endres, Linzer, 1991; Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, 1994; Florin, Mitchell and Stevenson, 1993), and the fact that this is a demonstration program seeking to understand the potential of partnership programs, successful applicants must be able to document a fully operational and effective partnership and provide a solid rationale to justify enhancing the nature of its current partnership efforts, in accord with the provisions of this announcement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The new CPCD Grant Program seeks to demonstrate the potential of: (1) Expanding the scope of existing, well-developed partnerships programmatically and geographically, and/or (2) developing multiple partnerships into coalitions in their current area to address other drug-related health and social problems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CPCD Program is an important part of CSAP's ongoing, long-term objective to achieve and document measurable reductions in substance abuse incidence, prevalence, and related consequences such as alcohol, tobacco, and other drug-related health problems, mental disorders and comorbidity, crimes, deaths and injuries among all age and ethnic groups within a community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Funds are available to test the effectiveness of extending the original partnership concept through one of two approaches reflecting the above concepts: (1) Local Prevention Linkages, or (2) State/Regional Coalitions. Applicants must choose one of these approaches and provide a rationale for their belief that using this approach will significantly enhance the effectiveness of substance abuse prevention efforts in the area served by the proposed multi-partnership coalition. Funding will be consistent with the intent of Congress that direct prevention services should be approximately 50 percent of the project budget.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program Model: CSAP is seeking applications that demonstrate the effectiveness of the two partnership/coalition approaches which are described below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Community Partnership-Initiated Approach <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _This approach would expand a local community partnership(s) to form a larger coalition comprised of a minimum of two partnerships (at least one of which is established and one of which is new) to provide integrated, community-based prevention services across a larger geographical area. At a minimum, this expansion would require the addition of at least one new community-based partnership. Thus, a community partnership initiated approach would have at least two (2) partnerships to establish a CPCD coalition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed projects must include a rationale for the expansion and document strategies that will enhance substance abuse prevention programming across the expanded area. This rationale should include identifying and justifying enhancements in the following: (1) Prevention services (such as peer counseling, pre- and post-natal care, cross-cultural education programs); (2) successful prevention activities and related services (such as youth alternative programs, parental support and skills development, mentoring and role modeling by intermediaries, violence related activities); (3) environmental, social policy and media strategies aimed at alcohol, tobacco and other drug abuse prevention; and (4) a plan and design for coordinating and streamlining prevention efforts that can serve to improve service delivery and promote cost-effectiveness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This approach should demonstrate how to effectively expand and coordinate prevention services across a broader geographical area that will result in sharing ideas, expanding state-of-the-art practices in diverse disciplines and fields, and identifying effective substance abuse prevention measures for implementation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants must keep in mind that all new services must be community-based and developed at the local level, consistent with program development approaches that have been documented by CSAP. One of the challenges of the demonstration is to unify a number of disparate, geographically diverse, community-based programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

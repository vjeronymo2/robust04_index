			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / International Bonds: Landesbank taps dragon sector The Eurobond market saw a sprinkling of new deals yesterday, but amid the ongoing summer lull, issuance is expected to remain slow this week. Germany's Landesbank Rheinland Pfalz tapped the dragon bond market for Dollars 300m of three-year bonds via joint leads Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers. The bonds were deemed adequately priced, yielding 24 basis points over the when-issued US Treasury note at their 99.592 re-offer price. One of the lead managers said he placed some 95 per cent of his Dollars 110m allotment among eastern Asian investors. 'We saw good demand from that region, following the borrower's extensive roadshow in July,' he said. The lira sector saw L150bn of 10.6 per cent four-year bonds for WestLB Europe which attracted some buying by investors in the Benelux region, Germany and Switzerland, according to an official at one of the joint leads. The deal was lead-managed by SBC and WestLB. Despite the recent political upheavals in Italy which caused turmoil in currency and bond markets, investors are more positive on the prospect of convergence by high-yielding bonds, he said. Moreover, they are attracted by the high coupons these markets now offer. Amid the cautious comeback by emerging market borrowers, the Argentine electricity distributor Empresa Distribuidora Sur - or Endesa - issued Dollars 50m of three-year floating-rate notes via Bear Stearns. The bonds pay a coupon of three-month Libor plus 400 basis points, which was seen to be a level which would generate investor interest. The deal, which is targeted at European and US investors, had been widely pre-marketed and met with good interest, helped by the SEC's Rule 144a, which allows placement among US institutional investors, said the lead manager. Although emerging markets remain clouded by expectations of a further interest rate rise in the US, sentiment has been buoyed in recent weeks by growing optimism over the outcome of the Mexican elections and the region's promising economic fundamentals.</p>

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Leading Article: South Africa's balancing act South Africa's government of national unity has passed its first test. Yesterday's budget is a brave attempt to reconcile two critical constituencies. The concerns of the business community, looking for evidence of fiscal discipline, were met with the pledge to cut the budget deficit from 6.9 per cent to 6.6 per cent of GDP. It will be harder to satisfy a domestic constituency anticipating a liberation dividend. The provision of Dollars 685m for the first year of the country's development plan may seem modest at first sight, but it will be hard to spend this amount efficiently in the time available. This cautious approach suggests that the new ANC-led government is determined not to repeat the mistakes that have proved so costly elsewhere in Africa. But the toughest tests are yet to come: controlling spending while keeping promises to provide a better life for the country's black majority. The budget will come under pressure from several sources including the costs of an expanding civil service, of a multi-tiered system of local, provincial and central government, and of integrating the armed forces. Winding up the old apartheid structures and replacing them with a new system will almost certainly prove more costly than anticipated, even if in the long run it will prove more efficient. Apartheid's legacy Redressing the legacy of apartheid involves undoing one of the 20th century's most radical experiments in social engineering, involving the forced removal from so-called 'white areas' of more than 3m people. Making restitution to the dispossessed, making available state-owned land to ease pressure in former 'black areas', and redirecting financial and other assistance from commercial farmers to peasant farmers without disrupting agriculture will be an awesome task for a government most of whose members have no previous administrative experience. Scarcely less demanding is the target of meeting a housing backlog of more than 1.5m units while keeping up with annual extra demand of some 200,000 homes. The new government must also resolve unfinished constitutional business: determining the relationship between the central government and the nine provincial governments. It is becoming increasingly clear that there will be a tussle for power between the provincial premiers and the executive, involving some of the most critical issues such as the allocation of state resources for housing, health and education. Working relationship Fortunately, the four-year transition which culminated in President Nelson Mandela's inauguration last month has helped forge a working relationship between the ANC, Deputy President de Klerk's National party, and the business community. It is significant that both Mr Alec Erwin, the deputy to finance minister Mr Derek Keys, and Mr Jay Naidoo, the minister responsible for the social upliftment programme, are preaching the virtues of fiscal discipline as enthusiastically as Mr Keys himself. This has allowed much of the important groundwork for development to take place. The foreign debt burden, dating back to the freeze on further lending imposed by commercial banks in 1985, has been eased. Similarly, the transitional team has negotiated an International Monetary Fund facility and made trade liberalisation proposals to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Now what Mr Keys called the 'golden triangle of government, business and the unions' has to deliver jobs and improved living standards. As he acknowledged, success in a challenging international environment requires liberalisation of South Africa's exchange controls, a significant obstacle to investor confidence, as soon as conditions are right. But first South Africa needs to build up its foreign reserves, which currently cover barely six weeks of imports. Above all, restored access to international financial markets should not be seen as a way of funding a larger budget deficit. If South Africa can realise the vision set out by Mr Keys in yesterday's budget - an open society, trading freely with other nations, investing liberally to increase productive capacity, and creating more jobs and an attractive domestic market - it will have broken the African mould.</p>

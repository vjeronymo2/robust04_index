			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> RISKY BUSINESS  </P> <P> There now are only six Orange County cities that allow the use and sale of  fireworks, and if voters make the right choice Nov. 6, the number could be down  to three. It should be zero.  </P> <P> On Measure L in Orange and Measure Z in Fullerton, voters can ban fireworks  directly by voting yes. They should.  </P> <P> In Costa Mesa, the ballot issue is advisory, and the wording is confusing.  Measure W asks residents if the city should continue to allow the sale and  discharge of "safety" approved fireworks by "nonprofit organizations within the  city."  </P> <P> Fireworks, even the so-called state-designated "safe and sane" ones, are  anything but safe. Last year, 85% of fireworks-related injuries in Orange  County occurred in the cities that still allowed them. Historically, cities  where all fireworks have been banned have significantly fewer fireworks-caused  injuries and fires.  </P> <P> The other part of Costa Mesa's loaded ballot question is equally misleading.  The fact that some community groups sell fireworks strictly to bring in extra  money doesn't make them any safer. Youngsters are the main victims of fireworks  injuries, whatever the legitimate fund-raising motives of youth groups. Vote no  on Measure W.  </P> <P> Outlawing fireworks in all cities, except for public displays, makes it easier  to enforce existing bans. We hope efforts to do that will ignite similar moves  in Santa Ana, Garden Grove and Buena Park. Finally, fireworks sales would be  illegal countywide.  </P></p>

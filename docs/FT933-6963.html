			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Telekom urges more MPs to support sell-off MR HELMUT RICKE, the chairman of Deutsche Telekom, Germany's state-owned telecommunications group, yesterday pleaded for urgent political support for early privatisation of the company. 'There is not much time left . . . (before) the emergence of fully liberalised markets and ever stiffer competition,' Mr Ricke said, referring to the European Commission's decision to liberalise basic voice telephony markets in Europe by 1998. Mr Ricke told a news conference that Deutsche Telekom faced an uphill struggle trying to increase its competitiveness because of its status as a public company. It is legally required to transfer the bulk of its profits to the state budget each year and to cover the ever-growing deficits of the German post and postal bank. 'We have made enormous progress toward increasing our competitiveness,' he said. 'However, we are not able, on our own, to implement all the measures that have now become urgently required . . . It is therefore imperative that public policy lead to a joint-stock corporation which can trade its shares on the stock market.' MPs this autumn will debate a controversial privatisation bill which emerged after two years of wrangling between Germany's political parties. The bill has won the support of the leadership of the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), but it still needs backing from ordinary SPD MPs. If adopted, the bill would allow Deutsche Telekom to sell a first tranche of shares on the stock exchange by 1996 or 1997. It would would also be able to keep its profits. Mr Ricke said the first tranche of shares would amount to DM15bn (Pounds 5.8bn). He also warned that Deutsche Telekom could not continue to subsidise the postal system at the same time as rebuilding the telecommunications infrastructure in eastern Germany and preparing for increased competition. Revenues this year are expected to reach DM58bn from DM54bn in 1992. Last year the company had to transfer DM6.5bn of its DM7bn profit to the federal and postal budgets. 'The political decision-making bodies must ensure that our enterprise can continue at an accelerated pace,' Mr Ricke said.</p>

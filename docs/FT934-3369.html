			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Directors keep check on pay Most directors are practising the pay restraint they expect of their employees, says a report published today. Company directors received pay increases averaging 3 per cent in the 12 months to October, says the survey, published by the Reward Group and the Institute of Directors. The annual survey of 5,000 directors, the biggest of its kind, found 55 per cent received rises of less than 3 per cent with less than a quarter receiving no increase and 2 per cent taking a cut.</p>

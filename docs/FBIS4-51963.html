			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 30 (KCNA) -- The Zimbabwean  Committee for the Repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan to  the North was inaugurated in Harare on April 20.    Parliamentarian J. Macheka, secretary of the Zimbabwe-Korea  Solidarity and Friendship Association, was elected chairman of  the committee at the meeting.    A letter of protest to the South Korean puppet authorities  was released at the meeting, which denounced their brutalities  in invaliding Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, former soldiers of the  Korean People's Army, by tortures and inhumane maltreatment,  keeping them in prison for tens of years for refusing to be  converted, and strongly demanded that they be immediately  returned to the northern half of Korea.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 20 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- An official source  reported today that Cuban Defense Minister Raul Castro has  demanded state enterprises practice strict financial discipline  and that he exhorted "an end to the impunity in light of law  infringements."    The weekly TRABAJADORES also reported the high-ranking  official praised the economic adjustment plan implemented this  month on the island and urged a promotion of the "people's  understanding and support for measures already adopted or to be  adopted later."    The Cuban adjustment program, which the government  differentiates from other world shock measures, raised prices  and rates of several selected goods and services and includes a  possible end to subsidizes of state enterprises, as well as a  possible income tax system.    Raul Castro, Army general and Fidel Castro's younger  brother,  presided over a meeting of the Western Army Military Council,  held here on 18 and 19 June to analyze troops' readiness and  their participation in agricultural tasks.    Finance and Price Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez reported that  at the meeting, authorities temporarily confiscated, among other  goods, 162 houses, 232 vehicles, and nine boats from individuals  accused of illegal enrichment.    The "precautionary measures" against these people are  applied  based on Decree 149, by which the government is attempting to  halt growing corruption sparked by the serious economic crisis  that has prevailed on the island since 1990.    The weekly states that following the meeting that permitted  the military chiefs to submit their reports, Raul Castro praised  the soldiers' discipline and readiness and "the maintenance of  more than 7 million weapons owned" by the Western Army. The  defense minister stressed the Army's progress in the planting  and harvesting of vegetables, tubers, rice, and beans and the  breeding of animals for human consumption, and he urged the  troops to save fuel without losing their fighting capability.</p>

			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUN ENTHUSIASTS HELP SISTERS  </P> <P> How disgusting it was to read of what those gun enthusiasts were doing to that  poor 5-year-old girl.  </P> <P> I couldn't believe how insensitive they were to the trauma that girl  experienced over the shooting of her mother.  </P> <P> If those gun users want to do that girl a favor, they should make a bonfire of  their instruments of mayhem, and tell her how sorry they were that guns were  ever invented. At least they should be made to read your front-page story in  the same edition on how frequent violence is having a traumatic impact on many  Los Angeles County children ("When Learning to Walk Means Learning to Duck").  </P> <P> RICHARD H.

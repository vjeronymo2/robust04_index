			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Seven O'Clock Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Attention: Radioactive material apparently was  stolen from a Buenaventura warehouse, and it could have  endangered the lives of many Valle Department inhabitants.  Touching the material or simply being close to it entails a  serious risk. Doctors at Valle University Hospital warn that  those who have handled this radioactive material known as  strontium 90 are in danger of contracting skin cancer, gangrene,  or nerve cells damage.    Cali Police have arrested several people who attempted to  sell the material to the hospital, but it is believed that more  people could have been exposed to the strontium 90.</p>

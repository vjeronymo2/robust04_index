			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / International Company News: DnB may refloat as profits make return DEN NORSKE Bank, Norway's biggest bank, yesterday announced a return to profit and said preparations for reprivatisation could commence this autumn. DnB achieved a first-half net profit of NKr204m (Dollars 27.72m) against a net loss of NKr1.16bn last year due to improved net interest income, strong gains on securities due to a sharp decline in domestic interest rates and improved efficiency. Mr Ole Lund, chairman, stressed the bank must achieve stable profits from 'basic banking' operations before a programme for a gradual return to private hands could be completed by early next spring. The timetable would be influenced by the third-quarter performance. Following a six-year banking crisis in the Nordic region, DnB's ended up with a 70 per cent stake acquired in return for numerous cash bail-outs. Last April, the bank received a state cash injection of NKr1.5bn in preference capital. DnB was also granted a state guarantee of NKr600m which, Mr Lund said, it would not have to call on. Net interest income rose by NKr296m to NKr2.64bn. Other operating income - gains on shares, foreign exchange, and other financial instruments - shot up by NKr780m to NKr1.87bn as operating expenses contracted by NKr172m to NKr2.25bn achieved by nearly five years of wide cost cutting. Mr Finn Hvistendahl, president, said he knew of no other large bank which could point to similar cost effectiveness. However, the bank is still saddled with credit losses which, at NKr2bn in the first six months of this year, remained unchanged from last year. Net non-performing loans increased to NKr12.12bn by end-June from NKr11.6bn at end-1992 due to a reclassification of 'doubtful' loans to non-performers.</p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 750 MAY BE LAID OFF AT LONG BEACH SHIPYARD  </P> <P> The commander of the Long Beach Naval Shipyard has recommended layoffs at the  sprawling Terminal Island facility that would pare the work force by about 750  within three months, it was disclosed Tuesday.  </P> <P> If approved by the Pentagon, the latest in a series of reductions would leave  the shipyard with about 3,900 workers -- well below a peak of more than 7,000  five years ago, when the yard was busy renovating the battleship Missouri and  repairing other ships.  </P> <P> Once the second-largest employer in Long Beach, behind McDonnell Douglas Corp.,  the shipyard would fall to sixth place among local employers with the layoffs.  </P> <P> Frank Rodriguez, head of the shipyard's joint labor unions, complained that the  reduction would harm the Navy's readiness in event of a national emergency  because the yard was designed to repair battle-damaged ships.  </P> <P> "If we get down low enough (in employment), we will not be able to do the  complex jobs we do," said Rodriguez, president of the yard's Metal Trades  Council. "It will take away our flexibility and . . . ability to respond."  </P> <P> Assistant Secretary of the Navy Everett Pyatt confirmed in a letter to Rep.  Glenn M. Anderson (D-San Pedro) earlier this month that he is weighing whether  to accept a recommendation by shipyard commander Capt. Larry D. Johnson to lay  off up to 520 permanent employees.  </P> <P> Shipyard labor officials say that more than 200 temporary workers would be  dismissed as well. As of Tuesday, the yard employed 4,646 people, including 544  part-timers.  </P> <P> Pyatt has not said whether he will approve the cutbacks, but his letter noted  that the shipyard has been bidding on ship overhauls based on a reduced work  force.  </P> <P> "If the manning is not adjusted as proposed by the shipyard commander, these  bids must be withdrawn. Such action would further reduce workload and manning  requirements," Pyatt wrote.  </P> <P> Mandatory 60-day notices informing employees of layoffs could be issued April  28 if Pyatt gives his approval, yard sources said. Already, the yard is  undergoing a management reorganization and eliminating apprentice and training  programs in anticipation of the reduction.  </P> <P> "It's kind of demoralizing when you're waiting for the big hammer to fall,"  Rodriguez said.  </P> <P> Yard officials had expected a relatively stable workload this year. But a  provision of a federal appropriations bill passed last year requires that all  contracts to upgrade warships be put out for open competition among public and  private yards.  </P> <P> Because of the new provision, officials canceled a plan to have the Long Beach  facility begin renovation of the cruiser Halsey last month so that the job  could be put up for bid. That development, in turn, created a workload lull  that is expected to last until summer, when the carrier Ranger arrives for  overhaul.  </P></p>

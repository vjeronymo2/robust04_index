			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / UK Company News: US offer accepted by holders of 51% of TIP Europe GENERAL Electric Capital, the US financial services company bidding for trailer rental company TIP Europe, has announced that it had received valid acceptances representing 51.3 per cent of TIP's shares by the first closing date yesterday. The offer has been extended until May 26, by which time an environmental study of TIP's European sites will be completed. The acceptances do not include a 9.9 per cent stake held by HAL Investments (UK). HAL has said it will accept the offer unless a higher bid is made. TIP's board has recommended the 42p a share cash offer. But earlier this week two large shareholders with 9 per cent rejected the offer. The two shareholders were Itel Corporation of the US and Tiphook, which is TIP's main competitor. They said they believed that they were supported privately by other shareholders. Their intervention may have prompted some institutions to delay acceptance in the hope of a higher price. TIP's board said yesterday that shareholders should accept the offer now rather than wait for potential longer term recovery. GE Capital said it had the backing of 59.6 per cent of TIP's shareholders holding 86.5m shares.</p>

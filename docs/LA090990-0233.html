			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOME 'CURES' FOR 'HOME SICK' SUFFERERS  </P> <P> I grew up quite happily in a rented bungalow in a blue-collar neighborhood in  Los Angeles. I have for the most part lived in rented apartments since then.  </P> <P> I have never felt deprived nor depressed. My two children are not depressed,  and for that matter, none of my friends, including those who grew up in and  raised or are raising their children in apartments.  </P> <P> This is a classic California problem and I have a classic solution. If these  people live to own a home then they should move to a state where they can do  just that. Or better still, they can look at those who are not renters, but are  homeless, many of whom once owned houses but lost them and still "keep on  keeping on." Life is transitory at best, and these people should try to find  something more permanent in their lives than chasing illusions of happiness.  </P> <P> MARILYN L. BLOCK  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

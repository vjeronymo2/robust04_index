			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WARNER BLASTS SONY OVER GUBER-PETERS CONTRACT;  </P> <P> ENTERTAINMENT: THE MOVIE COMPANY SAYS THE PRODUCERS' CONTRACT WITH COLUMBIA  PICTURES REPRESENTS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST.  </P> <P> In an ongoing legal battle for Hollywood's hottest producers, Warner Bros. on  Monday lambasted Sony Corp.'s contention that Peter Guber and Jon Peters can be  hired as chief executives of Columbia Pictures Entertainment without violating  their exclusive movie production deal at Warner.  </P> <P> "That suggestion is not possible from a practical or ethical viewpoint. Guber  and Peters would have intolerable conflicts of interest in decision-making,"  said Warner Bros. Chairman Robert A. Daly in a new affidavit.  </P> <P> In a similarly frosty tone, Warner Bros. President Terry Semel denied that he  ever orally agreed to let Guber and Peters terminate their written agreement if  they got the chance to own or operate another studio.  </P> <P> At issue is Sony's hiring of the producers of "Batman" and a string of other  hits to run Columbia Pictures, which Sony is acquiring in a $3.4-billion tender  offer set to expire today. Guber and Peters accepted their new Columbia posts  on Sept. 27 without obtaining a release from Warner.  </P> <P> Sony and Warner are due to square off Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court,  where Warner is seeking a preliminary injunction to bar Guber and Peters from  "reneging" on their five-year contract signed seven months ago. Warner contends  that it has already invested or committed $13 million in 50 new projects being  developed by Guber and Peters.  </P> <P> Sony, for its part, argued in its response last week that "California courts  look down upon injunctions limiting a person's employment opportunities."  </P> <P> In an 11-page statement attached to Sony's filing, CBS Records President and  Chief Executive Walter R. Yetnikoff detailed his behind-the-scenes role for the  first time. Sony acquired CBS Records last year, and CBS Records and Warner's  three record companies have continued a fierce rivalry.  </P> <P> In his sworn statement, Yetnikoff accused Time Warner Co-Chairman Steven J.  Ross of bias against the Japanese or Sony dating back to 1987, when Sony  decided to bid for the record company. According to Yetnikoff, Ross "even  offered to act as my personal adviser to help construct a deal that would avoid  a sale to Sony, and in fact attempted to do so."  </P> <P> Yetnikoff also insisted that Sony never set out to "raid" Warner, although the  CBS Records executive said he, Guber and Peters had "long shared a hope of  working together some day."  </P> <P> According to Yetnikoff, Sony approached three other candidates to head Columbia  while Yetnikoff was "in resident treatment at a health facility in Minnesota"  in August and early September. After leaving the Minnesota facility Sept. 10,  Yetnikoff said, he decided to call Guber and did so four days later. In  describing subsequent meetings, Yetnikoff said, "Guber and Peters assured us .  . . that Warner presented no problem whatsoever. . . . They also assured us  that they would have no trouble in obtaining a written release from Warner."  </P> <P> The CBS Records president said he never saw the Warner contract during the  September negotiations. By Oct. 3, however -- one week after Sony's bid for  Columbia was announced -- "it became apparent that Guber and Peters were having  difficulty with Warner" and Sony asked "for the first time" to hear the  contract's relevant language, the statement said.  </P> <P> Yetnikoff -- who is a lawyer -- said he concluded that a formal release from  Warner was not necessary since Guber and Peters were being hired as chief  executives and not as movie producers. (Sony contends that the Warner contract  is limited to movie production.)  </P> <P> In Warner's supplemental filings Monday, longtime studio chief Daly took strong  exception to the notion that Guber and Peters could work at two studios  simultaneously.  </P> <P> "As chief executives of a studio, they would be heavily involved in creative  decisions. For example, if Guber and Peters had a new concept for a film or  were able to attract a promising new literary work or a star actor or director,  to which studio would they allocate the asset?" Daly asked.  </P> <P> Daly also took issue with Guber's claim that Guber kept his negotiations with  Sony secret for fear that there might be premature disclosure "and presumably  trading on inside information, since Columbia and Guber-Peters Entertainment  Co. are both public companies." The Warner Bros. chairman pointed out that he  had respected Guber's confidence in the past when Guber confided that he  intended to make large investments in two other publicly traded entertainment  companies.  </P> <P> Semel, the No. 2 executive at the Warner studio in Burbank, refuted Guber and  Peters' contentions that he was willing to let them out of their Warner  contract.  </P> <P> "I do not make oral agreements to terminate written agreements, especially when  they involve key talent and millions of dollars," Semel said in his latest  filing. According to Semel, Guber was told that Warner would not release him  from the five-year contract in a phone call on Sept. 25 -- "two days before  Guber and Peters signed their agreement with Sony."  </P> <P> In that same phone conversation, Guber told Semel that he had "negotiated  secretly because he feared Mr. Ross would have called (Chairman Akio) Morita of  Sony and that would have put an end to his negotiations," the Semel affidavit  said.  </P> <P> And Ross, in a new declaration filed Monday, vehemently denied any  anti-Japanese bias, noting that he had entertained Morita in his home. Ross  said he never counseled against the sale of CBS Records to a Japanese company,  although he did suggest a tax-free spinoff to CBS shareholders as most  beneficial.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CS LONG BEACH FINALLY STOPS NEW MEXICO ST., GOES ON TO WIN, 55-48  </P> <P> Just when it seemed neither team would stop the other, Cal State Long Beach got  some defense and escaped with a 55-48 Big West Conference victory over winless  New Mexico State Saturday at Long Beach.  </P> <P> It took a late touchdown on an interception by Pepper Jenkins for the 49ers to  stave off the Aggies, who rolled up 634 yards.  </P> <P> The wild game at Veterans Stadium may have had more yards than fans. There were  1,100 yards in total offense. There was a crowd estimated at 1,000, although  Long Beach officials said the attendance was unavailable.  </P> <P> The 49ers, 3-3 overall and 1-2 in the Big West, had to overcome a 21-0 lead to  avoid losing to a team that hasn't won a conference game in three years. New  Mexico State (0-5, 0-2) has lost 11 consecutive games over two seasons and 22  in a row in the Big West.  </P> <P> "I've never seen a group work so hard to be rewarded so little," Aggie Coach  Mike Knoll said. "They know success is right around the corner."  </P> <P> The Aggies trailed, 48-45, and were driving late in the fourth quarter when  Jenkins intercepted Phil Vinson's pass, which was tipped by defensive end  Richard Hensley, and ran 51 yards for a touchdown.  </P> <P> Before that the 49ers had little success against Vinson, who completed 25  passes for 405 yards and three touchdowns, or fullback Anthony Singleton, who  rushed for 137 yards.  </P> <P> "We kept coming to the sidelines, saying, 'It's gonna change, it's gonna  change,' " Jenkins said. "That interception changed it a lot."  </P> <P> Both teams were unstoppable in the third quarter. New Mexico State drove 80  yards to build a 35-21 lead. Long Beach drove 90 yards for a touchdown. The  Aggies then drove 85 for another touchdown. The 49ers answered by going 62  yards in a little more than a minute, scoring on a 50-yard pass play from Paul  Oates to Sean Foster.  </P> <P> After forcing the Aggies to punt, the 49ers tied the game, 42-42, on a 10-yard  run by Freddie Leslie. Only 15 seconds later, after an interception by Marc  Tourville, Foster made a leaping catch in the end zone of Oates' 27-yard pass  to put the 49ers ahead, 48-42.  </P> <P> The 41 points in the third quarter were one fewer than what the teams combined  for in the second period.  </P> <P> Oates passed for 270 yards and four touchdowns, Foster caught seven passes for  130 yards and tailback Jeff Fassett ran for 133 yards, including one of 57 in  the second quarter that gave the 49ers their first touchdown.  </P></p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Progress on N Ireland unlikely before Euro elections The government has virtually given up hope of making further significant headway in forging a lasting political settlement in Northern Ireland before the European elections in June. This follows Monday's announcement by the Ulster Unionists, the province's largest political party, that it would not return to round-table talks with Dublin and other constitutional parties. Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, urged the government to concentrate on setting up an internal Ulster assembly - a proposal likely to be vetoed by Mr John Hume's mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party. London's pessimism over the immediate prospects for further progress emerged at Westminster last night as in the US Mr John Major voiced his determination to press ahead with the search for a comprehensive settlement. The prime minister's reaffirmation of the so-called three-stranded approach came after President Bill Clinton carefully avoided questions on whether the US administration would again allow Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, to visit the US. However, speaking at the White House after talks with Mr Major, Mr Clinton again offered public support for last December's Anglo-Irish declaration as the framework for eventual peace in Northern Ireland. Senior British officials interpreted this as a clear signal that Mr Adams would in future be barred from the US unless and until Sinn Fein renounced IRA violence. Ministers have interpreted the UUP's announcement as in effect the start of a three-month period of political manoeuvring in the run-up to the European elections. The UUP is anxious to protect its flank against Rev Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionist party, which is boycotting bilateral talks with London co-ordinated by Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister. Mr Major refused to accept that the UUP's disavowal of an Anglo-Irish dimension to a settlement meant the process was doomed. The Anglo-Irish liaison committee responsible for exchanging ideas on political progress in Ulster has met once since Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, Irish prime minister, agreed last month to put renewed emphasis on the joint talks. Efforts were under way at Westminster last night to arrange a meeting between Mr Molyneaux and Mr Ancram at which the UUP leader would be asked to clarify his position. Expectations are high at Westminster that further moves to set up a select committee for Northern Ireland will take place before the end of this month. This would be welcomed by unionists.

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Howden expects to settle MT dispute Howden Group's shares yesterday rose 7p to 50p after the Glasgow-based engineer announced that settlement of its dispute with MT Group was expected before the end of the year. The long-running dispute centres on a contract to supply tunnelling machines to Denmark, where MT, the international consortium, is constructing twin rail tunnels under the Great Belt waterway. In the year to April 30, reduced provisions of Pounds 1.07m (Pounds 10.4m) related to the matter helped Howden lift pre-tax profits to Pounds 18.1m (Pounds 2.99m). Howden said yesterday that a further announcement would be made shortly.</p>

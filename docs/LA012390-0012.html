			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE FLOW OF COMBAT NEWS WAS A STRANGLED TRICKLE;  </P> <P> MEDIA: THE SEQUESTERING OF REPORTERS AFTER THE PANAMA INVASION PROVES THE  PENTAGON'S OPENNESS TO COVERAGE A SHAM.  </P> <P> Two hours before U.S. troops began their combat assault in Panama, 16 reporters  and photographers lifted off from Andrews Air Force Base aboard an Air Force  C-141. Their mission was to cover the fighting and to share with all media  their reports, photographs and video of this historic event in U.S. history.  </P> <P> The concept of a press pool to cover such military operations was conceived  after the 1983 invasion of Grenada, during which the news media were completely  and apparently deliberately frozen out. A Pentagon commission concluded that  prohibiting press coverage in Grenada was improper and recommended that in  future combat situations, military commanders should make provisions for at  least a small pool of journalists to witness, record and document the action.  The commission's report was adopted as official Pentagon policy.  </P> <P> Now the combat phase of Operation Just Cause is over and it can be said with  certainty that the policy is being ignored. The Pentagon is not living up to  its agreement with the American media or, by extension, the American people and  their right to know.  </P> <P> As pool television correspondent Fred Francis said in his after-action report,  "The pool was repeatedly denied or ignored when it asked for access to  front-line troops, wounded soldiers -- simple interviews." Denied access to the  combat area, the pool was virtually sequestered at the Quarry Heights military  facility during the first 36 hours of fighting. Less than two miles from Quarry  Heights, American soldiers were moving in on Noriega's headquarters, which was  ablaze. When pool members asked to go there, they were told that it was "too  dangerous." When Francis tried to interview an Army major general whose  paratroops had seized the international airport, the officer said, "Sorry, my  operational orders are that I cannot let you talk with any of my men. I can't  speak with you."  </P> <P> The press pool did not produce one eyewitness account, one still picture or  even 10 seconds of television video that showed how American forces  successfully completed their mission.  </P> <P> The day after the invasion began, the Pentagon, apparently thinking the  situation was "well in hand," authorized the press to charter an L-1011 to fly  169 more journalists, including me, and about 25,000 pounds of electronic gear  into Howard Air Force Base. We were greeted by a wide-eyed master sergeant,  apparently astounded by the size of our contingent, who explained that we would  not be allowed into Panama City because roving gangs of Noriega's "Dignity  Battalions" were still at large, certainly a legitimate reason. But if the  situation was not under control, why was the trip authorized?  </P> <P> For two days we were uncomfortably locked up in a recreation center on the air  base. Finally, the military said the influx of journalists was too much to  handle and most of us were airlifted back to the United States with nothing to  show for the trip.  </P> <P> There is official documentation of Operation Just Cause, but even that is  currently being withheld. Defense Department combat photographers were allowed  to go along with the invasion force, but according to Robert Hall, an aide to  Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, the combat photography is "for internal use."  </P> <P> What kind of a public information policy is this? Just Cause was the biggest  military operation since Vietnam, conducted in a country where the United  States government has had a considerable presence since the digging of the  Panama Canal. Some within the press ranks believe there is a deliberate policy  -- that the Bush Administration wants to manage the news and that the Pentagon  views the press as hostile. I'm not sure. But either through official design or  incredible ineptitude, the American press was not allowed to do its job. The  traditional eyewitnesses to history were blindfolded and a free society was not  well served.  </P></p>

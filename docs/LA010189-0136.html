			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> LINGUISTS DELVE MANY MILLENIA INTO PAST TO FIND MAN'S MOTHER TONGUE  </P> <P> If this renegade group of linguists could board a time machine, they probably  would press the accelerator to the floor -- moving backward through the ages to  a time before Sanskrit, English, Punjabi or Japanese.  </P> <P> Hurtling back to a remote part of the past before people ever learned to farm,  past the era when humans first used fire to a period 100,000 years ago.  </P> <P> That is the time they think they will find the critical evidence, the seedlings  that produced all of the world's languages, something they like to call the  Mother Tongue of Man.  </P> <P> Such a discovery, this group of mostly Soviet and East European researchers  believe, would prove what is called the monogenesis of language, the evolution  of the spoken word from a single tongue.  </P> <P> But while even these scientists think the 100,000-year mark could eventually  prove to be too deep in the remote past, they have made headway in  reconstructing hundreds of words they believe were spoken 15,000 to 30,000  years ago.  </P> <P> Historical linguist Vitaly Shevoroshkin of the University of Michigan in Ann  Arbor sees a host of applications for biology and anthropology in the work he  and his colleagues in the Soviet Union have done.  </P> <P> For one, the evolution of language not only shows "how some words have become  petrified," by not changing much over time but also how people have migrated  around the world.  </P> <P> Yet he laments the work has generated little interest in the West.  </P> <P> To hear Shevoroshkin tell it, only a handful of Americans are interested in  learning the words spoken by early Homo sapiens sapiens, the prehistoric humans  whom paleobiologists believe first appeared 100,000 years ago and are the  direct ancestors of modern people.  </P> <P> Shevoroshkin theorizes that it is possible to pinpoint at least a few original  words of man, elements from a language that served as the progenitor for all of  those ever spoken on Earth.  </P> <P> "We would like to reconstruct the proto-proto-proto language, if you will, the  Mother Tongue.  </P> <P> "A proto language means a language family like Indo-European. If you say  proto-proto that's an ancestor of a family, not everybody accepts that idea  especially people in the West.  </P> <P> "But when you say proto-proto-proto, that's something completely different.  Perhaps we may not find the mother tongue, the language of the world, maybe we  can go back only 30,000 years.  </P> <P> "There is a big gap between people speaking some type of language 30,000 years  ago and one spoken 100,000 years ago. That is a very big gap and we don't know  how to fill it."  </P> <P> As part of his quest, however, Shevoroshkin hopes to find the links that tie  the world's languages together and link them to the past.  </P> <P> To this end, he is building on the work of Soviet linguists Sergei Starostin,  Vladislav Marakovic Illic-Svityc and Aaron Dolgopolsky who more than 20 years  ago tediously reconstructed a language spoken 15,000 years ago they call  Nostratic, which means "our language."  </P> <P> Shevoroshkin said 1,000 words of Nostratic have been reconstructed by analysis  of common elements from languages he and other scholars believe grew out of the  ancient tongue.  </P> <P> Nostratic, they believe, gave rise to the Indo-European, Afro-Asiatic,  Kartvelian, Euralic, Dravidian, Altaic and Eskimo-Aleutian language families.  Hence, making Nostratic a superfamily of languages, or as Shevoroshkin would  put it -- a proto-proto language.  </P> <P> His hope is to continue on to the proto-proto-proto stage, if he can find the  clues that will link him to the remote past.  </P> <P> Language is unique to the human species, Shevoroshkin said, and one of the  primary characteristics like upright walking and a highly evolved brain that  set humans apart from their cousin primates, the Great Apes.  </P> <P> He believes by way of a technique called deep reconstruction, he can tap into  the vocabularies of ancient humans, seeking first those elements that exist in  every language in the world -- first and second person pronouns and names for  parts of the body.  </P> <P> Such studies produced one of the startling findings in Nostratic, he said.  </P> <P> By studying the word for "eye" in many languages, Soviet researchers were able  to surmise what the word was in Nostratic.  </P> <P> "In English, the word is eye. But in German it is auge, very similar. In old  Russian it is oko and in Nostratic we believe it was huka."  </P> <P> Words for nature also lend themselves to historic analysis, he said,  emphasizing that because there was no agriculture before 10,000 years ago there  are no words for domesticated animals other than dog.  </P> <P> Nostratic scholars have been able to trace that noun among others, he said.  </P> <P> But even Shevoroshkin admits this is an arduous task and acknowledges that many  historical linguists doubt he can delve too deeply into the remote past to find  a language before Nostratic.  </P> <P> Stanford University linguistic anthropologist Joseph Greenberg, who has  developed a technique called mass comparisons for analyzing various languages,  is one who questions how well Shevoroshkin will do.  </P> <P> Greenberg, himself interested in the evolution of the various languages of the  world, prefers not to seek the vocabularies of early humankind but to classify  Earth's myriad tongues past and present.  </P> <P> His work produced the classification of African languages in the 1950s, the  groupings generally accepted by linguists today.  </P> <P> Greenberg would not call the efforts of Shevoroshkin and his co-investigators  futile but allowed the exercise could prove tedious.  </P> <P> "There's enough to show that all human languages have a common origin," said  Greenberg. "I think the really interesting part comes in constructing a family  tree (of languages)."  </P> <P> But the problem with family trees, Shevoroshkin said, is that it is easy to  leave out vast groups of languages and never show how one is related to  another.  </P> <P> "Linguists divide languages into several families such as Uralic, Indo-European  or Afro-Asiatic, and so on. They usually say they are not related and if they  are there is no proof.  </P> <P> "It is our intention to find the proof and to go beyond that," Shevoroshkin  said of his endeavor.  </P> <P> "People in this area usually talk about relationships and that makes little  sense to me," offered Greenberg.  </P> <P> But linguist Merritt Ruhlen, formerly of Stanford, acknowledged recently in the  journal Science that Shevoroshkin probably is right, that there is an ancient  link tying the world's languages to a common tongue.  </P></p>

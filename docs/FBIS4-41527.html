			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Kuzmin] </F>   [Text] Tehran 26 June TASS -- The second round of talks  between the Tajik Government and opposition leaders, which is to  complete here on Monday, has not marked any considerable  breakthrough so far. According to well-informed sources, the  conflicting sides are unlikely to sign an agreement on a  cease-fire for the period of the Tehran talks. However, the  negotiating parties still hope to break the deadlock.    The second round of Tajik talks is expected to result in  signing a protocol to reiterate the commitment of both the  former Soviet republic's government and anti-government forces  to a political settlement of their differences at the  negotiating table, the U.N. special envoy for Tajikistan told  TASS on Sunday [26 June]. Another protocol is expected to be  signed with a view to set up a joint commission, which will  discuss settlement issues in periods between the rounds of  talks. This commission will work in Moscow.    In their respective interviews with TASS, the negotiating  parties accused each other of dragging out the talks and  rejecting any compromises. A Russian observer noted, however,  that the opposition leaders could give up linking the proposed  cease-fire to political amnesty in Tajikistan, termination of  criminal proceedings against political detainees and freedom to  political parties and the press. The government delegation  agrees to these demands in principle, but stresses that a  cease-fire should come first.</p>

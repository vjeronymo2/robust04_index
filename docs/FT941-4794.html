			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bond falls hit share prices towards the close - Market report Leading stocks stumbled badly at the close of trading yesterday as bond markets fell sharply and rumours circulated that a large rights issue was overhanging equities. The FT-SE 100 Index, which had been moving nervously all day, extended an earlier loss to close 41.5 down at 3,264.4. Hints of a big fund-raising surfaced in the stock market early, and market analysts identified several possible names among leading companies due to report profits this week. BAT Industries, weak yesterday, and Cadbury-Schweppes both featured prominently in the list. A deeper reason for the late setback in equities was a sell-off in gilt-edged securities, the second of the session. Uncertainty in bonds across Europe reflected uncertainty ahead of the outcome today of the Bundesbank's variable rate tender, which has turned attention once again to interest rate prospects. Strategists noted that bond markets were again exercising the power over stock markets which lay behind the shakeout of the past two weeks. But they said it was too early to say whether the equity rally of the two previous sessions had been seriously challenged. Shares opened higher but were quickly tripped up as derivatives markets turned off when transatlantic houses sold futures instruments. The first bout of selling in bonds then hit, driving the Footsie down by more than 23 points. Selling was modest and shares soon steadied as losses in gilts were reduced. UK economic data, showing an unexpected jump in manufacturing output in January, and thus leaning against the likelihood of an early cut in base rates, was a discouraging factor. However, traders said that the stock market was content to take its cue from bond prices. The final setback came very quickly and caused some analysts to suggest that market confidence was 'surprisingly weak'. There was little time for selling to spread across the range and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index finished only 14.6 down at 3,923.1. The FT-SE 100 Index was hit by weakness among the pharmaceutical stocks, which still command a strong following among fund managers. There was also weakness in the utility sectors, which had proved resilient during recent weakness in equities. Property stocks, too, took heavy casualties after a progress report from a leading City of London group cast a cloud over the supposed recovery in the commercial sector. Seaq volume increased to 676.2m shares from Monday's 576.3m, which returned a retail business worth of Pounds 1.25bn, at the lower end of average daily figures. Traders stressed that there was significant selling pressure yesterday and questioned whether the stock market was yet able to free itself from the pressure exerted by bond markets across Europe. The equity market is expected to face a test of its attempted recovery today, when the outcome of the Bundesbank money market repo tender may give a hint on the near term trend of interest rates in Europe. A batch of results from leading British companies will also underline the latest trends in dividends. Equities outperformed against government bonds during the recent sell-off with the help of improved dividend payments from the banking sector. This improvement in returns to equity investors is expected to continue if the recovery in the UK economy takes hold.</p>

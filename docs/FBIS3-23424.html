According to witnesses, al-Turabi  received one or two blows to the head by a karate expert.  Consequently, he fell down and his head collided with the  ground, causing him to lose consciousness for 15-20 minutes.    Al-Turabi arrived at the Civic Hospital's emergency section  at 1935. He was breathing normally, and his pulse and blood  pressure were stable and within normal range.    There was blood in the nostrils, the upper lip was swollen,  and there was a wound on the right rear side of the head. But no  operation was needed to stitch the wound.    His eyes opened automatically, and he responded to verbal  directions most of the time. But his verbal responses were not  logical. Despite this, he showed no sign of weakness at the time.    A sectional brain scan showed a concussion in the front left  side and temple. But the examination showed no blockage at the  base of the skull, excluding a slight swelling in the left  section of the skull.    Treatment with dexamethasone was initiated and Dr. al-Turabi  spent the night of his hospital admission in the intensive care  unit. On the following day (26 May), he was transferred to the  neurosurgery ward. Dr. 'Abd-al-Amin visited Dr. al-Turabi on 27  May at the request of al-Turabi's family. Dr. 'Abd-al-Amin  suggested that al-Turabi be treated with minitol and phenytoin.    Repeated brain scans showed signs of a broader concussion  than shown initially by the preliminary tests. It also became  evident that there was great accumulation of fluids. It further  became manifestly clear that the patient had lost the ability to  speak.    On 28 May, Dr. al-Turabi seemed to be extremely exhausted  and  sleepy and totally unable to speak. Moreover, he was breathing  haltingly. (A test of carbon dioxide pressure in the blood  showed a reading of 47 TUR (measuring unit). He was readmitted  to the intensive care unit and hooked to intravenous tubes and a  breathing machine. His condition remained stable until the tube  leading to the lungs through the trachea was removed. This was  followed by a weakness of 4/5 degrees on the right side and  total loss of speech.    On 2 June, al-Turabi was taken out of the intensive care  unit. On 4 June, a rash appeared on his skin, and it was  attributed to an allergic reaction to the drug dilantin.  Consequently, it was decided to treat him with 250 milligrams of  valboric acid three times daily. His treatment with minitol was  suspended, the dosage of dexamethasone was reduced, and feeding  by tube was resumed.    After this, al-Turabi was able to take a few steps in his  room and could urinate without help from anybody. He also  regained his ability to understand verbal directions, along with  the ability to read and write. This was on 13 June. He also  became able to feed himself.    The treatment with valboric acid may continue for six  months.  It is likely that a degree of the inability to comprehend and a  large degree of the inability to speak will persist in a manner  that cannot be determined by the preliminary tests. If his  family agrees, Dr. al-Turabi can be helped to regain his fitness  in a special unit, either in the United States or in Europe.  This can be done on his way back to his country or shortly after  he arrives in Sudan. I personally prefer that he be treated at a  European center.</p>

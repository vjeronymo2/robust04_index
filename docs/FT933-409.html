			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Observer: Puff adder The marketing directors of 200 leading British companies would be well advised to put up their umbrellas this morning - even if it has stopped raining. Marooned on the Canberra, chugging up and down the English channel for three days, they are attending something called a Marketing Forum. Then, when there is absolutely no chance of escape, the ladies and gentlemen from British Gas, Hoover, Hertz and Shell will be out-hyped, weather permitting, by a helicopter drop of promotional literature. The progenitor of the cloudburst will be Paul Simons, chairman of Simons Palmer, the advertising agency whose activities include the How To Get Ahead in Business campaign for Virgin Atlantic. But whether 'bombing' 200 marketing directors with leaflets headlined Simons Who? is really The Way To Get Ahead In Advertising remains to be seen.</p>

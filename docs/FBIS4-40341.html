			<p>BFN     [Text] President Geydar Aliyev received the visiting CSCE  delegation headed by Jan Eliasson, chairman of the CSCE Minsk  Group, today. Jan Eliasson recalled that today, 15 June, marks  the first anniversary of Geydar Aliyev's return to Azerbaijan as  a leading official after a long time and said that the  Azerbaijan Government has taken important steps to end the war,  which has continued for more than six years. He noted that the  CSCE Minsk Group's close concern for the effort to end the war  is the outcome of one of those steps. The guest stressed:  Considering the proposals that have been recently made by the  mediating countries and the UN organization and, in particular,  focusing attention on the views expressed by the leading  officials of Armenia and Azerbaijan, we are making an effort to  end the war. [Words indistinct], that is the liberation of the  occupied territories, return of the refugees to their homes, and  restoration of the primary communications systems. That  objective can be achieved only if the talks are maintained and  the cease-fire agreement is heeded.    On his part, Geydar Aliyev said that Azerbaijan remains  fully  committed to the cease-fire in accordance with the agreement  that was reached earlier. He said: We have stressed several  times that we agree with the proposals that have been made by  the UN organization, the CSCE, and other mediating countries for  the finding of a peaceful solution to the Karabakh dispute.  That we agree with those proposals should not be taken to mean  that we will allow Azerbaijan's territorial integrity to be  harmed. We support a just peace. We welcome the fact that the  CSCE Minsk Group has recently adopted that concept in its  activities. Azerbaijan's leaders have stressed in the talks  that have been held on the question of the deployment of  military observers in the region that the Armenians in Karabakh  should not worry about their future when the Armenian military  units begin to withdraw from the areas they have occupied. The  UN and CSCE observers will give all the necessary guarantees to  them.    Altan Karamanoglu, Turkey's ambassador in Baku and  representative in the CSCE, attended the meeting. Speaker of  the Azerbaijan National Assembly Rasul Guliyev; foreign policy  adviser Vefa Gulizade; Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov; Defense  Minister Mamed- Rafi Mamedov; and other officials also attended  the meeting.</p>

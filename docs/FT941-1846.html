			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Seoul to ease domestic company finance rules South Korea plans to ease rules on domestic company financing through securities markets and allow securities houses to expand their operations, Reuter reports from Seoul. From April 1, manufacturing companies and small and medium-sized companies will be able to issue unlimited amounts of corporate bonds, the finance ministry said. Manufacturing companies will also be free to raise capital via rights issues, while securities firms will no longer need prior approval to relocate branches, change names or invest in other brokers, the ministry said. At present, the finance ministry sets limits on total corporate issues for a month. There are similar restrictions on rights issues. In addition, the government will no longer require institutional investors to buy more shares than they sell or make capital contributions to the stock market stabilisation fund. To encourage overseas portfolio investment, the ministry will adopt a 'negative system', in which securities companies will now be able to engage in all foreign exchange dealings except for those prohibited by law. Currently, the ministry has a 'positive system' which bans all offshore portfolio investment unless otherwise permitted by the law.</p>

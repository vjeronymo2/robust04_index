			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Dr. 'Ali Akbar Velayati by </F> al-Sayyid al-Mallah and Ahmad al-Suyufi in Cairo; date not given]    [Text] [AL-SHA'B] The question citizens in both Cairo and  Tehran must hear is what happened in your talks with Egyptian  Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa?    [Velayati] First, we are extremely happy to be in Cairo and  among the Egyptian people. We attribute great importance to  Egypt, its people, and its role. We believe that this country  and people play a major role in the Islamic world--a role no one  can deny, ignore, or forget. It is an important, historic, and  pivotal role, not only in Egypt, but throughout the whole  Islamic world.    [AL-SHA'B] But we would like to know what happened during  the meeting. Was the issue of restoring ties to normal  discussed?    [Velayati] If you mean the establishment of official  diplomatic ties, this was not discussed during the meeting,  which lasted one whole hour. However, what was discussed during  the meeting was everything that has to do with joint cooperation  between the two countries in international forums. In addition,  we discussed all the international issues of interest to the two  countries, such as Palestine, the war in Yemen, and the future  of the Nonaligned Movement and the Islamic Conference  Organization.    [AL-SHA'B] Do you have any specific ideas on restoring  relations to normal?    [Velayati] Undoubtedly, this requires action to reach joint  agreement, eliminate all suspicions, and remove misconceptions  on both sides.    [AL-SHA'B] Could we say there was some progress at this  meeting, or that it had some positive results?    [Velayati] Of course some progress was made. And of course  some positive points emerged. It is enough for me to tell you  this: I have been foreign minister of Iran for 13 years (since  1981) and this is my first visit to Egypt. My mere presence in  Egypt is a good and positive step. I can confirm to you that  our discussions were constructive and positive. During the  meeting, we affirmed both countries' desire to start good  bilateral cooperation in the international arena.    [AL-SHA'B] Now we come to the most thorny issue, the  long-standing accusation that the Islamic Republic of Iran is  exporting terrorism to the Islamic World, and even around the  world. What do you have to say about this accusation?    [Velayati] This is not new; Iran is not the first country to  be accused of such things. During the 'Abd-al-Nasir era, Egypt  itself was subjected to such accusations.    This is an old weapon the West uses to put pressure on  countries, especially those who refuse to submit to the control  of the Western powers. None of those who have leveled this  accusation can actually prove it. It is no more than dangling  the sword of Damocles over the heads of those who go against  Western and Zionist views. Notice, for example, that yesterday  Israel carried out bestial raids on the al-Biqa' Valley in  Lebanon, killing and injuring many people. I heard one of the  Israeli officials tell the London radio about this raid, saying  there is a batch of terrorists whom they have gone to kill.  Killing people falls into the realm of terrorism. Israel  kidnapped Mustafa al-Dirani from among his own children, and  then said he is a terrorist. Those who kidnap people from their  homes, terrorize them, and kill other people are the ones  accusing the kidnapped and dead of being terrorists. The killer  and kidnapper who is practicing all kinds of terrorism is not  being accused of terrorism. The Mustafa al-Dirani crime is a  peculiar one. Previously a batch of Israeli planes raided  Lebanon and it happened that one of the planes was downed and  the Israeli pilot captured. When the pilot was handed back,  al-Dirani was the one who handed him over, so he was accused of  having captured the pilot and was kidnapped. Who can claim that  one person is a terrorist and another person is not? It is a  strange game they use to gain control over countries. Praise be  to God this game has been exposed.    [AL-SHA'B] If there are good intentions to improve ties  between Iran and the Arab world, there are obstacles blocking  the way, including the disputed islands with the United Arab  Emirates [UAE]. Why don't we start by looking for a solution to  this crisis?    [Velayati] It is historically documented that these islands  belong to Iran, and we have the documents to prove it. We are  ready to send them to anyone who wants to see them. So why is  this issue being used as a pretext to stir up trouble with the  brothers by others, who are always lying in wait for us and are  never short of ways to do so. We want to stress, through your  paper, that we are ready to sit down with the UAE to negotiate  in accordance with the 1971 agreement. I personally visited the  UAE last year, met with His Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan,  and held good talks with him. We also met with his son, His  Highness Shaykh Hamdan, and the foreign minister, whom we  invited to visit Tehran, but he has not done so yet. So what  else could we have done? I went there personally and the  natural thing was for him to reciprocate the visit. I hereby,  through your paper, renew my invitation to him; and I hope he  will respond to it, because dialogue is the only way to resolve  our problems. Let met tell you about another incident. When we  were attending the nonaligned meeting in Jakarta with President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani, [UAE foreign minister] Rashid 'Abdallah  said: His Highness Shaykh Zayid asks you as Iranian officials  to adopt an appropriate stand and to act more appropriately  regarding the issue of the Abu-Musa islands. President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani immediately ordered us to send the director  general of the Iranian Foreign Ministry to discuss the Abu-Musa  issue. I immediately contacted him and we sent him to Abu-Musa  the same day. Rashid 'Abdallah told us that he was very pleased  about what we did. The director general of our ministry took  several measures to eliminate the problem. On his way back he  stopped over at the nearby Bandar-e 'Abbas to take the plane  back to Tehran, but he was surprised to hear of a Gulf  Cooperation Council statement denouncing Iran. For the record,  Shaykh Rashid 'Abdallah was not present when the statement was  issued.    [AL-SHA'B] We want to know your precise position regarding  the Gaza-Jericho Agreement?    [Velayati] Our position now is the same as our position  before and our permanent position, which rejects any agreements  with the Zionists.    [AL-SHA'B] You have good ties with Syria, so what would you  do if Syria concluded a peace agreement with Israel? Would this  affect your relations?    [Velayati] We are against any agreement with Israel by any  party. This does not mean that we are not aware of the kind of  pressure to which Syria is being subjected by all sides.  Suffice it to mention here the numerous campaigns directed  against Lebanon, Syria's closest neighbor. If such agreements  were signed, naturally it would affect our bilateral relations.  We still consider Syria the only major country left to confront  Israeli domination.    [AL-SHA'B] We would like to learn about current relations  between you and Iraq. The Egyptian public is wondering why you  and Iraq do not settle the pending problems between you, since  you are both Islamic nations. Topping these pending issues is  the issue of the POW's and the aircraft you are holding in Iran.  Iraq still accuses you of treating it harshly. What do you have  to say about all of this?    [Velayati] Our viewpoint is the exact opposite of the Iraqi  viewpoint. Regarding the Iraqi aircraft we are holding, this  matter is governed by the Security Council resolutions.  Internationally, we are not authorized to return them. We  cannot violate Security Council resolutions. The problem will  be resolved within its own framework. Moreover, we are not the  only ones who have Iraqi aircraft in their possession. There  are some planes in other countries--Jordan, for example.    Regarding the prisoners, we say the same thing that Iraq  says. We have a mutual problem. They have our prisoners and we  have theirs. We believe that there should be a bilateral  exchange of prisoners. For your information, an Iranian  delegation will visit Iraq on 11 June. A month after that I  will visit Iraq myself. A few days ago I met with the Iraqi  foreign minister; we have frequent meetings. We are great  advocates of the belief that everything can be achieved through  dialogue and meetings.    [AL-SHA'B] We are puzzled by your stand regarding the  Kashmir issue and what is being said about your stand against  the Muslims. What is your real stand on this matter?    [Velayati] I wish to confirm to the two of you that not a  single Islamic or non-Islamic country has cooperated more with  Pakistan over the Kashmir issue. You can ask Pakistan if you  wish; we challenge you to find a country that has done one-third  as much as us.    [AL-SHA'B] Undoubtedly, you have made contributions on the  Bosnia issue. But the Islamic world expected you in particular  to take a more effective and influential stand than you have  taken so far. Why have you taken such a stand?    [Velayati] I was in Sarajevo last month. I do not wish to  tell you what we did there, but I will quote public statements  by President Alija Izetbegovic to correspondents: All aspects  of the Iranian role in Bosnia will go down in history. Had it  not been for Iran, Bosnia would not be in the condition we see  it in today. Iran has so far provided many forms of aid. It  has also made a proposal to give military aid.    Velayati then added: A few days ago, THE WASHINGTON POST  published an article in which it confirmed that Iranian planes  had transported shipments of arms to Bosnia. Irrespective of  the truth of this report, we do is not rule out this kind of  undertaking in dealing with Bosnia, where we have seen forms of  ugliness unknown to us before.    [AL-SHA'B] Before we end this dialogue, we wish to learn  about your stand on what you call the state of the "great  Satan."?    [Velayati] Our stand on the great Satan is the same. It has  not changed. It is the same old stand. There is nothing new in  it. We have no objections to establishing cordial relations with  any party on condition that that party respects our causes and  does not support our enemies.</p>

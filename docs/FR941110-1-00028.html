			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> 8. Provisions, in accordance with section 173(a)(5) of the Act, that require as a prerequisite to the issuance of any part D permit, an analysis of alternative sites, sizes, production processes, and environmental control techniques for proposed sources that demonstrates that the benefits of the proposed source significantly outweigh the environmental and social costs imposed as a result of its location, construction, or modification. New Jersey has included this analysis as part of its permit requirements. This provision is, therefore, approvable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Provisions, in accordance with section 173(d) of the Act, for supplying information from nonattainment NSR permits to EPA's control technology clearinghouse. New Jersey has not included this provision in its revised NSR nonattainment rule. New Jersey must revise its rule to incorporate this provision. Therefore, EPA finds this as a basis for disapproval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Provisions, in accordance with section 173(e) of the Act, that allow any existing or modified source that tests rocket engines or motors to use alternative or innovative means to offset emissions increases from firing and related cleaning if certain conditions are met, or impose a fee on such source. New Jersey's NSR nonattainment rule does not include provisions which allow for these alternative means of meeting offset requirements. While the Act requires this provision, since New Jersey has no sources which fall into this category, we are not proposing to disapprove on this basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Provisions, in accordance with section 819 of the Act, that effectively exempt activities related to stripper wells from the new NSR requirements of new subparts 2, 3, and 4 for PM&hyph;10, ozone, or carbon monoxide nonattainment areas classified as serious or less, and having a population of less than 350,000. New Jersey's NSR nonattainment rule does not include provisions which allow for these exemptions. However, since states are allowed under the Act to implement NSR provisions that are more stringent than the Act requirements, New Jersey's approach is acceptable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. Provisions, in accordance with section 328 of the Act, to assure that sources located on the outer continental shelf are subject to the same requirements applicable if the source were located in the corresponding onshore area. New Jersey's NSR nonattainment rule does not include provisions which address this requirement. It is EPA's understanding that New Jersey has no sources to which this requirement would apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. A definition, in accordance with sections 302(z) and 111(a)(3) of the Act, of ``stationary source'' reflecting Congressional intent that certain internal combustion engines be subject to control under state programs, but excluding the newly defined category of ``nonroad engines.'' New Jersey's NSR nonattainment rule does not include provisions which address this requirement. New Jersey must revise its definition of ``stationary source'' to exclude this category. EPA, therefore, finds this as a basis for disapproval. EPA will be proposing a definition of ``nonroad engines'' in its rulemaking package to implement provisions of part D of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. Exemptions, in accordance with section 415(b)(2) of the Act, from nonattainment NSR provisions for installation, operation, cessation, or removal of a temporary clean coal technology demonstration project. New Jersey's NSR nonattainment rule does not include provisions which allow for these exemptions. However, since states are allowed under the Act to implement NSR provisions that are more stringent than the Act requirements, New Jersey's approach is acceptable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. Provisions in accordance with section 173(a)(3) of the Act, that owners or operators of each proposed new or modified major stationary source demonstrate the compliance of all other major stationary sources under the same ownership in the state. New Jersey's revised rule requires this demonstration from all permit applicants. This provision is approvable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

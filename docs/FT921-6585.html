			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Arts: Uncle Vanya - Cottesloe Theatre The National Theatre's new production of Uncle Vanya at the Cottesloe is so exquisite that I shall concentrate this review on how such technical excellence is achieved rather than on Chekhov's play. The production, directed by Sean Mathias, has come up through the National's theatre studio, copiously housed in the Old Vic and adequately endowed by private sources. The studio is being developed as a training ground for British theatre as a whole. That means training not only in acting, but in every detail of how to use a stage. Performers are encouraged to question every word of the text, and there is even a special course in how to wear under-garments that do not show but lend elegance to the clothes on top. Never again should you see a Restoration comedy where the characters are ill-dressed underneath. Perfection is all. In the case of Uncle Vanya, there are other resources to hand: Sir Ian McKellen, for example. McKellen must now be counted as the foremost British actor of our age. Nevertheless, even he must have gained from the studio experience. His Vanya brims with effortless superiority: the secret of such apparent effortlessness, however, is that it requires a vast amount of work behind the scenes. Whenever he is on stage, McKellen not only scores in his own right, he also looks like the captain of the side. He plays Vanya very quietly, and the rest of the cast perform in the same way. Nothing is shouted that could be spoken softly. Every word, every sound, makes the audience crane forward to hear. Yet it is not the words so much as the movements, the physical presence, that stand out. Look at the way McKellen wears his corduroy suit, as if he had been born into it as a perfect fit. Watch the way he eats a plum, then wipes his moustache with a handkerchief. See him put on his hat, then look again at the way he walks, relaxes and crawls. There are a lot of physical movements in this production, especially in this part. I do not recall seeing a performance like it. Yet McKellen is not alone. He is matched, among others, by Janet McTeer's Yelena, the young wife of the elderly professor. Yelena is said in the text to be beautiful. Ms McTeer is certainly stunning: her beauty is of the imperial kind, mixed with an occasional loss of self-confidence. She uses her height to the full: the costuming, and her wearing of it, is superb, for she too descends to the floor. One of her best scenes comes not with the men, but with Sonya, daughter of the professor by his first marriage and niece to Vanya. Here is a view of real female intimacy. 'Do I have silly look on my face?' Sonya asks when she is telling Yelena of her love for the doctor, Astrov. Marvellously, she does. Played by Lesley Sharp, she is up among the stars. Astrov is often seen as a replica of Chekhov himself. He is played in this production by Antony Sher, who must be one of the hardest actors to discipline to a team performance, particularly when he is not the captain. He has learned from the studio. His best scene comes alongside Yelena when she has realised her love for him. Good as Sher is, he is also magnanimous in allowing Ms McTeer to stand out. Note her sudden onset of breathlessness. Listen also to the ticking of the clock in the background, another of the details in which the production excels. I have refrained deliberately from discussing the play as such. The character of Yelena is not developed and the piece has an unsatisfactory ending. Yet whatever you may think of Chekhov or Uncle Vanya, this production is a total triumph for the art of theatre. The credits extend all the way down the line, even to the watchmen who do not speak. Without the studio approach, it would not have been possible.</p>

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Finance and The Family: Slow start, strong Recovery - Unit Trusts M &amp; G has been to unit trusts what Walt Disney was to animation. Its First British Fixed trust, launched 62 years ago, was a new kind of open-ended investment fund and founded the UK unit trust industry. Today, Muncipal &amp; General has 31 unit trusts and its Recovery fund, with Pounds 1bn assets under management, is one of the three largest of the country's 1,490 unit trusts. Launched in 1969, it has had only two managers. David Tucker ran it from inception until 1987, when Richard Hughes was eased into the job after being recruited from Derbyshire county council a year earlier. Originally, Recovery went against conventional investment principles by choosing companies that most people thought would fail, says Hughes. The public was unimpressed, and the initial subscription was only Pounds 200,000. But this approach has sprouted at least a dozen funds outside M&amp;G since then, and Recovery's performance over 10 years has been impressive (as the chart shows). It has easily outstripped the FT-Actuaries All-Share, but performance has suffered over five years because of the recession. Only in the past few months has it again overtaken the FT-A All Share after several years of underperformance. Recovery funds do not prosper in times of deepening recession because they invest in companies which are already in difficulty. 'The fund had a very bad time in 1974 which knocked confidence but, after that recession, the money came in,' says Hughes. 'Things went quiet again in the 1981/82 recession. By 1983, the size of the fund was Pounds 85m. David Tucker could not see it growing by much more, but then we had very high inflows in 1986 until 1991.' The original philosophy has been refined through trial and error. The companies chosen today are not ones which are simply doing badly - their problems must be of a particular nature. They might have bad management or a weak balance sheet, or the shares may be falling because of fraud or a particular disaster. Hughes avoids investing in companies which depend on a turn in the economy for improved performance. In all cases, the price of the shares must have fallen and the company must have the potential to make a good profit once it tackles its problems. The trust holds 90 stocks but Commercial Union, Charter Consolidated, Royal Insurance, T &amp; N and Cookson account for 18-20 per cent of them. Recovery's sheer size means it can, and does, influence the strategy that a company in which it invests should take in order to 'recover' (although, as a unit trust, it is restricted to a maximum holding of 10 per cent of a company's share capital). 'Nearly Pounds 60m has gone into rights issues of one sort or another in the first half of this year,' says Hughes. 'Companies know that without a change in management we will not provide new capital. If we are already shareholders and things start to go wrong, we will put pressure on the non-executives to change the management.' Cookson, the industrial materials company, is one of many companies which has benefited from new money injected by M &amp; G. Hughes started buying into Cookson in March 1991 when it launched a rights issue. The shares were 126p; they are now around 210p. Money was also put into Granada, the leisure group, after poor profits and the resignation of the chief executive led to a rights issue in June 1991. Hughes bought at 150p; they are over 400p now. Recovery is predominantly UK-based but it sometimes ventures overseas. One of Hughes' best stocks was Quantum Chemicals, a US petrochemicals giant, which he bought just three months ago at Dollars 12.25. Earlier this month, Lord White, chairman of Hanson Industries, bid Dollars 20 and Hughes was quick to sell. On the negative side, one big disappointment has been Greycoat, the property company, which Hughes bought for 400p at the end of 1990; he stopped buying when the shares hit 45p in June 1992. Shares in Ferranti International, the electronics and defence concern, which were hit after the 1989 discovery of fraud in its US subsidiary, have not performed, either, but Hughes remains hopeful. 'Recovery fund managers are always optimistic,' he beams. What of the drawbacks of operating a large fund with so many stocks? One of the restrictions is sometimes having to reject smaller recovery shares which look appealing, although Hughes says only 30 per cent of the fund is in FT-100 companies. He runs Recovery himself; the only additional input is from colleagues who hold the same companies. 'We are long term, so we do not jump in and out of shares. I meet the companies once or twice a year.' It can take a long time for companies to recover and, with 45 per cent of the stock in the fund for more than five years, M &amp; G Recovery is like an enormous charabanc, taking new passengers on board continually. 'We hold on to shares in the hope that a dog will one day become a star.' Charges The initial charge on the units is 5 per cent, and the bid-offer spread on July 14 was 5.5 per cent. The annual charge is 1 per cent and the minimum investment is Pounds 500. The minimum monthly investment into the savings scheme is Pounds 50. Recovery qualifies for full Pep status; there are no extra charges for the Pep.</p>

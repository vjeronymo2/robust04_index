			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Trutzer, director of the Council for </F> Ethnic Minorities in the Romanian Government, by Cristina  Trepcea; place and date not given: "We Are Not Intimidated by  the Demands of Nationalities"]    [Text] [Trepcea] What have the Romanian authorities done  about meeting the commitments to the Council of Europe regarding  ethnic minorities?    [Trutzer] Amendment 3 to the report on Romania's application  for admission to the Council of Europe recommends the  implementation of a law on ethnic minorities and education in  the shortest time possible. In connection with the law on  ethnic minorities, I can say that there is a draft law on  minorities dated 7 December 1993 that was sent to the government  authorities of the Council members for their remarks and  amendments, and the text is to be submitted to the government to  formulate the final draft law. By mid-April it will be  forwarded to Parliament. In connection with the educational  law, I can say that the draft law has been passed by the  Commission for Education of the Chamber of Deputies and is to be  put on the agenda of the meetings. Henceforth, everything  depends on Parliament.    [Trepcea] What has been done in connection with the European  Charter for Local Autonomy and with the Charter for Regional or  Minority Languages -- Amendments 4 and 5?    [Trutzer] The text reads as follows: "It is recommended  that it be signed as soon as possible." So far, this charter  for regional languages has been ratified by a only one state,  Norway, which did so in November 1993. In our country, this  legal instrument will be examined by the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs, because it involves things that have to be studied  carefully, while reservations have to be formulated accurately.  The same applies to the European Charter on Local Autonomy.  The Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romanian [UDMR]  energetically demands that these two European charters be  ratified. In my opinion, discussions and preparations on the  Charter for Local Autonomy may begin in accordance with  Romania's Constitution, which, in Article 119, stipulates that  public management in territorial-administrative units is based  on the principles of local autonomy and decentralized public  services.    [Trepcea] What can you tell us about the creation and  operation of religious schools with a special emphasis on  teaching children of minority groups in their mother tongue?    [Trutzer] This is also included in the UDMR draft law and in  that of the Council for Ethnic Minorities. It has to be the  subject of a special law. It is a comprehensive issue that  requires time.    [Trepcea] In your view, has Romania done enough to abide by  its pledges?    [Trutzer] The majority of the issues are under discussion,  which is in a positive stage, and one can say that, even if the  pledges have not been honored yet, we are in the process of  honoring them. I think that we are in a good position.  Regarding the law on minorities, for instance, "formulating"  such a law in Switzerland took 20 years, and in Hungary three  years. Our draft law was ready within six months. On the other  hand, the rapporteurs of the Council of Europe have not come in  order to scare us. We have to see things positively. Romania  is going through a phase of serious economic difficulties. I  think that parliamentary activity is much more important in such  areas as economic and fiscal ones. Insofar as the minorities  are concerned, we have made steps forward. The activity carried  out by the Council for Ethnic Minorities in close cooperation  with ethnic minority groups proves this. We have to cooperate.  If one side pulls to the right and the other to the left, there  is no possibility of moving forward. I think that the visit by  the rapporteurs of the Council of Europe augurs well for Romania  and we are not at all scared of them. Certainly, we will not be  able to say that we have done what we have not yet done. What is  important, however, is not to involve politics in minority  problems. And there is another thing that should not be  forgotten: The problem of minorities does not exist only in  Romania; it is a European problem. It would be good if we were  the first to solve it, but we cannot make any pledges in this  respect.</p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Regalian sells Southwark asset for Pounds 5m below its book value REGALIAN PROPERTIES, the UK property company, yesterday announced the sale of Red Lion Court, a large office building situated on the Southwark riverside, for nearly Pounds 5m less than its book value. The 128,000 sq ft building, adjacent to the Financial Times editorial offices, was sold to an unnamed German investment company for Pounds 38.25m cash, compared with a book value of Pounds 43m. Mr Robert Perdeaux, finance director, said: 'We're not happy, but that is the market price today. There was a lot of interest and that was the best we could do.' He said the company either had to sell or wait an indeterminate amount of time for the hoped-for recovery in property prices. Regalian will use the proceeds of the sale to reduce its borrowings from Pounds 130m at the end of the last financial year. It has also generated nearly Pounds 12m from the sale of other commercial properties since that date. Mr Perdeaux confirmed that Red Lion Court was the last commercial property asset providing income for Regalian, but said the company still generated a 'fair cashflow' from residential property. The property is let to Lloyds bank with 23 years remaining on the lease at Pounds 34 per sq ft. Regalian said the sale will create no tax liabilities, and the contract will be completed by the end of August. Weatherall Green &amp; Smith, the chartered surveyors, has reduced the Law Society's rent in Chancery Lane from Pounds 690,000 a year in 1986 to Pounds 454,000 from November last year. That has reduced the rent by Pounds 10 to Pounds 17.50 per sq ft, as a result of the independent expert determination permitted under an rent review clause in the contract for the property.

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Foreign investors return to Indian equities - The market's recent rally Almost a year after winning permission to invest in Indian stock markets, foreign fund managers have started to put serious money into equities. In the past six weeks, about Dollars 450m in foreign institutional funds has flowed into Indian equities, Dollars 300m of it in the past two weeks. The inflow has triggered the sharpest rally in the market since last year's financial scandal involving banks and brokers brought the 1991-92 bull run to an end. From the end of July to last weekend, the BSE index rose 27.5 per cent. Earlier this week stock prices began to slip back on profit-taking, and yesterday fell 3 per cent to 2,655 on reports that forward trading in shares might be banned. However, while the market was one of the world's best emerging market performers last week with a 10 per cent advance in dollar terms, according to data supplied by the IFC, an affiliate of the World Bank, it remains barely changed on the year to date. Nevertheless, there is no mistaking the change in mood: the financial scandal is now seen as a thing of the past. Furthermore, foreign and domestic investors seem more confident than they were even three months ago about the country's economic outlook. The turning point was the defeat on July 28 of a no-confidence motion in the government of Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, who was under pressure from his political opponents to refute allegations that he received money from Mr Harshad Mehta, a broker deeply embroiled in last year's scandal. Investors breathed a sigh of relief as the threat to political stability disappeared, at least temporarily. They also welcomed signs of improved performance in the Indian economy, especially a sharp increase in exports which closed the trade deficit in the first three months of the current financial year (April-June 1993) to just Dollars 300m, down from Dollars 1.6bn a year ago. The monsoon rains, crucial to India's agrarian-based economy, have also been good in most parts of the country. The rise in equities has been accompanied by a five-fold increase in daily turnover in the past month - from Rs800m to Rs4bn (Dollars 25m to Dollars 127m). Brokers say this indicates the rally is broadly based and involves a large number of investors. Brokers in Bombay suggest that a major reason for the upsurge in foreign inward investment is a growing fear among international investors that the Chinese economy may be overheating. For investors seeking to place funds in a large developing country, India is an alternative to China, they say. However, Marlin Partners, a Bombay investment company, warns that the rally may not last because further price increases would rapidly trigger a surge in primary issues.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EMERGING MARKETS: IFC WEEKLY INVESTABLE PRICE INDICES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                           Dollar terms                     No. of      Aug 20      % Change      % Change Market              stocks        1993     over week    on Dec '92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina             (11)      662.75          +6.9         +14.2 Brazil                (44)      201.81         +12.0         +61.4 Chile                 (20)      429.66          +1.5          +2.7 Colombia*              (8)      443.11          +3.6          +4.2 Mexico                (58)      726.08          +3.1          +7.4 Venezuela**            (8)      478.58          -4.0          -7.9 East Asia South Korea***       (130)      100.02          +6.5          +1.9 Philippines           (11)      168.73          +3.0         +26.4 Taiwan, China****     (76)       84.14          -2.4         +14.0 South Asia India*****            (61)       93.61         +10.0          -0.1 Indonesia******       (31)       88.16          +2.4         +50.2 Malaysia              (61)      224.61          +3.3         +37.3 Pakistan*******        (8)      228.51          -0.7         +14.2 Thailand              (52)      265.04          -1.2         +15.0 Euro/Mid East Greece                (17)      247.96          -2.2         +27.0 Jordan                 (5)      152.20          -3.3         +30.3 Portugal              (16)      102.11          +7.8         +32.4 Turkey********        (31)      135.78         +11.1        +103.1  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                          Local currency terms                     No. of         Aug 20      % Change      % Change Market              stocks           1993     over week    on Dec '92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina             (11)     406,679.17          +6.9         +14.5 Brazil                (44)  23,701,388.57         +19.4       +1036.5 Chile                 (20)         702.38          +1.7          +9.5 Colombia*              (8)         632.25          +3.8          +3.4 Mexico                (58)         973.67          +3.1          +7.2 Venezuela**            (8)       1,019.20          -3.3          +9.2 East Asia South Korea***       (130)         106.57          +6.6          +4.7 Philippines           (11)         223.10          +1.5         +38.0 Taiwan, China****     (76)          84.30          -2.3         +20.9 South Asia India*****            (61)         103.52         +10.0          +8.4 Indonesia******       (31)         100.20          +2.4         +52.3 Malaysia              (61)         211.56          +3.3         +34.1 Pakistan*******        (8)         308.73          -0.7         +33.2 Thailand              (52)         264.88          -1.4         +13.6 Euro/Mid East Greece                (17)         394.38          -4.1         +38.5 Jordan                 (5)         217.91          -3.3         +31.4 Portugal              (16)         119.17          +3.8         +52.9 Turkey********        (31)        +738.18         +12.3        +175.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Indices are calculated at end-week, and weekly changes are percentage movement from the previous Friday.

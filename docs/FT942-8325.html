			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Retail sales figures help an uncertain market - Market Report Further signs of recovery in the domestic economy and favourable comments on the near-term outlook for base rates helped UK stocks regain some ground yesterday. Shares closed well below the day's best levels, however, and trading volume was unexciting. The mood turned less positive in the afternoon when Wall Street and the US Federal bond market made an uncertain start to the new session, although the Dow Average soon turned higher to show a gain of 14 points as London went home for the day. The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 Index at 3,122.8 for a net gain of 6.3 points. In early trading, the Footsie had moved up to 3,131.1, helped by news that domestic retail sales had risen by 0.4 per cent in April to show record levels for the three-month period. UK government bonds flinched only momentarily on this news and resumed their upward move as the Bank of France confirmed expectations of a cut in its intervention rate. Some nervousness over the US dollar, which has so far failed to respond to the increase in key rates by the Federal Reserve, marred the second half of the trading session, although hints of a renewed support operation for the US currency found no support on the bond trading desks. Also unsettling were reported views of the president of the Bundesbank that the interest rate horizon was now clear - translated by market analysts as a hint that no more cuts in German rates are planned at present. However, the markets took a favourable view of comments from the panel of independent forecasters to the British Treasury which said it saw no need for a rate rise in the UK at present. Gilts closed very firmly and equities noted that two panel members had wanted a further cut in rates. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index edged higher by 1.8 to a close of 3,713.5. Seaq volume was a healthy 621.9m shares, boosted by activity related to trading statements from a handful of leading British companies. On Wednesday, 722.4m shares through the Seaq network were worth Pounds 1.66bn at retail level. The further recovery in gilt-edged stocks, in spite of underlying worries about the outlook for domestic interest rates, was regarded by market strategists as favourable for any advance by the equity market. 'The latest Fed move may well usher in a period of stability on short-term US rates which should provide a more stable platform for global bonds and equity markets,' commented the global strategy team at NatWest Markets. At Nikko, strategists looked for the securities markets to take a 'more considered view' of the Fed's move over the next few days, noting that currency markets have failed so far to shake off the recent negative stance. There were signs of significant underlying activity as the institutions picked up stock in sectors which have suffered over the past fortnight. Motor industry shares recovered ground, and the investment focus turned back in favour of the manufacturing sectors. Support for the consumer-orientated stocks was more selective and centred on recent trading statements from leading names. Financial sectors were left to drift as investors sought out opportunities elsewhere, although there was some interest in property shares, which were again seen as offering significant recovery potential.</p>

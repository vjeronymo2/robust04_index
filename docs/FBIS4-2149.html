			<p>BFN     [Text] Hefei, April 5 (XINHUA) -- Over the past 15 years,  China has approved more than 170,000 foreign-funded enterprises,  involving 40 percent of the total foreign funds invested in  developing countries.    These figures were disclosed at a national conference on the  registration and management of foreign-funded enterprises held  today at Hefei, capital of east China's Anhui Province.    By the end of last year, China had 107,800 jointly-funded  enterprises, 25,500 cooperative enterprises and 34,200 solely  foreign-funded enterprises, involving more than 150 billion U.S.  dollars in foreign funds.    China began to open its door for foreign investment in 1978.    In 1984, fewer than 2,000 foreign-funded enterprises were  registered in China and over half of them had an investment of  only scores of thousands of U.S. dollars each.    As laws and regulations concerning foreign investment were  improved, foreign funds in the country multiplied rapidly.    In 1991 alone, the number of approved foreign-funded  enterprises equaled the total in the previous seven years.    By the end of 1993, 56 billion U.S. dollars of foreign funds  had poured into China, and the share of foreign investment in  the country's total investment in fixed assets increased from  2.5 percent in the 1980s to 13 percent.    Of the over 80,000 foreign-funded enterprises which have  already started operation, industrial enterprises yielded 302  billion yuan in output value last year, about 30 percent of the  domestic gross product of the country.    At present, foreign-funded enterprises have prevailed in the  production of sedan cars, elevators, color TV tubes, computer-  controlled exchange systems and optical fibers and cables, for  which China used to depend on imports.    Meanwhile, China now exports audio systems, color  televisions, cameras and watches in large quantities and has  become one of the largest household electronic apparatus  exporters in the world.    In 1993, foreign-funded enterprises contributed 34.4 percent  of the nation's import and export volume, which was about 67  billion U.S. dollars. They produced an export volume of 25.4  billion U.S. dollars, 27.5 percent of the nation's total.    By the end of 1993, 146 countries and regions had already  invested in China, and businessmen and organizations from over  120 countries and regions had set up resident missions in China.    According to statistics for 1993, more than 20 million  Chinese worked in foreign-funded enterprises.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the purposes of condition (4), a majority of disinterested members of the Board shall determine whether or not any proposed action adequately remedies any irreconcilable material conflict, but in no event will the Trust or Forum be required to establish a new funding medium for any variable contract. No Participating Insurance Company shall be required by this condition (4) to establish a new funding medium for any variable contract if an offer to do so has been declined by a vote of a majority of contractowners materially affected by the irreconcilable material conflict. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The determination by the Board of the existence of an irreconcilable material conflict and its implications shall be made known promptly in writing to all Participating Insurance Companies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Participating Insurance Companies will provide pass-through voting privileges to all variable contractowners so long as the Commission continues to interpret the 1940 Act as requiring pass-through voting privileges for variable contractowners. Accordingly, each Participating Insurance Company will vote shares of each Fund held in its separate accounts in a manner consistent with timely voting instructions received from contractowners. Each Participating Insurance Company also will vote shares of each Fund held in its separate accounts for which no timely voting instructions from contractowners are received, as well as shares it owns, in the same proportion as those shares for which voting instructions are received. Each Participating Insurance Company shall be responsible for assuring that each of their separate accounts participating in the Trust calculates voting privileges in a manner consistent with all other Participating Insurance Companies. The obligation to calculate voting privileges in a manner consistent with all other separate accounts investing in the Trust shall be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance Companies under their agreements governing participation in the Trust. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The Trust will notify all Participating Insurance Companies that prospectus disclosure regarding potential risks of mixed and shared funding may be appropriate. The Trust shall disclose in its Prospectus that: (a) Its shares are offered to insurance company separate accounts which fund both annuity and life insurance contracts; (b) because of differences of tax treatment or other considerations, the interests of various contractowners participating in the Trust might at some time be in conflict; and (c) the Board will monitor the Trust for any material conflicts and determine what action, if any, should be taken. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. All reports received by the Board regarding potential or existing conflicts, and all Board action with respect to determining the existence of a conflict, notifying Participating Insurance Companies of a conflict, and determining whether any proposed action adequately remedies a conflict, will be properly recorded in the minutes of the Board or other appropriate records, and such minutes or other records shall be made available to the Commission upon request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Business Travel (Update): Little competition Small central and south American airlines must join forces to compete with US carriers for a share of the high growth in travel from the US to Latin America and the Caribbean, according to Mr Robert Booth, an aviation consultant at the International Airline Chief Executive Officer conference in Florida. Alliances would help small airlines cut costs, which he said were 25 per cent higher than those of their major competitor, American Airlines. They had also to 'spend some money on promotion and advertising', he said.</p>

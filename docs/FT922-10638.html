			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: Pentland to source for LA Gear in Far East PENTLAND Group, the sporting goods distributor, has been appointed sourcing agent in the Far East for LA Gear, the US sports shoe and clothing maker. Pentland, best known for its investment in Reebok, which it sold last year, has also paid Dollars 14m (Pounds 7.9m) for a 6 per cent stake in LA Gear, the former glamour stock now under new management following losses. Pentland will source LA Gear mainly from Korea, Taiwan and China. The agreement lasts until December 1995 and will then continue on a six month rolling extension basis. Previously, the US company sourced its own products. Mr Frank Farrant, finance director, said he expected Pentland to source more than Dollars 300m of business each year for LA Gear. This will partly replace about Dollars 800m of business lost when Reebok stopped using Pentland as sourcing agent last December. 'We have been looking for replacements for Reebok, and this is a significant step,' he said. Pentland raised about Pounds 389m from the sale of its 32 per cent stake in Reebok. It has used the cash to buy Pony shoes, a 20 per cent stake in Adidas and the worldwide rights to Speedo, the swimwear brand. The company now holds net cash of about Pounds 265m. The LA Gear stake was bought at Dollars 11.25 per share, equal to Monday's closing price. Pentland also has a three-year option to increase the holding to 7.75 per cent but has agreed not to lift its stake beyond 9.9 per cent. Earlier this month LA Gear reported a first quarter net loss of Dollars 8.2m, compared with a Dollars 12.5m loss a year earlier. The company is being reshaped after Trefoil Capital Investors, a fund led by Mr Roy Disney, vice chairman of the entertainment empire, took a 30 per cent holding for Pounds 100m. Mr Farrant said Pentland's stake was opportunistic, as it believed LA Gear had 'bottomed out'. Pentland's shares gained 3p to 112p.</p>

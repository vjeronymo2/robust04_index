			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Samir Ja'ja', commander of the </F> Lebanese Forces, by correspondent Ahmad Birru in the studio;  date and place not given--recorded]    [Text] [Ja'ja'] It is regrettable that the Sayyidat  al-Najat Church bombing should be exploited in an attempt to  outdo us in our continuous defense of society for the past 15  years in which we offered thousands of martyrs for this purpose.  Many lightning strikes against the Lebanese Forces have been  launched. Dozens of persons from these forces were arrested and  all of them have subsequently been released. The Lebanese  Forces' positions are always open and the Army has inspected  them more than once. Finally, we were surprised to learn that  these centers have been confiscated. The given excuses and  rationale cannot be justified. I understand that the judicial  sources can level charges and convict people. However, I do not  know who accused the Lebanese Forces. Who are they? There have  been leaks to the press and rumors to the media. We can see  everything except a judicial investigation, which we should see.  Ten days have passed so far since a number of measures and  arrangements began which they said are security measures to  uncover the perpetrators of the Sayyidat al-Najat massacre. But  we have not seen anything tangible expect dark, clouds and  repression measures that are being taken under the excuse of  searching for the Sayyidat al-Najat attackers.    We were the first to demand uncovering those who carried out  the church bombing. But what is happening today is a case of  political repression of the Lebanese Forces.    [Birru] They say that at least three of the six suspects  have  been connected with or have confessed -- the investigation  continues -- that they have something to do with the issue.  Even the president has hinted that the investigations are about  to uncover the suspects. Three of them belong to or frequent  the Lebanese Forces centers and it is said that they left for  the occupied border strip and from there to Israel and then to  Europe and they returned to Kasrawan from Europe.    [Ja'ja'] This is our hope. We wish to see three persons  admit that they placed the bomb. All the Lebanese people want  this. But where are these three people? What are their names?  Let them appear before the court. Who is doing the  investigation? I do not know. Where are they? I do not know.  What are their names? Nobody knows. As for the excuse that  they visited the Lebanese Forces centers, any criminal can visit  anywhere. If someone visits you and commits a murder two days  later, this does not mean that you are also a criminal, that all  fingers should be pointed at you, and that you should be  accused. I categorically reject any charges against the  Lebanese Forces as an establishment. Moreover, we would like  the judiciary to carry out its responsibility and carry out its  legal measures. Otherwise what is the law for?    Three, five, six, or 10 made confessions. Great. Let us  uncover them and let the trial start so we know what is going  on. Regrettably, the atmosphere is foggy and no one knows what  is going on. There are a pack of rumors sometimes against the  Lebanese Forces, sometimes against monks, and sometimes other  groups. This is no investigation.    [Birru] The investigation is ongoing and the judiciary is  continuing its work. Do you trust the Lebanese investigation  and judiciary.    [Ja'ja'] I have every confidence in the Lebanese judiciary.  Since the investigation is still continuing, how can some state  circles accuse this or that person, this or that side? Let us  finish the investigation first and let us leave the case to the  judiciary and then we will all support the law.    [Birru] Let us return to your relations with the regime, the  state figures, the prime minister, the president, and the  political parties taking part in the government. How are these  relations now?    [Ja'ja'] If you please, before discussing these relations  now, I have a brief explanation of what is going on against the  Lebanese Forces. We all remember that following the Sayyidat  al-Najat blast, the commander of the Lebanese Forces held a news  conference in which he held the state responsible for the  explosion and for any disturbance that might occur in the  country. In my view what is going on now is that some of them  want to get even by accusing the Lebanese Forces, and hence  antagonizing the Lebanese Forces without anything and without  any proof, before the investigation is completed and before the  case is turned over to the Lebanese judiciary.    We regret this and we are complaining about it. For the past  ten days, immense security measures have been inacted against  the Ghidras centers. The Lebanese Forces centers have all been  stormed and inspected, which is natural. But finally they were  either occupied or confiscated under the pretext that they have  a link. I understand that a person may have a link with an  explosion or a security disturbance but for a building to have  connection and to be arrested, this I do not understand.    With regard to your second question on our relations with  senior state figures, and political parties in Lebanon, you are  well aware that we were at the forefront of those who promoted  the march of national reconciliation. Similarly, we will be the  last to abandon this march. Consequently, we pursue dialogue as  our basic approach in political action. Our relations with  most, if not all, state figures are good. Concerning politics,  we, at present, deem ourselves part of the political opposition.  This means that we do not approve of anything done by state  officials at present. We believe that there are many loopholes  that need to be plugged. We also believe that we can do more to  build a stronger Lebanon that can better shoulder its  responsibilities.    [Birru] Dr. Samir Ja'ja': You, just like other Lebanese  leaders, have recently gone to Syria to offer your condolences  on the death of Staff Major Basil al-Asad. This apparently  means that Samir Ja'ja' is maintaining ties with Damascus. What  is the nature of these ties at present?    [Ja'ja'] There have always been ties between the Lebanese  Forces and Damascus. Despite the difficult circumstances they  have experienced, these ties have never been severed. These  ties are still there. The visit I have made to Syria to offer  my condolences on the regrettable incident that took place in  Damascus is the least I could do.    [Birru] Are you critical of the Syrian role in aiding the  Lebanese regime, or of the Syrian-Lebanese ties?    [Ja'ja'] We support whatever strengthens the Lebanese state.  We support whatever contributes to the creation of a free and  strong Lebanese state that is capable of shouldering its  responsibilities, and ensuring for the Lebanese citizens their  dignity, sovereignty, freedom, and livelihood. However, what  has been taking place over the past two days does not speak well  for the good conduct of some state institutions. That is why we  hoped the officials holding constitutional posts would shoulder  their responsibilities to correct the current mistakes. We  believe that what is taking place constitutes a total repression  of political freedoms. This hurts Lebanon. We hope that this  repression will cease, and that the culprits who planted the  bomb at the Sayyidat al-Najat Church will be uncovered. It is  the true culprits of this blast who should be uncovered. We  should not use the Sayyidat al-Najat Church blast as a cover to  apply political pressure on a certain party. The culprits of  this blast must be uncovered, and the necessary security  precautions must be taken to protect the Lebanese people from  all mischief.    [Birru] Dr. Samir Ja'ja': General Michel 'Awn, a previous  rival, has recently spoken about the situation in Lebanon,  criticizing the state. He has also talked about a federation  between the Christians and Muslims in Lebanon. Do you share  with him the view regarding the need to reconsider the  territorial and political equation in Lebanon.    [Ja'ja'] You have said that Gen. Michel 'Awn is the  archrival  of the Lebanese Forces. He was our archrival four years ago.  Why do you insist that he is still our archrival at present?  Maybe, he is still the Lebanese Forces' rival. Maybe, he is no  longer the archrival of the Lebanese Forces.    [Birru, laughing] He is known as the archrival of the  Lebanese Forces.    [Ja'ja'] He wants to be seen as such. However, the Lebanese  Forces do not want to be seen as rivals of any party. With  regard to the issue of launching political plans, this is an  open field for everyone. Each and every political party in  Lebanon has the right to launch any political plan it deems fit,  as long as dialogue is the approach pursued, and as long as the  aim is to reach understanding. Each and every political party  has the right to raise any political plan at the negotiating  table. All other parties have the right to discuss this  political plan. This is my comment on this issue.    [Birru] Do you still raise the proposal of forming a  federation between Christians and Muslims in Lebanon?    [Ja'ja'] Our attitude toward this issue is well known. We  believe that the Lebanese parties must hold constant  consultations among themselves to reach the best possible  situation. We believe that the paramount concern is to ensure  the unity of Lebanon. Other issues are details that can be  discussed among all Lebanese parties. It goes without saying  that some of the proposals regarding details, or minor issues,  are better than others. We acknowledge this.    [Birru] To the best of my knowledge, municipal elections  will  be held one year from now. It is public knowledge that you  boycotted parliamentary elections for obvious reasons. Will you  take part in the next municipal elections?    [Ja'ja'] This is the third time municipal elections have  been  postponed. I have serious doubts that officials are serious in  their efforts to hold municipal elections. All of us know that  1995 will be the year of presidential elections. Consequently,  one can predict what officials will say then. They will say  that 1995 is the year of presidential elections. Hence,  municipal elections must be postponed, they will argue.  Similarly, in 1996, they will say that 1996 is the year of  parliamentary elections. Hence, they will postpone municipal  elections. The same scenario will be repeated.    [Birru] Dr. Samir Ja'ja': Thank you.    [Ja'ja'] You are most welcome.</p>

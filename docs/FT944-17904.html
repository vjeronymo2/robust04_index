			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Seoul raises foreigners' shares limit South Korea will raise its ceiling on foreign stock investments from 10 to 12 per cent on December 1 and increase the limit to 15 per cent next year, Mr Park Jae-yoon, the new finance minister, said yesterday. It is the first increase in the foreign shareholding ceiling since the Seoul bourse was opened to foreign investors in January 1992. Foreign investors have pushed for a higher limit since the shareholding quota has long been filled for the country's most attractive stocks. The Seoul bourse still remains one of the most closed in Asia to foreign investors, who now control 8.6 per cent of market capitalisation with a total of Dollars 9.2bn (Pounds 6.1bn) in net investments at the end of August. Leading investments come from the US with Dollars 2.8bn, the UK with Dollars 2.45bn and New Zealand with Dollars 417m. The two percentage point increase will allow an extra inflow of Dollars 2.9bn from overseas into the market. The 8 per cent foreign shareholding limit on Pohang Iron and Steel (Posco) and Korea Electric Power (Kepco), the two largest state-controlled companies, will be raised to 10 per cent next year. Posco and Kepco are also scheduled to become the first Korean companies to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange later this month. The finance ministry has resisted a rise in the ceiling because of worries that the capital inflow would increase inflationary pressure. In addition, Korean companies feared that a new influx of foreign capital would cause an appreciation of the Korean won, which would dampen exports. But the ministry finally bowed to growing pressure to increase the limit as Korea prepares to join the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 1996. The Korean general share index has surged to record high levels in recent weeks as domestic investors bought blue-chip stocks in anticipation that the foreign shareholding ceiling would be raised and further increase stock prices. The change had already been planned to be announced this week in connection with the annual meeting of the World Bank/IMF, before Mr Park's appointment as the new finance minister on Tuesday.</p>

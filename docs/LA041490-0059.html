			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PALMDALE HIGH WINS IMPROVEMENT AWARD  </P> <P> Palmdale High School was honored Friday as one of California's most improved  high schools in the results of an annual awards program announced by state  Superintendent of Public Instruction Bill Honig.  </P> <P> Of more than 800 public high schools in the state, Palmdale was one of only two  in Los Angeles County to receive the improvement award.  </P> <P> The other was Avalon High School in Long Beach. Only 17 high schools statewide  received the designation.  </P> <P> The improvement awards honor schools, generally low achievers in the past, that  have made substantial progress in bettering their performance in areas such as  student test scores, numbers of students enrolled in advanced classes and  dropout and attendance rates.  </P> <P> Palmdale still has a high dropout rate compared to other California high  schools, said Carol Kennedy, a state Department of Education analyst. But she  said the school made progress in getting more students enrolled in advanced  level classes and in improving scores.  </P></p>

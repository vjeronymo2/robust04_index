			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LITTLE SAP ZAPS PANCAKE FESTIVALS  </P> <P> The sap from maple trees is running so slow in parts of the Northeast that some  towns have canceled their annual pancake breakfasts for lack of syrup.  </P> <P> "One guy told me he didn't do enough to cover his pancakes," said Wilson Clark,  president of the Vermont Maple Sugarmakers' Assn.  </P> <P> The season for tapping maple trees for sap, which is boiled down to syrup, is  nearing the end in southern New England amid signs that warm weather and an  insect with a taste for maples will sharply lower syrup production. "Everybody  is down at least 50% to 75%, with more on the heavy side," said Edward  McColgan, president of the Massachusetts Maple Sugar Producers Assn.  </P></p>

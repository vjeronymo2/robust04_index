			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Kinkel points finger over UN Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, said yesterday that Britain and France remained opposed to German membership of the United Nations Security Council, Our Foreign Staff writes. In a statement likely to fuel controversy within the EC, and for Chancellor Helmut Kohl within his own government, he also said it would be 'unrealistic' to imagine the EC taking a seat on behalf of Europe in the council. 'The United States says Germany should be on the Security Council, but there are still two countries that are opposed - Britain and France,' Mr Kinkel said at a privately sponsored conference on US-German relations, according to Reuters news agency.</p>

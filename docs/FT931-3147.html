			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Japan plans second growth boost THE Japanese government will announce a second emergency package to stimulate the depressed economy before Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, visits Washington in mid-April for talks with President Bill Clinton. Leaders of the ruling Liberal Democratic party confirmed the plan to outline a supplementary budget before the visit. The move, which follows a Y10,700bn (Pounds 62.5bn) emergency package of public works spending announced last autumn, reflects the mounting domestic and international pressure on Japan to stimulate its economy. The Japanese economy grew by only 1.5 per cent last year, according to official figures last week. Most companies are expecting a third year of falling profits for the financial year to the end of this month. Meanwhile, the US is likely to intensify pressure on Japan to boost demand for imports to cut its ballooning trade surplus, which last month grew by 3.7 per cent from the year before to stand at Dollars 10.55bn (Pounds 7.4bn), according to government figures published yesterday. Although a further stimulus has been widely foreshadowed, details of the plan are far from agreed. Mr Seiroku Kajiyama, the LDP's secretary general, said the package would have to be worth more than last year's Y10,700bn. LDP leaders feel a higher figure will be needed to meet foreign demands and head off mounting US pressure over trade issues. The finance ministry opposes such a large package. It is thought to favour a more limited stimulus of between Y6,000bn and Y8,000bn. The contents of the package are also far from agreed. Support for an income tax cut, which was strongly backed by retailers, has waned over the past few weeks. Instead the package is likely to focus on tax cuts for housing and small business investment, combined with higher spending on social infrastructure projects such as hospitals and schools. Universities and schools budgets to buy computers will be expanded, in part to help the ailing electronics industry. Different wings of the LDP and several ministries are fighting over plans for government investment to upgrade the telecommunications infrastructure. Competing plans are being put forward by the ministries of posts, trade and industry, construction and transport. The Finance Ministry opposes government subsidies for telecommunications investment, arguing that such measures should be funded by NTT, the privatised telecommunications group. The rise in Japan's trade surplus for February was mainly caused by a sharp drop in the value of imports, which fell by 2.8 per cent, while exports fell by 0.5 per cent mainly because exports to Europe were 14.4 per cent down on the same month last year.</p>

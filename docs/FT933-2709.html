			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / New chief whip in Lords takes over LORD HESKETH resigned yesterday as government chief whip in the House of Lords, to be replaced by Viscount Ullswater, a junior minister in the Department of Employment Lord Hesketh, who cut a colourful figure as chief whip, told Mr John Major he wished to spend more time on family commitments. He had wished to give up his post, with its formal title of captain of the Gentlemen-at-Arms, for some time, but had waited until most of the government's legislation for the current session had been passed. The prime minister expressed the hope that Lord Hesketh might eventually re-join the government. His most notable achievement over the past two years was the safe and speedy passage of the Maastricht bill through the Lords, despite the high-profile opposition of a handful of senior Conservative rebels, including Lady Thatcher and Lord Tebbit. In other changes, Lord Henley becomes a junior employment minister; his place at the Department of Social Security is taken by Viscount Astor, a government whip. Lord Strathclyde, a junior environment minister, and Baroness Denton, a junior minister in the Department of Trade and Industry, change departments.</p>

			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Taxi war highlights big growth in racketeering THE MURDER of a taxi driver this week during the middle of the day on Wenceslas Square, one of Prague's main tourist and shopping boulevards, highlights the growing lawlessness sweeping the city's taxi trade, writes Patrick Blum. Thursday's victim had come to the defence of a woman passenger violently ejected from another taxi whose driver felt her destination was not distant enough to be profitable. According to CTK, the Czech news agency, the victim was kicked to death by the other driver for suggesting his behaviour gave taxi drivers a bad reputation and would soon leave them with only themselves to drive around the city. The killing was only the latest in a series of violent incidents which have claimed the lives of several drivers. The rising violence against taxi drivers, and the control of taxi stands by Mafia-style gangs, have led the Association of Prague Taxi Operators to call for action by the city authorities to improve safety and restore law and order but until now little has been done to improve the situation. A delegation of taxi drivers yesterday appealed to the mayor, Mr Jan Koukal, to 'free the Prague taxi service from the influence of people who assert their right to decide who will or will not use taxi stands and who recklessly decide on the unprecedented overcharging of customers.' Last June, the association warned that organised groups were forcing honest drivers away from the taxi stands through threats and by attacking them and damaging their vehicles. The association says the gangs consists of former secret police drivers, illegal money changers, and dealers in black market goods. It is not uncommon for taxi drivers to insist on a flat payment - usually several times the meter fare - or refuse to carry passengers. Dishonest drivers prey on unwary tourists and often ask for much more than the normal fare of Kcs12 (27p)per kilometre. This correspondent was thrown out - verbally - of a taxi on Old Town Square, the heart of the Czech capital, packed with thousands of tourists on any summer day, for insisting that the driver switch on his meter rather than pay a pre-set amount representing five times the real cost of the trip. My threat to report the incident to the police met with a laugh and a shrug. But while many honest taxi drivers are driven out of business or face threats, unwary passengers have also been robbed and attacked by drivers. For tourists it is best to avoid the taxi ranks in the town centre, and call a reliable taxi company on the telephone to avoid unpleasant surprises. As elsewhere in central and eastern Europe, the demise of communism has opened the door to the emergence of a new underworld involving a variety of criminal activities including racketeering, protection, prostitution, drugs dealing, and the illegal trade in arms and radio-active materials. Violence is not uncommon as gangs fight for control, while an understaffed, under-resourced, inexperienced and under-paid police force is overwhelmed by the rise in criminality.</p>

			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Trade and macroeconomics The Tokyo trade package is likely to help growth, jobs and output, even though some of the estimates given by summit participants are highly misleading. The main reason growth should benefit is given by that unsatisfactory, but occasionally unavoidable, word 'confidence'. News that increases the chances of a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round should raise what Keynes called the 'animal spirits' of businessmen when they consider whether to invest, increase stocks or take on workers. Although this effect is probable, I am much more certain of a negative statement. A breakdown of the Gatt talks and the associated risk of trade wars, would have dealt a severe blow to confidence at a time when it is fragile and would have risked turning prolonged recession into depression. It is, however, noticeable that neither academic macroeconomists nor economic commentators have been in the forefront of the trade debate. One of the reasons is the pressure of specialisation. Trade negotiations are detailed, commodity-by-commodity affairs which only full-time experts can follow properly. There is a more interesting reason for the lack of contact between the two worlds. This is the difficulty of making true intellectual contact, which goes back a very long time. In most popular histories of the Great Depression, the savage increase in the US tariffs under the Smoot-Hawley Act of 1930 is given a large role in converting the recession of the early 1930s into the Great Depression. Yet it receives hardly a mention in many monetarist and Keynesian accounts. I can find no reference to it or anything related to it in either Friedman's Monetary History or Galbraith's Great Crash. In contemporary debates, macroeconomists have used the threat of 'increased protection' (please not 'protectionism', which adds a redundant extra syllable and should be used only to describe the belief, not the phenomenon) to browbeat their opponents about what would happen if their own favourite nostrums failed to be accepted. There is a real difficulty in translating from the world of trade negotiations into that of conjunctural issues. The frequent citations of the number of jobs supposed to be created are based on the Gatt estimate of a Dollars 200bn (Pounds 133bn) per annum increase in world trade from a successful conclusion of the whole Uruguay Round. But this usage is a cheat. The Gatt estimate is of the increase in trade between countries, not of output, not of welfare and still less of employment. Freer trade reallocates jobs more efficiently inside each country but does not directly destroy or create new jobs. There are yet further reasons for the embarrassment of economists on trade issues. They can be summed up by Friedman's saying, 'Protection is better in theory; free trade is better in practice.' There have been recurrent complicated theories over the centuries trying to show that there are benefits to individual countries from certain carefully chosen kinds of protection. The May issue of the American Economic Review is partly devoted to professional disquiet on what the public and their students should therefore be told. Professor Paul Krugman, who has invented many of the supposed exceptions to free trade theory, now believes that the likely benefits are small; that any exceptions will be wrongly chosen; and that undergraduates will benefit more from a thorough exposure to the mainline case for free trade. Most popular support for protection has nothing to do with esoteric trade theories. 'How can we compete,' it is asked, 'with Czech workers being paid a tenth of ours and south-east Asian workers being paid one hundredth?' The most effective refutation is to be found not in trade theory but in the elementary macroeconomic exposition of the circular flow of funds. An excellent example is in Friedman's Free To Choose, where he shows step by step how the proceeds from Japanese exports (the bogey when he was writing) are used either directly to purchase goods from other countries or contribute indirectly by capital exports. The plague of popular economic discussion is the fear of what Mill called a general glut; and there is no more important task than to explain why a glut is extremely unlikely given a background of moderately sensible fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies.</p>

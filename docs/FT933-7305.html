			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / PLO veteran in Arafat protest THE simmering leadership crisis inside the Palestine Liberation Organisation grew yesterday as a veteran official withdrew from the PLO's executive. Mr Shafiq al-Hoot, the PLO's representative to Lebanon, is the second executive committee member in less than a week to protest publicly against what they say is the authoritarian leadership of Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman. They also point to the financial crunch within the PLO. Mr Hoot stopped short of resigning his post but said he would have nothing to do with the executive committee until the convening of the Palestine National Council, the Palestinian parliament-in-exile. He said he could no longer stand by and witness the PLO's 'destruction, the liquidation of its institutions and the scaring away of its workers'. He said Mr Arafat was making decisions about peace talks with Israel without consulting the executive committee and had ignored 'red lines' laid down by the PNC in 1991. Although Mr Hoot did not give any specific details of policy disagreements there is growing suspicion among Palestinians that Mr Arafat is prepared to make concessions to Israel over control of Israeli-occupied Arab East Jerusalem. The latest challenge to Mr Arafat comes amid demands for democratisation of the PLO and greater consultation about how best to pursue peace talks with Israel.</p>

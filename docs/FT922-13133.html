			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / UK Company News: Talks allow Cabra to lift threat to wind up Chelsea CABRA ESTATES, the heavily-indebted property company, yesterday lifted its threat to seek the winding-up of Chelsea football club, saying talks on the future of the club's west London ground had made satisfactory progress. The heads of an agreement have been signed, whereby the club will buy its Stamford Bridge ground from Cabra for about Pounds 13m in cash. Crucially, the property company has been assured that Chelsea has access to bank funds and now hopes that a formal agreement can be signed within weeks. Part of the deal would involve Chelsea relieving Cabra of its obligation to pay Fulham football club roughly Pounds 8m to leave its Craven Cottage ground (to share Stamford Bridge) to clear the way for redevelopment. Cabra warned that Chelsea might have to be wound up after the club did not come up with the Pounds 22.85m purchase price for Stamford Bridge by last week's deadline, set as part of a contract backed by recent High Court and Court of Appeal rulings.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article] </F>   [Text] Japan's trade surplus with its trading partners in  Asia has grown because Japanese enterprises have advanced into  Asian countries and the economy of the Asian region has grown  far faster than of other regions in the world. This trend shows  a change in the business strategies of Japanese enterprises.  Japanese enterprises have concluded that they should look to the  Asian market for their exports which voices relatively little  discontent with Japan and is expected to grow in the future  rather than increase their exports to the United States that may  trigger fresh bilateral trade friction.    Japan's trade surplus with Asian nations accounted for only  30 percent of its trade surplus with the United States by the  mid-1980's. Its surplus in trade with Asian nations, however,  has jumped about 30 percent every year since 1990 when Japanese  enterprises, beset by the appreciated yen, began to move their  production operations to Asian nations and as a result, Japan's  trade surplus with Asian nations has grown faster than that with  the United States which has grown less than 10 percent every  year.    There is a view that once Japanese enterprises slow down the  movement of their production operations to Asian nations,  exports from Asian nations to Japan will increase and Japan's  trade surplus with those nations will decrease. Yet this view  is held only by a small number of Japanese businessmen. They  believe that "most of the goods produced by locally incorporated  companies of Japanese firms in Asian nations are geared for  exports to the United States." The goods produced by those  locally affiliated companies are likely to become a factor in  increasing Asia's trade surplus with the United States, not in  decreasing Japan's trade surplus with Asian nations. With Japan  expected to boost its exports to Asian nations in anticipation  that their per capita incomes and economies will grow rapidly,  Japan's trade surplus with Asian countries is highly likely to  continue to grow. If these trends continue, Asian nations will  certainly ask Japan to boost its imports from them. There is a  possibility that the United States will intensify its criticism  of Japan, claiming "Japanese enterprises are moving their  production operations of goods exported to the United Sates to  Asian countries to avoid trade friction with the United States."</p>

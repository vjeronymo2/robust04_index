			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Seoul moves to cool row with North South Korea should drop a confrontational approach in dealing with North Korea and give Pyongyang time to resolve the issue of nuclear inspections, the South Korean foreign minister said yesterday. Mr Han Sung-joo's comments reflect growing concern in Seoul that diplomatic efforts to persuade North Korea to accept international nuclear inspections are in danger of being derailed. The US has warned that if North Korea will not allow the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to inspect all its declared nuclear facilities by February 21, the UN Security Council might consider economic sanctions, a step that North Korea has said is tantamount to war. North Korea on Monday also threatened to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and protested against the proposed US deployment of Patriot missiles to South Korea. Over the last week South Korean officials have sought to calm the war of words between Washington and Pyongyang. Prime Minister Lee Hoe-chang insisted that recent developments did not signify growing tensions on the Korean peninsula or an increased threat from the North. Although the Seoul government says it is co-operating closely with the US on the nuclear issue, Mr Han appeared to criticise the US deadline for acceptance of IAEA inspections. 'Even if North Korea earned time by the use of delaying tactics (in its negotiations with the IAEA), such time would not be of any help to North Korea's nuclear development programme,' he said. This reflects the view of most South Korean officials that the North is using the nuclear inspection issue to win concessions from the US, such as diplomatic recognition and economic aid. But there is a growing feeling in Washington that North Korea is intent on developing a nuclear weapon, if it has not already done so, and that it is playing for time to complete its nuclear programme. The issue could arouse anti-American feelings in South Korea, where the media are criticising 'American hardliners' for trying to raise tension on the peninsula and thereby prompt Seoul to buy US weapons. The IAEA is expected to state at its next board of governors meeting on February 21 that the continuity of nuclear safeguards in North Korea has been broken. This would set the stage for the Security Council to consider the issue. North Korea has blocked full IAEA inspections since it threatened to withdraw from the NPT last March, although it suspended its decision after holding high-level negotiations with the US. Pyongyang agreed a month ago to allow a resumption of IAEA inspections to guarantee the continuity of safeguards. But it has since disagreed with the UN agency on the extent of the inspections, claiming it does not have to accept the complete inspections demanded by the agency as its NPT membership is still under suspension. Some analysts believe the North is delaying full inspections until the US formally announces the suspension of military exercises in South Korea this year and agrees to hold another round of high-level talks on improved relations. But the US refuses to suspend the annual 'Team Spirit' exercise and resume discussions with the North until Pyongyang accepts full inspections and renews talks with South Korea on denuclearisation.</p>

			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Letter: Age no barrier to pensions Sir, Contrary to Alan Smallbone's assertion (Letter, March 26) that pension costs act against the employment prospects of the mature I would suggest he reinvestigates. The modern pension package is the increasingly popular 'money purchase' scheme. It is popular because cost-conscious employers see this as an accurate means of controlling and forecasting payroll costs, regardless of the age or turnover of their employees. Furthermore, many of these types of scheme are not tied to any statutory retirement age. When my grandchildren eventually arrive I know that their first question will be: 'What was an actuary, Dad?'

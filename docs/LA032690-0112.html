			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: 'RAPE' IN DENTIST'S OFFICE IS MORE LIKELY MERE FANTASY  </P> <P> Question: I don't know whether my mind has played a trick on me or whether I  was raped.  </P> <P> I have known my dentist for over 10 years. He is in his 60s, very professional,  and I always thought he was a gentleman. But last month something happened to  make me question this.  </P> <P> I had to have oral surgery and he gave me an IV sedative. The procedure was  done in his office with the door open and the hygienist assisting, but I am  sure I was sexually assaulted during the procedure.  </P> <P> I asked the hygienist whether she ever left the room and she insisted she was  there the whole time. She reassured me that nothing happened and that the  medicine could have made me imagine it.  </P> <P> Can a sedative do that? The experience seemed so real, but I don't want to  accuse my dentist of rape if it was all in my mind.  </P> <P> Answer: We don't doubt that there have been instances when an unethical health  professional has taken unfair advantage of a sedated patient. Don't assume,  however, that your dentist is at fault.  </P> <P> Evidence is mounting that intravenous sedation with benzodiazepines may induce  sexual fantasies, including disturbing situations like the one you describe.  One woman even took her dentist to court, despite the fact that her husband had  been standing next to her throughout the procedure. The husband testified on  the dentist's behalf.  </P> <P> Anyone undergoing a procedure that requires intravenous sedation should insist  on having a third person in the room at all times.  </P> <P> With the hygienist present and the door open, it is very unlikely that your  dentist engaged in any misconduct.  </P> <P> Q. What can you tell me about "Guarana," the concentrated energizer? It is sold  in health food stores as an herb for energy, mental alertness and as an  appetite suppressant.  </P> <P> A. Guarana comes from the crushed seeds of a Brazilian shrub. Although it has a  reputation as an appetite suppressant, aphrodisiac and a stimulant, its active  ingredient is no more mysterious than caffeine.  </P> <P> It contains 3% to 5% caffeine, about twice as much as coffee.  </P></p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / International Company News: Freia Marabou advances slightly FREIA MARABOU, the Norwegian chocolate and confectionery group, yesterday reported a slight increase in half-year pre-tax profits to NKr236m (Dollars 41m) from NKr225m a year earlier. The company pushed up profits in spite of a dip in chocolate sales. Group sales slipped to NKr2.608bn from NKr2.664bn due to exceptionally warm weather in May and June. Operating profit in the six-month period declined to NKr225m from NKr245m in the same period last year, but operating costs were reduced to NKr2.252bn from NKr2.310bn. The chocolate division saw operating income fall to NKr1.294bn from NKr1.371bn, although its share of the Nordic market was maintained at 32 per cent. Chocolate exports increased, especially to Germany where they rose by 28 per cent, measured in value. Exports to the UK fell slightly, but tax-free sales advanced 20 per cent. Freia said work began in May on a new chocolate plant in Belgium and trial production would start in the second half of 1993. In the confectionery division, first-half operating income fell to NKr325m from NKr336m, but operating profit rose slightly to NKr17m from NKr16m. The snacks division saw operating income reduced to NKr498m from NKr507m but operating profit increased to NKr68m from NKr57m.</p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Fashion: Wearable Westwood passes the test - Jane Mulvagh and five friends cast a professional eye over the clothes of a famously outrageous designer - and are pleasantly surprised VIVIENNE Westwood has an image problem. While she is keen to be taken seriously as a designer of wearable clothes rather than protest-laden costume, to most her name conjures up platform shoes that Naomi Campbell falls off or nude bodysuits decorated with modesty-feigning fig leaves. She seems to have wilfully driven herself up a marketing cul-de-sac, destined to dress only the impecunious and provocative under-25s. But British fashion's class clown, like all class clowns, has grown up and seeks our respect. She intends to capitalise on her indisputable talent by building a design empire as impressive as those of her Continental copyists and to harness her skills to a major European couture house. She is, in addition, negotiating with a multinational pension fund, for the use of a dignified and imposing building in Mayfair with a serious sartorial history. If she pulls that off Vivienne Westwood will really be on the map. Her company has reached that crucial transition point, like Biba in the early 1970s, between cult and mainstream clothes designer, a point at which it is essential to understand fully both customer needs and pricing points. Over the past three years some working women, curious enough to break through the popular misconception, have discovered that while 30 per cent of her clothes tend to be impossibly, if entertainingly, unwearable the rest - Miss Marple tweeds, 'New Look' tartans, velvet Lord Fauntleroy separates , Dangerous Liaisons corsets - are sassy and flattering. She indulges their desire to, at times, adopt a slatternly prettiness. Her curvy tailoring spearheaded the reaction against hard-edged power dressing and she has long disliked the skeletal figure, often putting women over 60 and pregnant or voluptuous women (regarded by the judgmental fashion industry as fat) on the catwalk, and opening our eyes to sensuousness and gentleness rather than predatory and commercial sex appeal. Her efforts have earned her two Designer of The Year awards, front-row seats at Dior, Lacroix and Alaia in Paris in public recognition of her penetrating influence. Women's Wear Daily has elected her as one of the top five designers of this century - alongside Chanel and Saint Laurent. Acclaim within the industry is one thing, but women wearing Westwood for everyday working lives is another. The Financial Times invited five women, ranging in age from their 30s to 60s  -a lawyer, a journalist, an auctioneer, a corporate development executive and an entrepreneur - to comment on her autumn collection. Four of them had never worn her clothes and shared the typical preconceptions about her work but all share an enthusiastic appreciation of design, mind about what they wear and have a reasonable budget but little time to shop. Anna Somers Cocks, editor of The Art Newspaper, has never worn Westwood. She is 5 ft 3 in and sports the kind of deliciously voluptuous figure that real men love and the fashion industry loathes. Scanning the rails she summed up Westwood's appeal: 'Her clothes are the transvestite idea of what a woman should look like, converted back into what women can wear and because transvestites have an acute and dramatic sense of what looks feminine, in fact they look wonderful.' Anna loves the way the corsets encourage you to 'play at being a 17th century trollop' (her husband insists that she only wear them for him, so winning is their impact]). 'The shop makes one feel one is trying on the clothes of other generations, like fancy dress.' She feels, though, that, given the price, some of the workmanship and materials are too cheap, though the wools and tweeds are well-made. Claire Enders, Corporate Development Manager at Thorn EMI, is 5 ft 11 in tall and beanpole slim. She is no stranger to Westwood. 'I started wearing her clothes three years ago - those narrow, stretchy gold 'boule' dresses. Her jackets are first-rate and the large shirts with massive collars and big sleeves are magnificent and incredibly comfortable to wear. Her clothes are fun.' For the office Claire sees her clothes as an armour. 'You're surrounded by the enemy sex.' Mostly she dresses in generic executive woman mode, wearing dark suits with longline jackets and short skirts, never trousers, and seeking out clothes that 'create good feelings which you project and people think - right, she's cool and in control.' In spite of such self-imposed strictures for office dress Claire found several suitable suits. She admires Westwood's interesting shapes, such as the tucked darts, ruched skirts and romantic jackets, whose clever details 'may not be noticed by many but certainly give you a sense of style and confidence. The popular image that she has - all those odd things - actually make you feel good and completely different. They're not glamorous so much as eccentric and interesting. They please me.' Her verdict: good jackets, disappointing skirts. Three of the women feel that the range of sizes is poor, that the skirt/jacket options have not been practically thought out, that the skirt shapes are too 'clever' and unflattering and that the shop presentation could be off-putting to a first-time customer. All loved the jackets and coats. Eliza Mellor, a tax law solicitor at Nicholson, Graham &amp; Jones, believes that the uninitiated would have difficulty making the most of the original clothes. 'For example, I did not realise that her rose-bud shirts go with the tartans.' Eliza does not have to dress to impress colleagues. 'I simply have to ensure that my client feels comfortable and so I mustn't overaccentuate my appearance as they can be scared by too unusual a dress.' She loves the tartan jackets, and the capes, finding them warm and pretty. Pauline Hyde, founder of Pauline Hyde &amp; Associates, an international outplacement agency, is keenly aware of the messages her clothes communicate and throughout her career has carefully dressed each morning with her latest client in mind. 'I was genuinely surprised to find how wearable her clothes are for I had thought of her as wacky and not for me. Her collection is much broader than I had realised and I was delighted that I could find things to wear in my business life. She offers something that is ahead of fashion and yet has shelf life.' Pauline was disappointed by the finish but would have bought some clothes if they had been a little longer through the waist. 'I loved some of them but as she does not do made to measure I couldn't walk straight into them. But my perception has been totally changed and she will be one of the designers that I look at when buying in the future.' Susannah Pollen, a director of Sotheby's, is the most daring in her approach to Westwood for, being immersed in the arts, she has a more experimental approach. 'Curiously it's easy to make Westwood's clothes look quite conservative and well . . . Sloaney and what's the point in that?' she asks. She chose to wear the infamous platform shoes: 'They really have a point, they elongate the silhouette making the clothes look marvellous.' 'The positive aspect of Westwood is her imagination. I think the outrageous things are very glamorous and make you feel wonderful. On the negative side some of the detailing can be difficult to wear unless you are very tall.' She, too, felt that more help was needed to enable the customer to understand the clothes and be shown various ways to put the separates together. 'Her clothes can be daunting but once you've tried them on they're wonderful.' Four out of the five women ended up buying something for this season; Anna will be kept behind closed doors in her corset, Eliza chose the tartan and velvet outfit for wearing at the Salzburg music festival, Susannah opted for a fake-fur trimmed Harlow-style coat and Claire continues to be a regular customer. And while each lives up to the definition of a modern working woman they have the confidence and femininity to break away from the formulaic notion of working dress - but then Bertrand Russell did say that 'Orthodoxy was the graveyard of intelligence.'</p>

			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> BREA MAN KILLED IN SCUFFLE WITH POLICE  </P> <P> An Anaheim police officer shot and killed a Brea man who allegedly tried to  grab the officer's holstered pistol, detectives said. Gregory Alan Rosenberger,  25, was pronounced dead at the shooting scene behind an Anaheim house. Two  Anaheim officers watching for drug dealing in the 700 block of West Hall Avenue  noticed a man acting suspiciously and confronted him, officers said. The man  ran, and officers chased him several blocks -- stopping him as he tried to  climb a fence to the rear yard of a house, police said. There, Rosenberger  allegedly grabbed the butt of one officer's handgun in its holster, while the  other officer struck the man with a night stick, police said. The officers  managed to pull him away, but one of them opened fire when Rosenberger tried to  lunge again, police said.  </P></p>

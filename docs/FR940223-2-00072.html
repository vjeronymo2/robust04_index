			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Statement of Commissioner Deborah K. Owen, Concurring in Part and Dissenting in Part, in Eggland's Best Inc., File No. 932&hyph;3000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> I concur in the Commission's decision to issue a complaint, and to provisionally accept a consent agreement in this matter, except as to section V.B. of the Order. With respect to that Section, which requires corrective advertising, I dissent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The seminal case on corrective advertising is the Listerine case,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Warner-Lambert Company, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  86 F.T.C. 1398 (1975), where the Commission opined:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [I]f a deceptive advertisement has played a substantial role in creating or reinforcing in the public's mind a false and material belief which lives on after the false advertising ceases, there is clear and continuing injury to competition and to the consuming public as consumers continue to make purchasing decisions based on the false belief. Since this injury cannot be avoided by merely requiring respondent to cease disseminating the advertisement, we may appropriately order respondent to take affirmative action designed to terminate the otherwise continuing ill effects of the advertisement.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> 86 F.T.C. at 1499&hyph;1500.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As the complaint alleges, Eggland's ads, in my judgment, certainly create a false impression that its eggs will not increase serum cholesterol, or, comparatively, increase cholesterol as much as ordinary eggs. However, we must also find that the beliefs created by the challenged ads are likely to linger after the deceptive advertising ceases. As to that likelihood, it seems to me important to compare and contrast the facts in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Warner-Lambert <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to the situation here.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Warner-Lambert, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  decided in 1975, the Commission noted that the challenged advertising claims had been made directly to the consuming public since 1921, and involved expenditures of large sums in print and television media. 86 F.T.C. at 1501. The Commission cited to the ALJ's Findings of Fact, which noted that Listerine had made the contested representations since the product went on the market almost a century before; that cold and sore throat claims had been made continuously on its labelling since prior to 1938; and that over the ten years preceding the decision, Listerine had spent several million dollars on its colds advertising, the vast majority occurring on network and spot television, covering all parts of the day and evening and particularly in network prime time.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 1468 (IDFF 219&hyph;220); see also  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 1407&hyph;1408 (IDFF 5&hyph;8). The Commission pointed to record testimony indicating the high percentage of consumers taking such claims that would remain as long as five years after the ads ended. It concluded: ``The record demonstrates that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> long <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  after Listerine cold efficacy advertising ceased, a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> substantial <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  proportion of the public would continue to believe in Listerine's efficacy for the treatment and prevention of colds and sore throats.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 1503 (emphasis supplied).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If we contrast the length in time, and the magnitude of Listerine's advertising to the instant case, Eggland's advertising would hardly appear to rise to even a two-digit percentage thereof. We have no evidence that Eggland's campaign was so similarly saturated and extended that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> long <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  after it ceases, a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> substantial <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  portion of the public will continue to believe the challenged claims in the absence of the corrective advertising that the Commission has provisionally accepted. Moreover, one significant factor is in evidence here that was not present in the Listerine case: the barrage of contrary information to which the public is exposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the public received little, if any, information from sources other than the advertiser about the true effect of Listerine on colds and sore throats, the vast majority of information available to consumers challenges the Eggland claims, and links egg consumption with increased serum cholesterol. Articles in the popular press, television and radio programs, and many cookbooks recommend that consumers lower their consumption of eggs. Doctors and the American Heart Association advise people to limit their egg consumption for health reasons. The general ambient information and perception is that eggs are unhealthy, and this climate is highly relevant in determining whether the false beliefs created by Eggland's Best advertisements will likely linger. Eggland's Best advertisements attempted to counteract the common wisdom, but ran for only a short time. Because the information that eating eggs is likely to increase serum cholesterol will continue to be widely disseminated to consumers through media sources, it is unlikely that the false beliefs regarding the effects of Eggland's Best eggs on serum cholesterol, or their comparative benefits to other eggs, will be maintained. In sum, the half-life of Eggland's advertising campaign is probably very short.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is not to suggest, however, that corrective advertising is only appropriate where the ad campaign is decades-old and swamps the public. A classic opportunity for appropriately imposing the remedy was the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sun Company <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  case two years ago. File No. 902&hyph;3268. There, the Commission challenged claims linking octane and automobile engine performance made by a company that was previously under a Commission order for earlier false performance and uniqueness claims for its gasoline.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sun Oil Co., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  84 F.T.C. 247 (1974). Nonetheless, the Commission agreed to merely a cease-and-desist order, despite the fact that the challenged claims took advantage of, and further contributed to, widespread consumer misperception about the relationship between octane and performance. The contrast between the Commission's decision there, and here, suggests that the Commission's current posture on corrective advertising may be more a function of respondents' willingness to agree to the remedy, rather than of a well defined and implemented policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

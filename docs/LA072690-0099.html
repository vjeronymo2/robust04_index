			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> THEATER REVIEW: 'MOONDAISIES';  </P> <P> FLOWER POWER;  </P> <P> ZANINESS IS THE OPERATIVE PHILOSOPHY IN 'MOONDAISIES,' INTENDED FOR CHILDREN  AND ADULTS.  </P> <P> The first in a projected series of productions aimed at a young audience, Kent  Hamilton's "Moondaisies" should appeal to children 10 and under and their  parents.  </P> <P> Currently being performed on Saturday and Sunday afternoons in a large tent  behind the Simi Valley City Hall, the play is being produced under the auspices  of the Santa Susana Repertory Company (of which author Hamilton is a trustee)  and is being staged on the set constructed for the Company's recent version of  "Romeo and Juliet."  </P> <P> Set in modern times, "Moondaisies" begins with a father, portrayed by producer  Bill Rapp, cajoled into telling a bedtime story to his son and daughter, played  by Joshua Nelson and Risa Littman.  </P> <P> Upset by the childrens' accidental destruction of a portion of her garden,  their mother has stipulated that a flower play a heroic role in the tale.  </P> <P> The scene shifts to a "Star Wars"-like dimension, where the father and children  have joined a group of "Space Pioneers," humanoid save for the requisite  protagonist, a "moondaisy" who bears a startling resemblance to Mom. Enter a  bunch of "Space Pirates," led by the evil Zap, who has no use for life and  beauty. Confrontations, musical numbers and a fairly obvious ecological parable  ensue.  </P> <P> Zaniness is the operative philosophy here, with the Space Pirates a  particularly doltish bunch played broadly and for maximum laughs by adults John  Comstock, James Egan, Paul Roosevelt, Anthony Ross, Larry Transue, Kristin  Scott and -- as leader Zap -- Dave Clare.  </P> <P> It's with that bunch (many of whom, in different uniforms, also portray the  good guys) that parents are going to have the most fun: the actors are having  such a good time up there onstage that onlookers might easily envy them.  </P> <P> Younger children should identify with the characters played by Nelson and  Littman, and also go for the rough-and-tumble humor and the attractive cast.  Sophisticated youngsters and teen-agers are likely to identify with the  youngster who, at a particularly soppy moment, confesses to feeling like a  co-star in a Care Bears movie.  </P> <P> Acting, as such, is less Stanislavski here than Ronald McDonald. Leads Littman  and Nelson perform notably well in relatively straight roles, and Nelson (who  needs to project more when he sings) shows teen-idol potential.  </P> <P> The performance seen for this review featured, as it happens, a couple of  understudies. Theresa Reynolds filled in for Melissa Crook as the  mother/moondaisy, and vocal coach Judy Sherman took Reynolds' usual place as  "Ms. Morebucks, the Satellite of Greed."  </P> <P> No slight intended on the absent Crook, who chose a bad day for a schedule  conflict, but it's difficult to imagine how anyone could have played the part  any better than Reynolds, who seemed properly motherly when called for and  delightfully goofy when got up as a large, well-meaning and not particularly  bright talking flower.  </P> <P> The songs, by author Hamilton and composer Rick Field, were serviceable, but  the lyrics tend to get lost under the ensemble vocals and prerecorded musical  tracks. Director James Egan and choreographer Laura Squier keep things moving  smoothly, and costume designer Kay Myregard succeeds in making much out of  relatively little.  </P> <P> * WHERE AND WHEN: "Moondaisies" will be performed Saturday and Sunday  afternoons at 4 p.m. through Aug. 19 in the tent behind the Simi Valley City  Hall and library complex, 2929 Tapo Canyon Road in Simi Valley. Tickets are $5.  Call (805) 371-1715 for further information.  </P></p>

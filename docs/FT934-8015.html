			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Finnish bank in FM2bn tap issue UNION Bank of Finland plans to raise up to FM2bn (Dollars 341.8m) over the next two and half years through a series of bond auctions to domestic and international institutional investors. The tap issue will carry a 7 per cent coupon, and be denominated in lots of FM1m and FM10m. Subscription will be via monthly auctions between November 24 1993 and May 31 1996. It is the first time a Finnish bank, or company, has issued bonds in this way. Tap issues, with auctions, have previously been the preserve of the government. The initiative is designed to enhance the development of the Finnish bond market by offering investors new material. The maturity date of the issue, June 15 1997, is the same as the benchmark government bond issues'. The bank, part of Unitas, said proceeds would be used for normal funding. 'We are looking to raise longer maturity markka to fund our longer maturity markka assets,' said Ms Maarit Nakyva, UBF's first vice-president. Unitas has recently raised FM1.6bn in new equity as part of a recapitalisation drive following the Finnish banking crisis. Its capital adequacy ratio stands at 12 per cent.</p>

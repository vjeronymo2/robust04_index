			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: Pet food profits help 4% rise at Quaker Oats HIGHER pet food profits were a key contributor to Quaker Oats' 4 per cent rise in earnings from continuing operations in the three months ended March 1991. Earnings for the period, which is the Chicago-based food processor's third fiscal quarter, rose to Dollars 63.1m, or 82 cents a share, from Dollars 60.4m, or 77 cents a share, a year earlier. Net sales climbed to Dollars 1.33bn from Dollars 1.27bn. Last year's third-quarter figures exclude a Dollars 34.8m loss suffered by Fisher-Price, the toy maker which the group plans to spin off to shareholders. Quaker said yesterday that the deal is awaiting completion of an internal audit required to transfer the business to a new corporation. Nonetheless, it hopes to complete the spin-off by June 30. Operating income dropped by 8 per cent, largely due to lower profits from Brazil. But this was more than offset by a near-halving in financing costs, due to lower interest rates in Brazil. Both North American and overseas operations were bolstered by strong sales of pet food. US sales were helped by a relaunch of a key dog food brand. Mr William Smithburg, Quaker's chief executive, said he expects 'solid' earnings growth in the current quarter and the largest percentage of quarterly earnings for the year.</p>

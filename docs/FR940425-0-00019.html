In the Second R&amp;O, the Commission reallocated five bands above 3 GHz to the private operational and common carrier fixed microwave services on a co-primary basis and adopted specific channelization plans for each band. The Commission also adopted changes in parts 21 and 94 of its rules that allowed variances to the channeling plans. Specifically, the Commission stated that ``Fixed systems licensed, in operation, or applied for in the 6525&hyph;6875 and 10,550&hyph;10,680 MHz bands prior to July 15, 1993 are permitted to use channel plans in effect prior to that date, including adding channels under those plans.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The Commission believes that using the adopted frequency pairings will facilitate efficient use of the spectrum. However, the Commission recognizes that there will be locations, especially in congested areas, where new links cannot be coordinated if the new frequency pairings are used but which could be coordinated if a frequency pair inconsistent with the new rules could be used. Therefore, the Commission will consider on a case-by-case basis authorizing frequency pairings inconsistent with the rules upon a significant showing that the adopted frequency pairing plan would preclude the requested link. Additionally, the Commission has included language in &sect;21.701(m) similar to &sect;94.15(d) to provide for these unique situations. Further, as already provided in the rules, systems existing in the subject bands prior to July 15, 1993 may modify existing links and add new links under the old frequency pairing plans. However, the Commission encourages use of the new frequency plan wherever possible because its use generally will provide for the most efficient use of the spectrum. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. In the Second R&amp;O, the Commission concluded that the existing 20 MHz channeling plan for the 3.7&hyph;4.2 GHz band should not be modified. This decision was made to protect existing satellite operations that share this band with the point-to-point fixed microwave service. The Commission authorized private fixed microwave licensees in addition to common carrier licensees to use the band under the existing channeling plan. However, the channeling plan published in the Second R&amp;O inadvertently reflected a 280 MHz separation between transmit and receive frequencies. In the MO&amp;O, therefore, the Commission is correcting the channeling plan to reflect the original 20 MHz separation between transmit and receive frequencies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. The Second R&amp;O did not designate the 6425&hyph;6525 MHz band, currently allocated to the fixed service and used for common carrier Local Television Transmission Service (LTTS), for point-to-point fixed service to accommodate incumbent 2 GHz fixed microwave users that would be required to relocate. In its petition, Western Tele-Communications, Inc. (WTCI) requested that the Commission issue a Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making to allocate the 6425&hyph;6525 MHz band for general common carrier use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. The Commission believes that the LTTS provides a useful service and that sharing this band with fixed microwave operations would significantly restrict the usefulness of this band for LTTS operations. Further, the Commission believes that the five bands it has provided in this proceeding will accommodate both incumbent fixed microwave operations that must be relocated from the 2 GHz bands and future fixed microwave growth. Consequently, the Commission will not initiate a Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making proposing to reallocate this band for general common carrier use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. In its petition for reconsideration, Comsearch requested the Commission to reconsider the maximum power authorized in the 4, 10, and 11 GHz bands and the antenna standards for the 6 GHz band. WTCI requested that the Commission reconsider the ATPC rules and allow for up to a 10 decibel (dB) increase in power, instead of the 3 dB adopted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. The Commission agrees with the petitioners that the technical rules governing fixed microwave operations in these bands should be reviewed and updated to reflect advances in technology as well as recent changes in our regulatory structure. However, it believes these issues are best addressed in a proceeding dedicated to that purpose rather than being addressed in piecemeal fashion in this and other proceedings. Therefore, the Commission is deferring consideration of technical issues regarding maximum authorized power, antenna standards, and ATPC to a future proceeding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. In the First R&amp;O, the Commission exempted licensees of incumbent public safety facilities from involuntary relocation. In the Third R&amp;O, it clarified the definition of public safety. The Commission's purpose in each decision was to ensure that essential safety of life and property communications services are not disrupted or otherwise disadvantaged. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

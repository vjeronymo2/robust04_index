			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV SEES VEIN OF OPPORTUNITY TO BE MINED FROM WORKER UNREST  </P> <P> The spring and early summer of 1989 have been times of political and social  turmoil in the Soviet Union. Yet, while many have been treating the latest  round of coal strikes as the beginning of the end for perestroika, the labor  unrest is actually being used by Mikhail S. Gorbachev to accelerate economic  reform.  </P> <P> The coal strikes do not come as a surprise. Only 20% of the regional Communist  Party leaders were defeated in the elections of March 26, but candidates from  the coal-mining regions were particularly vulnerable. Then the extremely poor  conditions in the coal fields were the subject of heated speeches at the  televised Congress of People's Deputies that met in late May and early June.  That workers would follow up with action of their own was a natural  development.  </P> <P> The strikes, however, are far more than a traditional call for higher wages.  The key demands are usually those associated with management -- higher prices,  with local mines receiving a proportion of the hard currency earned by the sale  of their coal abroad. When the miners say they support perestroika, they don't  just mean the right to strike. They are calling for radical economic reform.  </P> <P> The cause of the miners' concern is obvious. In the crazy-quilt system of  Soviet pricing, coal is one of the items that is sold below cost to other  factories. So long as the miners are paid wages out of the state budget, they  don't care about prices. But with the new laws calling for self-financing (the  payment of costs out of receipts), abnormally low coal prices mean a cut in  wages to miners.  </P> <P> The crucial fact about the coal strikes is not that they occurred, but that  they have received so much attention -- often sympathetic -- in the controlled  Soviet media. The reason is that they could not come at a better time: the eve  of a major Central Committee plenum on nationalities.  </P> <P> The plenum will deal first with decentralization of authority to the Soviet  republics. As such, Russians are uneasy that Gorbachev is being too weak with  the non-Russians and making too many concessions to them. The coal strike gives  Gorbachev the ability to say that this decentralization is being demanded by  Russians, too -- and by one of the core elements of the old working class. It  also will legitimatize a continuation of the very thorough purge of  conservatives that he has been conducting over the last year.  </P> <P> We in the West desperately need to keep these events in perspective. For four  years a number of observers have been saying that Gorbachev is teetering, that  he is riding an uncontrollable tiger. As proof, they cite each incident of  turmoil.  </P> <P> Yet every serious Western analysis -- and surely the Soviet leaders themselves  understand this point -- notes that political reform will produce additional  tensions to keep the political caldron boiling.  </P> <P> The question has always been: Would this be the kind of escalating tension and  political activity that has toppled many authoritarian regimes around the world  and brought political democracy? Or would it be the kind of political turmoil  we saw in America and Western Europe in the 1960s that would subside with time  and a change in policy?  </P> <P> In my view the latter is the case. Gorbachev is not riding a tiger. He is a  Cossack firmly in control of his horse as he moves through tough terrain.  </P> <P> Paradoxically, the saving factor for Gorbachev is the nationality conflict. The  non-Russians are divided and can be controlled through a combination of  concessions and repression. The first big riots -- and bloodshed -- occurred in  Kazakhstan in 1986, when a Russian was named first secretary of that republic's  Communist Party. Yet he proved a skillful leader; last March, virtually none of  25 top leaders lost in the Kazakh elections.  </P> <P> The Russians in turn can be restrained by appeals to national unity. The  Siberian workers or Moscow students know that if they successfully push for  complete democracy, separatist parties will emerge everywhere and some areas  will leave the union. They are not ready for this.  </P> <P> That is why Gorbachev can afford to publicize the strikes and the national  demands in such an apparently reckless manner. The non-Russians will get the  greater autonomy they seek, and that will help pacify them. The Russians too  will get greater local independence and a rising standard of living.  </P> <P> But the non-Russians making the most extreme demands will be kept in check. The  troops will be called out periodically, as was the National Guard in America in  the 1960s. This does not mean the system is collapsing or reform is over. The  sky is not falling. We have to get on with developing a policy, not dreaming  that it will.  </P></p>

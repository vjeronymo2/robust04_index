			<p>BFN     [Text] Monrovia, 27 May (AFP) -- Violent fighting has  broken out since yesterday at Tubmanburg, 60 km north of  Monrovia -- headquarters of the armed Liberian faction, the  United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia [ULIMO] --  between Mandingos and Krahns, the two ethnic clans within the  movement which have been fighting since March. Gerald Van Djik,  the World Food Program [WFP] representative in Monrovia, told  AFP today that the hostilities broke out when a WFP team was  distributing 81 tonnes of food in the town. He was unable to  assess the casualties among the fighters and the civilian  population.</p>

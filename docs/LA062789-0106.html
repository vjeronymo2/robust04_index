			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INVESTOR HOLDS 7.1% STAKE IN TORRANCE FIRM  </P> <P> Kansas City investor John Latshaw reported Monday that he controls a 7.1% stake  in Standard Brands Paint Co. of Torrance. He described the holding as an  investment.  </P> <P> Latshaw, chairman of Latshaw Enterprises, a manufacturer of mechanical controls  and molded plastic parts in Missouri, said in a filing with the Securities and  Exchange Commission that his company owns 202,700 of the 405,400 shares that he  controls. The SEC filing also indicated that the 7.1% stake includes 178,150  shares acquired from April 17 to June 16 for $14.50 to $16.75 a share.  </P> <P> On the New York Stock Exchange Monday, Standard Brands common stock spurted to  a 52-week high of $19.375 before falling back to close the day's trading at  $16.75, off 87.50 cents.  </P> <P> Standard Brands is a leading do-it-yourself home-decorating retailer and paint  manufacturer. It was the target of two takeover bids in 1987, prompting the  company to repurchase 6 million of its common shares -- 53% of the total then  outstanding -- through a tender offer of $25 a share. The stock was trading at  about $21 a share at the time.  </P> <P> A Standard Brands spokesman declined comment on Latshaw's filing.  </P> <P> Standard Brands' net income fell to $8 million on net sales of $304.4 million  in its fiscal year ended Jan. 31, down from profit of $15 million on net sales  of $305.5 million the year before. Its operating income, however, rose to $36.1  million from $34.3 million.  </P> <P> The company's financial results over the last two years were affected by the  reorganization it launched in 1987.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST STEP TOWARD A NEW LIFE;  </P> <P> NOT UNEXPECTEDLY, EAST GERMANS VOTE THEIR POCKETBOOKS  </P> <P> East Germans voted themselves as far from communism and as close to Western  democracy and affluence as they could in Sunday's election. That was no  surprise, but the margin of victory for Christian Democrats and other  conservatives was.  </P> <P> The election was only the first step toward a new life for 12.2 million people  who have spent 40 years as hostages to the Cold War. Unfortunately, the rest of  the trip will be tougher.  </P> <P> It is an axiom of American politics that people vote their pocketbooks, and  clearly that is the case for Germans as well. West German Chancellor Helmut  Kohl, campaigning for the eastern version of his own party, talked directly  into East German wallets. His message was that his party would not drag its  feet reunifying a Germany divided since World War II, suggesting that in no  time at all they would be sharing the material well-being of their Western  relatives.  </P> <P> In the end, Social Democrats won only one-third more seats in the new East  German Parliament than Communists, and so it appears that hoped-for affluence  was not the only motive at work. The vote also put as much distance as possible  between the voters and 40 years of communist rule that dictated every phase of  life.  </P> <P> As with many celebrations, there will be hangovers. Kohl, who had other  stunning good news Sunday with the bad showing of far-right Republican party  candidates in Bavaria, must move fast to make good on his promises of  prosperity. Exchanging one high-value West German mark for one low-value East  German mark may be inflationary. Along with possible inflation, East Germans  may face unemployment and other setbacks while they work their way out of the  economic and intellectual dungeon of communism. Lothar de Maiziere, leader of  East Germany's Christian Democrats and top candidate for prime minister, is a  human-rights lawyer who fended off Communist efforts to dominate the church.  But jousting with a government and running one are two very different things  and non-Communist East Germans have little practice in governance.  </P> <P> The elements of transition that are under their control will be difficult  enough; much is beyond their control. The rest of Europe remains uneasy about a  reunited Germany and may try to slow the process down. And how far the Soviet  Union is willing to go to try to keep a unified Germany out of NATO is  anybody's guess.  </P> <P> Still, Sunday represented two steps forward: Creation of Europe's newest  democracy and soothing assurances from De Maiziere that Germany can and will  live within its present borders. The global village could live with one step  back another day.  </P></p>

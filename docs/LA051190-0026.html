			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUDGET CRUNCH SEEN HURTING PROSPECTS OF ETHICS PROPOSAL  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Council members -- who are cutting millions of dollars in  services from Mayor Tom Bradley's $3.6-billion budget and adding new taxes as  they confront a looming fiscal crisis -- acknowledged Thursday that their  actions might make it more difficult to convince voters to give them a pay  raise next month.  </P> <P> "This budget situation doesn't help," said Councilman Michael Woo, a leading  supporter of an ethics reform package that will go before the voters June 5.  </P> <P> The $5-million ethics reform package includes salary increases and provides  campaign matching funds for council members and other elected officials. Money  for the ethics measure has not yet been budgeted, meaning that the council  would have to dip into reserves or make additional spending cuts to fund the  ethics package if it is approved.  </P> <P> Tax hikes and threatened cutbacks in a host of services from tree trimming to  police add "another complication" to getting voter approval for the ethics  reform proposal, Woo said.  </P> <P> He nonetheless argued that the ethics proposal has merit because, among other  things, it places bans on officials' outside income.  </P> <P> Other council members who voted to place the measure on the ballot appeared  more pessimistic about its chances in light of the budget troubles. "It'll have  (a negative) effect," said Councilman Hal Bernson. "But I don't know if  anything could help" the ethics package, he added.  </P> <P> The leading opponent of the ethics package, Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, claimed  that with the money spent on the ethics package in the first year alone, nearly  100 officers could be put on the street.  </P> <P> The debate over the budget turned increasingly grim as various department heads  went before the council arguing that they should be spared from a proposed  $40-million package of salary, equipment and supply cuts that go deeper than  the belt-tightening already proposed by Bradley.  </P> <P> Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, who would lose nearly $13 million for salaries  under the proposals by the mayor and council, told the council he would not be  able to hire the 400 new officers envisioned by the mayor and council. He said  he also would have difficulty maintaining current levels of officers on the  street. If the council fails to restore at least $7 million in police overtime,  Gates said there would have to be a "net reduction" in service and officer  response times could increase.  </P> <P> Several council members responded skeptically, noting that Gates' budget is $1  billion and suggesting that there are other places to reduce expenses. Gates  repeatedly insisted that such trims were impossible.  </P> <P> City Atty. James Hahn said the proposed reductions in his spending request come  as the number of criminal cases filed by his office has increased by 13%. He  said the reduction would mean his office would have to cut back on a variety of  legal services, including advice given City Council members.  </P> <P> To lessen cuts in services, Hahn called on the council to adopt higher rubbish  collection fees to cover the full $40-million to $60-million yearly cost of a  major new curbside recycling program. The program is one of several key factors  contributing to the budget squeeze.  </P> <P> But there was no scrimping in the council chambers Thursday, as taxpayers  funded a two-table lunch that Council President John Ferraro said was becoming  too elaborate.  </P> <P> While reviewing ways to slice the budget, council members munched on skewered  meats, tacos, salads, soups, deep-dish cheesecake and an array of pastries.  </P> <P> "There's a ton of food over there," observed Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores.  </P> <P> Chief Legislative Analyst William McCarley said the lunch cost several hundred  dollars and was part of an effort to upgrade the fare at the annual budget  session.  </P> <P> Later, Ferraro allowed that the luncheon ritual might have to be scaled back to  the previous fare of sandwiches and soda because it " has "gotten out of hand.  It has become a buffet banquet"  </P> <P> The budget deliberations continue today.  </P></p>

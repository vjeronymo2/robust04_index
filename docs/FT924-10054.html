			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / East German plant shelved by Mercedes MERCEDES-Benz, the car and commercial vehicle subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, announced yesterday that it was shelving plans for a DM1bn (Pounds 400m) truck factory outside Berlin, in the most serious blow yet to hopes for new investment in former East Germany. The move provides graphic confirmation of the downturn in the west German economy, and the wider European market. It coincided with the latest industrial production figures for west Germany, showing a seasonally adjusted 2 per cent fall in September from August, continuing the decline in the western economy. The Mercedes decision is the second serious setback for investment plans in east Germany in recent days, following the news that Krupp is not going ahead with the takeover of the Eko steel plant on the Polish border. It underlines fears that the slowdown in the west of the country is likely to undermine the inflow of urgently needed investment in the east, where real unemployment is running at about 25 per cent. Mr Werner Niefer, the chairman of Mercedes-Benz, said the decision to shelve the plan for a truck plant at Ahrensdorf had been taken because of 'structural problems in the European commercial vehicle industry', which had become clearly visible as a result of the economic downturn. He said medium-term forecasts for the west European market had also been revised downwards because of declining demand for both light and heavy trucks, and there was also a clearly reduced potential for the development of markets in eastern Europe  - a key reason for the east German plant. 'All these facts, as well as the current under-utilisation of capacity at our existing plants . . . simply do not permit any decision to be taken on a new site for the time being,' he said. The state government of Brandenburg, where the planned plant was situated, put a brave face on the decision, stressing that the decision was only temporary. However, it confirms a worsening investment outlook throughout the German economy. The decline in west German industrial production was headed by a fall of 2.5 per cent in manufacturing industry output, whereas there was a slight recovery in mining (by 1 per cent) and construction (up 2 per cent). Comparing the combined production totals for August and September with the same months of 1991, manufacturing industry has dropped by 2.8 per cent, and overall industrial production by 2.1 per cent. Within the total for manufacturing industry, consumer goods output was down by 4.9 per cent, and investment goods output by 4.8 per cent.</p>

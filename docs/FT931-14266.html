			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (14): Liberalisation will be a slow process - Insurance THE legal framework for a single European insurance market is now firmly in place but it will take years - possibly decades - for genuine liberalisation to occur. Differences in taxation and contract law constitute real obstacles to cross border trade, especially in life, home and motor insurance. After moving at a faster rate than many would have predicted three years ago, the European Commission has this year approved a raft of directives aimed at liberalising the market for both life and non-life insurance. The legislation, which governments must implement from 1994 onwards, will open Europe's most protected markets to more competition and represents a victory for advocates of greater liberalisation. Under the 'single licence', insurers from any member state will be free to trade in any other member state, under home country rules. At the same time EC members are now committed to dismantling the vestiges of the highly regulated regime. For example, governments cannot demand prior approval of policy conditions or premium rates or require companies to invest in a particular category of assets. That could have an important impact on insurers in Germany, Italy and Belgium, for example, where the motor insurance market is highly regulated. Even so, genuine cross-border trading is still some way off. Insurers in different member states operate under very different tax rules. Most continental countries allow insurers much more freedom to build up tax-free reserves, while the room for manoeuvre of UK companies in this respect is still sharply circumscribed. Some life insurers must pay taxes on premiums, others do not. Variations in legal regimes and the lack of a single contract law system will also hinder trade in insurance. According to London solicitors Lovell White Durrant 'the diversity of contract law means that any comparison of one insurance product with another becomes unbelievably complicated for the layman'. Penetration of some markets - especially those such as the German, French and Italian, where retail networks are dominated by extensive networks of tied agents, selling the products of just one company, rather than independent brokers - will be tough. So far Europe's biggest markets - the UK, France, Germany and Italy - are still dominated by domestic companies, although some players are now beginning to win significant shares of neighbouring markets, either through outright acquisition or by the purchase of significant share stakes. Germany's Allianz has an important share of the Italian market through its acquisition of RAS, while France's Assurances Generales de France (AGF) could eventually win important influence in the German market if its current attempts to control Aachener and Muenchener - Germany's third biggest insurers - are successful. France's privately-owned Victoire has also made important headway by acquiring Colonia, Germany's second biggest insurer, in 1989. Victoire is currently engaged in a long drawn-out battle with its nationalised rival, Union des Assurances de Paris, for control of the company and a string of other European companies to which it is linked. Elsewhere Italy's Generali as well as several French, Swiss, German and Dutch companies are expanding in the rapidly growing Spanish and Portuguese markets, while AGF is a dominant player in the Irish market. Companies, such as Switzerland's Zurich and Winterthur, and Germany's Allianz have built up strong shares of the continent's market for commercial risks business (the policies bought by larger industrial and financial companies). By contrast UK companies have recently made relatively little impact in Europe, although Commercial Union's Delta Lloyd subsidiary has an important share of the Dutch market.</p>

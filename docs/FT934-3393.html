			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Audit Commission praises council tax The council tax has been a successful replacement for the poll tax, the Audit Commission says today, but there is still room for improvement. It says 54 per cent of England's budgeted council tax had been collected by the beginning of September, compared with only 50 per cent of budgeted poll tax by the same point last year. However, some councils had collected twice as much of their council tax as others, while there were a few councils where more than a fifth of taxpayers had paid nothing. It also found that some councils had backlogs of correspondence and benefit claims, while many authorities had been slow to begin chasing late payers.

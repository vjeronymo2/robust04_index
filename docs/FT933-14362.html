			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Rooney's future remains unclear Correction (published 16th July 1993) appended to this article. THE FUTURE of Mr Bill Rooney as chairman and chief executive of Spring Ram, the bathrooms and kitchens group, was still unclear last night. The shares closed 4p lower at 51p. After three profit warnings within eight months, Mr Rooney is under pressure from institutional shareholders to resign. This move is led by the Prudential Corporation, which speaks for 35 per cent of the group's equity. After a meeting yesterday, the company said: 'The board of Spring Ram, which remains united in its support for Mr Bill Rooney, recognises and accepts the need for immediate and major changes in the structure, style and management of the company for the 1990s. Today's meeting has been adjourned to enable the board to seek further advice on the implementation of these changes.' Neither Mr Rooney or any of the other directors would expand on the statement, which raises several questions. It is not clear how compatible 'major changes' are with continuing support for Mr Rooney, a co-founder of the company and still its dominating force. Mr Rooney has said he would be prepared to give up the role of chairman or chief executive, but not both. Mr Rooney and his family trusts have a 16 per cent stake in the company. Pre-tax profits in the first half of the current year were forecast to be well below the comparable period, contrary to earlier expectations. In March the company disclosed a pre-tax loss of Pounds 26m - a third less than expected. CORRECTION Spring Ram made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 26m last year. The incorrect reference yesterday to a loss was due to an editing error.</p>

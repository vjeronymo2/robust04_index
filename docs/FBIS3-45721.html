			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Person Who Undermines Cooperation Must </F> Bear Blame"]    [Text] Chris Patten's mood may be worse during his current  trip to Britain for consultations, because the situation has  changed, the international environment has become unfavorable to  him, and so has the domestic situation in Britain. British  business circles are no longer concerned about whether his  constitutional reform package will be passed by the Legislative  Council, and they have noted that his unilateral legislation was  an erroneous action. His countrymen asked him to make it plain  how the trade interests of British business would be harmed and  whether British-Chinese relations would turn for the better  after the talks on the Hong Kong issue broke down.    Therefore, this time, Patten was in no mood to put on  "political shows" by appearing on British television or  arranging interviews with British newspapers; instead, he  hastily consulted some "China hands" about countermeasures, and  tried to cope with the huge pressures from the British business  community. He discussed ways to deal with the Chinese with  former foreign secretary Geoffrey Howe, and discussed how to  handle the deadlocked situation after the breakdown of talks  with Ambassador McLaren and Foreign Minister Goodlad.    When he was appointed Hong Kong governor and was on his way  to take office in Hong Kong, he vowed to maintain good relations  with China in front of some British businessmen who supported  his appointment. He said that he would build up trust with his  Chinese counterparts and would be able to solve many issues by  just dialing the phone. He meant that as Britain had appointed  such an able Hong Kong governor, British businessmen would gain  favor everywhere in their China trade.    However, all people have seen that he behaved in an  extremely  irresponsible way by challenging the established agreements  between China and Britain, refusing to make things converge with  the Basic Law, and recklessly bringing part of the controversial  constitutional reform package to the Legislative Council before  an agreement had been reached, and all this was unnecessary.  Patten ruined all of the progress that had been made in the  past and caused the breakdown of the talks without regard to the  interests of the residents of Hong Kong and the interests of  British businessmen. He simply made a mess of the situation and  broke the promises he made when he took office.    Therefore, at a hearing in the British Parliament, David  Howell and other Conservative MP's questioned him about whether  he had expected the strong reaction of the Chinese side, what  had caused the current deadlock in Sino-British relations, and  whether Patten formulated China policy and had forced the  British Government to adopt it, or, would he, as Hong Kong  governor, obey the British Government. Patten still stubbornly  fought with his back to the wall. He did not dare to speak  clearly, and just said that "the British Government supports my  constitutional reform package." It seems that his superiors are  only able to support a subordinate and do not have the power to  correct what the subordinate has done. Such an arrogant attitude  will only arouse strong criticism from the British business  community.    At the hearing, Patten still tried to conceal faults and  gloss over wrongs and to deceive the British public. He said  that he did not know about any agreement between China and  Britain in 1990 at all, because when he consulted Percy Craddock  about constitutional reforms, Craddock did not tell him that an  agreement had been reached on electoral arrangements, so he did  not have to worry about that. All people in Hong Kong have long  known about the seven letters exchanged between the Chinese and  British foreign ministers, and Chinese officials also told him  that the seven letters represented an agreement, but he still  declared in a session of the Legislation Council's that he  "would not recognize any secret agreements" and "would not  create any more secret agreements." The deadlocked situation  was created by him deliberately, and he is trying to shirk all  his responsibilities.    Now, Western countries, including the United States, Japan,  Germany, and France, are all vying with each other to march into  the Chinese market. Will Britain still allow Patten to continue  his blunders and harm British-Chinese relations?    Even the Labor Party's Allan Rogers also said that the  Conservative cabinet should bear the responsibility for the  worsening of British-Chinese relations.    The parliamentary hearing enabled British voters to clearly  see who has caused the worsening of British-Chinese relations.  It is Chris Patten who should bear responsibility for the  current situation. John Major is now bogged down in a  predicament, and does not want to be blamed for the worsening of  British-Chinese relations. Therefore, on the one hand, the  Conservative Party summoned Patten to give a testimony; on the  other hand, it has again dispatched McLaren back to Beijing to  deal the deadlocked situation left to him by Christopher Hum and  to sound out China's reaction.    Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Wu Jianmin explicitly  replied to the British side: The Chinese side hopes that the  British side will withdraw the partial constitutional reform  package that has been submitted to the Hong Kong Legislative  Council for deliberation and returns to the negotiating table.  "If the British side refuses to withdraw it and brings the  second part of the constitutional reform package to the  Legislative Council for deliberation, then this will further  show that the British side is determined not to return to the  negotiating table, and that the British side will thus have to  bear responsibility for all consequences." "The Chinese side  will not accept any legislative decision on the 1994-95  elections made by the Legislative Council, and all institutions  formed according to such decisions will only be able to function  up until 30 June 1997."    The position of the Chinese side is firm, and the British  side should carefully weigh up the consequent gains and losses,  restrain Patten's confrontational policy, and remove obstacles  to Sino- British cooperation.</p>

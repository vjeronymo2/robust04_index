			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Northern Investors asset value up 13% Northern Investors, the venture capital investment trust, saw a 12.9 per cent increase in net asset value over the year to March 31, from 295.6p to 333.6p per share. Although dividend income from the company's venture capital assets increased by 17 per cent, a fall in short-term investment rates led to a decline in total revenue. The pre-tax figure fell from Pounds 284,000 to Pounds 249,000 and earnings per share from 5.6p to 5.1p. The proposed final dividend is maintained at 3.5p to give a reduced total of 5p (5.5p).</p>

			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / International Company News: Europe finance venture turns in solid first results AG-AMEV, the financial services group formed last year from the merger of Belgium's largest and the Netherlands' third biggest insurers, unveiled a 4 per cent rise in net profit for 1990. This was measured against a pro-forma consolidated income statement prepared for 1989. The two companies finalised their link-up in December, to be retroactive to the beginning of 1990. Groupe AG and NV Amev each hold a 50 per cent share in the group. To celebrate what it claims is the first full European Community merger in financial services, the group has drawn up its balance sheet in European currency units (Ecu). It earned Ecu393m (Dollars 464m) last year on turnover of Ecu6.3bn, against profits of Ecu373m from Ecu6.2bn in 1989. The advance looks slightly better in Ecus than in Belgian francs, in which it would have been only 2 per cent. Dividends, paid out separately - and in national currencies - were raised from BFr150 to BFr165 by AG and from Fl 2.65 to F l2.85 by Amev. The group's co-chairman, Mr Maurice Lippens from AG, pointed out that, but for the weakness of the dollar, earnings would have risen by 5 per cent. Results from the group's US operations - largely AMEV-provided - had, however, shown a high return on turnover, and there had been a significant advance in the Spanish car insurance market. A black spot was the cost of last year's storm damage in western Europe, which cost the group Ecu20m in Belgium alone. While consolidating its position in its core markets in Belgium and the Netherlands, AG-AMEV wants to reinforce its presence in Spain and the UK, and seek out new niches in the US. Mr Lippens said that given the group's strong financial position he 'could envisage important acquisitions'. AG is closely allied with Belgium's leading bank, Generale de Banque, as part of its 14 per cent holding in Societe Generale de Belgique, the country's leading holding company. AMEV in 1989 merged with VSB, the largest Dutch savings bank.</p>

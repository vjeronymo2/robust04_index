			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FREE CLINIC CLOSES PROGRAM FOR TEENS  </P> <P> In the face of steep cuts in state family planning money, the South Bay Free  Clinic closed its 10-year-old Teen Advocate program Friday. Its peer counselors  gave school presentations on pregnancy prevention and counseling on such  problems as drug abuse, suicide and communicating with parents.  </P> <P> The Hermosa Beach-based program, which the clinic said reached 7,000 students a  year, has received $45,000 a year.  </P> <P> In a related move, the clinic asked the South Bay Hospital District for  $226,600 over two years to continue family planning medical services, including  family planning, testing for sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy  counseling and physical examinations. None of the money would be used for Teen  Advocates.  </P> <P> The free clinic, which has sites in Manhattan Beach and Gardena as well as a  mental health program in Redondo Beach, expects to lose as much as $350,000 in  family planning and matching grant money as a result of Gov. George  Deukmejian's two-thirds cut in the state family planning budget in July, said  Craig A. Vincent-Jones, the clinic's development officer.  </P></p>

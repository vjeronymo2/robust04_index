			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Survey of Business Travel (7): Surprisingly conservative city - Hong Kong HONG KONG may be a miracle of peaks, steel and glass, but the first thing the business traveller needs to prepare for is the surliness of the city's antiquated taxi drivers. The scruffy-but-efficient Kai Tak airport is on the edge of the Kowloon peninsula, a 30-minute taxi ride away from the main business hotels on Hong Kong island. English language and charm are at a minimum in the colony's taxis, but the fare compensates for this. A trip into the Central district of Hong Kong island will cost just HKDollars 75 (USDollars 10), including the toll for the cross-harbour tunnel. There are three main districts for business hotels. Central is the core financial district and the Mandarin Oriental was always the traditional choice. But it is rapidly being superseded by more luxurious five-star offerings in nearby Admiralty and Wanchai, such as the austerely impressive Grand Hyatt and the sumptuous Island Shangri-la. Alternatively, for those with a yearning for the past (an unfortunate preference in such a modern city) there is the grand old Peninsular, located a short Star Ferry ride from Hong Kong island, at the tip of the 'Golden Mile', the principal tourist shopping district that runs along Nathan Road. Hong Kong is blessed with a remarkably cheap and efficient transportation system. Taxis are prevalent and inexpensive. The Mass Transit Railway links the main urban areas of Hong Kong Island and connects with the tourist and residential centres of Kowloon, with an efficiency which will shock the European visitor. The more traditional Star Ferry and Hong Kong island tram system continue to operate at a more leisurely pace for Dollars HK1. The main railway station is in Kowloon, with trains heading to the New Territories and the border, or through to Guangzhou (Canton). Hong Kong is renowned for being the Mecca for Chinese cuisine, but it offers a wide variety of food. For the businessmen who wants to be where the action is, the favourite destination for the 'power breakfast' remains the Mandarin Grill. At lunch-time, to rub shoulders with the Chinese tycoons, go to Fook Lam Moon, in Wanchai. It offers excellent though pricey Cantonese food, but do not expect either decor, or knives and forks. For a glimpse of the expatriate Taipans, you should angle for an invitation to the Jackson Room at the exclusive Hong Kong Club. In the evening, Karaoke Bars have become de rigueur and Hong Kong offers every range of the spectrum from glitz and fountains to sheer sleaze. Wanchai still has a range of 'girlie' bars, housing remnants of the Vietnam rest and recreation era. Tsim Sha Tsui offers stadium-sized 'Hostess Clubs', including the famous Club BBoss (formerly Club Volvo), where you are driven to your table in a pink car. A more relaxing evening could be spent taking the Peak tram (a funicular railway) up to the Peak Cafe, where the views and food make a magnificent combination. For a western-style night club, JJ's at the Grand Hyatt is now in vogue. Hong Kong is a surprisingly conservative city; for business, a suit and tie are an essential penance, even in the height of Hong Kong's humid summer. Another necessity is a stack of name cards.</p>

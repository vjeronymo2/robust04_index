			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LANDFILL'S DEAL WITH STATE ANGERS WATER  AGENCIES  </P> <P> Changes negotiated privately with state officials could allow the operator of  an Azusa landfill to reclaim the $20.5 million it pledged to clean up San  Gabriel Valley water pollution, officials of three water agencies charged  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The officials are angery about an agreement made final last month by the State  Water Resources Control Board, the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Board and  Browning-Ferris Industries, whose subsidiary, the Azusa Land Reclamation Co.,  owns the Azusa landfill.  </P> <P> Company and state officials deny any impropriety and say BFI only promised the  $20.5 million with the expectation that it would be able to recoup the money  from polluters.  </P> <P> The escrow agreement means that the landfill company, not the state, can get  back some or all of the $20.5 million if BFI can track down anyone responsible  for the pollution.  </P></p>

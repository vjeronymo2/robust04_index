			<p>BFN     [Text] The Workers Party (PT) has decided to change its  campaign strategy in light of Progressive Renewal Party Paulo  Maluf's decision not to run and of the launching of Fernando  Henrique Cardoso Brazilian Social Democracy Party as the  anti-Lula candidate. Coordinators of Luis Inacio Lula Da  Silva's campaign believe that Cardoso, supported by the Liberal  Front Party and by the Brazilian Labor Party, will be the elite  groups' candidate and that, therefore, a polarization of the  election is inevitable. The PT will intensify its attacks on  the economic plan and on Cardoso as the main target of its  criticism.    Until former Sao Paulo Governor Orestes Quercia is confirmed  as the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party presidential  candidate in May, the PT will not make any attacks on him.  Lula's campaign coordinators believe Maluf's decision not to  run could have stemmed from a behind-the-scenes accord with  Quercia. PT campaign official Greenhalgh believes Maluf has  backtracked because those who always supported him have endorsed  Cardoso's candidacy. "All the partners of Paubrasil [which  contributed to Maluf's campaign] have been consulted," he  ironically said. Until now, the PT has harshly criticized  Maluf. From now on, the PT tone will change and its criticism  against Cardoso will intensify.    The PT no longer considers Cardoso the third alternative,  having moved up to second place and become Lula's main  adversary. Greenhalgh added: "Cardoso has time and again  disappointed the people by telling them to forget what he said  earlier and by deciding to run without worrying about the future  of the plan." He was thus anticipating the PT line of attacks  against Cardoso. Within this new strategy, the PT will insist on  securing the support of Rio de Janeiro Governor Leonel Brizola,  (Democratic Labor Party).</p>

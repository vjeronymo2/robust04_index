			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Resolution of Coordinating Conference of Communist Parties </F> "On the Political and Socioeconomic Situation in the States  Within the Territory of the USSR and Objectives Connected with  the Stronger Unity of Communists"]    [Text] Delegations representing communist parties in the  states formed within the territory of the USSR and a delegation  from the UCP-CPSU Council met in Moscow on 21-22 May 1994.    There was an exchange of views on the political and  socioeconomic situation in the states within the territory of  the USSR and on further steps to strengthen the unity of the  communist movement.    Conference speakers remarked that the years since the  criminal breakup of the USSR against the will of the people had  confirmed the accuracy of the principled assessments of  congresses of the communist parties of the states and the  conclusions of the 29th CPSU Congress. The race for sovereignty  stopped the economic development of all states, and the economic  reforms became nothing more than a screen to conceal the efforts  of a small segment of the population to appropriate the national  property created by generations of Soviet people.    The breakup of the union, the plundering of national  property, and the disgraceful displays of nationalism separated  the Soviet people into ethnic communities and divided them into  a handful of rich individuals and millions of poor people. All  of this led to an economic disaster and the dramatic  exacerbation of inter-ethnic and social conflicts. The Soviet  people and our common motherland suffered economic losses five  times greater than in all of the years of the war with fascist  Germany. Hundreds of thousands of Soviet people died in  inter-ethnic wars and millions became refugees or lost their  jobs and were doomed to suffering and poverty.    The remarkable achievements of our domestic culture are  being  replaced by the Western mass culture, with its cult of money and  violence. Free medicine and education are being replaced with  paid services and are becoming inaccessible to a growing number  of citizens. Millions of housing applicants and homeless people  have lost hope of obtaining housing. The only indicators that  are rising are the mortality, vice, and crime rates. The death  rate is higher than the birth rate in the majority of former  union republics. The number of people killed by criminals each  year is three or four times as high as the number killed during  the 10 years of the Afghan war.    Under these conditions, the people of these states are  beginning to realize that their ruling regimes are essentially  against the people, and they are now pinning their hopes on the  removal of these regimes and the establishment of government by  the people as a result of vigorous activity by the communist  movement and progressive leftist forces.    The party organizations of the states learned the necessary  lessons from their serious defeat. They purged their ranks of  traitors, opportunists, and timeservers. Most of the communist  parties of the states are finalizing the establishment of their  organizational structures and are waging an aggressive struggle  for the interests of workers, the laboring peasantry, and the  national intelligentsia.    The main goals of the communist parties of the states are  the  following:    --service to the laboring public;    --socialism and communism as the historical future of  mankind, freedom and social equality, collectivism, social  justice, and genuine humanism;    --the achievement, defense, and consolidation of political  power by the laboring public, represented by the soviets, the  development of socialist democracy, and extensive national  self-rule;    --the opposition of the restoration of capitalism, and the  reinstatement of the socialist pattern of development in the  republics of the USSR as the best method of satisfying the  social needs of the laboring public;    --the cessation of inter-ethnic conflicts and the prevention  of civil wars within the territory of the USSR;    --the reestablishment of the USSR as a voluntary association  of sovereign states based on the principles of Soviet  patriotism, internationalism, the fraternity of peoples, and  respect for national traditions, in accordance with the national  referendum of 17 March 1991, when three-fourths of the adult  population of the country voted to preserve the USSR;    --the gradual reestablishment of the single republic  communist parties and their unification in a single Communist  Party of the Soviet Union during the process of the  reestablishment of the USSR.    The parties have defined their political strategy and  tactics, using Marxist-Leninist doctrine and dialectical  materialism as a guide, in a process of creative development,  based on an analysis of the actual historical situation and the  achievements of national and world science and culture.    The parties will use parliamentary and non-parliamentary  forms of political struggle to attain these goals within the  confines of existing laws.    Conference participants reaffirmed the accurate and timely  nature of the decisions of the 19th CPSU Congress on the  temporary--until the USSR has been reestablished--reorganization  of the CPSU as the Union of Communist Parties-CPSU, and they  believe that the communist parties of the states are all part of  a single communist movement within the territory of the USSR but  have their own autonomous organizations and their own programs  and charters.    Conference participants noted that some of the provisions of  the UCP-CPSU Charter and Program and obsolete and do not  correspond fully to the present features of the work of the  communist parties of the states. They requested the UCP-CPSU  Council to work with authorized representatives of the parties  on the elaboration of a common set of program and charter  principles and to submit them to the 30th UCP-CPSU Congress and  other general party forums for consideration.    Conference participants view the current coordinating  convention of leaders of the communist parties of all states  formed within the territory of the USSR as a permanent body.    Conference participants advise all communist parties to  concentrate on elaborating and substantiating our common goals,  coordinating joint actions by the parties for the attainment of  these goals, publicizing experience in political work with labor  collectives and with youth, and developing, supporting, and  distributing communist and opposition socialist news media.    Conference participants condemn all attempts to split the  communist parties and their regional organizations and to create  a communist movement with numerous centers and advise communists  to unite in single organizations for stronger influence among  the workers, peasants, and intelligentsia. Questions connected  with differing interpretations of theoretical aspects of the  tactics and strategy of party actions can and must be discussed  in intra-party debates in accordance with the standards of party  ethics.    Conference participants appeal to all communists for an  active struggle for the unity of the communist movement within  the territory of the Soviet Union, for their resolute defense of  the interests of the laboring public, and for stronger  organizational and party discipline. Our goals are a Soviet  Union, government by soviets of workers' deputies, a single  Communist Party, and socialism.    The resolution was approved by all conference  participants.</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Rebel Tory peers hail police bill climbdown Rebel Conservative peers yesterday welcomed a climbdown on police reform by Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, removing the threat of a damaging defeat in the Lords. Mr Howard was forced to abandon the key elements of his proposals to remove police authorities from the control of local councillors. The climbdown is an embarrassment to Mr Howard, who faces criticism of the criminal justice bill, the other important law-and-order measure announced in the autumn. It is a further blow to Mr John Major's Back to Basics campaign for traditional values, in which a crackdown on law and order is prominent. Lord Whitelaw, the former Conservative deputy prime minister who led opposition to key elements, said the changes to the bill were 'of enormous importance to our country'. Lord Callaghan, former Labour prime minister, said the government had 'given up the substance and kept the form' of the bill to avoid defeat. Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, the former Labour home secretary who is now a Liberal Democrat, said Mr Howard had 'mixed dogma and hubris with a reluctance to consult and a determination to legislate at almost any price'. The climbdown was announced by Earl Ferrers, the Home Office minister, before the Lords resumed a line-by-line debate on the police and criminal evidence bill. He said the government would drop plans to remove the automatic majority enjoyed by local authorities on police authorities, which at present consist of two-thirds councillors and one-third magistrates. He said most police authorities would have nine councillors, five Home Office nominees and three magistrates. The Home Office nominees will be chosen by selection panels consisting of one member chosen by the home secretary, one chosen by councillors and magistrates, and one chosen jointly. The selection panels will produce a list of candidates from which the home secretary will nominate five.</p>

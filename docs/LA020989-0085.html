			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH TO DELAY PLAN FOR OIL DRILLING AND LEASING OFF CALIF.  </P> <P> President Bush, in a major peace offering to environmentalists, will pledge in  his nationally televised speech to Congress at 6 p.m. today to "indefinitely  postpone" oil drilling off the Northern California coast and to delay a major  lease sale planned for Southern California, a senior Administration aide said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The proposal, which environmental leaders hailed as a major victory, will all  but kill the Ronald Reagan Administration's long-stalled plan to greatly expand  drilling in California waters. The plan, which for eight years has been fought  by California officials in Congress and the courts, became a major issue during  the fall presidential campaign. Democrats charged then that Bush, if elected,  would allow drilling to proceed.  </P> <P> Bush, during the campaign, pledged to re-examine Reagan's drilling plans. Since  then "the jury has been out on this issue with Bush," said Rep. Mel Levine  (D-Santa Monica), a leading opponent of offshore drilling.  </P> <P> "I've always felt that Bush's first test on the environment would be the  California coastline," Levine said. If Bush sticks to his plan to forestall the  lease sales, "it would be a dramatic environmental victory," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pledge on Acid Rain  </P> <P> In a second environmental decision, Bush will pledge in the speech to send  Congress legislation to reduce acid rain emissions as part of a new clean air  proposal. The pledge backs up a promise that William K. Reilly, Bush's  Environmental Protection Agency chief, made last week during his Senate  confirmation hearings and could break a logjam that prevented significant  modernization of clean air rules throughout Reagan's tenure.  </P> <P> Administration sources cautioned, however, that Bush will not offer any new  specifics on how to meet his clean air goals, leaving them open to further  negotiations.  </P> <P> Under the Reagan Administration's oil drilling plan, which was pushed by James  G. Watt, Reagan's controversial first Interior secretary, the federal  government proposed two major new California oil lease sales, Lease Sale 91,  off the northern coast, and Lease Sale 95, covering the coast south of Santa  Barbara.  </P> <P> Under Bush's plan, Lease Sale 91 would be "indefinitely postponed," effectively  killing the proposal. Lease Sale 95 would be delayed pending a report from a  special task force that Bush will charge with developing plans to balance  environmental and energy needs. While the task force approach in theory would  allow the Southern California sale to proceed at some future time, "the  language of the speech will indicate that he's disposed against the drilling,"  the Administration official said.  </P> <P> Under the Reagan plan, the government would have begun leasing tracts to oil  companies in the Lease Sale 95 area next year. The sales were budgeted to bring  in some $400 million in new federal revenue in the fiscal year that begins Oct.  1. Delaying or killing the plan will cause a "revenue hit," the official said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Would Fulfill Promise  </P> <P> But the money is of less importance to the new Administration than is the  emotional symbolism of the decision. Bush, who spent three hours Wednesday  afternoon in a relaxed review of his address to Congress, plans to use  tonight's speech to demonstrate his resolve to fulfill campaign promises, one  of the most prominent of which was his pledge that "I am an environmentalist."  </P> <P> Bush became the first President ever to pay an official visit to EPA  headquarters Wednesday, attending Reilly's swearing in ceremony and telling  officials there that the American people "won't accept excuses any more and  they won't accept finger-pointing. They want us to get all the sides together  and find a way to achieve both" environmental protection and economic growth.  </P> <P> Watt and other Reagan Administration officials argued that more drilling was  needed to reduce U.S. dependency on oil imports. Opponents have countered that  the risks of oil spills, air pollution from drilling equipment and esthetic  damage from the offshore rigs outweighed the benefits that increased oil  production might bring.  </P> <P> Unlike many other major environmental issues, which require either substantial  expenditures or extensive negotiations with Congress, the oil drilling issue  can be largely resolved by executive fiat.  </P> <P> Congressional opponents of drilling -- one of the most emotional environmental  issues the federal government confronts -- have fought a steady rear-guard  action to delay Watt's plan to vastly increase drilling in the Pacific off  California, the Atlantic off New England and the Carolinas and off Alaskan  shores. And California state officials have taken the federal government to  court on several occasions claiming that drilling plans, if carried out, would  violate a series of environmental laws.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEGAL VIEW: DEBATE OVER LIVING TRUSTS GOES ON  </P> <P> The debate as to whether to use wills or living trusts continues.  </P> <P> This week I received a letter from Julia Nissley, a paralegal and the author of  "How to Probate an Estate," an excellent self-help book that guides the  uninitiated through the probate process.  </P> <P> Nissley is frustrated by ads for living trusts that describe probate as "an  ugly, expensive legal nightmare that takes two to five years to complete."  </P> <P> That is simply not true, she says. "A stream of major probate law changes in  California in recent years has simplified probate procedures considerably," she  writes. "Court involvement has been cut to a minimum, or eliminated completely  in many cases, and standardized one-page printed forms are used almost  exclusively."  </P> <P> She is correct in stating that in recent years there have been substantial  changes in the probate code. Summary (relatively simple probate) procedures are  now available, especially for small estates and estates of married couples in  which the assets pass to a surviving spouse. For instance, estates valued under  $60,000 can easily be passed to beneficiaries after a waiting period of from 40  days to six months.  </P> <P> One possible catch is that, in some cases, this process considers the fair  market value of property in the estate before allowing for any liens or  mortgages. For example, if you owned a California home worth $100,000 in your  name only, you could not use the summary procedure, even if your mortgage was  $75,000. The value considered would be the full $100,000, no matter how much  you owed on the property.  </P> <P> On the other hand, if you owned that same home as community property together  with your spouse, you might be able to use the summary procedure. That's  because joint-tenancy property, community property, real property outside  California and certain other properties are not counted in the computation to  determine whether you meet the $60,000 eligibility cutoff. You might be able to  use this summary procedure even if your house is worth $500,000 -- if it is  held in joint tenancy or community property -- as long as your other assets are  worth less than $60,000.  </P> <P> There are also summary procedures in probate that allow a person to pass his or  her estate to the surviving spouse. Nissley explains: "Although the probate  code allows the surviving spouse to receive such property free of probate, in  most cases it is necessary to have an official document to remove the deceased  spouse's name from stock certificates and deeds or other documents. To do this,  the surviving spouse can file a Spousal Property Petition and obtain a court  order declaring that the surviving spouse is the sole owner of the property."  </P> <P> Deciding whether to use a will and endure the probate process or use a living  trust and thereby avoid probate is a personal decision, based on many  individual factors -- your net worth, your marital status, your desire for  privacy, your health, even your debts, among others. There are advantages and  disadvantages to each option, many of which I have described in previous  columns. (Remember that, generally speaking, a living trust is not a  tax-avoidance device; you can obtain similar tax benefits from a testamentary  trust that is established in a will and takes practical effect only during  probate.)  </P> <P> Before you decide, find out as much as you can about each option. Consult a  lawyer, talk to a financial adviser, attend seminars, and read the various  books and other publications available on the whole issue.  </P></p>

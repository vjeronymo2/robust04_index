			<p>BFN     [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  announced that the IAEA inspection team, which entered North  Korea yesterday [17 May], today arrived in Yongbyon, the site of  inspection, and has begun inspection activities.    The inspection team will watch [kamsi] the work of replacing  nuclear fuel rods in Yongbyon and conduct additional inspection  of the radiochemical experimental power station. The United  States and IAEA have high expectations for the inspection team's  activities.    After arriving in Yongbyon today, the IAEA inspection team,  composed of three inspectors, started the work of confirming  whether fuel rods were replaced by examining surveillance  cameras and seals installed in the nuclear reactor.    Even if North Korea has launched the work of replacing  nuclear fuel rods, the IAEA will persuade North Korea through  various negotiation channels to allow the inspection team to  optionally select nuclear fuel rods from nuclear reactor at the  initial stage of replacement and to store them in a separate  special instrument. The reason for this is that if the  inspection team takes a sample from storage house after the  replacement of the fuel rods is completed, the team cannot  examine the precise amount of nuclear material already converted.    The IAEA maintains that the sample-taking during the time of  replacing the nuclear fuel rods is indispensable for deciding  whether the North Korean report that damaged fuel rods were  replaced only once since the operation began in 1986 is true or  not and for finding out the exact quantity of fuel rods replaced.    Therefore, the IAEA inspection team will decide the extent  of  progress in the replacement of nuclear fuel rods and examine  whether the precise sample-taking is feasible at the present  stage or not. The inspection team is given a special mission to  urgently report the result of its aforementioned activities.    Meanwhile, the Clinton administration has expectations for  the result of the activities by the IAEA inspection team in  North Korea.    During a regular briefing today, U.S. Defense Department  spokesman (Box) expressed an optimistic view, stating that the  inspection team will complete inspections of the seven declared  nuclear facilities, which remained unsolved last March, and will  go into the nuclear reactor in question in Yongbyon and replace  film and batteries.</p>

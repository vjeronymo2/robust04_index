			<p>BFN     [Text] Ruslan Khasbulatov expressed his condolences today  to the families of the victims of the recent armed clashes  between governmental troops and a militant group in Groznyy.    Today Interfax received a statement of Khasbulatov. For  instance, the statement said, "I am shocked by this tragedy and  by the fact that armored vehicles and armored equipment were  used in the center of a densely populated city." He said it was  inadmissible to use such extreme methods even when confronted  with criminals if this could lead to the death of innocent  people.    The armed clash took place last Sunday and Monday. The  opposition headquarters told Interfax that the governmental  forces had surrounded the group led by Ruslan Labazanov and  subjected the residential areas of the district to heavy fire.    Such developments followed the order issued by Chechen  Military Commander Sultan Geliskhanov on the disarmament of  illegal military formations.    The opposition said that from 180 to 300 people had been  killed during these events, most of them civilians. The  official authorities said there were no more than ten people had  been killed and no more than sixty wounded.    The opposition headquarters told Interfax that Labazanov and  200 of his supporters had fled. Labazanov said he would enact  what he called a bloody revenge on Chechen President Dzhokhar  Dudayev and Military Commander Geliskhanov and on their  relatives for the innocent people killed during these events.</p>

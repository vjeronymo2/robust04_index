			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Sales collapse leaves Linx Printing with Pounds 391,000 loss A poor first quarter, during which sales in the US collapsed and European sales slowed dramatically, cost Linx Printing Technologies any chance of profitability at the halfway stage. The Cambridgeshire-based manufacturer of continuous ink-jet printers, returned a loss before tax of Pounds 391,000, compared with profits of Pounds 763,000, on sales down 26 per cent to Pounds 4.27m (Pounds 5.75m). Losses per share were 1.78p, compared with earnings of 3.7p. An interim dividend of 0.25p is declared. Mr Michael Keeling, managing director, said that sales in Europe had slowed in the first quarter as distributors ran down stocks of printers when recession started to bite. The second quarter had shown an improvement and the company had traded profitably but it was not enough to offset losses in the first three months. Sales in the US slipped to Pounds 167,000 in the half year, compared with Pounds 612,000 last time. Mr Keeling said that action had been taken to redress the position although he was unwilling to spell out measures in detail. Linx, which came to the market in 1992, has been hit by a combination of recession in its principal markets, increased competition from Videojet and Domino and changes in the pattern of demand for continuous ink-jet printing. It was also affected by the delayed launch of the 6000R printer; both the printer and an environmentally-friendly ink were launched late last year, and, Mr Keeling said, have been well received. He added that trading improvements, noted in the second quarter, had continued and he believed the company would make a profit in the full year.</p>

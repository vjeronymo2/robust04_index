			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / CIS balks at Russia's peacekeeping bill: Moscow appeals in vain for men and money to bolster operations in hot-spots An angry General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, yesterday rebuked his counterparts from the other ex-Soviet republics for refusing to contribute men and money to peace-keeping operations in the Commonwealth of Independent States. He also confirmed that Russia did not intend to honour the deadline of August 31 for the withdrawal of its troops from Estonia. The clash over peacekeeping emerged at a meeting of defence ministers from the CIS, which groups 12 former Soviet republics but not the Baltic states. Russia unsuccessfully demanded help from its CIS partners, both military and financial, for the peacekeeping operations it conducts in such hot-spots of the former Soviet Union as Abkhazia and Tajikistan. Gen Grachev, irritated by his partners' stance, shelved all further discussion of co-operation over peacekeeping. He accused the CIS states of looking after their own interests without taking into account the serious economic situation in Russia. However, the CIS defence ministers did approve a document which laid out a new conception of collective security, in spite of reservations by Azerbaijan and Belarus. On the subject of Estonia, Gen Grachev, said the Russian garrison issue would not be resolved unless the problems of the Russian minority were resolved there. 'My stand on the issue has been, and will be, tough.' Russian and Estonian negotiators are currently holding negotiations in Helsinki, the Finnish capital, amid rising tension over minority rights and border disputes. Mr Mikhail Demurin, the deputy spokesman for the Russian foreign ministry, yesterday described as 'counter-productive' the vote in the US Senate earlier this month to stop aid to Russia if the troops are not pulled out according to the agreed deadline. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, was quoted earlier this week as saying he was 'confused, to say the least' by the US decision. Estonia, even more than Latvia, with which Moscow has concluded a troop withdrawal agreement, is clashing increasingly frequently with Russia - most recently over a border disagreement. Russia has strengthened the border guards and emplacements at the disputed parts.</p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / International Company News: Nestle shows interest in buying parts of SME NESTLE, the Swiss-based multinational foods group, yesterday gave the first clear signal of interest in acquiring parts of SME, Italy's state-controlled foods, retailing and catering concern. Mr Francois Xavier Perroud, a Nestle spokesman, said: 'We are watching this with undisguised interest. I can't exclude some parts of SME could fit well with our existing activities'. However, he declined to comment on whether negotiations were taking place. Rumours of a purchase by Nestle, or other leading European foods groups, have driven up shares in SME, which is 62 per cent owned the IRI state holding company, in Milan in recent days. The stock, which has surged by 40 per cent in the past two months, yesterday climbed by 2.35 per cent to L4,849. On Tuesday, SME was suspended for the day after Consob, Italy's companies and stock market watchdog, demanded information from IRI about its plans. SME is one of Italy's biggest food producers, with sales of L2,323bn (Dollars 1.74bn) last year. The remaining turnover derives from retailing - L2,478bn in 1991 - mainly through the GS supermarket chain, while catering sales amounted to L1,01bn. Any acquirer would probably concentrate on SME's branded foods. Its Bertolli vegetable oils and Cirio canned vegetables brands are household names in Italy. Cirio and associated companies are undisputed leaders in the L1,100bn Italian tomato products market, with a share of almost 28 per cent. SME has also consolidated its position abroad. It claims over 24 per cent of the L370bn US olive oil market and substantial presences in France and Spain for processed tomato products. In replies to Consob, IRI and SME both denied negotiations on the sale of all or part of the group. However, IRI's severe debt problems have spurred speculation about a possible disposal. This week, Ferruzzi, the Italian agro-industrial group, confirmed its interest in SME, while spokesmen for Mr Raul Gardini, the former Ferruzzi head now building an independent foods empire, indicated he may also be interested in expanding his activities. By contrast, Ifil, the investment concern controlled by Fiat's Agnelli family, which has been expanding its food activities, yesterday denied any interest in SME, as did BSN, the French foods group.</p>

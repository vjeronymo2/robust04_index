			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Let's think boldly about education: America I doubt you could find a politician anywhere who would challenge the need to improve education and training, especially for the less academically inclined. As the Detroit jobs conference illustrated yet again, policymakers are united in believing that better education can boost productivity and hence the supply of 'high quality' jobs. Given this consensus, thinking about educational reform remains bafflingly timid. Education is still organised according to guidelines advanced in the late 19th century. For the most part this antiquated model is unquestioned, even though we would be horrified if other aspects of social life were stuck in such a timewarp. Imagine, for example, if we still had to rely on the horse-and-buggy or the telegraph. One typically 19th-century assumption is that education is something that sets you up for life. You are educated first, be it to age 16, 21 or whatever, then you enter the world of work, at which point you can happily stop learning. There are two critical assumptions here. The first is that the pace of change is so slow that what you learn early in life will remain relevant decades later. The second is that people can be sorted for life according to their youthful educational attainment. The chap with an Oxford 'first' is a genius for life; the 16-year-old school leaver (barring the occasional John Major) forever a dunce. Both assumptions are palpably false. It is not socially or economically acceptable to write people off because they failed at school. Nor in today's fast-moving economy should anybody, whatever their age, assume they can rest on past educational laurels. We should be moving toward a new model in which work and education occur in tandem throughout our lives. Yet little is done to promote greater flexibility in the timing of educational investments. Evening classes and distance-learning remain the Cinderella of education. Governments heavily subsidise young students, many of whom lack motivation, while largely ignoring the greater needs of adults struggling to combine work, child-rearing and study. A change of mindset is required. In the US, higher education imposes a crushing financial burden on professionals (or their parents) because they do not enter the labour market until their late 20s. A typical pattern is four years of liberal arts followed by three years of law school or five years for a doctorate. Yet if the sequence were reversed and the vocational qualification taken first, young people could start working in their early 20s. Less indebted, they could then pay out of pocket for whatever other education they need or desire. It ought to be regarded as normal to combine careers with continuing education of some kind. The 19th-century model is outdated in countless other ways. Teaching methods are not keeping pace with technical change. When interactive multimedia technology theoretically permits students to learn efficiently at their own pace, most are still forced to absorb information slowly through the medieval lecturer and class 'one size fits all' format. The school day and the school curriculum are still salami-sliced into quite arbitrary fragments according to a long-outdated blueprint. School children, for example, are required to study natural sciences but not economics, which is not necessarily more demanding and far more relevant for daily life. This merely reflects the lack of clout of economics as a 'new' academic discipline at the time when the modern school curriculum was being devised. In Britain's ludicrously over-specialised universities, students can literally spend three or four years studying just one subject such as geography or French. And academics everywhere, for all their reputed intelligence, are as respectful of arbitrary demarcation lines as any forelock-tugging trade unionist. Few university economists, for example, would dream of gaining expertise in other social sciences. Each 'expert' inhabits his own cell, largely oblivious of the work of scholars wearing different labels. Why is the world of education - from kindergarten to post graduate study - so hidebound? The short answer, I fear, is that it is an enterprise that is almost everywhere dominated by the public sector. Without huge subsidies higher education simply would not exist on its present scale. And this might not matter: lack of university chairs did not exert much of a drag on the 18th-century Enlightenment. As for schools, the paternalists deserve credit for achieving universal access. But the price paid is turning out to be steep. We now live in a topsy-turvy world where most parents are happy to spend large sums on cars, homes, gadgets and holidays but regard 'free' state education as a natural right. If more people could be persuaded to regard education as a service for which they should pay at least something (preferably a lot), and hence assume some direct control, they might be amazed by the subsequent pace of reform. As market forces took effect, teaching methods and curricula would rapidly adjust to meet the diverse needs of children. There would probably be a heavy investment in new technology and a resulting surge in teacher salaries, offset by a fall in educational employment. The most revolutionary change is that schools' priorities and procedures would be determined not by tradition or government regulation, but by the ever-changing demands of customer-students. Is this so frightening a prospect, so appallingly undemocratic, that we must cling to a bureaucratic system that is a proven failure for up to 70 per cent of the population?</p>

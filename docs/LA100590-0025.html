			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ NOTES: THE CASE OF THE DISAPPEARING SOLO  </P> <P> Astute listeners might notice a difference between Michael Bolton's recently  released single of "Georgia on My Mind" and the same song on his multi-platinum  CBS album, "Soul Provider."  </P> <P> And Michael Brecker isn't happy about it.  </P> <P> CBS edited out of the single a solo by saxman Brecker and replaced it with one  by fellow saxophonist Kenny G. Brecker -- who has recorded solos on records by  Bruce Springsteen, John Lennon, Paul Simon and Frank Sinatra -- remains on the  album's "Georgia" track.  </P> <P> "The whole idea was for CBS to milk Kenny G's name to enhance sales," said Don  Lucoff, president of New York-based DL Media, Brecker's press representative.  "Brecker played a very musical solo, it enhanced the record. If they didn't  think it was good, they would have replaced him before the album was released."  </P> <P> Not so, said a representative of CBS who wished to remain anonymous. "Brecker's  an incredible artist and his solo was outstanding. It's just that (Bolton's)  been on tour, opening up for Kenny, they have worked together for years, and on  the record they simply made a special edit, which is common in our business.  The edit could have been to make (the single) more topical, to release it for  radio, to trigger a better reaction in this mode than in the original mode, to  make it more salable. It could be any number of reasons."  </P> <P> Lucoff was not impressed. "I'd have to say the title of Brecker's new GRP  release, 'Now You See It . . . (Now You Don't),' has been taken to heart," he  quipped.  </P> <P> Brecker's Southland tour dates -- he was to play the Strand in Redondo Beach,  the Wadsworth Theater in Brentwood and the Smothers Theatre in Malibu last week  -- were postponed until early next year, said his manager, Darryl Pitt. In the  meantime, Brecker begins an on-and-off six-month tour with Paul Simon on Nov.  30 in Halifax, Nova Scotia.  </P> <P> Bernie Pearl, host of KLON-FM's "Nothin' but the Blues" for 10 1/2 years and  artistic director of that station's Long Beach Blues Festival, wants his fans  to know that he left the station -- he was replaced in a staff reorganization  move last week by Bubba Jackson -- for "irreconcilable differences with  management." In a press release, Pearl said that his listeners' support "has  made (the show) KLON's most listened-to and best-supported program for most of  the last decade." To show that he bears no umbrage toward his former air  partners, he added "To my colleagues, best wishes and continued success."  </P> <P> RIM SHOTS: Pianist Dorothy Donegan, singer Lorez Alexandria and reedman Buddy  Collette entertain at the BEEM Foundation's second Scholarship Awards brunch,  to be held Sunday, noon, at the Hyatt LAX Hotel (6225 W.

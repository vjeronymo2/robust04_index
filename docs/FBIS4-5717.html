			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 13 (YONHAP) -- South Korean and Russian  fishermen have fixed the price of pollack caught in Russian  waters, agreeing on a rate 18.5 percent lower than the  international price, the fisheries administration announced  Wednesday.    The agreement on this year's catch sets a rate of 420 U.S.  dollars per ton for egg-bearing pollack and 247 dollars for  eggless pollack.    Russia had asked for a minimum 515 dollars for egg-carrying  pollack to match the international price, but South Korea had  the upper hand in the bargaining because it voluntarily  refrained from pollack fishing over the past year in the Okhotsk  Sea at Moscow's request.    Russia declared a unilateral moratorium on Okhotsk fishing  last year even though the area lies in international waters,  citing depletion of resources.    South Korea and other countries protested but later agreed  to  voluntarily hold off on fishing there.    The two countries had already agreed on this year's quota of  77,000 tons at last November's government-level talks but left  the pricing to the fishermen.    Representatives previously held two price negotiations but  left empty-handed after Russia demanded 520 to 550 dollars per  ton.</p>

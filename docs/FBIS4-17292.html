			<p>BFN     [Text] As many as 4300 Russian enterprises were forced to  entirely or partially stop their work this February, as a  result, they lost 20 million man-days. A total of 428  enterprises completely stopped their work due to the shortage of  raw materials and difficulties attributed to the sale of  manufactured goods. This data was presented by the leader of  the Federal Employment Service [FES] Fedor Prokopov on Thursday  in Moscow.    According to the experts of the Federal Employment Service,  possible "partial" unemployment in 1994 will constitute 5-8 Mn  people and the number of workers at unprofitable enterprises  could exceed 20 percent of the total number of the employed  people in Russia. As many as 4.7 million people could be fired  as a result of production reduction in 1994, and the amount of  people who had no work or who lost it and are looking for a job  could exceed 12 million people.    At the same time, experts believe that because of the  discrepancy in supply and demand the unsatisfactory demand for  working places could exceed 6 Mn people or 8.7 percent of the  able bodied population in 1994.    Experts of the Federal Employment Service are convinced that  unemployment will become the dominating problem in social and  economic policy this year. To this effect they intend to  undertake certain measures on the urgent introduction of  compensation payments for approximately 970,000 people who are  forced to work an incomplete working day or week or who are  forced to take vacation without payment.    The Federal Employment Service forecasts that in 1994 it  will  be able to find work for 1.5 million people and 550,000 people  will be granted an opportunity to re-train at the expense of the  funds of the non-budget employment fund totalling 4 trillion  rubles. The service is especially concerned about the situation  of those leaving school, training colleges, and institutes;  about 500,000 of them will be unemployed in 1994, including  90,000 graduates from high schools.    The Federal Employment Service intends to preserve the  quotas  at existing enterprises to accept graduates from schools and  institutes and to financially support employers who hire young  people. The government's presidium agreed to the key provisions  of the draft of the federal program on employment for 1994,  however, it has returned it for revision to the specially formed  governmental commission headed by Vice Premier Yuriy Yarov.</p>

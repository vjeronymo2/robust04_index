			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: CLARKE, FLYERS' GM SINCE 1984, IS FIRED  </P> <P> Bobby Clarke was fired as vice president and general manager by the  Philadelphia Flyers after the team's poorest season in 18 years.  </P> <P> Flyer president Jay Snider made the announcement at a hastily called news  conference. "After much discussion over months, we had fundamental  differences," Snider said. "We had the same goal -- to win the Stanley Cup. We  disagreed on how to do it."  </P> <P> Clarke, who played for the Flyers for 15 years and was their all-time leading  scorer, was vice president and general manager since May 1984.  </P> <P> During his six years as general manager, the Flyers won three Patrick Division  titles and two Wales Conference championships, but this season finished under  .500 for the first time since 1971-72.  </P></p>

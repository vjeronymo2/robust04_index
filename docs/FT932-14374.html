			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (4): Busiest long-haul business corridor - The North Atlantic The north Atlantic air travel market has become like the gladiatorial contests in the Roman colosseum with protagonists prepared to slug it out in a grand setting. For the gladiators, the prize was freedom. For the airlines, it is profitability. The north Atlantic divides the two greatest economic entities on earth. It is not surprising, therefore, that the roads of European and US commerce lead there: it is the busiest long-haul business air traffic corridor in the world. Governments take a close interest in the rules of the game. Heavily loss-making airlines in the US and Europe are pressing their political leaders to renegotiate bilateral deals with foreign countries to improve their competitive positions. The deals are now likely to be renegotiated, setting a new framework for transatlantic air travel for the next few years. The most important changes are in prospect on the link between the UK and north America. Britain is easily the most important gateway between the two continents, accounting for about one third of traffic. At peak times, 100 flights a day on 12 airlines link the two. The competition is healthy enough for the passengers. But the airlines lurch from one price war to another and this spring saw them once more leapfrogging each other downwards in the price of economy class tickets. If you had the flexibility to conform to strict timings and had a voucher given out by a large UK supermarket chain, you could buy a return ticket from London to New York for Pounds 169. Price has also become a factor in business class and first class. By scanning newspaper small advertisements this month, you could pick up a business class return to New York for less than Pounds 1,000 on Kuwait Airlines, compared with the Pounds 2,100 officially charged by the likes of British Airways or its two main US rivals, United Airlines and American Airlines. That level of discounting hurts, but it is more than just the slack demand and low fares that upsets the airlines. For years, the US and UK carriers have felt that the bilateral arrangements between the two countries favoured the other side's carriers. BA has said that it is at a disadvantage because it is not allowed to carry passengers beyond the first airport at which it lands in the US. Its US rivals, by contrast, have first call on anyone who wants to fly onwards within the US. US carriers argued that BA had too strong a grip on the landing rights at Europe's most important gateway, London's Heathrow airport. Good slots mean frequent departures at convenient times, factors that are high up the list of priorities for the business traveller. The bilateral debate came to a head in the last year when BA signed a deal to give it a large stake in USAir, a carrier which has a large domestic US network. Although the stake did not give BA direct control of USAir, it promised to provide it with the opportunity to feed passengers into USAir's domestic network. The big US carriers objected to the deal on the grounds that it met BA's concerns without addressing theirs. The US government agreed and BA was forced to take a smaller stake in USAir with some aspects of the deal given only one year's approval. Mr Federico Pena, the new US transportation secretary, said he wanted to use the revised BA-USAir deal as a vehicle to rewrite the bilateral agreement. Although talks, due to start early next month, are unlikely to reach a conclusion until next year, both governments in principle want further liberalisation. In an extreme case, this could mean abandoning the notion of airline nationality altogether. Today, UK and US airlines have about half the market each, which is the aim of existing rules. Under complete liberalisation, such targets would be dropped. Governments would not concern themselves with the market share of nations, only the market shares of airlines, to maintain a competitive market. BA would view such a move sympathetically, perhaps because it is the most profitable airline in the western hemisphere. Its strength might help it win a greater share of the business. But governments in the rest of Europe are unlikely to want greater liberalisation for their own links to the US. The French government has called for a renegotiation of its US bilateral to cap the US market share at 60 per cent. Mr Jurgen Weber, chairman of Lufthansa, the German flag carrier, has called on the German government to cancel its air transport agreement with the US. He says that cancelling the aviation deal will clear the ground for a fresh, more even-handed agreement than the one which has limited German airlines' access to a dozen US destinations. These developments irk US airlines. 'The majority of European carriers are being propped up (by their governments) in one way or another', says Mr David Coltman, vice-president of US carrier United Airlines' Atlantic division. But they will have a tough fight on their hands to persuade Germany and France to allow more competition across the north Atlantic. They may use free market arguments to suggest that business travellers in France and Germany will suffer. If the rules on flights to the US are tightened, then competition will be limited and fares could rise. By contrast, if the UK-US bilateral is further liberalised, then the competitive pressure on prices should at least be maintained. One consequence could be that more passengers from continental Europe will consider flying to the US through the UK. This is not only to save money. Further liberalisation of the UK bilateral should bring more frequent flights to more US destinations, while European deregulation should allow more flights from more European cities to come to the UK. The consequence of changes mooted in bilateral regulations should be that the UK will remain the foremost staging post on the north Atlantic route, and possibly the cheapest from which to fly.</p>

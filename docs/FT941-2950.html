			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / The Property Market: Perplexing new phase - Vanessa Houlder on the impact of converging gilt and property yields The property investment market is approaching a watershed. The gap between gilt yields and property yields is starting to close. The reason is twofold: the sharp fall in gilt values over the past six weeks, in which 20-year gilt yields have risen by one percentage point to 7.4 per cent, and the rapid surge in property values over the past nine months. Property yields are still being driven downwards by the weight of money being directed towards the sector. Average property yields, which stood at 9.2 per cent in February 1993, are likely to fall to below 7.5 per cent at some point over the next month, according to Mr Greg Nicholson of Hillier Parker, chartered surveyors. This presents a conundrum for property investors. Investors have tended to view high-yielding properties with secure, long-term income streams as a substitute to investing in bonds. As a result, much of the driving force for last year's drop in property yields was the decline in bond yields. The close relationship displayed by bond and property yields last year suggests that property yields could be dragged up by the current rise in bond yields. But this seems unlikely. Most analysts believe that property yields will sink beneath gilt yields, as investor confidence increases about the prospects for growth in property rents. This scenario, after all, would merely be a return to the traditional relationship between gilt and property yields. Many property owners believe that property values have nothing to lose from an increase in inflation. An inflation-induced rise in rental values would be expected to compensate for the impact of the likely rise in gilt yields. Nonetheless, the erosion of the gap between gilt and property yields may dampen investor enthusiasm. Some investment decisions have been based on demanding projections for rental growth. Yet, so far, there is little sign of rental increases in even the best property - although some of the incentives such as rent-free periods offered to tenants are beginning to diminish. If the closing of the yield gap causes investors to believe that property is self-evidently cheap, some of the froth may be taken off the top of the market. At present, there is still a scramble to buy property. The result is that values are being chased upwards - in many cases well above the asking price. 'It is a bit like being in a casino. Quoting terms bear no relation to the ultimate sale price,' says Mr Nicholson. If some of the heat is taken off the market, investors who have seen large capital uplifts over the past 18 months, may be willing to sell up and take profits. If this happens, a reduction in the the shortage of property, which has helped drive up prices, will enable a much greater equilibrium in the market. The properties which are most vulnerable to a cooling of the market are high yielding buildings where tenants are locked into paying well above market rents for long leases. As investors have become more concerned about prospects for rental growth, there has been a lessening of interest in these over-rented properties. Moreover, since many investors viewed the high, secure income streams offered by these properties as substitutes for bonds, they are likely to be more sensitive than on average to increases in bond yields. But for most types of property, the likelihood is that any further rises in the bond yields, if modest, will slow the property price rises rather than put them into reverse.</p>

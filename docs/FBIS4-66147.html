			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Baudouin Bollaert report: "Paris Conference: An Antiwar </F> Plan for Europe"]    [Excerpt] The Conference [on Stability in Europe] is an  exercise in "preventive diplomacy" intended, above all, for the  countries of East Europe that want to join the European Union  [EU]. Hence its limitations.    Fifty-seven countries or international organizations,  including the United States and Russia, will be represented at  the opening session of the Conference on Stability in Europe,  which is being held at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris. This  French initiative, the brainchild of [Prime Minister] Edouard  Balladur, has been taken up by the EU and, according to a senior  official at the French Foreign Ministry, constitutes "the first  real sign of common foreign and security policy as defined at  Maastricht."    With a wide variety of bodies such as the Council of Europe,  the CSCE, NATO, the WEU [Western European Union], the North  Atlantic Cooperation Council, and the Partnership for Peace,  there is no shortage of organizations responsible for ensuring  peace in continental Europe. However, now we are being asked to  believe that they are not sufficient. Hence the idea of this  conference, which, within one year, should lead to a stability  pact under the auspices of the CSCE.    "The diplomatic response to a problem is traditionally to  create an institution or to publish a long declaration," said  Edouard Balladur. This time, he said, "it has been decided to  intervene at the very source of the problem itself, by seeking  to resolve the questions concerning minorities and borders via  the implementation of pragmatic measures. The example of  Yugoslavia, which demonstrates the dangers of leaving questions  in abeyance or unresolved, is probably prominent in everybody's  mind."    Consequently, according to [French Foreign Minister] Alain  Juppe, it will be a question of proceeding with an exercise in  "preventive diplomacy." However, by deliberately placing it  within the perspective of the EU, the French foreign minister  has excluded the hottest dossiers: Bosnia, Kosovo, the Crimea  or Caucasus, etc. In short, "the plan applies precisely to the  area where there are no problems," said one British diplomatic  ironically.    This renders no less laudable the objective being sought,  namely to ensure that the countries counted as candidate EU  member states (Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary,  Romania, Bulgaria, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania) establish  relations built on trust at regional level, by signing  reciprocal good neighborliness agreements. This is something  that Alain Lamassoure, [French] minister delegate for European  affairs, sums up in the following terms: "We are ready to  welcome new members, but not new sources of conflict." After  having adopted a final document reiterating the main principles  of the CSCE (respect for human rights and the rights of  minorities, etc.), the participants in the conference will have  to have "multilateral or regional discussions" in order to try  and settle, for instance, the fate of the Hungarian minorities  in Romania and Slovakia, or that of the Russian minorities in  the Baltic states.    "We will have to combine the strong political impetus given  by the EU and the Paris conference with great flexibility in the  methods of negotiation, bearing in mind the subjects treated.  The important thing is to stipulate an obligation to achieve a  result," says Paris. An interim conference could be scheduled  for the end of the year to evaluate the progress being made, and  the final conference at which the stability pact will be adopted  could be held "during the first half, or even the first quarter,  of 1995," said Alain Juppe.

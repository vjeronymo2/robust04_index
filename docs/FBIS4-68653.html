			<p>Republics   <F P=102>   944F0657A Moscow OBSHCHAYA GAZETA in Russian No 17, 29 Apr  94 p 7 </F>  <F P=103> 944F0657A </F> <F P=104>  Moscow OBSHCHAYA GAZETA </F> <F P=105>  Russian </F> CSO   <F P=106> ["Extracts From Materials for a Discussion Sponsored by the </F> State Duma Committee for CIS Affairs in Late March 1994"  published under the rubric "Document": "The Duma Is Still  Discussing Principles Concerning Support for Fellow Citizens  Residing Abroad"]    [Text] 1. ...As the legal successor of the USSR, Russia is  fully responsible for the fate of and ensuring the rights of  noncitizens-former citizens of the USSR wherever they may  reside. It is necessary to introduce the status of PERSONS  EQUATED TO CITIZENS of Russia in order to ensure that this  responsibility be discharged.    Individuals who are deprived of an opportunity to become  citizens of their country of residence or do not wish to do so  for a particular reason, but who in view of circumstances have  not applied to become citizens of Russia, should enjoy the  protection and patronage of Russia and the rights of citizens of  Russia, except for the right to participate in elections to  organs of state power, the right to a proportion of privatized  property in Russia, and probably certain other rights. The  status of persons equated to citizens shall cease automatically  once citizenship arrangements are made (the person opts for a  particular citizenship). (...)    2. First of all, it is necessary to strive to sign  agreements  on dual citizenship with all states-former republics of the  USSR. In the event of becoming dual citizens, the Law on  Protection of Russian Citizens and Persons Equated to Them  Abroad would apply to this category of persons.    However, the patronage of Russia should apply to a broader  community of people, that is, those who have become citizens of  the new state and who do not have an opportunity to obtain a  second, Russian citizenship. Direct legal protection and other  protection for such people will be quite justifiably viewed as  interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states. In  this case, Russia can only proceed from the principles of the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights and see to it that human  rights are upheld in all countries regardless of a person's  cultural or ethnic affiliation, origin, and citizenship. (...)    Russia must look for a way to provide economic support for  both the Russian-language educational system in the new foreign  countries and the development of the cultural life of the  Russian-speaking population. To this end, provisions should be  made for preferential procedures for receiving education at the  colleges of Russia (citizens and equivalent individuals should  receive an education in Russia on the same terms as citizens  permanently residing in Russia). It is necessary to develop a  program for scientific and cultural exchanges and training in  production, as well as a program for investment in the  educational system abroad. (...)    Russia should also facilitate the self-organization of the  Russian-speaking population by encouraging, for example, the  creation of national-cultural societies, supporting the creation  of economic structures affiliated with such societies, and  granting customs or other preferences to such structures. In  this case, the "titular" population would also be interested in  the preservation and development of such enterprises and,  consequently, in support for the Russian-speaking population.    3. Joint ventures in which the Russian-speaking population  would become the main partner from the side of the new states  must become a particularly important form of support for the  Russian-speaking population abroad. It would be necessary to  invest state funds in such enterprises, including the property  of Russia abroad, and to provide incentives for capital  investment by nonstate enterprises of Russia.    The creation of trilateral companies in which enterprises  from the traditional foreign countries would appear as the third  side could be the least painful path. It is also possible to  support joint Russian-foreign enterprises, whose cofounders from  the traditional foreign countries (for example, France) would  create mixed companies in the new foreign countries (for  example, French-Estonian companies).    Protection of the Russian population is not provided by way  of economic pressure or blockades of countries behaving in an  uncivilized manner but rather by way of developing cooperation  that provides an incentive for the proper attitude of the  government toward the Russian-speaking community.    4. The above points have referred solely to the  Russian-speaking population. However, it is necessary to also  support the same measures for the ethnic groups of residents of  Russia that have preserved their national originality, for  example, Chechens in Kazakhstan.    Germans, Meskhetian Turks, and Crimean Tatars--ethnic groups  whose destiny has been associated with the forced resettlement  of the 1940's--should also be supported.    In carrying out this program it is necessary to take into  account the fact that a large number of people coming from the  new foreign countries whose national and cultural interests are  not satisfied reside on the territory of Russia. Improvements in  the area of upholding the rights of ethnic minorities in Russia  should be an integral part of the program of support for the  Russian-speaking population abroad. This approach will testify  to the sincerity of Russia and will deflect the charges that  Russia is exploiting the slogan of upholding human rights for  political purposes.  <H5>  From the Files </H5>   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |113,540 people have become Russian citizens in nearby foreign countries (dat-|  |a as of 31 January 1994 from the Consular Service Department of the Russian  |  |Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs)                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1.

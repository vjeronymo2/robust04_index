			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Stanislav Devaty, director of the Security </F> and Information Service, by Jan Bednar; place and date not  given: "Intelligence Services Should Be Controlled by the  Government and Parliament"]    [Text] Parliamentary committees last week debated the  government bill on the Security and Information Service (BIS)  and also an "umbrella" law on all intelligence services of the  Czech Republic. The existing law on BIS is valid until the end  of the first half of this year, and, therefore, a new law has to  be adopted. We have asked interim BIS Director Stanislav Devaty,  who defended the bill in parliament, to what extent the new laws  will be of benefit to the work of intelligence services.    [Devaty] Parliament has decided that the system of  intelligence services should be regulated by a law. This law  should apply to all intelligence services because, until now, we  have had a comprehensive law on BIS only. Parliament has  decided that a new concept for intelligence services will be  created. New special regulations for each service should be  built on this concept. Ours has been drafted. Of course, it is  difficult to invent something new in the sphere of intelligence  services, but we have drafted this bill using our own experience  and foreign experience.    [Bednar] According to the bill, the government wants to take  over the control of intelligence services, apart from giving  them assignments. Have you not been satisfied with the existing  way of control?    [Devaty] I have said it about a hundred times: I am not  against control at all. On the contrary, I welcome any kind of  control. In principle, I am only against control bodies having  access to open cases. We have a sort of gentleman's agreement  with the control body: I am willing to let them have access to  any operation any time, but such an operation must be closed  first. The problem is that our responsibility should be  balanced. That is, if I open records on something, I must have  a very good reason for it. One cannot have access to an  operation in progress without having a reason or just because  someone says so. Someone must bear responsibility for the  operation being stopped. Deputies must be aware of the fact  that it may have serious consequences if, having access to our  work, they prevent a certain operation from continuing.    [Bednar] Has full responsibility been transferred to the  government whose task is to control you, then?    [Devaty] Control should be divided between the government  and parliament. As long as the government is to be responsible  for the activity of the [intelligence] services, it also has to  have a chance of controlling this service in some way. This is  logical. Now, we have to find a balance between the government's  interference in the work of the [intelligence] services and  parliament's access to their activity.    [Bednar] Does it trouble you that you have not been  appointed BIS director permanently?    [Devaty] To be sincere, it does bother me quite a lot, not  so much because of myself but because it means, in fact,  permanent "uncertainty within the firm." In view of the fact  that I have already been two years with BIS, that this "firm"  has developed in a certain way, and that we even implemented a  certain concept, I believe that it does not much contribute to  the security of the people who are employed there if no  permanent director has been appointed. Before me, there were  seven directors there. Such changes are not to the benefit of  the service, in the same way that they would not be to the  benefit of any other organization.    [Bednar] Does this obstruct reconstruction of the service?    [Devaty] We are trying to eliminate the influence of this  fact on the reconstruction of the service, but we can feel that  people are insecure. Each director brings his own ideas, and  this means certain changes to the intelligence service, a shock.  The intelligence service has been through so many shocks it  needs a period of peace, in my opinion. We already have arrived  at a certain model, and now we need at least two years of peace  to be able to develop our activity.    [Bednar] Why has the decision on the director still not been  made?    [Devaty] I do not know. The government, as well as  parliament, have their say in the matter--still according to the  old law. The fact is that I have been appointed precisely  according to the law. I was proposed by the government at that  time, the appropriate parliamentary committee discussed the  proposal, and I was appointed by the Czech National Council  Presidium. Unfortunately, they used the word "interim." Why  this still is the case, I do not know.</p>

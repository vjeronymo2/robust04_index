			<p>BFN     [Text] Croatian Assembly President Stipe Mesic and a group  of deputies have received a delegation of the Duma, the lower  house of the Russian parliament. The delegation was headed by  Kostantin Zatulin, president of this house's committee for  cooperation with fellow nationals. Our Andjelko Perincic was  among the reporters who attended one part of this meeting.    [Perincic] At the start, Zatulin said that the deputies to  Russia's Duma are concerned about the situation in the area of  the former Yugoslavia, so at their last session they voted for a  decision to urgently send their delegation to our region where  they could talk about how the warring parties view solutions to  the crisis. He also told his hosts that his delegation has  already visited Knin, Belgrade, and Vukovar. They will visit  Pale, too, he said. He cited the official titles of these  unrecognized state entities such as the Srpska republic and the  even more self-styled republic of Serb Krajina. In his reply  Assembly President Stipe Mesic explained in detail the history  and causes of the collapse of the Versailles Yugoslavia and the  breakdown of the socialist federation which Tito had taken to  the threshold of a confederal state, especially by the  constitution of 20 years ago.    The conflict, instigated by Serbia in pursuit of its  territorial ambitions, with weaponry belonging to the common  federation of the past, can only be resolved by using force, by  meeting force with greater force, as the aggressor does not want  negotiations, Mesic said. It is also of essential importance  for the world to restore the fundamental principles of the  inviolability of borders. He also criticized the Greater Serbia  theory -- according to which all Serbians should live in a  single state -- by raising the following counterquestion: What  would happen if the same demands were to be raised by Russians,  Hungarians, Germans, and other peoples? He also added that  there would have been no war had the world thwarted Serbian  aggression by greater force before Vukovar.    The head of Russia's lower house of parliament first  demanded  that the meeting should continue without the presence of the  press, so reporters were forced to leave the talks following  these demands.</p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Dentists call for free checks THE BRITISH Dental Association yesterday called for the re-introduction of free check-ups in response to the government's review of dentists' pay. But it would mean some people having to pay for treatment at rates agreed between them and their dentist - which Labour said could mean higher charges. The association wants to see a free core service of basic care and treatment which would include check-ups, X-rays and all emergency treatments. Any other treatment would have to be paid for by patients, but children and people who could not afford to pay would continue to get all treatment free. The scheme would involve moving the bulk of adult services from the NHS. Patients whose dentists still do NHS work pay 80 per cent towards the cost of treatment and inspections. However, one in five dentists already now only takes on private patients following a 7 per cent cut in fees last year.</p>

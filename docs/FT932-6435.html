			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / People: Promotion in pipeline British Gas has appointed Harry Moulson to head its national transmission system - the pipelines network - when Donald Young retires in July. The appointment places a 49-year old high-flier, who has been groomed for the top at British Gas, into a crucial post in the run-up to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's report on the company. The commission's report is due by the end of July and could leave Moulson heading a separate company. One of the key decisions the commission must make is whether British Gas's pipelines division should be hived off as a separate entity. Even if this does not happen, Moulson will still have to erect a Chinese wall between pipelines and the company's marketing business  -along lines that British Gas has already agreed with regulators. Moulson's background is in marketing in British Gas's regional offices and, more recently, at headquarters. Before that, he was chairman of British Gas Wales.</p>

Within this context, a meeting was held yesterday at the  headquarters of the Movement for Democracy in Algeria and  included representatives from the National Liberation Front,  Islamic Al-Nahda Movement, Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement],  and the Movement for Democracy in Algeria.    AL-KHABAR newspaper said in today's issue that preparations  have been going on for about a week to hold this meeting, during  which the preliminary document, prepared by the National  Dialogue Commission, the issue of whether or not to take part in  the institutions of the transitional period, and the issue of  guarantees and the sides that would participate in the National  Conference were discussed.    AL-KHABAR added that the participation of the dissolved  Islamic Salvation Front occupied a sizable part of the meeting's  time.    It seems, according to the newspaper, that these parties  have  formed a unified pivot to put pressure on the National Dialogue  Commission when the multilateral meetings are resumed after  tomorrow, Wednesday [5 January].    Before the anticipated meetings between the National  Dialogue  Commission and the parties, the National Party for Solidarity  and Development said in a statement, a copy of which was  delivered today to APS, that the multifaceted crisis, in  particular the political crisis that resulted from the  suspension of the December elections in 1991, can only be  treated through a serious dialogue between the authority and the  three winning parties in the elections.    In order to make the National Conference and the  transitional  period successful, Bencherif's party [National Party for  Solidarity and Development] proposes the release of political  prisoners, the closure of the detention camps in the south,  easing the conditions of the state of siege, and reinstating  workers dismissed for their political views.    At the end, the statement called for achieving all-embracing  reconciliation within the framework of the reciprocal  compromises and the return of tranquility to the people.</p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Regions weigh up Moscow power struggle FROM Sakhalin Island near Japan to Murmansk near Norway, Russia's regions are weighing up the consequences of the political crisis in Moscow with less trepidation than President Boris Yeltsin. As Mr Sergei Shakhrai, Mr Yeltsin's chief legal adviser, met the heads of local emergency committees, local officials interviewed in a straw poll yesterday were sceptical about the need or likelihood of extraordinary measures. While the legislative and executive branches battle it out in Moscow, Russia's 89 constituent republics and regions are demanding more freedom to run their affairs as promised in a federation treaty signed by all parties last year. Under threat from a Congress of People's Deputies, Mr Yeltsin has argued that only a strong presidency can push through radical economic reforms and keep together a country spanning 14 time zones. But Ms Zoya Kornilova, both a deputy and the official representative in Moscow of Sakha, the autonomous republic which produces most of Russia's diamonds, said the Congress had spared President Yeltsin a humiliating defeat by banning the referendum he wants. 'He has enough powers. He just has not used them effectively,' she said, adding that Sakha, better known as Yakutia, could not guarantee that a referendum would obtain a quorum. Mr Ivan Shabunin, head of the regional administration of Volgograd in southern Russia which has forged ahead with economic reforms, dismissed a statement by President Yeltsin's spokesman that the Congress was trying to restore communism. 'We just need to work,' he said, supporting a statement by regional chiefs calling for a moratorium on all elections and referendums this year and next. 'Let those who started reforms carry them through and take responsibility for them.' Dr Vyacheslav Silin, deputy chief of the Murmansk regional administration, was alone among those surveyed in sharing the president's fears: he pointed out that if radical reforms were not allowed to succeed, regions would try to fend for themselves and accelerate a break-up of Russia. But he said he doubted Mr Yeltsin could count on sufficient support from structures like the army to introduce presidential rule. With most Russians disillusioned with politics, many regional chiefs feared that a referendum turnout would be low. Many are looking for change from the government of Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, who has pledged tough financial policies combined with the removal of special tax privileges for individual regions and enterprises. Mr Grigory Shamin, head of the regional council of Tomsk in Siberia, complained that last year the federal government had allowed regions only 19 per cent of revenues, but that individual regions, including Tomsk, had been able to keep 50 per cent after lobbying Moscow. 'Why don't they just give us all 40 per cent?' he asked. Mr Viktor Sirenko, deputy governor of Sakhalin Island, said Moscow had to stop treating the regions 'like slaves'.</p>

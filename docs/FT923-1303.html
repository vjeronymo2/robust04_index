			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / E Europe trade zone dropped HUNGARY and Poland have shelved plans for a central-east European free trade zone with Czechoslovakia in favour of a separate bilateral agreement, Nick Denton reports from Budapest. Mr Jozsef Antall and Mrs Hanna Suchocka, the Hungarian and Polish prime ministers, decided yesterday in Budapest to press ahead alone with liberalisation while the relationship between the Czech lands and Slovakia remains unclear. The two leaders said their goal was bilateral free trade from the start of next year, followed only later by individual agreements with the two halves of Czechoslovakia.</p>

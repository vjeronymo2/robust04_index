His view mirrors that of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees'  chief, Larry Hollingworth, that it is time to "get on or get  out", and interprets the existing UN mandate more widely than  some.    Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, 53, a former commander  of the SAS [Special Air Services], arrived at Kiseljak  yesterday. Asked if he would take a tougher stance than his  predecessor, Lieutenant-General Francis Briquemont, he said: "I  can't predict. Our mission is to facilitate the delivery of  humanitarian aid, to secure the safe areas and to bring about  peace in this country. I'm going to go around for the first  week or two looking at how we're going to achieve this."    But sources said he would expect his battalions--including  his old regiment, the Coldstream Guards at Vitez--to operate  more robustly, and to impose themselves on the countryside.  Galvanising troops of several nations to take a more active,  peace-keeping approach will be a great challenge, although the  French and British governments appear to be in step on a more  forthright approach.    General Rose has said he believes the UN mandate goes far  enough and that he has enough troops to fulfil it. In his view,  the mandate provides for securing safe areas, ending the siege  of Sarajevo and restoring peace -- a wider interpretation than  some. "My own view is that people's attitudes count more than  anything else in this country," the general said.    He would not be drawn on the question of a possible  withdrawal. "We are keeping thousands of people alive. If there  had never been the UN Protection Force there would have been  wholesale famine and death." He added: "Obviously no  commitment we have is going to be open ended. There will come a  time when the countries will look at whether the cost in  financial terms and human terms justifies the result. Of course  we can't stay here forever."    As General Rose was speaking, news had broken of Bosnian  army  successes in attempting to break out of the Maglaj pocket to the  south-east, with the reported recapture of Donji Mravici and  Lijesnica. Far to the south, in the British area, there was a  report of the hamlet of Here, on the main, British-controlled  supply route, being razed to the ground, Here had been about  1km inside Bosnian army lines and near the Croat-held town of  Prozor.    A UN military spokesman, Lieutenant-Colonel Bill Aikman,  also  said yesterday that a "significant battle" erupted after Croat  units surged out of Prozor towards government-held Jablanica on  Monday.    General Rose denied that General Briquemont had left Bosnia  a  frustrated and broken man. "A lot of nonsense has been talked  about General Briquemont," he said.    France yesterday proposed General Bertrand de Lapresle,  commander of its Rapid Intervention Force, to take over as  overall commander of the UN peace-keeping forces in former  Yugoslavia.    The French Defence Minister, Francois Leotard, said he  wanted  General de Lapresle to replace General Jean Cot, who is to leave  at the end of March after clashing pubicly with UN  Secretary-General, Butrus Butrus-Ghali.</p>

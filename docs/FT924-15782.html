			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Mosaic adjourns annual meeting Mosaic Investments, the West Midlands-based mini-conglomerate, adjourned its annual meeting yesterday. It will resume when the company's discussions with its bankers are concluded. On Monday the company withdrew its final dividend and had its shares suspended following a failure to agree borrowing facilities to allow it to redeem Pounds 2.99m of convertible preference shares. Mosaic said the issues raised by the announcement would make it difficult for shareholders to decide how to vote on the AGM resolutions. And many would have sent off their proxy votes before the announcement.</p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt, Zurich back at record highs A mixture of performances were seen yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT turned forward once again to set a new record close following the release of satisfactory M3 data and a slight easing in the repo rate. Nevertheless, the market is not anticipating a cut in the discount rate at the regular meeting of the Buba council today, believing that the bank will wait for the release of inflation data before committing itself, perhaps on November 4. The DAX index added 15.80 to 2,042.56. Turnover was DM9.8bn. Daimler was DM3 stronger at DM743 by the close, with news that Deutsche Aerospace planned to make substantial job cuts by 1996 coming in the after market. ZURICH returned to record breaking territory after Tuesday's brief consolidation and the SMI index added 7.7 to 2,668.4 in active trading. Nestle, benefiting from the strength of the dollar, continued its advance, adding SFr9 to SFr1,183 in active trading. PARIS was beset by technical problems during the session and the CAC-40 index closed just 2.36 ahead at 2,149.68. News that Cap-Gemini, Chargeurs and Club Med were to be dropped from the index from November 17 depressed their prices: falling respectively by FFr13.40, FFr52 and FFr26 to FFr185.10, FFr1,145 and FFr358. The replacements, BNP, CLF and Promodes, gained FFr1.80, FFr15.50 and FFr60 to FFr278.90, FFr439.50 and FFr1,010. MILAN remained preoccupied with Fiat although renewed interest emerged in the broader market and the Comit index edged 0.69 lower to 588.25. Arbitrage trade between the shares and rights left Fiat L12 lower at L3,850. BCI rose L27 to L4,522 and Credito Italiano eased L14 to L2,301 as analysts awaited clarification of comments by the prime minister that a 3 per cent shareholder limit after the banks were privatised did not exclude the forming of 'hard core' shareholder blocks. He added that investors wanting to take such positions would have to pay a premium for their stakes. Speculative buying took Montedison L15.70 higher to L854.60 in heavy volume of 10.9m shares. AMSTERDAM enjoyed another record breaking day with the CBS Tendency index finishing up 1.4 or 1 per cent at 133.9. KLM strengthened on US buying with the shares adding Fl 1.70 to Fl 42.50. The publishing sector was also firmer, with Elsevier up Fl 2.70 to Fl 149.20, helped by news that the UK had cleared its purchase of the Official Airlines guide, VNU rising Fl 3.20 to Fl 145.80 and Wolters Kluwer up Fl 2.00 to Fl 106.50. Akzo was one of the day's losers, down Fl 2.80 at Fl 181.60. STOCKHOLM was pulled lower by Ericsson and Volvo. The Affarsvarlden general index closed down 11.5 at 1,385.5. Ericsson shed SKr17 to SKr440 while Volvo slipped SKr16 to SKr413 following its announcement of details of its buy-out for BCP. Procordia lost SKr6 to SKr230. MADRID finished near its highs for the day, lifted by an easing of one-year treasury bond yields, and the general index rose 2.93 to 303.1. Endesa added Pta180 to Pta6,000 in response to the company's forecast on Tuesday that group profit would rise by 5-10 per cent in 1993. COPENHAGEN climbed to a new year's high with Novo Nordisk up DKr4 to DKr630 and the KFX index rising 1.16 to 101.95.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  will hold working group meetings on bilateral trade "Framework"  talks in Tokyo later this week and next week to discuss  government procurement areas, the Foreign Ministry announced  Wednesday [15 June].    The working group meeting on telecommunications equipment  will be held Thursday and Friday, and the meeting on medical  equipment will be held June 22 and 23, both in Tokyo, the  ministry said.    Ministry sources have said vice ministerial-level meetings  on  the Framework talks between Deputy U.S. Trade Representative  Charlene Barshefsky and Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi  will be held June 22 and 23 in Tokyo.    Barshefsky is expected to arrive in Japan on June 21, the  sources said.    Japan and the U.S. agreed in May to restart the Framework  talks after reaching common ground on the definition of  objective criteria that it would be both quantitative and  qualitative yardsticks instead of numerical targets for each of  the negotiation sectors.    Government procurement of medical and telecommunications  equipment is one of the three priority areas along with  automobile and auto parts, and insurance business.</p>

			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Farming reform call MR JOHN GUMMER, the agriculture minister, condemned the European Community's farming policies as 'bankrupt' yesterday and said the government would be pressing for a swift reform of the common agricultural policy. He said the community needed to move towards more realistic prices at a pace the agricultural community could accept. Mr Gummer also reiterated his disagreement with the McSharry proposals to reform the CAP. 'You cannot bribe people to stay on uneconomic plots,' he said.</p>

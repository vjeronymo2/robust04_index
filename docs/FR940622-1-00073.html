			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Work-Colleges (Subpart C)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 675.41&hyph;675.47  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Amendments added new section 448 to the HEA to establish the ``Work-Colleges program.'' Congress created this program to encourage comprehensive work-learning programs and recognize the special nature of institutions that choose to make work-learning a central part of their educational programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the statute, institutions that satisfy the definition of ``work-college'' may apply to the Secretary to participate in the Work-Colleges program. The term ``work-college'' under the statute means an eligible institution that (1) has been a public or private nonprofit institution with a commitment to community service; (2) has operated a comprehensive work-learning program for at least two years; (3) requires all resident students who reside on campus to participate in a comprehensive work-learning program and the provision of services as an integral part of the institution's educational program and as part of the institution's educational philosophy; and (4) provides students participating in the comprehensive work-learning program with the opportunity to contribute to their education and to the welfare of the community as a whole.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A comprehensive work-learning program does not provide only narrowly career-oriented or job-skill-oriented employment. It provides work experiences that teach basic habits and attitudes, responsibility, interpersonal relations, communication, teamwork, self analysis, organizational behavior, problem solving, leadership and other lessons that are not job specific or career specific.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The statute requires that funds made available to work-colleges must be matched on a dollar-for-dollar basis from non-Federal sources. In addition to any amounts appropriated, the statute allows work-colleges to also use FWS program funds and Federal Perkins Loan funds to provide flexibility in strengthening the self-help-through-work element in financial aid packaging.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Program Name Change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ``Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant program'' will now be known as the ``Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant program.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 676.4&blank;Allocation and Reallocation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary proposes to amend this section to provide for the flexibility to reallocate unexpended FSEOG funds. This change would allow the Secretary to assist students who suffer financial harm from a natural disaster such as a flood or hurricane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 676.18&blank;Use of Funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary proposes to eliminate an institution's authority to transfer FSEOG funds to the FWS program. This change is required by the Amendments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 676.20&blank;Minimum and Maximum FSEOG Award  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current regulations provide that an institution may award a student a maximum of $4,000 per academic year. In accordance with section 413B(a)(3) of the HEA, the Secretary proposes to amend the regulations to allow an institution to increase the FSEOG to $4,400, for a student engaged in a program of study abroad.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 676.21&blank;FSEOG Federal Share Limitations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Amendments require that the Federal share of FSEOG awards will not exceed 75 percent effective for award years beginning on or after July 1, 1993. The Secretary is proposing to amend this section to incorporate this statutory change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is important to note that the Secretary will continue to authorize a Federal share of 100 percent of the FSEOGs awarded to students by an institution for an award year if all of the following criteria are met:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The institution is designated as an eligible institution under the Strengthening Institutions Program (34 CFR part 607) or the Strengthening Historically Black Colleges and Universities Program (34 CFR part 608).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The institution requests that increased Federal share as part of its regular FSEOG funding application for that year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Assessment of Costs and Benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently. Burdens specifically associated with information collection requirements, if any, are identified and explained elsewhere in this preamble under the heading Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations, the Secretary has determined that the benefits of the proposed regulations justify the costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal governments in the exercise of their governmental functions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To assist the Department in complying with the specific requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any potential costs or increase potential benefits resulting from these regulations without impeding the effective and efficient administration of the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Clarity of the Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 requires each agency to write regulations that are easy to understand.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

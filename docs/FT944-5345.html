			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / FT Christmas Books: The pick of the publishing year - From politics to poetry, history to humour - our writers choose the best books of 1994 I recommend May the Lord in his Mercy be Kind to Belfast by Tony Parker (HarperCollins Pounds 7.99), and Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil by John Berendt (Chatto, Pounds 10.99). Tony Parker's book is a collection of interviews with people on every side of the political, religious, and economic divide. He has a sorcerer's skill at charming remarkable self-confessions, without ever making his presence felt. The book is apparently artless, but is beautifully edited and shaped, and is the most comprehensive and profound document that I have ever read about Northern Ireland. John Berendt's book is set in Savannah. It is a documentary account of a murder that took place in a small, insulated Southern community. It is a beguiling mixture of wit, mystery, satire and compelling narrative, seasoned with some voodoo and jazz.</p>

The SCS petition was adopted at the SCS  constituent meeting held on December 4, 1993.    The Czech Interior Ministry replied that Czech law does not  allow dual citizenship and that it does not stand a chance of  being amended in the foreseeable future. Making an exemption  for older people would create an unwelcome precedent, the  ministry says.    The Czech Ministry for State Property Administration and  Privatization replied that those Czechs who are permanently  resident in Slovakia are not allowed to take part in voucher  privatization, but they can purchase privatized property if they  wish so.    A demand for Czech culture centers in places with large  Czech  minorities will have to be postponed until after the launching  of the Bratislava center, and this will only open when a  suitable space to house it is found, the Czech Culture Ministry  replied. Other centers will open in Kosice and Presov, both  east Slovakia, and Zilina, central Slovakia.    The government Radio and Television Council says that the  use  of long-wave radio broadcasting, heard across Slovakia, will  continue to be granted. As for Czech TV, the Council is  considering a license for satellite broadcasting as ground-based  TV stations do not reach Slovakia.    The Czech Health Ministry, citing the law, says that Czech  Slovaks are not eligible for Czech health insurance.    The Transport Ministry says that reduced railway fees for  old-age pensioners cannot be extended to another state's  citizens as no reciprocal agreement has been signed with  Slovakia, and as for reduced urban transport fees, this lies  within the competence of local government.    The Czech Education Ministry says, however, that Czechs  wishing to study in the Czech Republic are exempt from school  fees, SME writes.</p>

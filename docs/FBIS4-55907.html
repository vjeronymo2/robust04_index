			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, May 23 (TANJUG) -- The Moslem authorities  in Vares on Monday banned free movement of Croat civilians on  the entire territory of the town in central Bosnia-Herzegovina.  As reported by Croatian radio, Croat civilians were also banned  from entering or leaving Vares.    The local Bosnian Croat army command requsted mediation of  the United Nations peacekeepers (UNPROFOR), said the radio.  Vares, a mining town which had a majority Croat population  before the war, was seized by the Moslem army last autumn.    Around 10,000 Croats expelled from the town have sought  shelter in the territory of the Serb republic, the state of the  Bosnian Serbs. The relations between the Bosnian Croats and  Moslems have become tense on the terrain and the number of  incidents is growing while the leaderships of the two Bosnian  ethnic communities are preparing a formal proclamation of a new,  Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia on May 30. The agreement on  forming a Moslem-Croat federation was reached under strong  pressure of the United States.    For a whole year before their abrupt reconciliation in  march,  the two sides were engaged in bloody fighting for territories  with mixed population in the central and southern parts of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

Separatists are obviously "frightened"  of peace. In case of a peaceful settlement, all criminal acts  perpetrated by them against mankind will be unveiled --  thousands of people shot without trial, dozens of villages  burned to the ground, and the ruined lives of people of many  nationalities, Georgians, Abkhazians, Russians, Greeks, and  Armenians. If a peace agreement is signed, international  observers who are to study the instances of genocide and ethnic  cleansing will promptly arrive in Abkhazia.    The Georgian leader later stressed the positive of the  Geneva  talks, despite the disruption.    Mr. Shevardnadze mentioned that the Russian side, the United  Nations, and the authorities of Great Britain, France, and  Germany supported the Georgian side in its aspirations for a  peaceful settlement of the Abkhaz conflict and that a new  escalation of war must not be allowed. The stance taken by  these countries must play a positive role in resolving this  issue. "It is necessary to find new forms and formulae, and  make a definite compromise in order to avoid the outbreak a new  catastrophe which could assume an unprecedented scale," the head  of the Georgian state declared.    The parliament chairman stressed that everything is now up  to  the security council. The United Nations, with Russian support,  must justify the peacekeeping mission entrusted to it; and if  Russia plays the role of a guarantor of peace and stability,  then it will be a new landmark in world politics and positively  affect not only the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict but also those  world issues which need to be resolved immediately.    When assessing recent Russian events connected with the  adoption of the law on amnesty for the August and October  putschists, Shevardnadze said that this action could complicate  the internal political situation in Russia if the leadership of  the country fails to control the situation independently without  the influence of external factors.    Commenting on his forthcoming visit to the United States,  the  Georgian leader said that besides a meeting with the U.S.  President, consultations with representatives of the World Bank  and the IMF and also with the leaders of various U.S. government  departments are planned.    Eduard Shevardnadze especially singled out one of the  essential points at the forthcoming Georgian-U.S. meeting: a  more detailed familiarization of the U.S. administration with  the Abkhaz conflict.</p>

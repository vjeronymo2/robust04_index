The paper, citing informed sources, said the resignation  would occur after 'Id al-Fitr, the feast marking the end of the  Moslem holy fasting month of Ramadan which began February 11 in  Kuwait.    Senior Kuwaiti officials want to "bolster the executive  branch by unifying positions and speeding up the decision-making  process," the paper said.    AL-SIYASAH said the current government had accomplished its  mission by reviving the 1962 constitution and parliamentary life.    The outgoing 15-member cabinet was formed in October 1992  and  is led by the crown prince, Shaykh Sa'd al-'Abdallah al-Sabah.  Six ministers are independent MPs or opposition members.    The key portfolios -- foreign affairs, interior, defense and  information -- are held by members of the ruling Al-Sabah family.    The opposition swept the legislative elections of October 5,  1992 leading the previous cabinet to resign two days later.</p>

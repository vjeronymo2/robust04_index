			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 4-A GIRLS;  </P> <P> LA HABRA, LA QUINTA HAVE KEY INGREDIENTS TO WIN IT ALL  </P> <P> On paper, Orange County teams have a 50-50 chance of making it to the Southern  Section 4-A final. Two of the four seeded teams in the division are from the  county: top-seeded La Habra and third-seeded La Quinta.  </P> <P> In a division that needed 12 at-large teams to fill the bracket, La Habra's  unusually tall Highlanders could easily advance to the final.  </P> <P> "In that top half of the bracket, La Habra looks like they are going to cruise  through there," La Quinta Coach Kevin Kiernan said. "I don't see any team with  any height there that can match up with them at all. So I think they've got a  pretty good path to the finals."  </P> <P> La Habra has three players who are at least 6 feet tall. Leslie Ferguson, a  6-foot post player, leads the Highlanders with 16 points and 11 rebounds. She  teams with the Kristich sisters, 6-1 Ana (11.8 points, nine rebounds) and 6-5  Zrinka (13.1 points, 9.2 rebounds).  </P> <P> La Habra brings a 97-3 league record, compiled over 10 years, into the playoffs  and has won nine of the past 10 Freeway League championships. While the  Highlanders tower over most of their opponents they are not invincible. They  have only two seniors, only one of whom plays regularly, and they are untested  against tough competition. The Highlanders lost to Valencia in a nonleague  game.  </P> <P> La Quinta doesn't have height but the Aztecs have seniority and scoring punch.  They start five seniors, including last year's state scoring leader, Amy  Jalewalia, who has raised her average to 33.4 points a game from 32 last year.  </P> <P> The Aztecs last made it to the final in 1985 in the 3-A division, but illness  and scholastic troubles have hindered them since. Kiernan is hoping nothing  like that will happen this year.  </P> <P> "We're keeping our fingers crossed," he said. "We always seem to lose a body as  soon as we start talking about CIF (playoffs). Last year Tanya Krill got the  chicken pox and the year before it was ineligibility. We don't get our grades  until Tuesday or Wednesday and we always have a couple of kids who are  borderline.  </P> <P> "If we're healthy and everybody is eligible, we have a good shot at going a few  rounds. It is a very competitive bracket. There doesn't seem to be any dominant  teams in there besides La Habra. Everybody's got a good shot."  </P> <P> Fullerton (16-6) and Cypress (15-9) have strong records and the benefit of  playing against good league competition. Fullerton lost to La Habra twice in  close games while Cypress defeated Empire League champion Esperanza once.  </P> <P> Fullerton plays host to Redondo (7-14), an at-large team. Cypress faces  at-large entry La Mirada (10-11) at Cypress.  </P> <P> Seven of the nine Orange County entrants will play their first game at home and  the other two, El Modena and Garden Grove, play against county schools.  </P> <P> Buena Park (9-9) plays host to Pioneer (10-12), El Modena (7-13) travels to  Kennedy (14-10) and at-large entries Garden Grove (11-11) and defending  division champion Katella (9-15) play at Katella.  </P> <P> DEFENDING CHAMPION -- Katella  </P> <P> TOP TEAMS -- La Habra (19-3), Palm Desert (23-2), La Quinta (23-3).  </P> <P> DARK HORSE -- Cypress (15-9).  </P> <P> BEST DRAW -- St. Joseph (16-9), the only unseeded team with a first-round bye.  </P> <P> WORST DRAW -- Garden Grove (11-11), with the best record of any at-large team  in the division, meets defending champion Katella and then most likely  top-seeded La Habra.  </P> <P> KEY PLAYERS -- Leslie Ferguson and Ana and Zrinka Kristich (La Habra), Amy  Jalewalia and Heather Brannon (La Quinta), Sommer McLain (Fullerton), Rosa  Olloque (West Torrance), Tisa Read and Brenda Joyce (Palm Desert) and Valerie  Ruiz (Kennedy).  </P> <P> NOTEWORTHY -- There are 12 at-large teams in the division, all but one has a  losing records.  </P></p>

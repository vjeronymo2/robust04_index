			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: Schneider profits plunge to FFr275m SCHNEIDER, the French electrical power and engineering group, yesterday reported a collapse in annual profits and announced it would buy out the minority shareholders in its Merlin Gerin subsidiary. Net attributable profits plunged to FFr275m (Dollars 49.37m) last year, from FFr923.9 in 1990, weighed down by losses at Spie Batignolles, its construction subsidiary. A profits fall had been expected since Spie Batignolles warned in February that 1991 losses may reach FFr950m. Following that, Mr Georges de Buffevent, chairman, resigned. However, Schneider's profits decline was slightly more than analysts had forecast. They include the first year's contribution from Square D, the US electrical equipment group which Schneider bought in a rare hostile takeover last year. Schneider, which owns 61.3 per cent of Merlin Gerin, a producer of electrical distribution equipment, is offering its shareholders four Schneider own shares for five Merlin Gerin shares. The acquisition had long been expected and makes Schneider the latest of several leading French companies to buy out minority stakes in subsidiaries, to simplify their structures and fortify their capital bases. Recent examples include Havas, the media, marketing and travel combine, which early this month bought out the remaining shares in Comareg, a publisher of free newspapers. Last year, Alcatel Alsthom, the engineering and telecommunications group, absorbed three subsidiaries.</p>

			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KRAUTHAMMER ON ISRAEL  </P> <P> "Intifada's 'Shock Troops' Masked," the well-written and informative article by  Daniel Williams (Part A, Oct. 29), again points out the lamentable condition to  which present Israeli leadership has sunk. Their new policy of opening fire on  anyone in the West Bank and Gaza Strip wearing a scarf or hood is simply a  continuation of the inhuman brutality which they have so long inflicted on  their Palestinian charges.  </P> <P> I visited the Israeli-occupied areas in August and was appalled at what I found  there. Israeli officials regularly appropriate private land without cause. The  Palestinian population is subjected to collective punishment for the suspected  misdeeds of a few. Homes of those believed to have connections with dissidents  are summarily demolished. Individuals may be held in detention for up to a year  without trial. Schools and vocational training centers are shut down with even  the dissemination of homework assignments forbidden. Now, as hapless  Palestinians try to insulate themselves from the damp winds of winter, they  face sudden death at the hands of Israeli soldiers. Could any situation be more  tragic or more pathetic?  </P> <P> The barbarous tactics employed by Israel's far-right leaders will ultimately  prove ruinous for that nation. Such cruel policies provide no real opportunity  for meaningful dialogue, no chance for a lessening of tensions, no opening for  peace. Sadistic repression always breeds violent rebellion in a never-ending  vicious circle. Only when Israel's decision-makers see the human faces of those  in the occupied lands can there be hope of reconciliation and an end to the  awful carnage.  </P> <P> JAMES D.

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Pledge over Taiwanese rail link TAIWAN officials at the weekend reaffirmed the government's determination to build a USDollars 17bn (Pounds 11.3bn) high-speed railway despite a vote in parliament on Friday to cut the project's budget for the fiscal year which began on July 1, writes Dennis Engbarth in Taipei. Legislators voted 58-49 in favour of cutting all NTDollars 9.44bn (Pounds 237m) in central government funding for the fiscal year 1994. The proposed 345km railway would cut transit time from Taipei to Kaoshiung to less than two hours, from more than four hours now.</p>

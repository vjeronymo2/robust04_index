			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Single market still to find full harmony Europe's single market will remain incomplete without a new round of harmonisation legislation, a report said yesterday. The European Union's Economic and Social Committee identified 62 obstructions to the free movement of goods, services, people and capital in a report on the functioning of the internal market, concluding that a 'vigorous programme be adopted to eliminate all remaining obstacles'. Of the obstacles identified, half related to the free movement of goods, 15 to the movement of private services, 13 to the free movement of people and two to the free movement of capital. The failure of member states mutually to recognise each other's standards in those areas where no EU legislation exists remains the biggest block to the free movement of goods, according to the 200 responses from industry, consumers and trades unions. Areas such as food additives, nutritional labelling, electrical goods and the weights and dimensions of vehicles were particularly problematic, the report said. It also pointed out that product safety markings were interpreted differently between member states, while varying testing requirements made additional tests necessary on certain imported goods. The committee also recommended greater harmonisation of environmental standards to avoid the problem of 'environmental nationalism'. The report found that environmental regulations were frequently acting as non-tariff barriers, particularly in the chemical and packaging industries. Many of the survey's respondents argued for greater regulation in financial services, particularly in the granting of mortgages where the taxation rules of certain member states effectively prevented cross border transactions. For example, the report recounted the case of one person taking out a mortgage with a company in another member state and not being allowed to offset the interest payments against taxation, which would have been possible if the mortgage had been taken out in the home state. Another problem area is insurance, an area opened up just two months ago. The survey found that huge discrepancies remained in the taxes levied on insurance policies. The report also found significant obstacles to the free movement of people, in particular the failure of states to recognise each other's professional qualifications. Differing social security regimes are also an impediment. The biggest complaint regarding the free movement of capital was that cross border payments take too long and are too expensive.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Robert Mugabe by Leslie Mashokwe </F> in Cape Town; date not given; on the "Newsline" program --  recorded]    [Text] [Mashokwe] Mr. President, thanks for honoring us  with this interview. I would like to ask you one very personal  question. You studied in South Africa. You were at Fort Hare  University, and you have been avoiding coming to this country  for very a long time. With the demise of apartheid how do you  feel being back in the Cape?    [Mugabe] It's a great feeling to be back to South Africa. I  was back actually at the time of the inauguration, to attend the  inauguration of President Mandela, and that was a great feeling,  a great feeling indeed because I had last been here in 1952,  only when I came back for graduation. I stayed in South Africa,  I think for two years up to 19...[pauses] end of '51, in the  Eastern Cape. A lot of things have happened since then, when I  was at Fort Hare, and apartheid was just beginning to be  implemented, and I remember the students who belonged to the  African National Congress Youth League planning real action by  way of demonstrations, sit-ins, and passive resistance, but  after that the struggle took other dimensions, and there was  armed struggle.    It was during that period -- we were in exile together with  the ANC and the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress], and together we  planned the strategies to defeat colonialism in whatever form,  whether it was in the form of apartheid or in form of UDI  [Unilateral Declaration of Independence], as in southern  Rhodesia then. And we got our independence in 1980, 14 years  before South Africa got its freedom and democracy.    Of course, when we got our own freedom, we never regarded  that as complete freedom of Africa, and we had always worked on  a program, yes, for us to get our own freedom in what was  Rhodesia, but also for others -- Namibia to get its own  independence; South Africa to get its own freedom and democracy,  and that was a long, long wait, a very long wait indeed. We all  longed for a day when apartheid would go, when we could interact  with South Africa, and we could visit South Africa and the South  Africans could visit us. The day has now come, so it's a  tremendous joy.    [Mashokwe] Were you at all surprised by the turn of events  come February 1990, when President De Klerk then announced these  changes?    [Mugabe] Yes, a mixture of both surprise and disbelief.  Surprise, because we never expected that the leader of an  Afrikaner Party, the National Party, which in fact had been the  initiator of apartheid, could one day reverse it in that  dramatic way. It was indeed dramatic, too dramatic for us to  believe, but there it was.    When it was first announced, we thought it was just  palliative, the statement was just palliative in that apartheid  would not really go, but when one measure after another was  taken to undo it and completely eradicate it from the statute  book, then we started to believe.    [Mashokwe] Mr. President, do you ever regret the stance that  you took? You were known to be very vocal against apartheid.  You didn't mince your words on this. When you look back, your  country suffered a lot of economic ills. You were destabilized  in the process. When you look back, do you have any regrets?    [Mugabe] We don't regret having taken the steps that we  took.  In fact, a country like Zimbabwe, who did not go the full length  in opposing apartheid -- we wished we could have done more, but  it was not possible because of the linkage between our economies  -- the South African economy and Zimbabwe, a linkage that was  consolidated by Ian Smith during UDI, and when Rhodesia was made  to depend on South Africa. But politically, diplomatically we  took quite a rigid stand, and we were not to have anything to do  with those who were in charge of apartheid here and in  government, therefore, because we held them responsible. We  don't regret having taken that rigid stand at all, but we regret  the loss of life that ensued, the sabotage that was carried out  in Zimbabwe, destruction of ANC property and the loss of life  that followed that destruction of property. That we regret. We  still have those wounds. We still have the scars, the damaged  buildings. They still are there, and in fact we still have  prisoners we have arrested--people we have arrested for  committing those acts of sabotage. But all that was really the  amount of sacrifice we were called upon to make in order for us  to have the day that now we have. In order for us to return to  South Africa, we had to do all that.    [Mashokwe] The prisoners -- are they going to be released at  any stage? What are the possibilities?    [Mugabe] Well, we are reviewing their cases. There are only  five in our prison, and one of whom is a South African,  (?called) (Zwayo), and the other four were South Africa's agents  from white Rhodesia -- Rhodesians who worked with South Africa,  but President De Klerk and now President Mandela have all  appealed to me for possibly their release, but their death  sentences had been commuted to life imprisonment, and therefore  they are not going to die, but we are reviewing their cases.    I consulted with the Minister of Justice the other day, and  we thought we should review their cases in the same way as we  review the cases of our own, but now that here people have been  pardoned, people who were guilty of what one might call  political crimes, and had been pardoned, except a few, we might  very well review their cases in a favorable way.    [Mashokwe] In South Africa we talk of this truth commission  where South Africans are saying: Let's know what happened in the  past. Let's pardon people, including right-wingers probably.    [Mugabe] Pardons, sure, must be granted. The past must go.  Bygones must be bygones, and this is what I said in March 1980,  when I appealed to both the black and white community to work  together. They had to forget the past. They had now to  recognize that whether yesterday they had fought as enemies or  as allies, they could no longer actually do without each other,  whichever way things go. We shall live side by side with each  other, and therefore, there had to be a recognition of that  common belonging, a common denominator that came about as a  result of our independence.    The same with South Africa. There is that common denominator  and your situation here is even much more complex than our own.  We are only 10.5 million. You are 40-plus million, and  therefore it's a big population you have, but apart from that a  population that also subdivides itself into various races,  various tribes, people living in various regions and a number of  religious affiliations, and so it's a much more complex  situation, and I admire the stance that President Mandela and of  course the ANC have taken in demonstrating that this is now a  new South Africa, which requires a new ideology, a new political  outlook that binds everyone together and makes the people of  South Africa have a common destiny, which means there is that  greater sense of belonging to South Africa, greater sense of  nationality than there ever was before. At least that's what is  being cultivated and we admire that.    [Mashokwe] We talk now of the conference that you attended,  on the threshold of the new era. Many critics say that this  threshold never really reaches the ordinary people of southern  Africa, of Africa. What is your comment on this?    [Mugabe] No, it does reach to the ordinary people of African  grassroots, and we are always talking about the grassroots.  True, when policies are first enunciated they don't  immediately....[pauses] They don't go down to the masses until  they have been explained, but this is the work that our  subordinates must be doing in the regions and at various levels,  to tell the people that we are now one, but of course it will  take time for some of our people to forget and to forgive and  forget, but the leadership, if it does continue to preach  national reconciliation and national unity, national harmony,  the message will get through. I assure you.    [Mashokwe] Unemployment in Zimbabwe is said to be about a  fifth of your people there. We have the same kind of problems.  Is there no danger, not just in Zimbabwe -- South Africa has  the same problem -- is there no danger of unemployed people  overturning political gains?    [Mugabe] No, I think the numbers are exaggerated. We have  quite a lot of youngsters, yes, who are unemployed but our  situation is quite different from yours. We are less urbanized  than South Africa, less industrialized than South Africa. In  industries -- we have in Harare, Bulawayo, Gweru, Mutare, yes --  but over 70 percent of the people, between 70 and 80 percent,  are over [sentence as heard]. And the youngsters who are  unemployed by and large are people with roots back in the rural  areas. They come into urban areas to seek employment, but when  they can't get that employment they go back to the rural areas.  There is hardly a Zimbabwean who says Harare is his home. None.    We all have our roots where people can do agriculture, and  this is a solution that really, that we find amongst us -- that  is, if the going is not that good in town, people can always go  back to the rural areas and eat, provided of course we have not  been struck by droughts, and so there is that aspect. People can  do agriculture, and our youth, we are now trying to mobilize so  some of them, I hope a substantial number, can pursue  agriculture you see, as a way of life. But this is not to say  we don't have a sizable number of people unemployed. Yes, the  reason they are unemployed is not because there had been any  mismanagement of the economy, but rather that colonial -- the  colonial legacy that we have has been that of underdevelopment  in what was regarded as the African sector in the rural areas  and also the development of skills was delayed or denied in some  cases.    Therefore, even though the jobs are there but they are jobs  for skilled men, and these cannot be found in every case. With  jobs in industry, even in the public service, you see, we have  jobs, but they require skilled people. In some cases the white  employers go out of Zimbabwe to get skilled personnel, people  with high skills whom they want to be managers or to be highly  trained technicians operating in the -- I mean, to undertake  operations in their industries. So that is one reason, but of  course we are now engaged in trying to transform the system and  opening it up to investment, encouraging existing investment to  expand and, thereby, create more jobs. It will take us time,  but we are doing that.    [Mashokwe] What role, Mr. President, do you see for South  Africa in the Southern African Development Community?    [Mugabe] Oh, a tremendous role. South Africa will now come  with its heavy muscle and join us. Heavy muscle, because it is  a highly developed country. It has its own problems, of course,  of underdevelopment in certain sectors, but you have highly  developed industries and that gives South Africa quite a muscle  with which it can interact with us as we relate to it, both  multilaterally within the region, and also bilaterally.    We trade with South Africa. Zimbabwe is the largest trading  partner South Africa has in Africa, and 20 percent of our  imports come from this country, and so we are quite a market.  Botswana gets about 80 percent of its imports from this country  and so also is a good market, and now what we want to see is an  economic order that binds us together in a cooperative way, and  of course the benefits must be reciprocal. We must open up our  borders, remove tariffs, or lower them for a start, and trade  with each other as freely as we can.    [Mashokwe] Is there no fear of this big brother image which  could probably bring about concern or suspicion?    [Mugabe] Oh, no, no, no. We are very happy. In fact we are  encouraging countries whom whenever we speak and this subject  arises, we always encourage countries to help South Africa at  this stage. South Africa will need a lot more of aid by way of  investment, even grants for a start. We had that kind of, you  know, boost at the beginning of our independence, and at least  to get us...[pauses] to get our economy to be reconstructed and  rehabilitated, and South Africa needs that kind of assistance  from the whole of the international community.    Yes, when one looks at Cape Town and Johannesburg, Durban,  and the other big cities one is impressed by what happens there.  But one must look also, even within those cities, at the  depressed areas, you see, the townships, that has been  neglected. One must look at the systems, social systems that  operate and see whether these systems are equitable or  inequitable. Look at the educational system. A lot needs to be  done really to rehabilitate, to reconstruct and restructure it  in such a way that it is the education that formally on the  blacks [as heard].    Education systems can be boosted, can be qualitatively  transformed and brought to the level of the education that was  obtained on the European side, and this is what we had to do in  our own country -- remove the inequities of the past, all the  inequalities.    That will require some funding, a lot, lot more funding and  investment is required in order for the economy to continue to  grow, and if South Africa prospers that way they will get the  benefits as well, by way of the new technology which has come to  South Africa.    There would be companies that will come to Zimbabwe, to  Botswana. We already have lots of South African companies in our  country and the technology that their parent companies acquire  here will be technology that the subsidiaries elsewhere will  require, but of course, within the system of our interaction,  cooperation, the benefits by way of technology will be our  benefits. The benefits by way of capital goods will also be our  benefit. We will use machinery for our mines from South Africa.  South Africa will sell them much more cheaply that Britain or  Germany, for obvious reasons, are likely to sell those same  goods to us. So, there is that benefit to be derived and we  don't think that money that comes to South Africa is money that  would have come to us, necessarily, no.    [Mashokwe] Fourteen years of Zimbabwe's independence. What  lessons are there for South Africa -- for this new emerging  democracy?    [Mugabe] Quite a number of lessons, and I don't think they  are lessons necessarily for the government or for Mandela. They  are lessons for the community. One, independence does not usher  in an era of manna falling from heaven. Never will there be  gifts the Almighty will shower down on the people of South  Africa. The people of South Africa have got to sweat, to work  hard. Now the environment is there. We must ask for the  opportunity, you see, for them to work. The opportunity for  them to have the necessary skills, the opportunity to be  appointed, given they have those skills, to jobs that they were  denied yesterday, and this is what the outlook must be on the  part of the people -- patience. They will require a great  amount of patience because delivery of benefits is a process, a  function really, of the development of industries.    Then there is the second aspect which has to do with racial  harmony. That has got to continue. If that fails then the  country is ushered into an era of conflict and a country as  large as South Africa, if it develops conflict you know what the  consequences will be and there will then be a spill over into  neighboring countries. One we would hope that doesn't happen.  We are glad that the policy that has been adopted by President  Mandela is one of racial harmony and one, of course, that seeks  now to get rid of the conflict between Inkatha and the ANC, the  conflict between the whites and the blacks, and if only the  people will heed that lesson, then we will have a very peaceful  and stable South Africa, but it will take time.    It has taken a long time for our own whites to adjust to the  new situation. Yesterday they were the leaders, they were,  well, the policy makers, and now that we are the policy makers  some of them find it extremely difficult to adjust.  Economically, they are still bosses in our country, the whites,  and they have not, you know, as it were, reoriented their  thinking. They have not fully adjusted. Some have adjusted but  they are only a small number.    Ian Smith is still talking the same UD language ... UDI  [Unilateral Declaration of Independence] language as in 1965.  He hasn't adjusted, but we didn't have to adjust. We adopted  the policies that we espoused, even during the liberation  struggle. We said to ourselves we are not fighting the white  man because he is white. We are fighting his policies. Once  those policies have gone the white man becomes acceptable, but  he will have to accept the new order, but you have people like  Ian Smith. You have your own Ian Smiths here who will continue  to fight for the old order, even though it's a futile struggle,  but it will continue until [laughs] death takes them, and so  really, we have got to be patient, and I would hope that my  brother President Mandela will be patient with them and not get  annoyed. We have been patient with Ian Smith. He still runs  his farm. We have not confiscated it in any way. We ...  sometimes you feel... [pauses] you feel the man is completely  unrepentant. Why continue to treat him justly, but then sense  and I think, magnanimity bids that, well, that the man is  harmless anyway. Let him have his outpourings and they won't do  anyone any harm.    [Mashokwe] Mr. President, I'm running out of time.    [Mugabe] Yes?    [Mashokwe] The issue of the Frontline States, will it still  be there as the OAU has been accused of not being able to  address its own socioeconomic and political problems. Let's  look at Rwanda for instance?    [Mugabe] Yes, the Frontline States no longer have a front  line, and we do not regret that the front line has gone. I was  joking with former President de Klerk yesterday, when he asked  me whether South Africa was a member of the Frontline. I said  yes, and he said where is the front line? I said if the FL  still exists it's now the fishing line along the coast. And so  that's why we wanted the Frontline to (?leave) and that's where  we now are. So we can go fishing now, but we are looking at how  we can transform the Frontline into an organ that will be a  watchdog one, and come to the assistance of countries or a  country that will have lost control because of some instability  that has been triggered by lawless people.    And we have the example of Lesotho, what's happening in  Lesotho, and really Lesotho requires friends now. Friends who  believe in democracy. Not long ago they had elections there in  order to transform the military experience there, which the  people of Lesotho were forced to embrace for so long a time,  into a new democratic order, and the elections were won by the  BCP [Basotholand Congress Party]. But some people are opposed  to that experience. And we feel that Lesotho is really to be  allowed now some period of rest from military rule, and anyway,  a period it deserves, because everybody in our region is going  democratic. They will possibly be assisted.    And so the Frontline States, as a spearhead of the OAU, and  also of course as an organization of our own region, can be  transformed so it embraces not just the countries that fought  for Zimbabwe, Namibia, and South Africa, but others also in our  region. Possibly the role of SADC [Southern African Development  Community], and has this political agenda, but not an agenda to  interfere in the domestic affairs of a country, an agenda really  to salvage a country, to save it from being torn apart by forces  that are inimical to progress and democracy. And that's the  role we hope those of our experts we asked to look at how the  Frontline States can be transformed, and the new look Frontline  States might be able to do.    But you made mention of the OAU and Rwanda. Well, the OAU is  a much larger organization than the Frontline States, and of  course the larger an organization is then the more complex and  the more problems, and in some cases the more contradictions it  embraces. And it's true that in Rwanda we have a situation that  should have been controlled long ago, but this is not to say  nothing was being done, President Mwinyi was working with our  encouragement on a program to get the leaders to agree to  proceed to elections, and in fact there is already an Arusha  Agreement.    Unfortunately, the incident of an air crash reversed the  process that was underway, but we hope we can once again, if we  send troops, as some of us have committed ourselves to do, and  bring the situation under control, and President Mwinyi can  start the exercise from there. He left it off where the air  crash and the events that followed disrupted it. So it's not  that nothing was being done in Rwanda, it is only that when the  event or the tragedy of the air craft that crashed happened, and  the subsequent developments, the Hutu rising against the Tutsi,  and we were not poised immediately to go into Rwanda and help  solve the situation, that was unfortunate.    [Mashokwe] In conclusion Mr. Mugabe, what do you want to do  when you stop being a politician?    [Mugabe] What do I want to do? I want to teach again. I  want to go teaching. When I retire from politics, obviously, I  want to do a little more reading, more writing especially, and  bring you into another focus of our people, and some of my  experiences in getting them to read and evaluate my experiences.    [Mashokwe] Mr. Mugabe, thanks for your time and for honoring  us with this interview.    [Mugabe] Thank you.</p>

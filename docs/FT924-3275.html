			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Deutsche Bank puts blame on Bundesbank THE BUNDESBANK was partly to blame for September's turbulence in the currency markets, as a result of its controversial decision to increase interest rates in July, a main-board director of Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, said yesterday. Mr Ulrich Cartellieri, the board member responsible for economics, said that the market judged that other countries would be unable to follow suit. Investors had behaved accordingly, moving their assets out of softer currencies into the D-Mark. His remarks coincided with a defence of the Bundesbank by Mr Horst Kohler, the state secretary for finance in Bonn, who warned that countries with weaker currencies could not expect to have their exchange rates supported with automatic cuts in interest rates from the German central bank. Yet Mr Kohler, who is Germany's chief international financial negotiator, also warned that the Bundesbank could not conduct its monetary policy totally divorced from political reality and all democratic control. He said he would like to see lower interest rates in Germany, but stopped short of calling on the Bundesbank to cut them immediately. Mr Cartellieri's remarks amount to the first open criticism of Bundesbank monetary policy, from the top levels of the German banking industry. In an implicit rebuke to Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, who in a recent speech blamed speculators for the currency turmoil, the Deutsche Bank economist said that those who were indulging in so-called speculation were careful financial managers, in big companies and in financial institutions, who had large cash balances in the weaker currencies. 'It was obvious for months that above all Britain, but also France, needed lower interest rates in order to enliven their economies,' Mr Cartellieri said. That was made impossible by the Bundesbank's decision to increase its discount rate by 0.75 points to 8.75 per cent on July 16, in a bid to curb domestic inflation. The resulting currency turbulence had done direct damage to German industry by increasing the value of the D-Mark against other currencies. He said that under present circumstances there was a real danger of a 'downwards spiral' of devaluation, with threatening consequences for jobs, investment and economies across Europe. It was essential to carry on towards the goal of a single currency for Europe, Mr Cartellieri said. Mr Cartellieri's remarks, ahead of tomorrow's Bundesbank Council meeting to determine a target for next year's M3 broad measure of money supply, amounts to a sharp attack on the central bank's monetary policy over recent months.

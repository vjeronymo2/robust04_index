			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of Greece (2): Walking the economic tightrope - Meeting targets on reducing inflation and the budget deficit is vital Greece's budget planners are well aware that 1995 will be a decisive year for the economy. If targets on reducing inflation and the budget deficit can be met, Greece still has an outside chance of joining its European partners in monetary union at the end of the 1990s. Otherwise, as a foreign economist put it, the downward spiral of deficit and debt will 'consign Greece permanently to Europe's economic margins'. Greece won grudging approval in September from its EU partners for a revised convergence plan, aimed at meeting the Maastricht requirements on inflation and the deficit by the end of 1998 and substantially reducing the public debt, now at more than 110 per cent of gross domestic product. With this year's budget deficit now likely to be held just below the target of 13.2 per cent of GDP, the socialist government's commitment to reducing fiscal imbalances is starting to look more convincing. The government is also confident that inflation can be held at about 11 per cent this year, down from 13.7 per cent in 1993. But that is outside this year's single-digit target and still more than three times the EU average. 'There will be no revenue shortfall this year, which gives us something positive to build on,' says Yannis Stournaras, a senior government economic adviser. The finance ministry's success in boosting tax revenues after a disastrous start to the year, together with cuts in the public investment budget because of delays in launching EU-funded projects, is expected to wipe out a Dr200bn revenue shortfall forecast earlier. But next year's budget is causing headaches at the finance ministry, mainly because the government wants to avoid the political cost of introducing new taxes in what may be an election year. The convergence plan calls for cutting the budget deficit to 10.7 per cent of GDP and annual inflation to 7.8 per cent. However, Yannos Papantoniou, the economy minister, will have to put together a new fiscal package if it appears Greece will not meet these targets. Income from one-off privatisations and asset sales cannot be assigned to help cover a revenue shortfall under current EU rules, but must be used to offset debt. For the moment, revenue increases depend on reinforcing the campaign against tax evasion, with the help of a new financial police force, empowered to arrest suspected tax evaders and seize their books. Corruption in tax offices, together with protracted legal disputes over tax settlement, is blamed for past failures to improve revenue collection. Much of this year's boost in revenues came from introducing an automatic settlement procedure to resolve 7.5m outstanding disputes involving Dr1,300bn in tax arrears. The system is now being extended, with self-employed professionals being automatically assessed for unpaid taxes over the past five years. The resilience of the underground economy, estimated at more than 30 per cent of GDP, is also due to the removal of customs controls under single market rules. 'Smuggling of fuel and cigarettes is reaching epidemic proportions. That is one area where the financial police should prove effective,' says a finance ministry official. However, the government has no plans to reduce outlays through public sector reform. It gave a generous capital injection to a loss-making state development bank, wrote down substantial amounts of debt owed by farm co-operatives and continues to subsidise debt-ridden defence concerns. Government ministries and state enterprises this year ignored guidelines for hiring one employee to replace three who took retirement. As a result, the public sector has added more than 30,000 jobs. This will place considerable strain on the finance ministry's efforts to cap government spending at 1993 levels next year, despite restricting public sector wage increases to a nominal 6 per cent. Still, the effort to impose fiscal discipline, as well as the effects of recession on consumer demand, is helping the external balance. Imports rose by only 3.8 per cent in the first half of 1994, while a steady rise in EU transfers kept the current account deficit at Dollars 1.1bn. Greece has little chance of being able to climb out of recession next year. Growth in 1995 is set to rise marginally to 1.2 per cent, based on the launch of infrastructure projects financed by the EU's new structural aid package for poor member-states. But there are hints that recovery may be on the way. Private investment is projected to grow by about 1 per cent next year, despite interest rates on working capital above 25 per cent. Greece's industrial sector, which accounts for only 17 per cent of GDP, is picking up, with output forecast to rise by this year by almost 2 per cent after four years of decline.</p>

			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I enjoyed last June's cover story on the differences between dads in real life  and on TV.  </P> <P> Yes, there did appear to be a difference, especially in TV's early series --  and all to the good, it seems to me.  </P> <P> Your story didn't mention the father of them all -- Charlie Ruggles, who  starred in "The Ruggles." It was a comedy series that aired for three years on  ABC from 1949 to 1952, but that probably was before writer Joe Rhodes was born.  Too bad -- he missed some good shows.  </P> <P> June D.

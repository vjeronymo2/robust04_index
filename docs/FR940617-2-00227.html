			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Matching Requirement:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Grantees must provide at least 25 percent of the total cost of the project. The total approved cost of the project is the sum of the ACF share and the non-Federal share. The non-Federal share maybe met by cash or in-kind contributions, although applicants are encouraged to meet their match requirements through cash contributions. Therefore, a project requesting $40,000 in Federal funds (based on an award of $40,000 per budget period), must include a match of at least $13,333 (25% of total project cost).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Anticipated Number of Projects to be Funded:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is anticipated that three projects may be funded at the maximum level; more than three projects may be funded depending on the number of acceptable applications for lesser amounts which are received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFDA: 93.671 Family Violence Prevention and Services: Family Violence Prevention and Services Act, as amended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

Applicants must submit a signed Letter of Agreement between the public agency representing the child welfare/child protection responsibilities and the organization or coalition representing domestic violence advocacy organizations and their concerns. Either signatory to the Agreement may be the principal grantee. The Agreement to be submitted will specifically indicate the role each participant organization has in the implementation of the proposed project. Because the successful implementation of a proposed project would have implications for systemic/procedural change in the child welfare and/or the domestic violence community, the Letter of Agreement is mandatory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Purpose:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To develop effective strategies for domestic violence services integration into child protection systems and strategies. To offer the applicant organizations an opportunity to design, develop, and collaborate on one of several issues or areas of concern between the child protection system and the domestic violence community. Efforts are to be focused on the development of curricula and materials and the implementation of training to be available. The training of child protection representatives and domestic violence advocates will be to enable the most efficient and effective response when encountering woman abuse in the course of child abuse and neglect investigations. Protocols for effective strategies of intervention need to be designed, developed and put in place to allow for the child protection system to assist and utilize the non-offending parent to protect her children.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants may propose to do one or more of the following: Plan and implement the training of child protection service workers, supervisors and social services providers on the relationship of domestic violence and child abuse and neglect; develop and implement domestic violence responsive policies to be adopted by the Statewide child protection services system; develop and implement through the child protection system a domestic violence specific curriculum which will become part of a mandatory training program; develop and implement Memoranda of Understanding between the child protection system and the domestic violence statewide system; and gather and submit data correlating abuse between adult partners and child abuse and neglect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Background:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on a recent review of the literature, it has become evident that in the homes where the woman is battered the children were themselves more likely to be victims of child abuse and neglect. Domestic violence is surfacing as one of the highest risks to children. Domestic violence represents physical endangerment to the child as well as the possibility for developmental delay.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1985, there were an estimated 795,000 abused children between the ages of 3 and 17 living in two-parent households (Gelles, Strauss, 1987). According to these studies, men are the main perpetrators of domestic violence and commit 95 percent of all assaults on women. In 70 percent of households in which women are abused, the men also commit child abuse (Schecter, 1982). Also, in 70 percent of child abuse cases treated at Boston Children's Hospital in 1991, the mother was abused as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In an attempt to establish the actual relationship between child abuse and battering in families, 116 mothers of children ``darted'' or flagged in a single year for abuse or neglect at a metropolitan hospital were studied by Stark and Flitcraft (1984). These examinations revealed that 45 percent of the abused children had mothers who themselves were being physically abused and another 5 percent had mothers whose relationships were ``full of conflict,'' although abuse was not verified. Bowker, Arbitell and McFerron (1988) reported that children whose mothers had been battered were more likely to be physically abused and less likely to be ``neglected'' than children whose mothers had not been battered. In Hilberman and Munson's (1987) research, they found evidence of physical and/or sexual abuse of children in 20 of the 60 cases they studied. They concluded: ``There seems to be two styles of abuse: the husband beats the wife who beats the children, and/or the husband beats both his wife and children.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Project Duration:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The length of the project should not exceed 17 months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

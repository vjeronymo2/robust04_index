			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Arts: Giselle - Covent Garden On Saturday night, Viviana Durante made her debut as Giselle and, fortunate young ballerina, had the inestimable advantage of Irek Mukhamedov as her Albrecht. It is in no way to diminish the merits of Durante's performance to say that, without Mukhamedov, her interpretation would have seemed less touching, for he, more than the staging, established the world in which Giselle must love and suffer and become a protective wraith. Mukhamedov, as we know from his Bolshoy appearances, is a great Albrecht. The sustaining thread of his reading is a passion for Giselle. This Albrecht is not playing with Giselle's feelings: his every moment with her - as peasant girl or wili - reasserts that intensity of feeling which he shows her (and us) early in Act 1. Soon after their first tender greetings, Albrecht looks intently at Giselle and, miraculously, Mukhamedov conveys the gust of passionate love that sweeps over the heedless aristocrat at this moment, justifying for him this village dalliance. He raises his arm and swears fidelity (Giselle, instead, proposes the flower test) and the rest of the drama is explained thereby. Because Mukhamedov is a totally expressive artist - no step meaningless, no gesture unfeeling - every least nuance of emotion is made clear, ardent, poetically beautiful. Remorse, despair at his own folly in the mad scene - to which Mukhamedov gives intense pathos by his involvement in Giselle's torment - and his ability to suggest that each appearance by the wili Giselle deepens his love for her, establish a world of emotion which sustained Durante's reading as surely as did his partnering. The dance blazed in the forest scene, noble and grand in outline as in expressivity. Mukhamedov's Albrecht is a peerless incarnation of Romanticism. His exit in Act 1 - turning back to gaze at the dead Giselle - was worthy of Gericault. His pose,flower held aloft, as the ballet ends, would have inspired Berlioz. And in nothing is this marvellous interpretation selfish. The generosity and dedication that have marked Mukhamedov's every role gave Viviana Durante an ideal framework. Her playing was, not surprisingly for so gifted a dancer, whole-hearted, intelligent. She already commands much of the role: her account of both acts was technically fluent, felicitous, and her view of the peasant girl was quickly responsive to feeling. A young ballerina's first mad-scene is often burdened with too much drama - the Opera House production, with its concern for detailed ensemble playing, encourages this  -and Durante will soon be able to find simpler means, but the lines of her reading are true, and the wili was given a vaporous and touching gravity, the dance floating, delicately poised. We have much to expect from this first performance.</p>

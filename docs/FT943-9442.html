Or is it just a question of being pre-empted by your competitors? On Saturday BBC1 showed the first of a two-part documentary about Hammer horror films. Today Channel 4 begins a series called The World Of Hammer which runs for 13 episodes, no less (12.25). A few weeks ago Channel 4 ran a long sequence of programmes about the troubles in Northern Ireland. Now BBC2 is running a long sequence on the same topic. Today we are offered a 10-minute look at 'some of the surprising economic factors', Consequences; and a 40-minute look at comedians in Northern Ireland, The Empire Laughs Back (11.15). Have there not been previous programmes showing the activity inside a blue tit's box as the nest is lined, the eggs laid and the demanding chicks fed? Was there not a whole series of programmes including just such material quite recently from the BBC's Bristol unit?

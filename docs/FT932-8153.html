			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Rail sale rebels step up pressure PRESSURE ON the government to consider changes to its rail privatisation proposals mounted significantly last night when potential Tory rebels tabled amendments they said would help make the measure more popular, David Owen writes. Eight Tories signed the amendments which will be debated next week when the bill returns to the Commons for its report stage. Rebel leaders are expected to meet Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, today to press their case. The MPs' demands fall under three main headings: safeguarding concessionary railcards, allowing British Rail to compete to run services, and formulating a national plan for the railway network. Ministers are determined not to give way over BR's ability to compete for franchises. In a letter to MPs, Sir Keith Speed - a former minister and rebel leader - said: 'We have all seen in recent times what can happen to Conservative party support if policies are embarked upon in an insensitive and ill-thought-through manner.'

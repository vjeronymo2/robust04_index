			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / International Company News: General Re reports weaker results in second quarter GENERAL RE, the biggest US reinsurance group, reported slightly weaker results, with second-quarter net earnings slipping to Dollars 158.5m, or Dollars 1.80 a share, against Dollars 160.5m, or Dollars 1.82, in the same period last year, agencies report. Second-quarter revenue was Dollars 829.2m against Dollars 780.9m. For the six months, net earnings were Dollars 366.3m, or Dollars 4.18 a share, against Dollars 310.9m, or Dollars 3.52. Revenue rose to Dollars 1.679bn from Dollars 1.574bn. General Re said its underwriting results for the latest quarter were weaker than the year-ago period, but better than the first quarter. The group said that given the magnitude of the insurance industry's catastrophic losses in the latest quarter its losses were lower than anticipated. General Re said its realised capital gains in the latest quarter totalled 29 cents a share compared with 28 cents a share a year ago. The company's 1991 second-quarter earnings also included a gain of 3 cents a share on 'fresh start' tax benefits. For the latest six-month period, realised capital gains were 64 cents a share against 45 cents a share a year ago. Also included in net income for the latest six months is a gain of 70 cents a share from the company's adoption of SFAS 109, which changes the method of accounting for income taxes.</p>

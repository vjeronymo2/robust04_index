			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / EC trade practices provoke sharp attack from Gatt THE European Community's trade deals with exporting countries have come under sharp criticism from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), the organisation which sets the rules governing world trade. Gatt's hardest strictures are aimed at arrangements negotiated by the EC with countries such as Japan designed to limit exports to the community of electronic equipment, cars, machinery and textiles. These have introduced 'strong elements of discrimination' to the multilateral trading system and tend to encourage cartel-like behaviour both within the EC and abroad, the Gatt secretariat says. In its first review of EC trade policy, Gatt is also critical of the frequent use by Brussels of anti-dumping action against foreigners accused of selling their products too cheaply on EC markets, as well as the widespread subsidies which are paid to farmers and manufacturers. EC farm subsidies and protection for textiles and clothing manufacturers entail a substantial cost for consumers, particularly for those with low incomes, the report points out. Nevertheless, Gatt does not find that the EC is creating a 'Fortress Europe' against the rest of the world by its thrust towards a single internal market in 1993. Widespread concern that the 12 member states would turn inward had 'not been confirmed to date' and there was little evidence of any recent major intensification of protectionism by the EC. At the same time Gatt notes that a 'hard core of controversial issues' remains to be settled in the internal market context. The report mentions car imports and warns that Brussels' current proposals for telecommunications could restrict trading opportunities for other countries. France and Italy are singled out for unduly insulating their home markets. In mid-1990, France maintained 71 quantitative restrictions on imports of food products and other goods, including consumer electronics and semi-conductors says the report. Italy applied 48 similar measures. German domestic support for its coal mines is about four times higher than the UK's, Gatt notes. France is taken to task for its reluctance to report all the subsidies paid to its producers. The EC Commission argues that the Gatt secretariat has failed to recognise the basic openness of the Community market and has passed an unbalanced judgement. Mr Roderick Abbot, EC director for external trade relations, told the Gatt council that a grouping representing one-fifth of world trade, had to be considered one of the driving forces behind the high levels of global flows realised in the 1980s.

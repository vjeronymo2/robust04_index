			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Vietnam branch status for two US banks Vietnam yesterday approved in principle branch status for Citibank and Bank of America, allowing the two big US banks to do business in Vietnam for the first time since they were forced to abandon the country in 1975. An official from the country's central bank, the State Bank, confirmed that both banks would be able to upgrade their representative offices in the capital, Hanoi, and in Ho Chi Minh City, to full branches once the technical details had been sorted out, a procedure common to all foreign branch applications. Both banks have had representative offices in the capital, Hanoi, and in the southern industrial hub of Ho Chi Minh City since early 1993. Although they applied for full branch status shortly after President Bill Clinton removed the trade embargo on Vietnam last February, the approval process has been dictated largely by the pace of normalisation of relations between the two countries. 'We wish it had been given to us much earlier but we are pleased to have got it nevertheless,' said Mr Chuyen Uong, Citibank's representative in Hanoi. Vietnam and the US last month agreed to establish diplomatic liaison offices in each capital by year's end. Officials from both banks said they expected their branches to be up and running by early next year. The bulk of their business would be wholesale banking and, in the case of Bank of America, advising the government on financing the rebuilding of Vietnam's crippled power sector. 'I think they're sending a positive message to the US,' said Mr Luu Le, Bank of America's Indochina manager who, like Citibank's Mr Chuyen, is of Vietnamese origin and managed a branch of his bank in the then Saigon before the communist victory in the Vietnam war forced them to close down. The Citibank and Bank of America branches bring the total number of foreign branches to 11 in this country of 72m. About 20 more applications are understood to be in the pipeline but banking analysts say there are signs that Vietnam is starting to look overbanked and that few foreign branch licences are likely to emerge for the time being. State Bank figures show that combined loans among foreign banks amount to only Dollars 100m (Pounds 62m). Most of them are short-term loans. Bankers say they are reluctant to lend to state-run or even private Vietnamese companies whose accounts are murky at best and where recourse to collateral has not yet been tested. They are also still smarting from the imposition last year of an unpopular turnover tax applied to foreign banks.</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Alvis rises strongly to Pounds 5.07m Lower reorganisation charges coupled with stronger performances in some businesses helped Alvis, the defence contractor, report pre-tax profits ahead from Pounds 1.13m to Pounds 5.07m in the year to September 30. The board is, however, proposing to hold the final dividend at 0.5p, giving an unchanged total of 1p, in spite of earnings per share of 2.4p (losses of 5.5p). 'The order backlog at September 30 1992 was more than this year's Pounds 80m. There has been a small erosion of the order backlog. But this reflects timing of particular orders as much as difficult conditions in the defence and aerospace markets,' said Mr Nick Prest, chief executive. He said the company did not expect to see any significant upturn in orders before late 1994 or early 1995. Alvis booked lower exceptional charges of Pounds 1.08m (Pounds 5.24m), mainly against relocations and redundancies, which flattered the comparison at the pre-tax level. Turnover increased 5 per cent to Pounds 97.3m (Pounds 92.4m) and trading profits rose 15 per cent to Pounds 5.75m (Pounds 4.99m). Alvis Industries in Coventry made a contribution to profits compared with last time's break-even. Helio, the optics business now owned by Alvis's 51 per cent-owned Avimo Singapore subsidiary, achieved a 'substantial increase in profits' on the back of a high level of orders.</p>

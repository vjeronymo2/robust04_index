			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Profits warning was confidential, court told THE FORMER chairman of a waste disposal group told an Edinburgh court yesterday that when he briefed an investment analyst about a profits warning by the company he emphasised that the information was confidential. Mr Peter Runciman, former chairman of Shanks &amp; McEwan (SME), was giving evidence for the prosecution on the second day of the trial at the Court of Session of Mr Thorold Mackie, an analyst with Edinburgh stockbrokers Bell Lawrie White. Mr Mackie has pleaded not guilty to insider dealing. He has the full support of Bell Lawrie, which is paying for his defence. It is alleged that Mr Mackie 'counselled and procured' two share salesmen in his firm to sell shares in SME, thus avoiding the fall in the share price which occurred when the profits warning was issued on September 19 1991, and realising Pounds 1.39m more than would have been achieved if they had sold after the profits warning. Mr Runciman said he met Mr Mackie on September 6 by appointment for a briefing. The previous day SME's three-man executive committee had decided it was necessary to issue a profits warning because the group's earnings per share for the half year were likely to fall by 1.6 per cent, instead of rising 15 per cent increase as indicated at the agm in July. Mr Runciman said he had had a good relationship with Mr Mackie because Bell Lawrie was its main point of contact with its Scottish shareholders. He told Mr Mackie SME would be issuing a profits warning and answered detailed questions for a circular. 'I told him that he could not use the information until he had clearance from me,' Mr Runciman said. On the afternoon of September 9, Mr Runciman was told by SME's broker, Hoare Govett, that 1.8m shares in the company had been sold through Bell Lawrie. 'My reaction was that there must have been a leak,' Mr Runciman told Mrs Ann Paton QC, prosecuting. The next day he telephoned Mr Mackie. 'I mentioned that he had been given highly privileged information and that if there had been a leak it would be an extremely serious matter.' Mr Mackie replied: 'I hear what you say." Cross-examined by Mr Donald Macfadyen QC, Mr Runciman denied that he had given Mr Mackie no general indication that the whole discussion was confidential, and that he had not mentioned to him that SME was planning a profits warning.</p>

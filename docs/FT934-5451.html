			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Filing accounts can help your rivals - In a Nutshell Filing accounts at Companies House, as required by law, is betraying vital information to competitors at home and abroad, according to the Small Business Bureau and the Union of Independent Companies. Privately owned British manufacturing companies, particularly those with only one product range, have become 'hopelessly exposed to both UK and foreign competition', the two groups say in a report*. Neil Hamilton, minister for corporate affairs and deregulation tzar, has been sent the report which says sensitive information on small companies is more readily available in the UK than anywhere in the world. The SBB has asked Hamilton to persuade his European colleagues it is potentially damaging for small and medium-sized companies to publicise accounts. The SBB wants small companies, where shareholders are also directors, to be exempt from filing accounts. Hamilton is studying the issue. *The Filing of Accounts at Companies Registry.

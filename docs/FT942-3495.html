			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Suez weak on CU deal as Paris hits 1994 low Weak bonds, a weak dollar and the threat of excess liquidity due to corporate cash calls pushed most bourses lower, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS suffered a sharp correction after the CAC-40 index, failing to find fresh support after breaking through the 2,000 level, struck a session's low of 1,969 before ending the day at a new low for the year of 1,977.66, down 43.06. The main cause of the setback was not the European election results in France, a disappointment for the ruling right-wing coaliton government, but continuing weakness in the bond and futures markets. Equity turnover stayed low at around FFr3.5bn. Suez eased FFr9.50 to FFr293.50 as investors reacted to the news, announced after Friday's close, that it was to sell its Groupe Victoire subsidiary to Commercial Union, of the UK. The sale, believed to be for some FFr12.5bn, is perceived as disappointing for the French group. James Capel, which said it was not recommending the stock as a buy, made reference yesterday to the fact that, by its own calculations, the sale was worth some FFr12bn less than it was last summer - a difference equivalent to FFr80 per share. FRANKFURT tried to move up after a satisfactory Euroelection performance from the CDU, but the attempt foundered under pressure from the pending Daimler rights issue, and other technical factors which went from bad to worse as the day wore on. The Dax index finished the session down 27.30, or 1.3 per cent lower at 2,105.78. Selling ahead of Daimler's near-DM3bn rights issue brought the stock down DM28, or 3.6 per cent to DM747 and undermined other cyclical blue chips like BMW, Volkswagen, and BASF. Turnover rose from DM5.3bn to DM5.8bn. After hours, the Ibis-indicated Dax fell through support at the 2,100 level, and kept falling until it closed the afternoon at 2,084.42, its lowest point of the day. Mr Edgar Benischek, head of trading at Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt, said that in addition to the weight of the Daimler issue, the market was conscious of Friday's upcoming closure of futures and options contracts - an event which can lead to strong pressure to bring prices up, or down. The events of the day overshadowed allegations in Der Spiegel which left Mannesmann down DM2.50 to DM436.50 on the session, and a further DM2 lower at the end of the London afternoon. AMSTERDAM's only bright spot came with the first day of trading in KPN, the post and telecommunications group, which closed at Fl 50.20, a premium to the issue price of Fl 49.75. Volume was exceptionally heavy with an estimated 17m shares changing hands. The flotation of 30 per cent of the KPN equity was the largest in the market's history, but even this was insufficient to motivate the broader market which was pressured by weak bonds. The AEX index finished off 5.02 or 1.2 per cent at 401.69; KPN not yet being included among AEX constituents. Heineken dropped Fl 4.90 to Fl 218.70 in line with the trend and little affected by news that its Spanish subsidiary, El Aguila, planned a 3-for-10 rights issue. KLM, off 10 cents at Fl 50.80, denied reports which had come from the Belgian communications ministry, that it had been holding talks with Sabena on closer co-operation. MILAN was unexpectedly weak after the strong showing of Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party in the European elections. The Comit index fell 13.90 or 1.8 per cent to 742,33 amid profit-taking, particularly by foreign investors, after yesterday's options expiry and ahead of tomorrow's end of the monthly account. Dealers noted that the market faced heavy calls on liquidity with the with the privatisation of Ina, the state insurer, and a number of rights issues during the July account. They added that a constitutional court ruling on pensions, which could cost the treasury up to L16,000bn, compounded the negative mood. Among shares heavily traded by foreign investors, Fiat fell L268 to L6,633, Generali gave up L950 to L43,600 and Montedison lost L69 to L1,405 in volume of 27.7m shares. ZURICH was pulled lower by the banking sector after the Swiss National Bank warned that it saw no room for easier monetary policy for the time being. The SMI index dropped 19.6 to 2,744.2 as UBS bearers lost SFr21 to SFr1,206 and SBC bearers SFr8 to SFr406. Against the trend, Berner Holding, the insurer, picked up SFr50 to SFr1,280 after Germany's Allianz said it had bought a 30 per cent stake. SMH, under pressure last week, rose SFr17 to SFr840. James Capel, which lowered its recommendation, commented that a relatively flat profit outlook for this year, combined with concerns about the durability of the Swatch brand, would make it difficult for the watchmaker to outperform in the short term. MADRID was not inclined to celebrate the triumph of the opposition conservatives in the European parliamentary elections. Bonds weakened, equities followed and the general index fell 4.48 to 321.03. WARSAW accelerated its recent slide, all Polish shares tumbling by the 10 per cent price limit. The Wig index fell 955.4, or 9.8 per cent, to a 1994 low of 8,757.3. Turnover shrank 63 per cent to 374bn zlotys. Written and edited by William Cochrane, John Pitt and Michael Morgan</p>

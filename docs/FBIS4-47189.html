			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikita Kirichenko, Anastasiya Matveyeva, </F> Aleksandr Privalov and Andrey Shmarov: "These Edicts Have a  Place in the Package"]    [Text] At the very beginning of last week, on Monday, Boris  Yeltsin frankly and impartially qualified the state of the  Russian economy as catastrophic. This declaration would have  seemed quite penetrating -- now you cannot affect anyone with  stronger expressions --if the president had not added that, as a  counterbalance to the economic catastrophe, he had signed a  package of six edicts on economic matters. At first, it spread  quickly that the edicts abolished all restrictions on foreign  trade. At the same time, rumors spread just as quickly that the  edicts imposed restrictions on an increase in the enterprises'  consumption fund and the issuing of cash. Due to these rumors,  the dollar's cash exchange rate rose at once by 20 points.    As far as the complete liberalization of VED [foreign  economic activities] goes, this was not confirmed. As for the  cash -- this was confirmed.  <H5>  The Abolition of Export Quotas and Licenses </H5>   The president's Edict on the Abolition of Quota-Setting and  Licensing for Deliveries of Good and Services for Export was  signed exactly a week after the Minyust [Ministry of Justice]  had registered the MVES' [Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations] order approving the instructions on the procedure for  that same quota-setting and licensing.    The KOMMERSANT correspondents interested in this incident  were unable to uncover the persons responsible for promulgating  the edict (except for the president himself, of course). The  head of the president's group of experts, Aleksandr Livshits,  stated that his subdivision did not participate directly in the  edict's drafting. The government staff informed us that they had  read the edict for the first time in ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI. The  Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations' reaction was reflected  in the perplexed statement of the chief of the Export-Import  Operations for State Needs Main Administration, Andrey Dogayev:  "I would like to hope that all the consequences of this  document's adoption have been thoroughly studied and accepted  after consultations with the sectorial ministries and the  regional administrations. It would be undesirable to have a  repetition of the situation which arose with the adoption of the  new import customs tariff." In the Minekonomiki [Ministry of  Economics], the specialist sought could not be found, but, after  talking things over, KOMMERSANT's experts came to the conclusion  that Mr. Shokhin's department does not issue such crude  documents.    And, in fact, the edict does not wear the crown of a  bureaucratic creation. It consists of only two points, but they  contain so many obscurities and contradictions that the drafting  of the package of its supplementing documents will require  serious and skilled work.    The questions begin right with the edict's first point. It  says that quota-setting and licensing shall be maintained for  goods and services "to be exported in accordance with the  Russian Federation's [RF] international obligations." In the  opinion of the deputy chief of the Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations' Export-Import Operations for State Needs Main  Administration, Mikhail Gaykazov, this makes it possible to  interpret it as an indication of the fact that the talk is about  goods to be shipped to other countries in accordance with  intergovernmental agreements. But it is most likely that this is  not so. As it seems to the experts, the non-tariff regulation of  export shipments, according to the logic of Russia's relations  with the YeS [European Union -- EU] and the MVF [International  Monetary Fund -- IMF], was supposed to be maintained only with  respect to those goods which have quotas set by agreements only  with these organizations.    Further, in the first point, astonishment is being evoked  among knowledgeable people by the fact that the quota-setting  and licensing have merged here, as it were, into a single whole,  which, however, is also not surprising for the average citizen  stupefied from the mass of new economic terms. At the same time,  these are "two big differences." And the one thing may well  exist separately from the other.    Quota-setting is an attempt to reserve for the treasury the  guaranteed receipt of money through the sale of export quotas.  Under current market conditions, this source has begun to dry  up. This is why an attempt is being made to plug the holes in  the budget, by abolishing certain export preferences.    However, export licensing is a means of ensuring the state's  strategic interests. It is used as a lever for state regulation  of foreign economic activities throughout the entire country,  even with the most liberal approach to the economy. So that, to  abolish licensing and to say that this is very liberal, is  somewhat strange.    KOMMERSANT's experts decline to make long commentaries with  respect to the edict's second point because of its complete  internal contradictoriness. They suggest that the government  "abolish preferences for the exporting of goods and services for  federal state needs (except for goods to be exported to the  countries of the near abroad in accordance with  intergovernmental agreements), with the exception of preferences  granted in accordance with the RF Law on the Customs Tariff...."  But this law contains one small point, according to which it is  precisely these preferences which the government is granting.    Finally, it is symptomatic that the edict passes over in  silence the special exporters -- and thereby preserves their  right to exist. The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations  explains the necessity of maintaining the institution of special  exporters by the fact that, with their help, it is easier to  maintain prices at the highest possible level, not letting them  drop to the level of dumping prices, and also to exercise  control over the repatriation of currency earnings. The next  logical step on this path is a further reduction in the number  of special exporters: after all, it is easier to control one  than several.  <H5>  Taxes and Cash </H5>   The subject of taxes is, in any event, no less confused than  the preceding one. Part of this subject can be interpreted two  ways, part looks too declarative and part is simply  incomprehensible. However, there are also rational kernels.    The first thing which is incomprehensible is the most  important: by how much, actually, is it being proposed that  taxes be reduced? If the text of the Edict on Certain Matters of  the Tax Policy is interpreted literally, then it follows from it  that it is being proposed that the rates for the NDS  [Value-Added Tax -- VAT] and the profits tax be lowered by 10-20  percent. Ten percent of the current VAT rate (including the  special tax) is 2.3 percentage points and it is 3.8 points for  the maximum rate for the profits tax. Thus, the president's  proposal can be reduced to bringing the corresponding rates down  to 20.7 percent (the VAT) and 34.2 percent (the profits tax).  This is undoubtedly pleasing, however, strictly speaking of  course, this is ridiculously small: all the same, the granted  break assumes rates higher than last year's.    Also vague is the budget at the expense of which the profits  tax will be reduced -- the federal or the municipal. And such  confusion may cause very serious squabbles among the fiscal  organs.    Moreover, upon closer examination, even this benefit may be  eaten away -- through an increase in the norms for other taxes.  Indeed, it is recommended in the edict that the taxation of the  citizens' personal incomes be increased, along with the taxes on  the property of the public and legal persons.    But the president could also have made a slip, having in  mind  a lowering of the rates not by percentages, but rather, by  percentage points (a quite common slip of the  tongue). And so then the edict's implementation may exert a  fairly serious normalizing influence on the investment climate.    In fact, let us take our reference investment plan (for  details, see the investment review in KOMMERSANT No 17) and  assume that the VAT is set at the level of 13 percent (minus 10  percentage points), while the profits tax is set at the level of  18 percent (minus 20 points). In this instance, the investment  conditions change quite radically.    Let us recall the plan's basic features. The total amount of  investments is 500 million rubles [R], the time from the  investment of the money to the production of the first output is  6 months, the number of workers is 201 persons (for the  evaluation of the reference plan, interference in the form of  preferences for small enterprises was not "applied"), the  average wages are R300,000 per month, and the current return on  capital is 40 percent (which corresponds approximately to the  industry average).    Calculations indicate that, under the existing tax  conditions, the pay-back period for this plan comes to 17  months, the internal profit norm (the indicator which  characterizes the maximum value of the resources which can be  used for the plan's realization) is 739 percent and the  investments' profitability (over the life of the plan) is 92  percent.    If the taxes are lowered by 3-4 percent (the literal  interpretation of the president's edict), then the pay-back  period decreases to 14 months, the internal profit norm  increases to 769 percent and the investments' profitability  increases to 120 percent.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

It may be noted that,  while the reduction of the profits tax affects mainly such  indicators of efficiency as the investments' profitability and  the internal profit norm (see Chart 1), the decrease in the VAT  is reflected first of all in the lowering of the current demand  for working capital (see Chart 2).   <FIG ID=JPRS-USR-069-06A>      Chart 1. The Investments' Profitability in Relation </FIG>      &lt;annot&gt; Key: -- 1. Left-Hand Column: the Investments'  Profitability as a Percentage -- 2. Bottom Row: Profits Tax Rate  as a Percentage&lt;/graphic&gt;     The effect, as we see, is considerable. However, it is  unfortunate that, even if the president had percentage points in  mind, then, in this instance as well, even a good undertaking  may fall through. The Duma may block it -- for quite  understandable fiscal reasons.  &lt;graphic&gt;   <FIG ID=JPRS-USR-069-06B>      Chart 2. Increase in the Demand for Working Capital </FIG>      &lt;annot&gt; Key: -- 1. Left-Hand Column: Millions of Rubles  --2. Bottom Row: Number of Months --3. Lines Represent the VAT  at Various Rates&lt;/graphic&gt;     It is true that, in this instance, the administration has  some kind of counterplay. A hint of this is contained in the tax  edict: the talk is about accelerated depreciation, the mechanism  of which the government is instructed to develop over the course  of 2 months. Accelerated depreciation is good, first, because it  makes it possible to reduce profit and, correspondingly, the tax  payments, thereby improving the investment situation (see Table  1) and, second, because its use does not require legislative  formalization. It is true that what is being talked about in the  edict is accelerated depreciation in the high-technology  sectors, but who will interfere in the event that this mechanism  is applied to other industries?    We would note, however, that our scenario for the "good" (in  the sense of investment stimulation) version of the edict, as it  were, leaves outside the framework the budget result of the  easing of the tax climate. And this is hardly proper. It is  possible, of course, to argues idealistically about the  unrestrained growth of business activity and the increase in the  tax base, which would follow this easing, which would make it  possible to cover the tax arrears. But, to be honest, even if  this occurs, it will not be right away by any means.    This is why the budget effect, both for the Duma and for the  president's economic experts, is far from being the last thing.  And it must be noted that the drafters of the package of edicts  understand this.    They also understand the fact that simply introducing new  taxes and raising the rates will not solve the old problems.  Thus, it is necessary to do a better job of collecting the  already existing taxes. This circumstance has been taken into  consideration in other edicts from the package -- the Edict on  Additional Measures for Normalization of Settlements and  Strengthening Payment Discipline in the National Economy and the  Edict on the Implementation of Integrated Measures for the  Timely and Complete Submission to the Budget of Taxes and Other  Obligatory Payments.    These documents contain quite a few repeats of already  existing norms or variations on their theme (for example,  regarding the ban on the opening of several current accounts),  which have been invoked, apparently, to demonstrate the  seriousness of the authorities' intentions. But there are also  new restrictions. The talk, first of all, is about the tax  organs' right to withdraw funds without authorization from  enterprises' currency accounts using the procedure for paying  off arrears in obligatory payments (in essence, this point  legitimizes already available TsB [Central Bank] and Minfin  [Ministry of Finance] instructions on this matter), as well as  about introducing a procedure for prioritization in the use of  funds from a current account.    At the same time, if, in the first instance, the interests  of  primarily exporters are affected, especially of those not  burning with a yearning to run and to pay taxes, then the second  circumstance is nothing new and it affects absolutely all  managing entities and does so very seriously.    And, really, about what does the Edict on Additional  Measures  for Normalization of Settlements... talk? It directs that all  legal persons may obtain cash in a bank "... in an amount not  exceeding 5 percent of the average daily receipts of funds into  their current accounts for the preceding quarter, including for  the payment of wages... -- in the amount of 5 times the minimum  monthly wage, proceeding on the basis of the overall average  listed number of workers."    So, if you please: they thereby twisted the "dough" if not  into a ram's horn, then very tightly. Indeed, as it turned out  -- previously, the servicing bank issued exactly as much cash as  was requested and it was the client's business to handle this  cash in such a way that the controlling organs did not catch on  and did not qualify it as personal income payments. There were  lots of ways to do this -- from the old "for purchasing  agricultural products" to payments to their own associates for  leasing their motor vehicles and purchasing vouchers at a high  price and selling them at a low price. Now, however, the  enterprises' money circulation plans have been frozen.    Of course, it is possible to obtain cash due, but only by  transferring money to personal accounts. But this means that it  is necessary to give instructions to the bank with an  explanation of the purposes and, naturally, to whom the money is  being transferred, i.e., strictly speaking, to illuminate for  the tax inspectorate not only one's own bookkeeping, but also  the bank's.    Of course, there also remain such old tried and true methods  as the use for money laundering of partners who have a business  involving "dough" such as, for example, retail sales. However,  this channel will work only as long as their use of cash  registers remains uncontrolled. If they are forced to use the  cash registers all the same, then then stream of "dough" will  momentarily dry up. In the latter event, reliable money  laundering will be possible, very likely, only through offshore  companies.  <H5>  A Public House -- Sad Words </H5>   The Edict on the Reform of State Enterprises, which is also  part of the package under examination by us, has been called  into being by lamentable circumstances. Apparently, it signifies  by itself the overdue start of the government's long-promised  campaign for the restoration of the manageability of state  property. It must be acknowledged that the grounds for the  start of such a campaign are more than adequate. Over the last  few years, the press has been overflowing with proof of the fact  that the management of the vast majority of state enterprises  uses them as its own private domains, without hardly a glance at  their nominal owner, the state. The current managers of the  state enterprises are enjoying all the rights of an owner,  without being burdened by an owner's responsibility -- and, on  the other hand, also not burdened by any other external  responsibility.    The edict, about which we have been talking, will begin to  restrict these managerial freebooters. Let us present its  contents in brief. As of the moment of the edict's promulgation,  it stops the establishment of new federal enterprises with the  allocation to them of property based on the right of complete  economic authority. Some of the currently existing federal  enterprises will be eliminated -- and public plants,  factories or industries will be established on their basis. It  is clear from the edict's text that this action should be  considered a punishment: considered as grounds for making such a  decision will be the lack of profit based on the results of the  last 2 years, the indiscriminate use of allocated federal  credits or the "improper" use of real property -- in other  words, the inept or illegal management of an enterprise. Just  what does the punishment consist of? How will a "public"  enterprise differ from a state enterprise?    Property will be allocated to it not based on the right of  complete economic authority, but rather, on the right of  operational management, i.e., it will be able to implement the  alienation, leasing or pledging of this property only by the  consent of the government or an organ empowered by it. A reader  of the edict will have a doubt: does a current state enterprise  really have the right, for example, to lease its capacities  without the approval of the GKI [State Committee for State  Property Management]? Indeed, it does not. Thus, does the edict  not declare that it is the duty of the "public" enterprises  simply to observe the obligatory laws a bit more strictly than  everyone observes them? Let us read on -- the suspicion gets  stronger.    Specified in the charter of a public enterprise is the  personal responsibility of the manager for the results of  economic activities --but really, is there nothing at all  mentioned in the current contracts with the managers of state  enterprises about responsibility for results? A public  enterprise will be obligated to use federal credits for a  specific purpose -- but is a current state enterprise also  really not so obligated in the least?    The only, perhaps, substantial harsh item in the edict is  this: the procedure for distributing profits will be fixed in  the public enterprise's charter. Although, if you think about  it, even here there is nothing to be especially feared: first,  what difference does it make how profits are distributed, if  there have not been any for 2 years all the same; second, it  depends on which procedure will be fixed....    The newspapers have already managed to inform us that many  state enterprise managers are inclined to view the change into a  number of public plants not as a punishment, but rather, as a  long-desired goal. Our cursory perusal of the edict, it would  seem, confirmed these managers' opinion: there is seemingly  nothing terrible in the title "public" and you do come under the  wing of the budget all the same. But this is only at first  glance. But read more attentively -- you will see that the  public plants have not been promised any kind of special  protection.    Judge for yourself. That a public plant is obligated to use  federal funds for a specific purpose is stated in black and  white, but that these funds will be allocated in any adequate  amount is not stated even between the lines. That a public plant  is not allowed to obtain credits without government guarantees  is stated, but that the government intends to grant such  guarantees is never mentioned. But if a public plant does not  use any part of the property entrusted to it for operational  management or uses it other than as intended, then the  government will take the afore-mentioned property away from it.   <FIG ID=JPRS-USR-069-08A>      Chart 3. Structure of the Consolidated Budget's Revenues in the First Quarter of 1994 </FIG>      So, for an enterprise, the treasury's guardianship will turn  out most likely to be more of a hindrance than a substantial  help. And, for far-sighted managers, now is the time to take  advantage of the loophole left in the edict: according to the  last paragraph of point 4, a decision about converting to public  enterprises "may not be made with respect to a federal state  enterprise which has not been prohibited from privatizing by the  State Privatization Program... and which has submitted using the  established procedure, prior to 1 July 1994, an application for  privatization." Hurry, gentlemen, submit the applications! The  train is departing!   <FIG ID=JPRS-USR-069-08B>      Chart 4. Receipt of Revenues into the Federal and </FIG>      &lt;annot&gt; Key: -- 1. Left Side: Federal Budget -- 2. Right  Side: Local Budget -- 3. Profits Tax -- 4. VAT -- 5. Income Tax  from Natural Persons -- 6. Excise Taxes -- 7. Revenues from  Foreign Economic Activities&lt;/graphic&gt;     On the other hand, it is possible that we are hasty with our  conclusions. It is necessary to wait a month or two -- and it  will become clear to everyone whether the changing of  enterprises from state ones to public ones is a reward or a  punishment. Prior to 1 July 1994, the government will approve a  Model Charter for a public plant (factory or industry) and,  prior to 1 August, it will determine the "procedure for the  planning (finally! -- KOMMERSANT) and financing of public plants  (factories or industries), including for the maintenance of  social-sphere facilities allocated to them, for the setting of  prices for the goods (work or services) produced by them and for  their budget financing, as well as the wages for their workers."  So let us read these documents and all doubts will disappear and  everyone will find out at the same time just what the "planning  of plants" means.    KOMMERSANT's experts, however, are ready to state their own  assumptions even now. It seems to us that the only real  assistance to the public plants on the part of the treasury will  be just the maintenance of the plants' allocated social,  cultural and communal facilities: after all, if the plants,  especially those which form cities, go bankrupt (you will  remember -- 2 years without profits), then the budget will have  no choice -- it will maintain the orphaned social, cultural and  communal facilities by whatever means are necessary. As for all  the rest, there will be plenty of planning and more than enough  price-setting, but there will be no financing to speak of.    To console the reader, however, let us make one more  assumption: if this edict works at all, it will do so very, very  slowly. Why? Because this happy moment is absolutely supposed to  be preceded by the approval of the list of  enterprises subject to change into public ones. And our  government has a very hard time producing this genre -- the  lists. We would remind you that the lists of VPK  [Military-Industrial Complex] enterprises prohibited from being  privatized (and those lists were, to a certain extent, similar  to this one) took 9 months to prepare, instead of the 3 months  prescribed by the presidential edict. But the lists of future  bankruptcies are being prepared continuously -- there is no end  in sight. Consequently, we will have to wait and wait for the  list of potential public plants --indeed, even the deadline for  their drafting has not been set by the edict.  <H5>  The Adventures of the Highway Fund </H5>   Undoubtedly, Edict No 1008, On the RF Federal Highway Fund,  occupies a special place in the package of presidential edicts  by virtue of its reformatory incandescence and the sharpness of  its statements.    Without lapsing into needless pathos, it must be said that,  since the beginning of 1992, the uneasy fate of the RF Federal  Highway Fund has been linked partly to the fate of the RF itself  and its reformatory thinking. Following its great Motherland,  the Federal Highway Fund has endured the periods of birth,  legislative formalization, amendments to the latter,  consolidation and, finally, a separate article.    Let us explain what we are talking about. At the beginning  of  1992, when the main task for Gaydar's government was to show to  the arbiters from the IMF a state budget with an acceptable  deficit, the highway fund, along with its entire deficit, was  isolated as a separate industry. The old taxes from motor  vehicle owners (50 kopecks per unit of an engine's horsepower)  simply could not cover the budget expenditures for road  maintenance and repair.    When the fund became independent, they began to see to its  revenue portion. For example, a fee was imposed on legal persons  when a motor vehicle was purchased. Thus, the fund even began to  prosper, while Boris Fedorov did not note this at the end of  1993.    The funds assets were immediately "consolidated" into the  budget. However, inasmuch as the last thing Boris Fedorov wanted  was to spend the money for road maintenance and repair, the  special-purpose fund stopped being a special-purpose one.  However, just a very little bit of time passed and everything  became fine again: the new stage of reform "from above"  determined that the fund's place is in the budget, but as a  "separate article."    Thus, KOMMERSANT's experts have carefully read in  succession all six edicts of the presidential package. It is  precisely the recognition of these diverse documents as a  package which makes it possible to assess the entire extent of  the disparity between the authorities' reformatory potential and  the catastrophic state of the economy declared by the president  himself. To reach the one reasonable, even if vaguely worded,  idea on the restriction of illegal "dough," it is necessary in  this package to wade through a pile of bureaucratic twaddle  which is burdened by a claim to profundity.    The continuation of the series of presidential edicts  has been promised. Perhaps they will compel us to change our  opinion about the entire "new wave of reforms" -- but certainly  not about the first six drops.</p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES. . .: STAND-UP KINDA GUY  </P> <P> Craig T. Nelson has been a very busy man this year.  </P> <P> Though one of his more salient roles was as the beleaguered father in the  original "Poltergeist," he has this year been seen in HBO's "Murderers Among  Us: The Simon Wiesenthal Story," the Shelley Long feature "Troop Beverly Hills"  and the yet-to-be-released "Turner and Hooch" with Tom Hanks.  </P> <P> Nelson is working on a six-hour miniseries called "Desperadoes," about a Drug  Enforcement Agency agent who was kidnaped and killed in Guadalajara, based on  the book of the same name by journalist Elaine Shannon.  </P> <P> And then there's ABC's "Coach," the Wednesday night sitcom just renewed by ABC.  Nelson plays Hayden Fox, a football coach at a northern college who after 16  years suddenly has to cope with being a father to his 18-year-old daughter who  has enrolled at his school.  </P> <P> "I'd done comedy early on with Barry Levinson and had lost that in the  intervening years: People didn't know me as a comedian, so I decided to do a  half-hour sitcom," says Nelson.  </P> <P> Nelson along with Levinson used to write for Lohman and Barkley and they even  had a stand-up routine.  </P> <P> "I've done three or four heavies in a row. There's a close relationship between  heavies and comedy though," he says. "And doing this show was like going back  to live theater because you're getting ready for a week and then you have two  shows on Friday and things get changed. I liked the pressure, I liked the risk  and that's why I went into it.  </P> <P> "I went into this show with no intention of it being a big hit, but for it to  be a good show. The payoff may not be there, in terms of what everyone wants  out of it, but it's already been there for me and that's more than enough." SUE  MARTIN  </P></p>

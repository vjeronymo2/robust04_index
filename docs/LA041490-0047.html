			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: AIRPORT RENTAL FEE PROPOSAL REJECTED  </P> <P> Vocal opposition from pilots at Camarillo and Oxnard airports has led to the  rejection of a proposal that would have charged renters for sharing space with  other aircraft owners.  </P> <P> The proposal, part of a revised rent and fee schedule to be presented to the  Ventura County Board of Supervisors, was recommended by the Department of  Airports.  </P> <P> The $25 monthly user fee would have helped offset the costs of services such as  fire and rescue, security, and unrestricted use of taxiways and runways, said  Austin Cline, the airports' administrative officer. Airports Administrator Jim  O'Neill said that non-renters are "getting a free ride" by being able to store  aircraft in hangars rented by others.  </P> <P> But about 20 pilots and renters from the two cities were at the airport  authorities' monthly meeting Thursday to challenge the proposal, saying those  who occupy space in already rented hangars pay their way by buying airport  fuel, parts and labor.  </P> <P> Cline said he believes about 90 planes are being stored rent-free at the  county-run airports, and that revenue from the $25 fee would have amounted to  between $21,000 and $28,000 annually.  </P> <P> Camarillo Airport Authority member Mike Morgan said the revenue "wouldn't be  worth the trouble." O'Neill added that not having the extra money "wouldn't  break us."  </P> <P> Pilots also opposed a recommended flowage fee increase from 4 to 5 cents a  gallon on fuels sold by vendors on airport property. That was also rejected.  </P> <P> In other action, the proposed 1990-91 airport budgets were approved, and a  study of the economic impact of the airports on surrounding communities was  ordered.  </P> <P> The revised rent and fee schedule will go into effect July 1.

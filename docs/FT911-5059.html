			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Paper urges replacement for A-levels REPLACING A-levels with a more broadly based post-16 qualification is likely to be advocated by the Labour party in a policy document to be released later this month. An education working party chaired by Mr Derek Fatchett, a Labour education spokesman, is examining alternatives to A-levels for pupils in England and Wales. A modular course with a mixture of academic and vocational subjects is the favoured option. 'We need to integrate the academic and the vocational side of post-16 study,' Mr Fatchett said yesterday. 'But if you go for two separate qualifications, the traditional A-level will always rank in the first division, and its vocational equivalent in the second division.' One option under consideration is a baccalaureat based loosely on the French system, as advocated by the pro-Labour Institute of Public Policy Research. Pupils would study a minimum of five 'modular courses', with at least one arts subject, one social science and one natural science. Ministers have ruled out abolition of the A-level, which they regard as the 'gold standard' of the post-16 system. They appear to favour the creation of a separate vocational qualification to run in tandem with it.</p>

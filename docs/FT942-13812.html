			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa ends lower Johannesburg ended a quiet day lower with investors reluctant to commit themselves less than a week before the elections. The weakness of the gold price and a firmer financial rand added to the hesitant tone. The overall index finished 8 softer at 5,037 and golds fell 23 to 1,860, but industrials managed a gain of 3 to 5,963. De Beers ended 50 cents lower at R107 and JCI fell R1 to R91. Richemont reversed small early gains to lose 50 cents to R41, but substantial gains in industrials were registered for Iscor, which added 7 cents to R3.27 and Malbak, up 65 cents to R18.90.</p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average falls in low volume SHARE prices lost ground for the fourth consecutive day as a stronger yen, and caution ahead of the futures and options expiry today, kept investors on the sidelines, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average lost 81.92 at 20,493.32, after an early high of 20,618.31 on buying by investment funds and a low of 20,399.56 later in the morning on arbitrage selling. The index recouped some of its fall in the afternoon on small-lot buying by public funds. Volume was an estimated 270m shares, the lowest since March 5. Declines led rises by 678 to 336, with 163 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 2.77 to 1,652.26. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged ahead 1.12 to 1,243.10. Investors were also wary of taking positions before the release today of the Bank of Japan's tankan, its quarterly report on business sentiment. After a brief fall to below the Y106 level, the dollar closed Y0.13 down at Y106.20, a new Tokyo low. Some high-technology exporters were hit by fears of lower profits: Sony lost Y20 to Y4,560. However, power utilities, importers of fuel, were higher, with Kansai Electric Power up Y40 to Y2,920 and Kyushu Electric Power up Y70 to Y2,950. Regional banks were also stronger on small-lot buying by foreign investors. Shiga Bank advanced Y24 to Y834 and Bank Ryukyus added Y180 at Y7,500. However, some city banks were lower on technical trading: Mitsubishi Bank slipped Y20 to Y2,720. Speculators focused on Aids-related issues. Mochida Pharmaceutical fell Y50 to Y2,950 on a report that the World Health Organisation had announced that Mochida's anti-Aids interferon drug was ineffective. Olympus Optical, whose US joint venture was reported to have developed Aids-detecting equipment, put on Y20 at Y1,280. On the over-the-counter market, THK, the bearings maker which plunged earlier this week on rumours of financial problems due to stock speculation, recovered Y20 to Y2,140. Traders said the rise was partly due to support by a leading broker. Baring Securities said that, aside from fears of hidden liabilities, THK faces a drop in operating margins due to the recession and higher yen. In Osaka, the OSE average declined 111.84 to 23,006.91 in volume of 14.5m shares. Roundup PROFIT-TAKING was much in evidence yesterday among the Pacific Rim markets. HONG KONG lost ground on selected profit-taking in thin trading. The Hang Seng index dipped 78.50, or 1.1 per cent, to 7,260.58 as turnover shrank to HKDollars 3.77bn from HKDollars 4.69bn. Among the actives, Cheung Kong receded 20 cents to HKDollars 27.60 and China Light HK1 to HKDollars 39.25. HSBC was steady at HKDollars 72.50 and Hang Seng Bank shed 50 cents. SEOUL was subjected to profit-taking following strong gains earlier this week. The composite index retreated a net 3.86 to 773.39, after a day's high of 787.60. Turnover was a record Won1,344bn. TAIWAN saw a decline in financial stocks pull the weighted index 46.71 lower to 4,223.01 in TDollars 16.94bn turnover. MANILA slid for the third day in succession, marked by confusion over the closing date for Manila Electric's 60 per cent dividend declaration. Trading in Manila Electric was suspended until the issue is settled. The composite index shed 5.38 to 1,576.46 in turnover of 327.3m pesos. AUSTRALIA recovered to close slightly higher after being dragged lower earlier by the weaker gold bullion price. The All Ordinaries index finished 3.4 ahead at 1,712.5 in turnover of ADollars 278.5m. May unemployment data showing little change from the previous month, and a strong futures market, helped to swing the market around. BOMBAY moved up on short-covering, the BSE index gaining 44.98 at 2,396.01.</p>

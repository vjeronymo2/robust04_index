			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Regulation of satellite TV Sir, Ian Hargreaves, in an otherwise thoughtful article, repeated a number of misconceptions about satellite television ('Why the BBC should be privatised', November 13). First, that satellite broadcasters are not regulated at all. In fact, UK-based satellite broadcasters are subject to Independent Television Commission regulation on programme content and sponsorship, and advertising content and breaks. They are also subject to the Broadcasting Standards Council and Broadcasting Complaints Commission, and to EU directives such as Television Without Frontiers. It is true that ITV faces tighter requirements, but in return receives direct access to 99 per cent of UK homes, inherits a 40 per cent share of TV viewing, and is granted a monopoly on the sale of regional television advertising. This is a trade-off voluntarily accepted by each ITV franchise applicant in 1991. Second, that ownership rules do not apply equally. In fact, all national newspaper groups are free to set up as many satellite channels as they like, but may not hold more than one 20 per cent stake in an ITV company. This rule applies as much to Lord Blakenham and Conrad Black as to Rupert Murdoch. Similarly, ITV companies may not control satellite stations, nor vice-versa. Third, that the UK faces a mounting deficit on its broadcasting trade account. In fact, if investment in the 120 ITC-licensed cable and satellite programme services, and in building the cable television network is included, the UK enjoys a huge surplus, and will continue to do so this decade. The source of Mr Hargreaves' flawed statistics clearly excluded this massive investment, but seems to have included satellite movie channel payments to Hollywood studios, which any sensible categorisation would list under film, not broadcasting, in trade calculations.

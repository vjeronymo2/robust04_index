			<p>BFN     [Text] During the last day of his stay in Beijing,  President Alberto Fujimori firmly defended respect for human  rights but expressed his opposition to the interference of great  powers in domestic affairs.    Fujimori described as fruitful his meetings with his Chinese  colleague Jiang Zemin, and Chinese Premier Li Peng.    Fujimori noted the progress made in the fight against  terrorism, a scourge which in the past 13 years has killed at  least 22,000 Peruvians.</p>

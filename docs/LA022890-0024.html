			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NICARAGUA CURTAINS FOR THE LEFT;  </P> <P> STAMPEDE TO DEMOCRACY ENDS ROMANCE OF SOCIALISM;  </P> <P> THE SURVIVING TOTALITARIAN STATES DON'T INTEREST KHAKI INTELLECTUALS. REALISTS  HAVE TOGET TOUGH NOW WITH CHINA.  </P> <P> The pilgrimage is over. The long march of the West's "progressive"  intellectuals has come to a bedraggled end in Nicaragua, a peasant nation about  as far, socially, as a nation can be from the conditions where the revolt  against modernity was supposed to take root.  </P> <P> Marxism has been just that revolt for those who look upon it sympathetically  (usually from a safe distance, in modern "bourgeois societies"). The revolt --  romanticism in drag, dressed up as science -- was against the supposed cold  rationality and soulless banality of a capitalist, industrial, commercial  world.  </P> <P> The revolt was supposed to succeed first where the Industrial Revolution came  first, in Europe, probably in Germany, with its large proletariat. But the  supposed engine of history, the industrial workers of the world, would have  none of it, preferring material progress and freedom, and understanding the  connection of the two.  </P> <P> So intellectuals in fatigues (Castro, Ortega) foisted Marxism on peasants who  were perceived as "unspoiled" by the "false consciousness" of capitalism. But  given a chance, the peasants say, "Please, spoil us."  </P> <P> To the non-Marxist left, including many church groups, the charm of the  Sandinista regime was its anti-Americanism. How galling for those people that  the regime has been toppled by a candidate known in Nicaragua to be backed by  the United States. Where now can the glazed gaze of the last political pilgrims  turn? To North Korea? Meanwhile, so high have been the stakes of American  politics, and so mistaken have been the stances of one faction, that in victory  we have a surfeit of what normally accompanies defeat -- recriminations.  </P> <P> The collapse of the Soviet system under the pressure of Western military  preparedness has elicited, from those who fought that preparedness, the  preposterous thought that the collapse proves that the preparedness was  disproportionate to the task. Now the alibi industry on the left, which did not  quite kill aid to the Contras soon enough to save the Sandinistas, must deal  with this truth: Without Ronald Reagan, there would have been no Contras to put  pressure on the regime, pressure that eventually led to elections.  </P> <P> The ongoing attempt to make Reagan a figure of fun, an attempt now entering its  second quarter-century, founders on a huge fact: The world is going his way, in  no small measure because it was his way. From Eastern Europe to Central  America, "the evil empire" has collapsed because Moscow lost its nerve and  capacities.  </P> <P> The reputations of many people and the interpretations of many events are  undergoing revision. The U.S. effort in Vietnam looks more worthwhile in light  of the subsequent blood baths and waves of boat people. They discredit those  who, in their zeal to see America defeated, professed to see humanitarianism on  the other side.  </P> <P> One can now see why the overthrow of Allende's incipient Leninism in Chile,  coming just as Vietnam was being conquered, was such an unnerving event in  Moscow and throughout the international left. It shattered the myth of  inevitability. The leftward ratchet of history was broken: All movement in that  direction was not irreversible.  </P> <P> Another crack in the left's confidence (confidence was everything, material  accomplishments being paltry) came when communism crested short of power in  post-Salazar Portugal. Can it be just 15 years since "Eurocommunism" was "the  wave of the future"?  </P> <P> The vast majority of people who a year ago were suffering under communism's  cruel stupidities are today suffering even more. They are Chinese -- and, lest  we forget, Tibetans, who are under China's grinding heel. We know that all the  nations of the world are now porous to news. (Turn up those American  transmitters!) Our friends -- if such they still are -- in China, the  democratic forces, knew what happened in Nicaragua as soon as it happened. Now  is the time for the Bush Administration to acknowledge the futility of its  gentle policy toward China and turn up the pressure.  </P> <P> The change of regimes is cause for joy in two communities in Miami. Many  Nicaraguans can now go home. And the Cuban Americans, for whom America is home  and Cuba is an imprisoned family member, know that Castro is next. Moscow  should be told that all cooperation with the United States is now contingent on  the ending of all aid to Cuba.  </P> <P> One of the creations of "progressive" political pilgrims was the pro-Castro  Fair Play for Cuba Committee (which attracted Lee Harvey Oswald). Now, this  instant, we need a fair-play-for-Cubans policy.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 29, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DERSHOWITZ ON PRENATAL RIGHTS  </P> <P> In response to "Drawing the Line on Prenatal Rights," by Alan Dershowitz, Op-Ed  Page, May 14:  </P> <P> With all due respect to Dershowitz, I am appalled by his position advocating  state intervention in a woman's body once she has made the decision to bear a  child over having an abortion. I also am a human rights activist, one perhaps  who has been silent far too long! I am sure Dershowitz would have a different  view on state intervention if the fetus in question was within his male body as  opposed to the body of a woman.  </P> <P> No government entity should have the right to dictate what one does with the  inner sanctity of one's body -- suggest, educate, recommend, yes, but not  intervene. Pregnant women are the first step in government intervention within  the privacy of our bodies. Who will be the next target? Diabetics, cardiacs,  hypertensives -- perhaps only allowed to order from a "special menu" in a  restaurant or shop in a "special section" of the market -- by state  intervention on the individual's behalf? Once unleashed, where will government  intervention stop? Dershowitz has allowed himself to be manipulated by the  right-to-life movement and, in so doing, has lost sight of what constitutes a  democracy!  </P> <P> SHEILA J. TENN  </P> <P> Reseda  </P></p>

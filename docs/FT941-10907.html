			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (19): All eyes on new president after a roller-coaster year - Venezuela In many respects, 1993 was another bad year for the Venezuelan equities market. After three years of strong growth, the economy of this South American oil exporter went into a recession in 1993, and inflation rose to 46 per cent. The country continued to suffer political instability, including the removal of a president to face corruption charges, a series of terrorist bombs in Caracas, and recurring rumours of a coup d'etat. (There had been two frustrated coups in 1992.) Added to this was the uncertainty associated with elections, held last December, to choose a new president and national and state legislatures. Moreover, Venezuelan equities had to compete with high real interest rates that could provide holders of savings accounts with a 30 per cent return in dollar terms. As a result of all this, the Caracas Stock Exchange index had fallen in real terms by 17.5 per cent at the end of a rollercoaster year. (Nominally, the index rose by 10.2 per cent.) This was a far cry from 1990, when the Caracas exchange posted the world's highest gain in dollar terms. Trading activity in shares, as measured by the number of operations, rose by 11.2 per cent to over 165,000 trades; but trading volume in dollar terms dropped by over 28 per cent, to Dollars 1.85bn, according to figures released by the exchange. The Venezuelan bolivar lost 25 per cent of its value last year against the dollar. Trading remained highly concentrated, with 10 issues out of 157 companies listed (up from 139 companies in 1992) accounting for 85 per cent of shares traded. These 10 issues are: La Electricidad de Caracas (the most active stock), Mantex, Vencemos (Class I), Banco Union, Sudamtex (Class B), Mavesa, Sivensa, Sudamtex (Class A), Banco Occidental de Descuento and Venaseta (Class A). Despite all this, some issues did very well. 'Investors who picked up blue chips on dips were treated to very large gains,' wrote Mr Alex Dalmady, editor of InvestAnalysis Stock Guide. 'The market was very volatile during the year, reversing trends about a dozen times. High interest rates made sharp rallies, since the opportunity cost of holding a stock that wasn't rising (or wasn't rising fast enough) became unbearable. Trend-following traders, expecting powerful rallies, got burned time in and time out. The contrarians, who bought when nobody wanted stocks and who sold when everyone was in the market, raked in profits.' According to Mr Dalmady, the top five performers in 1993, with overall gains in dollar terms, were: Corimon, a diversified industrial group (+107.6 per cent); Proagro, an agribusiness company (+106 per cent); Venepal (Class B), a papermaker (+49 per cent); Vencemos Class I, a cement company (+43.6 per cent); Electricidad de Caracas, a utility (+33.7 per cent). The five worst performers in 1993 of the 51 issues analysed by InvestAnalysis were: Tordisca ( - 65.6 per cent); Bancor ( - 66.8 per cent); Grupo Zuliano ( - 68.7 per cent); Inverdica ( - 71.5 per cent); and Torvenca ( - 77.8 per cent) During 1993, the Caracas exchange attracted a significant number of foreign investors, who had been absent from the Venezuelan equities market since 1992. Moreover, the exchange improved the efficiency of its operations, increased automation, and was managed in a more professional manner than in previous years. At present, the economic outlook for 1994 is poor. The economy continues to be in recession, and inflation is rising. The failure of a large commercial bank (Banco Latino) in mid-January has sent shock waves through Venezuela's financial system. Most Venezuelans, battered by inflation over the past few years, say they want to abolish market reforms initiated in 1989. Investors are waiting to see how the new president, Mr Rafael Caldera, who has just started a five-year term, will confront these problems. A 78-year-old politician, who served as president from 1969 to 1974, Mr Caldera took a strong line against market reforms during his presidential campaign last year. But as inauguration days drew nearer, he and his advisers indicated that, while the country's free-market policies will be altered, they will not be scrapped.</p>

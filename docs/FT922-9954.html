			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Steinmuller agrees to buy 40% of power unit L and C Steinmuller, the German power boiler and environment equipment manufacturer, has reached provisional agreement to acquire a 40 per cent stake in the power supplies group of Tampella, the Finnish engineering and forestry group, controlled by the Bank of Finland. Tampella said the arrangement would enable it to 'achieve its strategic goals' inside the European Community while Steinmuller would gain 'new marketing channels' in Scandinavia and North America. The announcement follows the decision last week by the Finnish state-controlled paper machinery and engineering group Valmet to acquire 91 per cent of Tampella's board machine production plants. It also represents a further move in the restructuring of the debt-ridden Finnish company that made a pre-tax loss of FIM1.6bn (Dollars 355m) last year. The power supplies business supplies chemical recovery systems for the wood processing industry and heat and electricity plants for the power industry. Steinmuller is a subsidiary of Philipp Holzmann, the Frankfurt-based construction and project management company. Tampella was saved by the Bank of Finland as part of the rescue of the country's main savings bank, SkopBank. The bank's credit loss troubles were mainly caused by the outstanding debts accumulated by Tampella on loans totalling FM1.5bn.</p>

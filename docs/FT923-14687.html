			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Technology: Batman to launch new film sound from Dolby When America's latest box office release, Batman Returns, opens in the UK next week (July 8) Batman will have a new trick up his sleeve. He'll be talking in digital. Batman Returns is the first film to use what may well become the de facto digital soundtrack standard. Alas, the Empire Leicester Square in London is the only cinema outside the US equipped with the necessary equipment. Only the select few will hear the technology in all its glory. Dolby, best known for its hi-fi noise reduction systems, has been working on film sound for more than 20 years and on digital sound since the mid-1980s. Getting quality stereo sound into cinemas is a problem. Stereo only really works over a tiny triangular area between two speakers, known as the 'hot spot'. To overcome this problem, a centre speaker and sometimes additional speakers are placed at the front of the cinema, as well as speakers at the rear. The best sound is produced with 70mm film, but this costs up to five times more than standard 35mm. The larger film size uses magnetic material glued on to the already exposed film print, with the sound then recorded on six tracks. As the film is quite stiff, the tape heads have to push against the film surface and quickly wear out. Dolby wanted to improve the sound on 35mm film to digital quality. It also wanted to leave the conventional optical analogue soundtrack intact, so film distributors would not need separate prints for digital and analogue cinemas. That dual inventory approach has dogged other attempts to introduce digital cinema sound. Dolby overcame the problem by squeezing the digital information into the spaces between the film sprocket holes. Using hundreds of small black squares between the holes, Dolby achieved a data rate of 320 Kbits/second - still low compared to the 1,400 Kbits/second of stereo CD. However, using sophisticated digital recording and compression techniques to reduce the information recorded, the system produces quality, noise free recordings with a greater range and better frequency response than any other cinema sound system.</p>

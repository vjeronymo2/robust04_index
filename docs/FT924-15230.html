			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Scientist warns on passive smoking A LEADING cancer researcher urged employers yesterday to ensure staff did not have to suffer passive smoking at work, Lisa Wood writes. Sir Richard Doll, a consultant with the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, said that about 0.5 per cent to 1 per cent of all cancers were caused by tobacco smoke at work. Urging companies to support next week's European Week Against Cancer, Sir Richard said, 'People have a right to work in a smoke-free area, and there is no reason why they should have other peoples' carcinogens passed on to them. 'It is an employer's responsibility to provide a smoke-free atmosphere for workers if they want it,' he added. Meanwhile, the National Asthma Campaign, the Health Education Authority and the Ulster Cancer Foundation are supporting a move by Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) to bring a test case over passive smoking at work. According to a legal opinion published by Ash, non-smokers may be able to sue their employers for damage caused to their health by passive smoking.</p>

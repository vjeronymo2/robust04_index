			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sufyan Abu-Zayidah, a prominent Fatah </F> official in the Gaza Strip, by Hasan Abu-Zayid; place and date  not given--recorded]    [Text] [Abu-Zayid] What are the results of the latest  Fatah- Hamas meetings?    [Abu-Zayidah] First of all, there is confusion between the  public seminars being held in several places and the  organizational meetings held on other levels. In any case,  these contacts are aimed at unifying all Palestinian ranks. The  aim is to prevent the shedding of Palestinian blood,  particularly at this transitional phase between the signing and  implementation of the agreement. There is no doubt that it is in  the interest of the Palestinian people and the interest of the  agreement and the peace process to have an agreement between  Hamas, in particular, and the forthcoming Palestinian authority,  particularly Fatah, which is a basic part of this authority.  However, Israel thinks this rapprochement is taking place at  the expense of the peace process. This is completely wrong.    [Abu-Zayid] What about this agreement? How can this  agreement be interpreted?    [Abu-Zayidah] If you mean the agreement signed between the  Fatah hawks and 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam [battalions], then I can  say that this agreement is about internal affairs pertaining to  the Gaza Strip. These affairs have nothing to do with the peace  process, but with events on the ground. Please note that the  agreement concerns strike days, the lands supervised by the  government, internecine fighting, and the killing of agents. It  is in the national interest of all to control these matters.  The agreement does not cover support for or rejection of the  peace process.    [Abu-Zayid] Will Hamas members participate in the  Palestinian  autonomy in Gaza and Jericho?    [Abu-Zayidah] As supporters of the peace process and as a  forthcoming Palestinian authority, we open all doors and windows  to Hamas and the Palestinian opposition in order to participate  in building the Palestinian future. However, there seems to be  no agreement or firm decision within Hamas itself. There are  personal opinions on the extent of Palestinian opposition or  Hamas participation in this authority. For example, they do not  object to participating in municipal councils or taking part in  municipal elections. However, some refuse to take part in the  administrative or legislative council elections of the autonomy.  In all cases, it is in the interest of the Palestinians as well  as Hamas to be part of this Palestinian authority. Otherwise,  let it be a democratic, objective opposition. This is the aim  of the dialogues and meetings.    [Abu-Zayid] Yesterday, you met for the first time with the  Islamic University students, who are considered part of the  opposition. What is the significance of this meeting?    [Abu-Zayidah] In my opinion, the meeting was extremely  important. It sent a message to the Israelis and the whole  world that the Palestinian people enjoy a great awareness and  sense of responsibility, that they can shoulder their own  responsibility by themselves, and that there will be no  bloodbath as soon as the Israeli Army leaves the Strip, as some  try to depict it. There will be great love, appreciation, and  respect among the sons of the one people even if they have  different views. This is the important message of this meeting.    [Abu-Zayid] Mr. Sufyan Abu-Zayidah from the Fatah leadership  in Gaza, thank you very much.    [Abu-Zayidah] Thank you.</p>

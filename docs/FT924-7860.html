			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Survey of Japan and the European Community (10): Long-term commitment - Case Study, Hoechst chemicals and pharmaceuticals WHEN Hoechst, the German chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, set up its Japanese arm in 1953, Japan was not yet the industrial power known today, and was largely seen as only a consumer market. However, the expansion of Japanese industries in the past decade has forced Hoechst to change its strategy drastically, and the country's automobile and electronics industries have now become some of Hoechst's most important business partners. 'At a global group seminar in 1980, there was no talk about Japan,' recalls Mr Horst Waesche, president of Hoechst Japan. 'But later, when Japan became our competitors, we were suddenly asking ourselves: what are we going to do in Japan?' Hoechst found that its longstanding relationship with the Japanese market and the familiarity of its name, made things easier in penetrating into the corporate relationships. Sales at the Hoechst Japan group have grown to Y174.9bn - up 66 per cent from 1987 - and it holds a big market share in areas where it entered earlier. For example, Hoechst has a 25 per cent market share in the agrochemical and herbicides market, while the company boasts a 30 per cent share in high performance pigments. However, the need to transform its operations in Japan from that of a pharmaceuticals and chemicals trading company to a serious manufacturer, supplying leading automobile and electronics makers, has not been an easy task. The company's basic strategy has been to build extensive production and research and development facilities, establish alliances with leading Japanese companies, and become suppliers to Japanese companies both in Japan and abroad. Hoechst has spent Y80bn in the last five years on capital investments, including Y3.7bn on its new chemical plant north of Tokyo, completed in 1991. It has also decided to invest Y2bn for a new plant for fibre production. Some 40 per cent of Hoechst's products sold in Japan are currently produced locally. In 1991, Hoechst and Mitsubishi Kasei, the leading chemical concern, agreed to co-operate in the development and production of polyethylene film, a move following a dyestuff joint venture between the two companies set up in the late 1960s. Mr Waesche brushes off worries over the current slowdown in the Japanese economy as short term, describing the symptoms as just a readjustment phase. 'Japanese companies are still making far larger profits than European companies,' he says, predicting solid growth in the years following a recovery. Instead, Hoescht has longer-term prospects in mind. The company's pharmaceutical research laboratories will probably not show returns this century. Mr Waesche reckons that the long-term commitment is what counts. The company was also listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's foreign section in late 1991. The move came when trading on the TSE had slumped, prompting foreign companies to review the necessity of a Tokyo listing. Last September, five international companies including General Motors of the US, Philips Electronics and News Corporation formally applied for delisting due to the high costs and administrative burden in spite of a sharp decline in their local shareholders. Mr Waesche says he was surprised by the delistings, and adds that the listing is essential for their international profile, especially for recruiting skilled personnel. Moreover, Japan will become more important due to the growth potential of China. Japanese manufacturing companies are already moving into China by setting up production plants. Mr Waesche says the significant role of Japanese industries in China's industrial growth provides great business potential for Hoechst as well. Despite claims of unfair business practices among Japanese companies, Mr Waesche points out that if a foreign company can provide competitive products, there is no discrimination - 'once you are in, things are fine. The important thing is to establish yourself inside the system.'</p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: DTI to move part of oil and gas office to Aberdeen THE GOVERNMENT is to move 60 geologists and engineers with the Department of Trade and Industry's oil and gas division from London to Aberdeen to set up an office to deal with North Sea oil development. Many Scottish businessman and politicians have long been pressing for the whole of the Petroleum Engineering Directorate to be moved to Aberdeen in order to strengthen the city as a centre of oil and gas expertise. Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, said that consultants had found 'no clear case' for doing this. The new Aberdeen office, he said, would provide services previously available only in London and would 'take the nationwide lead in the issue of field development consents'. If, as expected, more oil companies moved from London to Aberdeen to be near the directorate the office would be expanded to 80 staff. A study by accountants Ernst &amp; Young showed, however, that there would be a loss of business efficiency to the DTI if the whole of the directorate went to Aberdeen. It acknowledged there would be a 'small gain' in promoting an agglomeration of industries and skills in Aberdeen, which should improve the UK international position in offshore supplies and services. It said the impact of the move on the location of other organisations would be small and the effect on the costs and efficiency of oil companies would be neutral. There would be a very small financial cost to the DTI. Mr Ian Wood, chairman of the Aberdeen-based Wood Group, an offshore service company, said the decision was a 'step in the right direction'. Mr Wood is a leading campaigner for moving the whole directorate to Aberdeen.</p>

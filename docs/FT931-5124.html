			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Studies confirm confidence is up THE REPORT of a surge in business confidence in the first two months of this year, recorded by the Institute of Directors in its latest survey, is reinforced by other surveys published today which detect an improvement in business and consumer confidence but warn that it could be shortlived. The institute found that 51 per cent of the 305 directors questioned were more optimistic about the outlook for the economy than they were six months ago, compared with 38 per cent in December and 10 per cent in October. The only region where the level of confidence fell was the Midlands, where 48 per cent were more optimistic compared with 50 per cent in December. But fewer directors report that their company has been investing - 49 per cent in February compared with 53 per cent in December and 52 per cent in October. For more than a third of directors insufficient demand remains the main concern. A survey published today by PA Cambridge Economic Consultants shows consumer confidence is recovering slowly. The quarterly survey's index of confidence has seen the first rise since June 1992 to 75.2, up from 72.8 in December. Of the 1,000 people questioned, 12.4 per cent expect their financial position to improve in the next three months compared with 9.3 per cent in December - 20.8 per cent expect it to get worse, but that is down from 25.9 per cent in the last survey. A new index of activity in consumer industries launched this week by NTC, the research group, also suggests that the consumer sector is recovering. NTC reports that the index has been rising sharply for the past five months because of increases in retail sales, TV advertising, share prices and recent interest rate cuts. A more cautious note is sounded in the survey published today by the Finance &amp; Leasing Association. It reports that 64 per cent of members have seen a rise in confidence in consumer lending, compared with 8 per cent in October, but nearly two thirds of members report no change in business lending and 'a mood of caution' about the future. Infolink, the consumer credit information group, warned: 'Consumer confidence may well falter in the run-up to the Budget on March 16.'</p>

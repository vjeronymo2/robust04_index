			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Survey of Management Consultants (3): Faith in the religion of quality is starting to waver - Despite its successes, not everyone is convinced by TQM theory Management theories come and go. But since the early 1980s one of the most enduring in the industrialised west has been the search for Total Quality. In fact the origins of the Total Quality Management (TQM) movement date back almost four decades. The founding fathers of modern TQM theory include the three Americans, W Edwards Deming, Joseph Juran and Armand Feigenbaum, who in the early 1950s introduced Japanese managers to the principles of quality control and are thus widely credited with helping to create Japan's post-war industrial powerhouse. But is was not until the early 1980s that pioneer companies in the west, such as Xerox, which had watched the Japanese steal a large chunk of a copier market it had invented, began to wake up to quality theory. Xerox responded first by undertaking a series of 'benchmarking' studies to determine the scope and specifics of the competitive challenge. As a result Xerox in the US and Rank Xerox in Europe launched a comprehensive quality strategy, dubbed 'Leadership Through Quality' in 1983. Since then Xerox has managed to reverse the decline in its market share and, in the process, has won numerous quality prizes including the coveted Baldrige award in the US in 1989. Like many of its Japanese counterparts, Xerox sees its quality programme as just 'a way of doing business', but one that is entirely focused on providing customer satisfaction. Other companies such as Motorola, the US electronics group, claim that they have saved millions by adopting quality programmes in their manufacturing operations. Ms Sharon Studer, a partner at KPMG, the international management consultancy, describes quality as 'the ticket to play' for western companies. The Japanese, she argues, established quality as an entry point to whole industries. 'If one is going to be a world competitor you benchmark against the best, and that is often the Japanese.' Among the basic tenets of all quality programmes are some fairly straight-forward concepts. These include recognising that it is important to get things right first time, and that almost any thing or process can be measured or benchmarked. Perhaps most important of all is the realisation that the driving force behind any process, whether manufacturing or service, must be to provide the customer with what the customer wants. Quality, and TQM in particular, has become a big business in its own right. Around three-quarters of all US and British companies claim to have some form of quality programme and converts to the total quality movement sometimes treat it almost like a religion. Increasingly, large companies and other organisations which have applied for and achieved certification under one of the national or international quality standards expect their suppliers and contractors to have also achieved quality certification. Meanwhile hundreds of books have been written on the subject of quality, and companies often pay thousands of pounds to send their executives to seminars where management consultants and corporate disciples sing TQM's praises. Some specialist management consultancies, such as Philip Crosby Associates in Florida, have even built up a worldwide business dealing specifically with quality management issues. Since it was formed in 1979 PCA, which has offices in 23 locations in 14 countries, says it has trained more than 1m people in various facets of quality management. But not everyone is convinced. Although some marked successes are claimed for TQM there is evidence that the quality programmes of many companies are failing. Among the staunchest critics are some of the management firms which have helped fuel the TQM bandwagon. Some research in the past year has cast doubt on TQM as a panacea for all competitive ills. A survey by Arthur D Little of 500 US manufacturing and service companies, found that only a third felt their TQM programmes were having a 'significant impact' on their competitiveness. A similar study undertaken by AT Kearney of over 100 British companies suggested that 80 per cent of quality programmes fail to produce any tangible benefit. However, the study also suggested that most quality programmes failed because the management had not set realistic goals or defined measurable benefits at the outset. The AT Kearney study suggested that successful TQM programmes typically have a greater focus on the customer and aim to give employees more authority to make decisions. It suggested that companies which have successfully introduced TQM are twice as likely to have made an objective study of their competitors through 'benchmarking'. It also revealed that, where TQM has failed to generate tangible results, the quality manager, rather than a director, was often responsible for the programme. Companies which practise TQM successfully appear to share four common characteristics: An emphasis on tangible results; insistence on performance measurement; an integrated programme; and a clear commitment from top management. In addition they ensure that they 'retain ownership of the programme' instead of relying on outside consultants. But often it seems the real problem for western companies is that the TQM programme becomes a bureaucratic end in itself, rather than a means to the end, namely serving the customer. And executives, and shareholders, often expect quick results rather than acknowledging that quality programmes take time to develop - and that they never really finish. One often-quoted example of a quality programme that went wrong is that of Florida Power Light (FPL). During the 1980s the utility built up a huge quality programme in an effort to become the first non-Japanese winner of the Deming prize for quality. In 1989 it won the prize but the improvement in customer service was insignificant compared to the effort and cost involved in its quality programme. Since then a new management team has down-scaled the quality programme and made it much less rigid. Even the four-year-old Baldrige award has managed to generate controversy. Some supporters such as Mr Robert Galvin, Motorola's chairman have called it 'the most important catalyst for transforming American business' methods. But its critics have suggested that it is seriously flawed on a number of counts, complaining variously about its methodology, focus and philosophy. The debate which raged in the US earlier this year, mostly on the pages of the Harvard Business Review, may even find an echo in Europe, where the Dutch-based European Foundation for Quality Management handed out its first award for TQM earlier this month. The guiding principle behind the EFQM award is that it is not sufficient for western European companies to survive, they must prosper, and in order to prosper they must be competitive. They must be seen as offering 'quality' goods and services that customers find attractive and good value for money. Its promoters argue that, 'companies attaining total quality excellence will have that all-important competitive advantage and will play a vital role in Europe's future and success.' Like their US counterparts they believe that TQM holds the key to competing with the Japanese and that 'through TQM western Europe will become a leading force in the world market."</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1992 (18): Importance of clear objectives - Engineering application CAD software was initially bought as an engineering and drafting tool at Hotpoint, the UK manufacturer of white goods. But now, according to David Ellis, IT co-ordinator, 'it is an enabling-tool to improve the design to manufacture process.' Eight years ago the company chose Intergraph's EMS engineering modelling system. When a review looked in 1990 at alternative offerings from Computervision, IBM and HP, Hotpoint decided that it still had the right tool, and stayed with EMS. It now runs EMS, MicroStation, project layout and associated desktop publishing products on a network of Intergraph UNIX workstations and servers. 'There were many excellent solutions available, but CAD must be seen as an integral part of the IT strategy, not an isolated tool, to get the maximum benefit,' says Mr Ellis. Hotpoint was looking for several different levels of integration - not just in-house, but in dealing with third parties without having to translate. It also put a high rating on useability and friendliness. The system has now percolated most areas of Hotpoint, and plays a part not only in the design, but in the manufacture, and even the user manuals provided with Hotpoint's fridges, washing machines and dishwashers. There are now links with the MRP manufacturing software, and with the CNC numerical control systems in Hotpoint's Welsh factories in Rhyl and Gwynnedd. Mr Ellis stresses that the benefits have not been solely in the design improvements attributable to CAD software, but in the new approaches that its use has brought. His advice to others is that 'companies should look at the processes, the people, and then at the technology as an enabler.' CAD should help to develop and improve the effectiveness of individuals, and also benefit and improve the process itself. Too often, he warns, the implementation of CAD software fails because the objectives have not been fully understood - 'the goals have to be defined properly,' he concludes.

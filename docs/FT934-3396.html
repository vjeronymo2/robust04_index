			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / What to do if you think you have suffered Many people are so bewildered by the world of pensions that it is not surprising some will be led astray by bad advice. But how can consumers tell whether they have been wrongly advised? There are two basic situations where employees could have been persuaded to switch to a personal pension from a company one. The first is when they have left a company's employment. Their choice lies between leaving their benefits in the employer's scheme, transferring the benefit to the new employer, or switching into one of two types of personal pension. Mr Mailesh Shah, senior consultant at actuaries William M. Mercer, said that those who switch to a personal pension should understand that they have given up a defined level of benefit to earn a pension which will be governed by the level of investment return. In other words, they have taken a risk to get a higher pension. Anyone who feels that the risk was not explained to them might have a case for complaint. The more serious problems, however, are likely to occur where employees have been persuaded to opt out of their existing employer's scheme, and contribute instead to a personal pension. In such cases they may be giving up a number of benefits. For example, the employer will often be making contributions, and there will be death-in-service and spouse's benefits. Opting out can be worthwhile, but existing employees are likely to be better off with their company pension. Mr John Cole of financial advisers Berry, Birch &amp; Noble, said that there were two warning signs which should cause consumers to worry. 'If the person who made the sale took no interest in your personal position, or did not ask about the benefits in your company scheme, alarm bells ought to sound.' What should you do if you believe that you have been wrongly sold a personal pension? The first step will be to return to the person who sold you the policy. If you bought your pension from a member of Lautro, the life assurance and unit trust regulator, your next step if you are not satisfied is to write to the compliance officer of the company concerned - the person who sold you the pension should have given you a card indicating the body of which he or she was a member. Should you be unhappy with the response of the company, your next step is to contact the pensions ombudsman at 11 Belgrave Road, London SW1V 1RB. It might also be worth notifying Lautro at Centre Point, 103 New Oxford Street, London WC1A 1PT. If you bought your pension from a member of Fimbra, the regulator for financial intermediaries, your first step is to contact the independent financial adviser concerned. If you are still not satisfied, you should write to the Complaints Department, Fimbra, Hertsmere House, Hertsmere Road, London E14. The investor can take the dispute to an arbitrator, whose award is binding.</p>

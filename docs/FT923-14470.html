			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (3): Advanced details on the autumn issue To be published on Sept 11, 1992 The Autumn issue of Software At Work will examine users' experiences of human resource systems, plus marketing and market research databases. The 'hot topic' section will look at Europeanisation: the development of software to serve different countries. Here are details of the synopsis: Human resource systems: payroll systems have been grinding away since the early days of business computing, doing a dull but vital job. The arrival of the personal computer raised the possibility of personnel managers getting little administration systems of their own. But more recently, payroll and personnel package users and suppliers have been looking at exploiting basic data about employees to greater effect to help plan, manage and use an organisation's biggest and usually most expensive resource to maximum advantage. Marketing and market research databases: marketing and selling demand the right information to ensure the best return on effort. Market research information is now available in a variety of forms, ranging from computer bureau services to CDs which can be used with personal computers. What are the options and how can the information best be used? Europeanisation: the advent of the single European market is likely to bring an increasing number of international mergers and partnerships, plus overseas expansion by companies which have traditionally concentrated on their home markets. This will bring demand for software running on different computers which can handle multiple currencies and languages and the oddities of different countries' business methods. Following the September review, future issues of Software At Work will look at developments in computer-aided design and manufacturing; document image processing; project management; contingency planning and disaster recovery; and electronic funds transfer at the point of sale. For details of how Software At Work operates and how to contribute to the next issue, see details in the article at the top of this page: Users have their say. Information from users and suppliers is needed by Mon, July 13.

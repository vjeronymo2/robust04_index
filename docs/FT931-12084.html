			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Books: Victim of the Revolution - Philip Mansel discusses a much maligned monarch LOUIS XVI by John Hardman Yale Pounds 19.95, 264 pages GUILLOTINED two hundred years ago on January 21 1793, Louis XVI remains the most elusive of monarchs. His piety, his silences, the disappearance of many of his papers, are so many barriers to understanding. Revolutionary propaganda and the royalist cult of the Martyr King have further distorted the truth. Paradoxically, Louis XVI was at first a success. When he was only 20, in 1774, he inherited a weak and discredited throne. Yet he restored French finances and diplomatic prestige, defeated Britain in the War of American Independence, and began a programme of unobtrusive but effective reforms - including civil rights for Protestants, long before Catholics had them in Britain. In some ways he was more modern than his immediate successors. Beside his conscious rejection of territorial annexations in Europe, the expansionism of the Republic and the Empire appears infantile and counterproductive. He was well educated and intelligent (his German and English were excellent). His obsession with facts and figures - revealed in his famous hunting diary - helped his grasp of finance. He was more opposed to the violence and arrogance than to some of the aims of the revolutionaries. According to John Hardman, in 1787 he 'virtually called the Third Estate into existence as a political force.' Why then did he die beneath the guillotine's blade? One answer is his conscience. No monarch or ruler can afford to say, as he did at his travesty of a trial, 'I declare to you that my conscience reproaches me with nothing.' His predecessors had devoted themselves to strengthening the royal power-base and propaganda machine. Louis XVI put le bonheur des francais first, thereby losing the power to realise it. Few kings, however, have faced such difficulties - and such treachery. Beneath a show of obedience, members of his family, and some of his ministers, pursued policies hostile to his own. Hardman shows that the Comte de Vergennes, one of the greatest foreign ministers in the history of France, a confidant and favourite of the King, intrigued against the King and Queen during the Diamond Necklace Affair in order to bring witnesses favourable to the Cardinal de Rohan back to France. The Finance Minister and popular idol Necker sabotaged the Seance Royale of July 17 1789. The Right in the National Assembly was as ready to flout the King's will as the left. John Hardman's biography coincides not just with the two hundredth anniversary of the King's death but with the final realisation by much of French opinion that it was worse than a crime, a mistake. Only 262 pages long, this is a political history, with little on the King's piety, his concern for the poor or his artistic patronage. In my opinion, Hardman is not critical enough of such sources as the denigratory diary of the Abbe de Veri or the hagiographical memoirs of Baron Hue. Nor is he sufficiently forthright about the treachery of Marie Antoinette towards her husband. Not all errors are minor. Far from showing that the King continued paying those bodyguards who emigrated, the papers from the Tuileries show that he stopped. The posthumous cult of Louis XVI is ignored. Nevertheless, the force of prejudice, especially about royal figures, is so strong that this is the only sane assessment of Louis XVI in English since his death. The bright light of Hardman's archival research dispels the fogs of revolutionary and royalist propaganda. A different man emerges: energetic, sardonic, rarely influenced by the Queen except perhaps in 1787-9. He could fly into 'a towering rage'; different ministers described him as 'harsh' or 'implacable'; he had a sense of humour (he called Catherine II Madame Potemkin), and a grasp of reality. Although he failed to exploit it in the crucial months May-July 1789, he knew that the amour propre of 'the bourgeoisie' (his term) was one of the main forces behind the revolution. By July 1789 the Paris mob was uncontrollable and the royal army unreliable. To have survived on the throne, and saved France from civil war, for three more years, was no ordinary achievement. On the political history of the reign Hardman is generally judicious and interesting. By ignoring the military dimension, he fails to explain why the King lost, or failed to use, ultima ratio regum: cannon power. This breakdown, more than fundamental political conflict, is the real explanation for the hiatus in monarchical power in France between 1792 and 1804.</p>

No estimate on the loss was made because the  building was to be demolished.  </P> <P> Fire investigators determined that the cause of the fire, which started inside  the building, was arson, but there were no suspects.  </P> <P> Westbound Ventura Boulevard was blocked to traffic in the area and eastbound  traffic was backed up by the fire and cleanup.  </P></p>

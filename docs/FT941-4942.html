			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Elderly's share of benefits falls The proportion of the social security budget going to elderly people is falling, says the annual report of the Department of Social Security. Four years ago, elderly people took up half of all benefits expenditure, mainly through state pensions. By 1996-97 this will have fallen to less than 45 per cent of the total. Over the same period, the share of social security going to long-term sick and disabled people will rise from 16 per cent to 22 per cent. Legislation to curb the growth in numbers claiming such benefits is passing through parliament. The report says that benefits have become better targeted in recent years, with 95 per cent going to people in households with below-average income. Since 1988 extra spending has been directed at low-income families with children and pensioners receiving income support. Income-related benefits are focused even more on low-income households. About 86 per cent goes to those in the bottom 40 per cent of the income distribution. However, more precise targeting has meant a small increase - to 845,000 households - in the numbers who lose more than 70 per cent of each additional pound of income. This happens where the withdrawal of benefits coincides with the start of income tax to produce high marginal net deductions. Spending on social security will account for 28 per cent of public spending next year and will rise from Pounds 82bn this year to Pounds 92bn in 1996-97. An increasing proportion of social security is financed out of general taxation, which provides more than half the income for benefits. Employers' National Insurance contributions provide a quarter of the budget and employees' contributions about a fifth. Social security departmental report. HMSO. Pounds 14.20.</p>

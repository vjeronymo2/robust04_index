			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: Shares in US airlines plunge on profit warnings Shares in Continental Airlines and Southwest Airlines, two of the biggest US carriers, plunged to 12-month lows yesterday after the companies warned their fourth-quarter results would be badly hit by fare wars in the US market. Other airline stocks took a hammering as gloom over the industry's prospects reasserted itself. Earlier this year a spate of good results had given rise to hopes that the sector was recovering from years of losses caused by overcapacity and cut-throat competition. The biggest disappointment came from Southwest Airlines, which until now had enjoyed a long period of unusually strong profits growth by offering no-frills services at fares well below those of other airlines. Southwest was able to offer these low fares because its costs were much lower than those of the other big carriers. But the other airlines have been hitting back, trying to mimic the Southwest formula with their own low-cost services and forcing Southwest's fares even lower. On Wednesday, Southwest warned that its passenger yield - the average fare per passenger per mile - could be down by as much as 9 per cent in the fourth quarter, resulting in net earnings well below the comparable period's 26 cents a share. Its shares closed Dollars 3 down at Dollars 16 7/8 yesterday, a fall of 15 per cent. Shares in Continental Airlines were even worse hit - at the close, they were down Dollars 3 1/2 at Dollars 8 7/8 , a fall of 35 per cent - after the company warned that losses in the fourth quarter would be significantly deeper than expected and capacity would be reduced by 7 per cent in January as a result. Analysts had already been predicting a loss of 70 cents a share for Continental because the airline's no-frills Continental Lite service, launched last year as a rival to the services offered by Southwest Airlines and other low-cost carriers, has run into difficulties. Airline stocks sank on fare wars fears. UAL, United Airlines' parent, was down Dollars 4 3/8 at Dollars 87 5/8; AMR, American Airlines' parent, was down Dollars 2 1/8 at Dollars 48 3/4; USAir was down Dollars 1/8 at Dollars 4 3/8; and Delta Air Lines was down Dollars 2 at Dollars 46 1/4.</p>

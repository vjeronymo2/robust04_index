			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Extra time for British Coal MR HESELTINE goes to Brussels today to see whether the EC's policy on aid to industry can accommodate a fresh round of subsidies to save British Coal. If he steps on the plane with a heavy heart, he has only himself to blame since his own mishandling of the pit closures is the main reason why he is now trying to prop up British Coal rather than privatise it. But a commercially viable coal industry must remain his aim. Although the stormy debate over the future of coal has shown that there is widespread popular support for the industry, it has not thrown up any compelling reason to accord it special treatment. The UK is a fuel-rich country which does not need to rely heavily on coal. Coal is an expensive fuel once its true environmental costs are factored in - as they should be. And British Coal has already demonstrated that it possesses the technology and the will to raise its productivity closer to commercial levels. The only possible case for extending subsidies lies in the evidence submitted by independent mining engineers that British Coal could achieve greater viability with three or four more years' breathing space. Even this is another of those gold-at-the-end-of-the-rainbow arguments which needs to treated with caution, but given the hard political realities now facing Mr Heseltine, it might provide the least harmful possible justification for further aid. However if the UK does embark on a fresh round of subsidy it needs to be done with several clear points in mind. The first is that any aid for British Coal will be driven more by a desire to save jobs than to bring sense to the UK's energy policy. The funds should therefore be accounted for as an employment subsidy and not as a hand-out to the coal industry. That will not, regrettably, avoid the fact of further distorting the UK's already badly warped energy picture, and these will load further costs on to the economy at large through higher-than-necessary electricity prices. It will have a knock-on effect on other industries such as gas and nuclear power, and place a competitive handicap on British manufacturers. The second is that protection for coal will also lead to higher electricity prices because of regulatory arrangements which permit power generation costs to be passed directly through to the consumer. Since concerns already exist about the lack of competition in the generating business it would be appropriate to combine any programme of subsidies with closer monopoly scrutiny of the power business. A third is that the cost of any subsidy should be clearly identified. Since helping coal is essentially a matter of social policy, the cost should logically be borne by the taxpayer. But with the Budget in deep deficit this would mean up to 1p on income tax - a tricky option in present circumstances. Therefore the cost may well have to be borne by the consumer through a levy on electricity bills, which is not as it should be, though it does have the advantage that people could be reminded by an item on their quarterly statements of just how much it is costing them to keep British Coal going. A fourth point is that Mr Heseltine's package of measures should be accompanied by a clear timetable for privatising and restructuring British Coal, partly in order to make announced limits on both the size and ultimate duration of subsidies more credible. There is no reason, as the government now appears to believe, why British Coal should not be privatised during the lifetime of a subsidy regime. Its new owners would know the score and would have a stronger incentive to get British Coal into shape for the day when they cease. Although many people will judge the success of Mr Heseltine's task in terms of the number of miners' jobs he saves, a better measure will be the bottom line in terms of money spent. The less the better. Extra time for British Coal in the end only means extra money.</p>

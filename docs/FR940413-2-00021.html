			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Southern proposes to modify an existing receiving station in order to deliver gas to Wichita River Oil Corporation (Wichita) for use as gas lift gas at its production facilities in Jefferson Parish Louisiana. Southern plans to modify the meter station on its 4-inch Three Bayou Bay Line in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, by reversing the existing 2-inch meter to enable Southern to deliver gas to Wichita at that location. Southern estimates that the cost of modifying the meter station is approximately $10,100 for which Wichita has agreed to reimburse Southern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Southern states that it will transport gas to Wichita pursuant to the existing service agreement between Southern and Natural Gas Clearinghouse under Southern's rate schedule IT. Natural Gas Clearinghouse has requested transportation of the gas for delivery at the meter station by having the meter station added as a delivery point to the service agreement under Southern's tariff. Southern further states that Wichita anticipates receiving on average 200 Mcf of natural gas per day and 4,000 Mcf per year at the proposed facilities. Southern states that the operation of the proposed facilities will have no significant effect on its peak day or annual requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> May 20, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Standard Paragraphs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> F.

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Avesta Sheffield doubles loss, holds payout AVESTA SHEFFIELD, which has become Europe's largest stainless steel group following the recent merger of Avesta and British Steel's stainless steel operations, yesterday disclosed a SKr564m (Dollars 72.33m) loss, after financial items, for 1992. Weak market conditions were aggravated by merger expenses and the costs of starting up a new mill, the company said. The deficit was more than double 1991's SKr248m loss and led the company to scrap its dividend after a SKr1 per share pay-out in 1991. 'The most important reason for the negative result is that product prices have fallen more than raw material prices,' the group said. It blamed industry over-capacity and increased nickel exports from the former eastern bloc for the fall in prices, while noting that demand was restrained by recession in many important markets. It said European demand for hot rolled plate, pipes, tubes and long products fell, while demand for cold rolled products rose just 1 per cent, compared with a normal 4 to 5 per cent. Sales amounted to SKr7.59bn, compared with SKr7.39bn in 1991, with SKr842m generated by British Steel's stainless operations in the two months following the completion of the merger on November 2. Excluding this contribution, sales were down 9 per cent. The overall loss would have been lower but for SKr171m adverse movement in inventory prices, SKr50m in merger costs, and SKr101m related to the start-up of the group's hot strip rolling mill in Avesta. The group originally expected the merger to produce SKr400m of annual cost savings from 1995, but now says it expects the benefits to be greater and to take effect as early as 1993. British Steel owns 40 per cent of the group.</p>

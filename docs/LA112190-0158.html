			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> N.Y. DAILY NEWS SUES 11 OVER STRIKE VIOLENCE  </P> <P> The Daily News has taken a new tack in the nearly monthlong strike against the  tabloid by suing 11 people for allegedly burning a delivery truck, stealing  bundled papers or attacking replacement drivers.  </P> <P> Evidence in two of the three lawsuits filed in state court Tuesday includes  videotapes made by management, newspaper spokesman John T. Sloan said.  </P> <P> Each lawsuit, claiming the defendants hurt the paper's ability to do business,  seeks $100,000 in punitive damages and unspecified compensatory damages.  </P> <P> One lawsuit claims that a member of the drivers' union set fire to a truck  outside the paper's Brooklyn printing plant on Oct. 25, the night the strike  began.  </P> <P> Another claims that two Wall Street Journal drivers stole bundles of the News  that had been left at a drop-off point by non-union drivers on Oct. 30.  </P> <P> The third lawsuit accuses eight people of attacking non-union drivers and  independent distributors on Oct. 31 at a paper drop-off point.  </P> <P> Nine unions representing more than 2,000 employees at the nation's  third-largest newspaper went on strike over what they called unfair labor  practices.  </P></p>

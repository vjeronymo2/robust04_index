			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Books: Flight fancy - Fiction MR VERTIGO by Paul Auster Faber Pounds 14.99, 278 pages At first glance Paul Auster's new novel is a straightforward story of an orphan boy from the American Mid-West who learns to fly. Yet the fact that the book is set during the pioneering days of aviation is a sly joke on Auster's part: his protagonist, Walter Rawley, is no more than a distant observer of the daring new world of manned flight. 'I was twelve years old the first time I walked on water' is how Walt begins his first-person narrative, and he goes on to relate his painful initiation into the strange, logic-defying art of levitation. Plucked from the streets of St Louis at the age of nine, Walt spends three years on a remote farm in Kansas undergoing a series of ordeals devised by Master Yehudi, a sinister Hungarian saved from outright charlatanism by a kindly streak. Yehudi's harsh methods slowly transform the orphan into Walt the Wonder Boy, whose aerial stunts draw astonished crowds from coast to coast. Yet Walt's status remains ambiguous. The extraordinary gifts which Master Yehudi has developed in him are put to no greater use than the accumulation of money, and they fade as soon as puberty subjects him to crippling bouts of vertigo. 'You know nothing', Yehudi tells Walt, explaining why he has selected him from the thousands of hungry kids begging on the streets. 'You know nothing because you are nothing'. Walt is singled out not for any innate talent but for its polar opposite, a lightness of character which allows him literally to rise above his peers. Walt's story is also that of his century, of turning away from confused ideals of white America's European roots to an obsession with making money; having lost his levitational skills, Walt winds up as the proprietor of a laundromat chain. 'I did what no American had done before me, what no one has ever since', he boasts, encapsulating the paradoxical spirit of the 1920s: unbounded ambition, foolish pride and child-like innocence. This is a heavy burden of symbolism for a novel to bear and it is often a relief to hear Walt's no-nonsense voice expostulating over Yehudi's flights of fancy. Walt protests: 'I hate to be a party pooper, sir, but this beauty stuff's a great big ho-hum. I mean, who cares if a place looks crummy or not? As long as it's got some people in it, it's bound to be interesting. Subtract the people, and what's left? Emptiness, that's what?' This little speech points to the novel's most serious flaw. At its heart is a cold perfection, a sense of deliberate disengagement which holds the reader at arm's length. Mr Vertigo is a class act, but one whose impact does not linger once the show is over.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- Residents near the U.S.  Yokota Air Base decided Tuesday [5 April] night not to appeal to  the Supreme Court a ruling that rejected their demands for a ban  on night flights but ordered compensation for their suffering.  The plaintiffs also decided to ask the government not to  appeal, said Ryuzo Fukumoto, leader of the residents.    The government has not expressed whether it will appeal or  not. The deadline for appeal expires next Wednesday.    The Tokyo high court last Wednesday ruled that the  government  pay 710 million yen to 596 residents near the base, 40  kilometers west of central Tokyo, for past suffering from noise.  The court, though, rejected the suit's demands for a ban on  night flights and compensation for future annoyance.    "To give up an appeal is regrettable... (but) the residents  have aged too much," Fukumoto told reporters.    In November last year, Japan and the United States agreed  that flights and ground activities at the base between 10 P.M.  and 6 A.M. should be restricted to those which are essential to  U.S. military operations.</p>

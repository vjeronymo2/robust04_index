			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Message issued by President Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani in </F> Tehran on 1 February marking the start of Islamic revolution  anniversary celebrations -- recorded]    [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful.  This moment is an historic and a very important occasion in our  country's history. Our people do not forget those highly  exciting days, when the nation was impatiently awaiting the  return of the imam [Khomeyni] after years of exile and  separation from the homeland. The enemies of our nation and  agents of arrogance inside the country, who enjoyed a  comfortable lifestyle, were concerned that with the imam's  return their days of plundering and corruption would end. This  moment coincides precsiely with the moment when the imam landed  at the airport.    The government of the day had concentrated all its efforts  on  preventing the imam's arrival. On the other hand all the  combative forces inside the country had concentrated all their  efforts on realizing their old aspiration. The moment was  highly exciting when the people found out that the imam's plane  had come through various dangers to land safely at Mehrabad  Airport. I think our artists and those talented in poetry and  culture should draw suitable pictures to mark the occasion. The  arrival of the new year is usually an exciting moment for our  nation. Certainly the effects of this moment in our history are  greater than those moments before the new year, so we have  created certain ceremonies.    Let us look at the time before that moment and the period  after it. If we look at the era before [Khomeyni's arrival], we  see the rule of satan, the country's dependency, the presence of  foreign advisers in Iran, abjectness, captivity, corruption,  unrestrained behavior, the rule of aristocracy, and so on.  Whereas on this side, we see the rule of God, rule by the  people, the people's presence in the arena, independence,  freedom, Islam, the Koran, improvement, piety and, in a word,  the path of God.    It seems that our new generation should be made more  familiar  with the facts relating to both chapters of the country's  history -- much more than what we have explained to them so far.  These two chapters are: the era before the Imam's arrival and  the chapter after that moment.    Our nation remembers that from the moment the imam stepped  out of the plane, everything changed shape. Hopes gained much  greater strength. The fear of the revolution's opponents  intensified immensely, and the wheels of history rotated at a  faster rate. The pages of history were turning so fast that no  on could read the lines of history or even glance at them.  After only a few days the foundations of monarchist tyranny  collapsed and the foundations of the Islamic government, the  popular government, were laid down.    May this occasion be a blessed occasion to our nation and  may  these historic moments remain honored in our history for ever.</p>

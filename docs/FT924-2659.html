			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Arts: Black comedy in 'Grace' - Theatre 'It's an honour to meet you,' says the Rev Neal Hoffmann, a prosperous American evangelist, to Ruth Hartstone, an impoverished Englishwoman who is about to sell him her family estate. Welcoming him with stately courtesy, she simply says 'Yes.' The battlelines are already drawn; but what is the battle? Ruth cannot afford to stay in the family home, and is selling up for two million. Hoffman and his Enterprise Faith team, by contrast, are not only ruthlessly evangelical and American, they are also relentlessly profit-oriented and Philistine. They want to buy the Hartstone home because a miracle happened there 40 years ago, at the deathbed of Ruth's sister Grace. Hoffman now plans to base his Enterprise Faith there and there to film his account of Grace's story. A black comedy ensues, along Evelyn Waugh or Angus Wilson lines. The Hoffman crew is a ludicrous lot, including Joanna, a Sloane actress who pursues Ruth's young companion, Freddy, with hopes that he is the gamekeeper for her: 'Very DH Lawrence]' She is, however, being secretly bonked by Hoffman's English agent Gavin Driver. Hoffman's wife, a soul in torment for many reasons, has renounced her genuine literary talent to write wretched scripts for Enterprise Faith. Meanwhile, there is also a skeleton in the Hartstone family cupboard. But will Ruth reveal it? The playwright is Doug Lucie, who has written other 'darkly funny' plays. The comedy here is acute, and so is some of the characterisation  - notably Mrs Hoffmann. But Lucie weighs the moral scales against the Americans to preposterous extremes. They and their Americanophile colleagues take evangelism, Philistinism, Republicanism, Thatcherism and charlatanism to extremes. They also demonstrate, in passing, gross male chauvinism and anti-liberalism, plus subtle fattism and racism. Ruth and Freddy, however, combine their religious scepticism with charity, industry, socialism and (eventually) honesty. The contrast between the two sides is too drastic to be either persuasive or fun. The play was also surely written about three years ago. Though it is officially 1992, no-one refers to a recession. Ruth and Freddy do voice an interesting kind of despair about Britain, but this is simply old-school pessimism (viz. E. Waugh and A. Wilson, passim). Line by line the play is so entertaining, and so well delivered, that it enthrals you while you watch. What weaknesses it has grow on you gradually, and hit you afterwards. This is not the fault of Mike Bradwell's sure direction; nor of Sue Plummer's elegant designs; nor of the cast. The most interesting characters are subsidiary - Mrs Hoffman, Joanna, Freddy  -and, excellently though they are played by Kate Fahy, Emma Lewis and Ben Thomas, they are not fully developed. Kristin Thomas, in her professional debut, is awesomely perfect as the born-again gospel-singing actress Felicia. James Laurenson, virtually unrecognisable, does good work (apart from a few intrusive British syllables) as Hoffman, but the role is something of a stereotype. Likewise Anna Massey is an ideal Ruth - cynical, genteel, precise, dowdy - but the part does not return the compliment. It is not subtle enough to stretch her. At the Hampstead Theatre until January 2</p>

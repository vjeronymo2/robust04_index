			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Fazekas-Sumegi-Varju: "Parties' Expressions of </F> Support, Condemnation"]    [Excerpt] In the "Sunday News" radio program, Sandor  Lezsak, managing director of the MDF [Hungarian Democratic  Forum], answering questions from listeners about the dismissals  at the radio, answered that the attacks related to the  dismissals started immediately. Critics questioned the  qualifications of managers and editors, he continued,  who--having taken the places of the fired persons--have not had  a chance to prove themselves.    In his opinion, it is necessary to wait until the newly  appointed editors show evidence that they are truly rendering a  public service and consider providing unbiased information to be  their primary task. Speaking to the reporter, he said: "I  understand you people, you find it very difficult to work, but  from what I've seen, work is continuing at the radio and the  mood is good."    Answering a listener's question about the MDF surpassing (to  quote verbatim) the previous government's "villainy," Lezsak  announced that it is symbolic of the degree of press freedom  that such statements were being made into the "Sunday News"  program's microphones.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   The Executive Committee of the KDNP [Christian Democratic  People's Party] judges the reduction in force, which is a  necessary evil that seems to be inevitable for financial reasons  and which was planned already before the system change, the same  way that it regards the similar forced steps taken by any other  institution. However, at other institutions workers do not have  the possibility of representing their interests in the domestic  and international press. The KDNP rejects the assumption that  the dismissals were initiated by the government. It considers it  unjustified and harmful for political parties to try to  interfere directly in the internal affairs of the radio. In its  opinion, the statement of the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party]  and the SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats]--which noted that if  they win the election they will rehire the fired workers--is a  mockery of media freedom. The Christian Democrats hope that the  time of direct party direction and intervention in the life of  institutions has passed. "There must be no returning to the  past!" ends the KDNP's statement.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   Limiting freedom always begins with limiting freedom of the  press, said Alajos Dornbach at the SZDSZ's political talk show  on Saturday, kicking off their campaign. According to the  National Assembly vice president, the government allowed its  vassals to take these steps. They are afraid of a leftist  danger, and at the same time they are centralizing mass  communication so that people will not be able to choose among  the various parties. Ivan Peto said that the government has  ensured that the Democratic Charter's protest, which is planned  for 14 March, will have plenty of substance. Gabor Fodor called  the events a blatant political cleansing. In his opinion, once  the new government takes over, Gabor Nahlik and Laszlo Csucs  [acting presidents of Hungarian television and Hungarian radio,  respectively] will be out in a matter of seconds. They have  proved themselves to be politically biased and professionally  unsuitable, so there can be no confidence in them. He also  brought up the government's responsibility, saying that it  pushes ahead using Csucs and Nahlik as battering rams. At the  news conference after the meeting, Ivan Peto expressed the  opinion that the people who were fired had played a much bigger  role in creating freedom of information that the people who  fired them. He called it regrettable that journalists must be  afraid if they or their information sources say anything  critical of the government. He added at the same time that no  one has ever been able to win elections by such means. "However,  we do not want the government to help the SZDSZ's campaign to  achieve success by such means," he added with irony.    The IDE [Youth Democratic Association], the SZDSZ's youth  organization, notes with outrage the fact that political  cleansing has taken place at the public-service Hungarian Radio.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   At a news conference over the weekend, Istvan Csurka  expressed the opinion that the firings at the radio were an  important step toward creating freedom of the press. According  to the chairman of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party (MIEP),  if this step had been taken in 1990, the country would be in a  completely different situation.    Csurka also announced that with the support of 88  organizations and parties, the Hungarian Way Circles Movement is  organizing a friendly protest in the interest of a free  Hungarian press on 15 March at 1400 in Szabadsag Square.  According to him, the reason they are not holding the  demonstration at the Petofi statue is that Lord Mayor Gabor  Demszky simply rented the square from midnight on 15 March to  midnight the next day.    The MIEP chairman dissociated himself well before the fact  from any provocations that may occur, saying that in today's  situation such an event can only be held amid great danger. In  connection with the recent events at the radio, Zsolt Lanyi,  chairman of the Budapest branch of the FKGP [Independent  Smallholders Party], who supports the 15 March protest,  announced that his party considers the radio to be too  pro-government. MIEP Spokesman Bela Gyori announced that on  Friday several people broke into Laszlo Csucs's office and,  while he was in the government's office, they purportedly  smeared his chair and desk with feces. According to Gyori, the  perpetrators are known, but he was not willing to betray their  names.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   The Agrarian Alliance considers the dismissals at the radio  to be the newest evidence of the mockery of press freedom and of  the grinding into the dust of nonpartisan and objective  information. With these steps the government and the vice  president of the radio, who has full presidential power, have  violated their constitutional duties. For this reason the  Agrarian Alliance calls on Prime Minister Peter Boross to  initiate Laszlo Csucs's immediate dismissal and to ensure  personnel measures that will regain the people's trust.    There is democracy in Hungary, but we will only have proof  of  this after the election, when it will become clear whether or  not the political line that misuses its power suffers a failure,  emphasized Republic Party Chairman Janos Palotas on Saturday  evening at a citizen's forum in the country seat of Vas County.  In his opinion, the chiefs of the national media cannot set  their judgment above that of the nation; that is, if six or  seven times as many listeners or television viewers want to  listen to or watch a program than the number that do not, then  no one can take this right from them. Those who were dismissed  generally prepared such programs, he emphasized.    Speaking of the dismissals at the radio, party Chairman  Zoltan Kiraly stated at a meeting of the MSZDP [Hungarian Social  Democratic Party] in Komlo that when dilettantes get into  power--and this pertains not only to the radio but also to the  television--it is clearly their aim, and it is also in their  interest in terms of power politics, to get rid of talented  people who are good at their jobs.

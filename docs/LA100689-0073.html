			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION FOE CHOOSES JAIL OVER FINE IN ATLANTA CASE  </P> <P> Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry was fined $1,000 Thursday for an  anti-abortion blockade of a medical clinic during last year's Democratic  National Convention but opted for two years in jail instead.  </P> <P> "In good conscience I cannot pay the fine," said Terry, 30, who while acting as  his own attorney during the trial, argued that he had the right to break "man's  laws to uphold God's laws by saving unborn children."  </P> <P> Terry was convicted by a jury Sept. 29 in Fulton County State Court of trespass  and unlawful assembly resulting from a demonstration at the Atlanta SurgiCenter  in July, 1988. The demonstration resulted in the arrest of 139 anti-abortion  activists.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1,100 Arraigned  </P> <P> Since that incident, another 1,100 activists have been arraigned for a series  of similar demonstrations in the city, and officials estimate that police and  court costs to the city are running in the millions of dollars.  </P> <P> The charismatic leader and his anti-abortion group have blockaded hundreds of  clinics nationwide and have been embroiled in more than 150 trespass court  cases. An estimated 28,000 to 35,000 protesters have been arrested. Last month  he was acquitted by a Los Angeles jury of trespass charges stemming from  blockades at two women's clinics. He is due back in Los Angeles in December to  face conspiracy charges.  </P> <P> In Atlanta, Chief Assistant Solicitor Robert Lee O'Brien, whose home was  picketed by anti-abortion demonstrators during the trial, had asked the court  to give Terry two years in jail, the maximum penalty. However, Fulton County  Judge John Bruner suspended the jail term on condition Terry pay a fine, stay  out of the Atlanta area for two years and not violate any Georgia laws.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Not a Criminal'  </P> <P> Terry told the judge: "I'm in your hands. I've requested no fines or  imprisonment. I am not a criminal. I was there for the purpose of saving  babies."  </P> <P> Bruner, who had continually admonished Terry for trying to make abortion the  issue, shot back: "I won't be preached to." O'Brien said Thursday, "Terry told  me in court that I had blood on my hands for prosecuting him and that God would  punish me, but never once did he deny the criminal trespass charges."  </P> <P> O'Brien said Terry would serve his time at one of the county's jail work camps  where "they spend a lot of time breaking up rocks."  </P> <P> Terry had tried to argue that his actions were intended to save lives of the  unborn, but Judge Bruner ruled that he could not use the necessity defense  because it did not pertain directly to the charges.  </P> <P> Operation Rescue officials say that they will appeal the conviction.  </P> <P> Asked who would lead the organization's rallies if Terry decides to stay in  jail, Operation Rescue official Joseph Foreman, said: "Sometimes you can lead  better from jail than other places. . . . If people care, it is far more  effective than an appeal."  </P> <P> Bob Jewitt, Atlanta's Operation Rescue coordinator, said that they plan to jam  phone lines to city and county government offices in Atlanta to protest the  sentence. "We are already getting calls from all over America. The Christian  public is outraged. . . . He was railroaded."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Expects Fine to Be Paid  </P> <P> Patricia Ireland, executive vice president of the National Organization for  Women, which has battled Operation Rescue in court on numerous occasions, said  Thursday: "He clearly wants to play Daniel in the lions' den. His friends will  ultimately pay his fine, but in the meantime he'll get a lot of publicity."  </P> <P> Ireland criticized the judge for "merely slapping Terry on the wrist. Randy  Terry has become a symbol of anti-abortion extremism at its worst. In light of  this, he should have imposed a significant sentence because he (Terry) will  continue to harass clinics and the women who are exercising their  constitutional rights."  </P> <P> Carol McGraw reported from Los Angeles and Edith Stanley from Atlanta.  </P></p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: OTOB to launch option on power utility THE Austrian futures and options exchange, OTOB, is launching options on ordinary shares of Oesterreichische Elektrizitaetswirtschafts Verbundgesellschaft, the electricity utility, Reuter reports from Vienna. The OTOB said the company's shares would be the sixth in Austria on which call and put options could be bought or written. They would be launched on March 13, subject to bourse approval. Options are available on the OTOB on Creditanstalt-Bankverein preferred shares and ordinary shares in EVN, the utility, Lenzing, the textile and chemical group, OMV, the oil group and Wienerberger, the building group. The OTOB said it also planned to launch options on the real-time Austrian traded index (ATX), which currently covers 18 shares, in mid-1992. In the second half of the year it would introduce interest futures on a synthetic Austrian bund government bond. It said the new market had developed more rapidly than expected since its launch last October 4. On February 17, it posted a contract volume high of 16,850 contracts, comprising 14,510 calls and 2,340 puts.</p>

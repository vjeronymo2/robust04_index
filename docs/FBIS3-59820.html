I have received a variety of comments on this issue, which  is worth examination because of the place that Baghdad has  occupied in Arab literature. The names of al-Karkh and  al-Rasafah are mentioned in numerous creative works of verse and  in entertaining anecdotes. This is something that has aroused in  me the wish to tackle the various aspects of this issue, even if  with some brevity.    An interesting thing about the Arab conquerors is that  wherever they went, they took with them their nomadic character,  embodied in their camels, their date palms, and their Bedouin  traditions. They were eager to maintain their intellectual and  material contact with the desert. All peoples send their  children from the countryside to urbanized cities to learn  refined language and civilized ways, except for the Arabs, who  sent their children from urbanized cities to the desert to learn  refined language and the Bedouin ways of life. This is what the  Arabs did with the Apostle Muhammad, God's peace and prayers be  upon him, when they handed him over to Halimah al-Sa'diyah.  <H5>  Arab Strategy </H5>   When the Arabs established their capitals, they located them  on the brink of the desert, as in the case of al-Basrah,  al-Kufah, Wasit, Damascus, and al-Ramlah. This was part of the  Arab strategy developed by Abu-Bakr, the first caliph, may God  be pleased with him, when he instructed his commanders not to  allow water to separate him from the Muslim armies. This  strategy was the secret behind the impregnable Arab power. If  Arabs wanted to raid the enemy, they could catch him. But if the  enemy wanted to raid them, they withdrew into the desert's  belly, and so he could not catch them.    In accordance with this strategy, Caliph Abu-Ja'far  al-Mansur  built his circular city, Baghdad--the city of peace. He chose  for it the western bank of the Tigris River, thus letting the  river stand as a defense line separating his capital from the  other peoples to the north and the east and leaving his back  open to the desert. This is the geographic position of the  al-Karkh side, or of al-Karkh when approached from Baghdad.    But Baghdad's growth compelled its inhabitants to move to  the  opposite side of the river, or in the direction of al-Rasafah.  Soon, this side became the bigger of the two. Nearly two  centuries later, the caliphs moved their palaces and their  governments to this side of the river and allowed the circular  city that had been built by al-Mansur to disintegrate and  collapse, and to let all traces of its walls disappear. There is  no doubt that the circular city was not big enough to  accommodate the capital of a major empire, which Baghdad was  destined to be.    The transfer of government from al-Karkh to al-Rasafah was  politically and humanly significant, denoting the transfer of  the center of influence from Arabs to non-Arabs. Consequently,  the Tigris River protected the city's southern and western  flanks from the desert (Arabs) and opened it from the north and  the east to Iran and Central Asia. From that time on, the caliph  became a toy in the hands of non-Arabs. Perhaps we can consider  the move to al-Rasafah to be one of the biggest military  mistakes committed by the Abbasides. Soon thereafter, Hulago  invaded Iraq and found nothing to obstruct his way to an open  Baghdad.    This geographic position of al-Karkh and al-Rasafah has had  an important impact that has continued to exist to this day and  that has played its role in our modern history. The al-Karkh  side has continued to be inclined toward the desert. It has also  been the home of Arabism and Islam, whereas al-Rasafah became a  cosmopolitan city (multinational, multireligious, and  multiethnic). It became a haven for non-Arabs and foreigners, a  playground for entertainment and a place of song, dance, and  opulent and sophisticated living. This is the situation  currently. There is hardly a non-Arab and non-Muslim home in  al-Karkh, whereas al-Rasafah is divided into varied cosmopolitan  quarters. It has the Christian Quarter, the Jewish Quarter, the  Kurdish Section, the Armenian Camp, and so forth.  <H5>  Tolerance Versus Fanaticism </H5>   Lifestyles have also been divided along the above lines of  division. Al-Rasafah is characterized by tolerance, and al-Karkh  is characterized by clannishness and by clinging to tradition.  To this day, unveiled women have continued to avoid passing  through al-Karkh. When Salwa, my sister, went to visit our old  homes in al-Suq al-Jadid with her face unveiled, a storm of  protest rose against us, and my sister did not visit the area at  all for years. A similar storm rose when the quarter's  inhabitants noticed poet Naji al-Qashtini, my uncle, in a  carriage, with his unveiled wife sitting next to him.    We moved out of al-Karkh in the 1930s, which saw the start  of  the process of a class emigration. Many people, including my  father, may he rest in peace, noticed that the area's sternness  and clannishness were no longer compatible with the developments  of the time. So they sold their homes and moved to the new  development areas in al-A'zamiyah, al-Battawin, and al-Karradah.    However, the majority stayed. With time, al-Karkh turned  into  a stronghold of the advocates of pan-Arabism, such as  'Abd-al-Salam 'Arif, 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Arif, and Naji al-Suwaydi.    Inversely, leftist activity spread on the al-Rasafah side,  and it is from this side's school that numerous communist,  socialist, and democratic leaders graduated, such as Zaki  Muhammad Busaym and Husayn Jamil.    In 1958, 'Abd-al-Karim Qasim staged his coup, which resulted  a few days later in a bitter conflict between the Communist  Party and the Ba'th Party, and between the advocates of  separatism on the one hand and the advocates of Arab unity on  the other. In that conflict, Iraq, and the Arabs generally,  faced another chapter of the Karkh-Rasafah polarization.  'Abd-al-Karim Qasim, Wasfi Tahir, and al-Mahdawi were from  al-Rasafah and were supported by the advocates of regionalism  and the leftist philosophy. These men were countered by  'Abd-al-Salam 'Arif and al-Shawwaf from al-Karkh, and these two  were supported by the advocates of pan-Arabism and Arab unity.    There was some sort of a psychological conflict between the  two sides. Al-Rasafah people characterized al-Karkh people as  fanatic and savage, and al-Karkh people characterized the  Rasafah people as corrupt and dissolute. My father was from  al-Karkh and my mother from al-Rasafah. Whenever he got into an  argument or had a quarrel with her, he cursed the hour when he  married a woman from "that direction," which is the phrase the  al-Karkh people give to the al-Rasafah side. They even refuse to  refer to al-Rasafah by name, calling it "that direction."    This bias is, in fact, a part of the lengthy historical  development of the city of al-Mansur and al-Rashid, and of the  inflow of non-Arab and non-Muslim peoples to the al-Rasafah  side, which is open to the north and the west, and the inflow of  the sons of Arab tribes to al-Karkh, the side that is open to  the south and the west, i.e., to the desert.    This explains why the people of Najd have persistently  emigrated to and landed on the al-Karkh side. This side is not  only the closest to them, but is also the side of Arabism,  Islam, Bedouin values, and an absence of the elements of  diversion that are found on the other side. This is the answer  to my question as to why the Najd people settled in al-Karkh and  avoided al-Rasafah.    We encounter the reverberations of this makeup even in the  city's economic life. One secret behind al-Rasafah's expansion  is the presence of craftsmen's markets and vocational markets on  this side, in addition to the presence of government offices and  courts, of course. This is confirmed by the names of some of  al-Rasafah's markets, such as the Goldsmiths Market, the Weavers  Market, the Brass Founders Market, the Tailors Market, and the  Cobblers Market. Arabs despise crafts and vocations.  Consequently, no significant presence of such markets is found  in al-Karkh. What one finds there are some crafts that are tied  to Bedouin life, such as articles needed for camels and horses;  Bedouin clothes, such as robes, gowns, and headgear; articles  needed for tents, and similar stuff that is sold in 'Alawi  al-Hillah.  <H5>  One City </H5>   The two sides are not, of course, separated totally, because  they form one city. This city's caliphs and rulers have  constantly tied the two sides, first with one bridge and then  with two bridges, to which various modern governments added more  bridges. These bridges have played a major role in Baghdad's  social, literary, political, and even military life. Ibn Batutah  visited the city and referred to its two bridges, saying,  "Baghdad has two bridges tied in the fashion we described when  we mentioned the al-Hillah Bridge. People, both men and women,  cross them day and night. In this regard, they are on an endless  picnic."    From Ibn Batutah's description of the al-Hillah City Bridge,  we conclude that the Baghdad Bridge was built on a number of  vessels tied by iron chains to a wooden pole on each side, as he  says. As for his reference to an endless picnic, it reminds us  that the bridge area has continued to be to this day the area of  fashion, display, and watching. It is in this area that young  men watched young women. We conclude this from numerous literary  anecdotes.    It is said that 'Ali Ibn Jahm appeared before Caliph  al-Mutawakkil when he, 'Ali, had just arrived from the desert  and proceeded to praise the caliph with these coarse words:    "You are like a dog in your loyalty and like a billy goat in  butting heads with difficulties;    "You are like a bucket, may God preserve you for us, and  some  big buckets are full of sins."    Al-Mutawakkil was a wise man, who realized the man's poetic  potential and who, at the same time, realized that Ibn Jahm  meant well and that he was praising him in the ways he was used  to paying tribute in his Bedouin life. So the caliph ordered  that Ibn Jahm be given a home on the bank of the Tigris, right  next to the bridge. He then summoned the poet six months later  and asked him to recite some of his verses. Ibn Jahm proceeded  to utter this verse, which is truly famous for its sweetness:    "Deer's eyes between al-Rasafah and the bridge have hit me  with love from every direction."    All this change only six months after watching the eyes of  Baghdad's women! A lot has been said about these women's beauty.  Ibn Batutah drew attention to this beauty when he said, "Between  Baghdad's water and her air, feminine beauty arises." About  Baghdad's women, one poet has said:    "My heart yearns for its Baghdad and its Iraq; for its  gazelles and for the beauty in their eyes;    "They strut in paradise as if platonic love were part of the  city's qualities."    Narrators recount that a woman from the al-Rasafah side was  crossing to the western (al-Karkh) side when she was accosted by  a young man, who said to her, "God's mercy be upon 'Ali Ibn  Jahm." She responded, "And may God's mercy be upon Abu-al-'Ala'  al-Mi'arri." Then each went his way. People asked the man what  it was that he had said to make her give him this answer. He  said that he had asked God to have mercy on 'Ali Ibn Jahm, thus  reminding her of his verse, "Deer eyes between al-Rasafah and  the bridge...." She responded by asking God to have mercy on Abu  al-'Ala' al-Mi'arri, thus reminding him of al-Mi'arri's verse:    "Oh how sad, she lives nearby, but the path to her home is  strewn with horrors!"    Thus, the Baghdad Bridge was a playground for lovers,  flirts,  and for perfume and medicine vendors; a meeting place for ulema  and jurisprudents; and a pavement for Koran reciters and  beggars. But even beggars were of a special kind, according to  Abu-Ja'far Muhammad Ibn Ja'far al-Bur'i who has said, "I passed  by a beggar sitting on the bridge. He was saying, 'A poor blind  man.' I gave him a coin and said to him: 'You have wished me  nothing in return.' The beggar answered: 'For your charity, it  is: Have mercy.'    With time, the Baghdad Bridge gained extreme political and  military importance. Al-Mansur made the right strategic  calculations when he selected the location, considering that the  city is situated at the point that represents the shortest  distance between the Tigris and the Euphrates and at the center  of the route that separates the Syrian semidesert and Najd from  Kurdistan's mountains and Iran. For many centuries, the Baghdad  Bridge was the only crossing point between the eastern and  western sides of the Tigris. It is, of course, the crossing  point between al-Karkh and al-Rasafah, each of which represents  a human polarization point, as we have already pointed out.  Control of this bridge became a major mobilizational objective.  A number of skirmishes and battles were staged on this bridge,  and I was witness to some of them.    In the final days of Rashid 'Ali al-Kaylani's uprising in  May  1941, British forces approached the rebellious city. The Iraqi  military command hastened to fortify the bridge with some barbed  wire, machine guns, and one single, miserable tank. But the  bridge surrendered when al-Kaylani's government collapsed and  fled. The British then proceeded to open the route, through this  bridge, to send supplies to the Soviet Union.    The successive governments feared that the "savage" al-Karkh  people would cross into al-Rasafah (the seat of the government)  whenever a crisis developed. Thus, the government hastened to  secure the bridge with soldiers to prevent al-Karkh people from  crossing over when Rashid 'Ali al-Kaylani's government fell.  <H5>  The Al-Farhud Operation </H5>   The al-Farhud operation erupted in Baghdad. As a result,  some  people were killed and their homes and shops were looted,  because they were considered sympathizers with the British. I  was in al-Karkh at the time. So, I came out to watch this  al-Farhud that was running in the direction of al-Rasafah. But  police detachments, which had been deployed on the bridge,  opened fire in the air in a desperate attempt to stop the  "savage" al-Karkh people from crossing over to al-Rasafah.    The same kind of operation recurred in the 1948 uprising  against the Iraqi-British friendship treaty (the Portsmouth  treaty). This time, I was on the al-Rasafah side, and I saw the  police open fire on the al-Karkh crowds, also to stop them from  crossing to al-Rasafah. Blood flowed copiously on the Baghdad  Bridge. One of the people killed in that incident was Ja'far  al-Jawahiri, the brother of poet Muhammad Mahdi al-Jawahiri.  Ja'far's death was the occasion for a magnificent poem, of which  every educated Iraqi has memorized some verses:    "Do you or do you not know that victims' wounds are a mouth;  A mouth that makes no claims and that asks for no mercy; A mouth  that tells the starving destitute: Sacrifice your blood, be  generous."    I attended the funeral of Ja'far al-Jawahiri, and I heard  the  lines of people escorting the funeral reiterate in 'mass frenzy:'    "It was on the bridge, on the bridge; the battle took place  on the bridge."    This government fear of al-Karkh people has its historical  justifications. The al-Karkh side has often created problems for  the government, especially after numerous members of the 'Aqil  tribe settled in al-Karkh. In 1834, the 'Anzah tribe clashed  with the forces of 'Ali Rida Pasha, the Ottoman ruler, and  emerged from the battle triumphant. Consequently, the tribe  gained control of the entire area south and west of Baghdad and  camped in the area known as 'Akarkuf. As soon as the 'Aqil  tribe, which lived in al-Karkh, heard of the 'Anzah tribe's  victories against the Ottoman Army, it felt stronger and was  emboldened. So it rebelled against the ruler, took control of  the coffee shops overlooking the bridge, and cut off the bridge.  A heated, day-long battle then ensued between al-Karkh, which  was controlled by 'Aqil, and al-Rasafah, which was controlled by  the Ottoman forces. But the ruler's forces were not able to  prevail in that battle until they borrowed the British consul's  boat and used it as a military boat against the al-Karkh people.    In his book, "Social Glimpses of Iraq's Modern History," Dr.  'Ali al-Wardi says, "But something worse than the battle started  then. Soldiers rushed into the al-Karkh side to indulge in  whatever they wished to indulge in. So they plundered the  markets and set fire to them. Then they marched into homes and  started looting them. They then proceeded to violate women and  to offend them in indescribable ways. Women's screams could be  heard from the al-Rasafah side. In one scandal, an Albanian  soldier tried to rape a woman who resisted him, so he killed  her. The woman's body was taken to Shaykh 'Abd-al-Qadir  al-Kaylani's shrine and was deposited at the shrine's doorstep.  There, the head of Prophet Muhammad's descendants ordered that  she be buried as a martyr."  <H5>  A Little of What Baghdad's People Have Experienced </H5>   It seems that the al-Karkh side has also played the role of  safe haven and refuge for outlaws who have fled to the area and  from there to Bedouin tribes and to semidesert villages. Thus,  the authorities were unable to pursue and arrest them.    Saddam Husayn is, of course, considered a living example of  this fact. After he tried to assassinate 'Abd-al-Karim Qasim,  Saddam crossed to the al-Karkh side and fled from there to the  Arabian Peninsula and then to Damascus and Egypt. The same  happened with Mufti 'Abd-al-'Aziz Jamil Zadah, who led on 28 May  1832 the inhabitants of Qanbar Quarter of al-Rasafah in an armed  rebellion against the Ottoman ruler. At the time, Abu-al-Thana'  al-Alusi went to al-Karkh to urge its inhabitants to join the  rebellion. But the ruler's troops were able to suppress the  rebellion by turning their guns on Qanbar Quarter and setting it  afire. The soldiers then proceeded to loot the mufti's home and  to burn its library, which contained nearly 7,000 volumes.    When that uprising failed, the mufti crossed over to  al-Karkh  and took refuge with al-'Aqil tribe, which was able to smuggle  him, along with his companions, to the village of 'Anah on the  upper Euphrates River and the heights overlooking the Syrian  semidesert.    The Baghdad Bridge has witnessed momentous historical events  in its long history. It has its tragic aspect, which is embodied  in the massacres perpetrated on both its sides; in the  executions that have been carried out at its ends; and in the  suicides that some Baghdadi people (mostly women) commit by  jumping off the bridge into the river running under it. But the  bridge has its funny side also. Numerous jokes and anecdotes are  told about the bridge and about those who cross it, both man and  beast.  <H5>  Escaped Bridge </H5>   Frequently, the violent flow of the Tigris River during the  flood days in the spring have torn the bridge away from its  moorings and dragged it downriver, with the people atop the  bridge screaming and imploring heaven for their safety and the  safety of their bridge. The bridge used to be carried away by  the current for long distances before the authorities could get  hold of it and return it to its location. People used to bring a  band to the river bank to play certain tunes that were supposed  to return the bridge to its place, as if this bridge were a  living creature who could hear their tunes and respond to their  call. The late Haqqi al-Shibli told me that he saw the unmoored  bridge pass through the al-Karradah Quarter with amazing speed.  Suddenly, a man standing on the drifting bridge gestured with  his hand and called Shibli at the top of his lungs, telling him,  "O man whom I don't know and who doesn't know me, look at me and  tell my mother, may God have mercy upon your parents, that the  bridge got untied with her son on it and that he doesn't know  where he is going!"    Oh, what words with which to sum up the aimlessness in which  Baghdad's people have lived throughout their tragic history!</p>

According to information available to WELT AM SONNTAG, this  is the contents of intelligence service tape recordings and an  internal report sent to the German Government by the German  Embassy in Bulgaria. At the weekend, the German Government  expressed "dismay," and also concern about Zhirinovskiy's  threats. Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR) came  out the second strongest party in the December 12 elections for  the first freely elected Russian parliament since the  disintegration of the Soviet Union.    Zhirinovskiy made his threats to a German diplomat at Sofia  airport. It was there that on Thursday [30 December] the head  of the German Embassy's Consular Section in Bulgaria had  informed him of the Federal Government's decision not to grant  him an entry visa for Germany.    Following this decision, the Russian party leader threatened  the German diplomat that he would break off diplomatic relations  with Bonn. He furiously pointed out that there are still  Russian troops stationed on German territory. They would "not  be withdrawn." Instead, he would station "300,000 Russian  troops" in Germany, if he came to power.    The troops should "safeguard Russian compensation claims for  damage suffered in World War II." Germany would have to pay up  and would become "a poor country" as a result. He said that he  would insist that Germany return all the buildings that Russia  had put up in eastern Germany over the last 50 years. They  would be handed over to Russian industrialists.    Decisions made against him by the Federal Government, such  as  that preventing his entry, could lead to a "Third World War,"  Zhirinovskiy ranted, which would "completely destroy" Germany.    He said the German Embassy official could be sure to be  "liquidated" soon. He, Zhirinovskiy, has such good contacts  with Russian intelligence that he could make the official simply  "disappear."    The Federal Intelligence Service (BND) and the Federal  Office  for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV] have been asked by  the government to keep an even closer eye on the activities of  international right-wing extremists in Germany in the future.  Paul Muenstermann, vice president of the BND, which is in  charge of foreign intelligence, told WELT AM SONNTAG that his  office had, for instance, passed information on the activities  of the Russian right-wing radicals and their leader Zhirinovskiy  to the Federal Government. This particularly applies to any  direct contact that Zhirinovskiy has with German right-wing  extremists. The BfV was informed about the nature of such  contacts.    Christian Democratic Union [CDU] Secretary General Peter  Hintze told WELT AM SONNTAG that both the BND and the BfV would  have to obtain information with a view to a "right-wing  extremist international," which could become a threat to the  whole of Europe.    Juergen Ruettgers, the manager of the CDU/CSU [Christian  Social Union] Bundestag Group, told WELT AM SONNTAG:  "Nationalists, fascists, and right-wing extremists are trying  to set up a new cooperation network all over Europe, as has  become apparent by Zhirinovskiy's appearances before German  right-wing radicals." Right-wing extremism must be fought with  all possible means not only in Germany; the BND will also have  to step up surveillance of all right-wing extremist groups  abroad.    Zhirinovskiy has close links with German right-wing  extremists led by the chairman of the German People's Union  (DVU), Gerhard Frey. The DVU has a membership of some 26,000  and is considered to be the biggest right-wing extremist  organization in Germany.    The most spectacular joint appearance of Zhirinovskiy and  Frey so far took place on 2 October 1993 at a rally at the  Nibelungen Hall in Passau. In April 1993, at Zhirinovskiy's  invitation, Frey took part in the Russian nationalists' party  conference in Moscow. In his welcoming speech he called  Zhirinovskiy a great politician.    On Friday, a spokesman of the Australian Foreign Ministry  said in Canberra that Zhirinovskiy has canceled a scheduled  visit to Australia. He said this was due to numerous  appointments that he had in Moscow. If he had applied for a  visa, he would almost certainly have been granted one.</p>

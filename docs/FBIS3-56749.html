That was declared in an interview with INTERFAX by  Mikhail Gorbachev, the ex-Soviet president.    In his opinion, no one in the government is thinking about  what should be done next to advance the country, and for this  reason "we are doomed to political and economic drifting with  all the ensuing consequences."    He warned that if the country's leaders "disregarded the  popular mood, Russia would surely get into new serious political  troubles with adverse social effects."    However, he spoke out against returning the country to the  old system. In his words, the course towards a market economy  should be continued but substantially corrected.    He suggested for one that market relations should be  intensified at the small and medium business level and urged  passing tough anti-monopoly legislation.    "But there is nothing more important than to teach people  how  to live under market conditions, otherwise transition to a  market economy will be violent," Gorbachev stressed.</p>

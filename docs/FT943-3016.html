			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Sri Lanka in push to end war Sri Lanka's new government is making a concerted effort to end the civil war that has plagued the country since the mid-1980s, the coalition's newly appointed chief economic adviser said yesterday. 'We have to end this war. The prime minister is absolutely right in tackling that problem first,' said Mr Lal Jayawardena, who this week joined Premier Chandrika Kumaratunga's administration. Mrs Chandrika has offered to negotiate a peace settlement with the separatist Tamil 'Tiger' guerrillas fighting for an independent homeland for ethnic Tamils. Mr Jayawardena said Sri Lanka was spending about Rs20bn (Pounds 262m) a year on the war, the equivalent of 4 per cent of GDP, plus a further Rs3bn on war-related problems. The peace dividend could be substantial. A former treasury secretary, hedismissed suggestions that left-wing members of Mrs Kumaratunga's centre-left coalition could force adoption of socialist policies. The government would not change the previous conservative administration's labour policies, nor would there be any nationalisation or expropriation of private property. The government was committed to export-led growth including export-oriented services, he added.</p>

			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / International Company News: Dutch paper group swings into red KNP BT, the Dutch paper and packaging group created out of a big domestic merger earlier this year, swung into a net loss of Fl 16m (Dollars 8.2m) in the first half of 1993 from a pro forma net profit of Fl 161m a year earlier. The company said it would be taking an extraordinary charge of Fl 300m to pay for projects aimed at boosting profits and integrating businesses previously owned by the three merger partners KNP, Buhrmann-Tetterode and VRG. It blamed the downturn on a decline in sales and on lower selling prices. Turmoil in European exchange rates was a contributing factor. KNP BT warned in May that it had fallen into losses and that it would be making reorganisation provisions. Yesterday, the company - which is 17 per cent owned by the Canadian forestry group MacMillan Bloedel - repeated its forecast that it would be difficult to post a net profit before extraordinary items for the full year. All four of the group's business sectors - paper merchanting, graphic systems, packaging and paper production - posted lower operating results in the first half, with graphic systems and paper production showing small operating losses. Group sales were down nearly 10 per cent to Fl 5.9bn. The graphic systems sector was hit by a decline in sales in Europe as well as by the devaluations of the Spanish peseta and the Italian lira. In paper production, industry-wide overcapacity put KNP BT's margins under pressure, in spite of a decline in raw material prices. Part of the Fl 300m charge will be used towards the divestment of four graphic distribution companies in Europe and Asia, in line with an agreement made with the EC's merger authorities.</p>

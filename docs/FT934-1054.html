			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: The mysterious berry that brightens our yule-tide board - Cranberry jelly is a familiar accompaniment to Christmas turkey, but where is the fruit grown, and how? / Farmer's Viewpoint Christmas dinner would be the poorer without them. The turkey would look pale and uninteresting were it not for the dash of colour they provide; and their subtle taste enhances the flavour of the meat, which, lets face it, from modern fast grown hybrids can be somewhat bland. Yet, I confess that until a few months ago I had given them little thought. Subconsciously, I suppose, I had assumed they grew on bushes or briars like black currants or blackberries. But in spite of the fact that I had been farming for nearly 40 years and for most of that time had travelled around the world looking at farm crops whenever the opportunity arose, I was taken completely by surprise when I saw this one for the first time. I am referring, of course, to cranberries, or rather the jelly that is derived from them, large dollops of which I hope we shall all be enjoying next weekend. So, what is a cranberry and where does it come from? Six months ago I could not have answered those questions. Then I went to Canada and a few miles south of Vancouver in the delta of the Fraser River I came upon the first cranberries I had ever seen. For the cranberry is native to North America. Moreover it is one of only three berries originating from that entire continent - the other two being the blueberry and the concord grape. Given that turkeys also originated in North America it is reasonable to suppose that Red Indians discovered that cranberries complemented the flavour of the meat of the wild birds and passed on that culinary intelligence to early settlers as they explored and colonised. The history of the cranberry, however, seems less remarkable to me, a farmer, than its agronomy. For cranberries grow on what can only be described as low lying peat bogs. They are, in fact, perennial wetland plants and have a similar growing habit to heather. The plants have short, wiry stalks and in spring the pink flowers make cranberry fields look a little like flat grouse moors. But wild and natural today's cranberry fields are not. The bogs in which cranberries are planted are laser levelled and subterranean irrigation is installed to ensure that optimum soil moisture levels can be maintained at all times. And the roads between the fields are also most unusual. Because of the boggy nature of the land and the fact that heavy gravel and stones would sink into it the farm tracks are made of light lumber waste such as chippings and sawdust. They are also built up several feet higher than the low lying cranberry bogs. These high roads are needed for the cranberry harvest. When autumn comes the red shiny berries are ready to pick. A few for the whole fruit trade are carefully gathered by hand, packed in boxes and sent to market; but by far the majority of the cranberries grown in Canada and the US are used for processing into jam and jelly. These do not need to be handled so gently and growers have devised what must surely be a unique technique for harvesting them. Using the built up roads between the cranberry fields as dams each bog is flooded to a depth of about a meter so that water covers all the vegetation. A small, light, mechanised push tractor with a rotating metal reel fitted on the front is then driven down a ramp on to the bog of ripe fruit. The reel thrashes the plants under the surface of the water and knocks off the cranberries which float to the surface. A finished field it looks from a distance like a bog full of blood. The whole farming family then dons long salmon fishing type boots and leggings and goes down in to the flooded bog with a kind of flexible barrage. The barrage ahead of them, they push and shove the floating cranberries towards one corner of the bog where a rubber elevator, its base in the water, takes the fruit up into a trailer on the lumber waste road. The harvested fruit is then delivered to the processor. How much the crop was worth and what level of profit might be expected from it, however, remained something of a mystery to me. Growers were only too happy to talk about the costs and complications of producing cranberries but were a little coy about the returns. They told me, for instance, that the crop could only be grown successfully in North America and even there only in a few places where land quality and micro-climate were just right. And they reminded me that a crop with most of its sales concentrated into the few weeks before Christmas each year was bound to be volatile and high risk. But I suspect they might have been trying to head off possible competition. For they could not hide their obvious prosperity. As I spoon the delicious red jelly on to my plate on Christmas day, however, I shall not grudge them the profit they make from my enjoyment.</p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Matt Clark suspended pending further buy SHARES IN Matthew Clark were yesterday suspended at 470p at the company's request after the acquisitive British wines and mineral water company confirmed weekend press disclosures that it was negotiating for its second purchase this year. The company is thought to be in talks over Grants of St James, Allied-Lyons' upmarket wines business. A statement issued by the Stock Exchange confirmed that negotiations 'regarding the possible purchase of certain businesses' were under way. Matthew Clark refused to comment but the suspension lent credibility to the suggestion that any acquisition might be part-funded by a share issue. The talks come in the wake of the acquisition of Freetraders, the drinks wholesaler, which was funded by a Pounds 12.9 rights issue in June, and the purchase of Strathmore, the mineral water business, for Pounds 11m last year. Grants' wines business includes the Stowells of Chelsea box range, as well as the Piemontello and Black Tower brands. Grants also owns a wholesaling business which would fit well with Freetraders.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Firmino Lukamba, Voice of Resistance of the Black  Cockerel correspondent in N'Dalatando, reports that Popular  Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party combat  aircraft are currently bombing the civilian population in the  area. Lukamba says that the struggle for the control of  N'Dalatando involves the use of chemical warfare, leaving behind  a carpet of dead and wounded people, and destruction. The Armed  Forces for the Liberation of Angola Military Command in the  area, concerned with such a tremendous violation of the UN  charter, today requested that a UN Angola Verification Mission-2  commission be urgently sent to N'Dalatando to investigate the  matter. An officer of that command said that a government cannot  be allowed to massacre thousands of citizens in the name of  democracy.</p>

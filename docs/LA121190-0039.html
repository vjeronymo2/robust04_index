			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> PHAR LAP'S LEGEND LIVES ON IN AUSTRALIA  </P> <P> Earlier this year, I was showing an Australian visitor the main attractions of  Washington, D.C., and took him, of course, to the Lincoln Memorial. I said that  Lincoln was the most universally revered figure in our nation's history, and  asked him who would have a comparable stature in Australia.  </P> <P> The visitor didn't hesitate: "Phar Lap."  </P> <P> Indeed, there do seem to be more monuments in Australia to the legendary  racehorse of the 1930s than to any of the country's founders. His statue graces  the entrance to Flemington Race Course, site of the Melbourne Cup. The original  Phar Lap was stuffed by a taxidermist and is on display at a museum in  Melbourne, where it is a major tourist attraction. His heart has been preserved  under glass at the Australian Institute of Anatomy in Canberra. (Naturally,  it's a gigantic heart.)  </P> <P> Moreover, the death of the champion -- after an ill-fated trip to North America  -- still is a nettlesome issue here. On my first day in this country, the taxi  driver from the airport recognized my accent and talked at length about how  Aussies love Americans, how they've never forgotten that we were allies in  World War II, but added one small proviso: "We'll never forgive you for killing  Phar Lap."  </P> <P> No great racehorse has ever had a career so melodramatic. Phar Lap was bred in  New Zealand and entered in a yearling sale there. A scuffling Australian  trainer, Harry Telford, loved his pedigree, and persuaded an owner named David  J. Davis to make the purchase.  </P> <P> When Phap Lap arrived from New Zealand after a rough crossing of the Tasman  Sea, skin had been torn off his head and he limped out of the tight quarters he  had occupied on ship. Davis didn't want him, and so he leased him to Telford  for three years -- an agreement that would prove to be fateful.  </P> <P> Phar Lap -- the name means "lightning" in Sinhalese, the major language of Sri  Lanka -- was slow to bloom, but he won his last nine races as a 3-year-old and  was a popular champion by the time he was 4 and was preparing for the Melbourne  Cup. Bookmakers stood to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars if he won.  </P> <P> His groom, Tommy Woodcock, recalled the events of that week in a film interview  made shortly before his death a few years ago: "Mr. Telford got several letters  that they were going to shoot him or run him down in the road. One morning we  were going from the racetrack back to the stable and I happened to see this car  on the road. The car started, and I took Phar Lap to the corner and pushed him  to the fence. The car comes whizzing around the corner and all of a sudden a  gun comes out the back window and fires a couple shots. They missed by a couple  feet."  </P> <P> After that close call, Phap Lap went into hiding before the Cup and arrived at  Flemington under police escort 40 minutes before post time. The crowd roared at  his arrival, and roared even louder after he carried 138 pounds to victory in  the two-mile race.  </P> <P> Despite being burdened by crushing weights, Phar Lap won 15 of 17 races as a  4-year-old. As a 5-year-old, he won nine of 10.  </P> <P> By then, Telford's three-year lease had expired, Davis was in charge and he  chose to accept an invitation the trainer wanted to decline: to run in a stakes  race at the Agua Caliente track in Tijuana, Mexico, just south of San Diego,  for the then-incredible purse of $100,000.  </P> <P> Woodcock went with him on the ghastly ocean trip, but Phar Lap weathered it  well enough that he was able to win the Caliente Handicap in track-record time,  beating some of the best horses in North America. Now he was an international  hero -- American newspapers hailed him as the "Red Terror from the Antipodes"  -- and Davis was planning on running him in the United States, then in England.  </P> <P> Phar Lap, of course, never got that chance. Woodcock was looking after him in  Menlo Park, Calif., where, he said: "Early one morning he got a little sick --  just a little temperature -- but by the next day he was in terrible pain. It  was pitiful really, all the squealing and the pain he was in. I led him into  the box (his stall) and he let out one unmerciful squeal and died in my arms."  </P> <P> The next day, flags in Australia were flying at half-mast, and headlines in  newspapers said simply: "HE'S DEAD."  </P> <P> Who or what killed Phar Lap? After the earlier attempts on his life,  Australians were naturally conspiracy-minded, and a Melbourne reporter who  accompanied him on his North American trip reported he was killed by poisoned  balls of clay that were thrown through the window of his stall.  </P> <P> The truth probably was much less dramatic. Isobel Carter, Phar Lap's principal  biographer, researched the whole issue in depth and concluded that the horse  had eaten "highly fermentable green pasture" that caused his stomach to swell  and brought on a fatal attack of colic.  </P> <P> The mysterious circumstances only added to the Phar Lap legend.  </P> <P> "He came along in the Depression years and he was a symbol of hope and  optimism," said Gary Gray, who conducted the Tommy Woodcock interview and has  produced films on Australian racing history here. "He also told the world that  we could produce horses to beat the best, and we could do a whole lot of other  things too. We were not just a colony. Phar Lap was a symbol of our emergence  as a nation."  </P></p>

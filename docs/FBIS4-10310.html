			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Mexico City, 10 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The Special  Assistant Prosecutor's Office in charge of clearing up the  murder of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio reported  today that one of the suspects in the case was released with  reservations and that formal jail warrants were issued for two  others.    The Attorney General's Office of the Republic (PGR) added  that Jose Rodolfo Rivapalacio Tinajero was released under "legal  reservations," due to lack of evidence of his participation in  Colosio's murder, which took place on 23 March.    In an official communique, the PGR added that formal jail  warrants were issued for Rodolfo Mayoral Esquer and Vicente  Mayoral Valenzuela, as being probably responsible in the murder,  to the degree of co-participants as aides or accessories to the  crime.    The Mayorals, father and son, were acquitted on charges of  criminal association due to a lack of evidence; nevertheless, if  new evidence is found the case could be reopened for the same  crime.    Included in this case are Tranquilino Sanchez Vanegas and  Mario Aburto Martinez, perpetrators of the crime that took place  in Tijuana, Baja California State, in northwestern Mexico.    The four individuals remain incarcerated in the Almoloya  Penitentiary in the State of Mexico, 90 km from this capital  where they are to be processed. In the Rivapalacio Tinajero  case, the Attorney General's Office made him responsible for  incorporating Tranquilino Sanchez Vanegas, Vicente Mayoral  Valenzuela, and Rodolfo Mayoral Esquer into the group he  organized, apparently to keep order during the Lomas Taurinas  political event.

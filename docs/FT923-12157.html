			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / UK Company News: CRT ends year with Pounds 6.16m CRT GROUP, which as its name suggests is involved in consultancy, recruitment and training, lifted pre-tax profits by almost 13 per cent from a pro forma Pounds 5.47m to Pounds 6.16m in the 12 months to April 30. The year, in which turnover rose some 12 per cent to Pounds 43.5m (Pounds 38.7m), was the group's first in its current form. Having reversed into R Smallshaw (Knitwear), a textile manufacturing shell, it had spent Pounds 29m to date on acquisitions, Pounds 18m of which was raised in two rights issues. Mr Barrie Clark, finance director, said that all the main acquisitions 'had worked' and that the results were the proof. Earnings per share increased to 8.26p (7.22p) and a final dividend of 1.825p is recommended, making a total of 2.4p (2p), a rise of 20 per cent. With only two small acquisitions in the year - Doctus Consulting Europe and First Associates for a combined Pounds 200,000 - all growth was organic. During the year, the group was given a new structure, new operating and financial procedures and deferred considerations for past acquisitions were unwound so the companies could fit in the new structure. The main engine for the growth was the training division which contributed 90 per cent of the operating total from 47 per cent of total revenue. Consulting accounted for 10 per cent of profits from 13 per cent of revenue and recruitment only broke even on 40 per cent. The importance of training to profits skews the results to the second half, said Mr Karl Chapman, chief executive. He said that recession-induced weak demand lay behind the performances of consultancy and recruitment, adding that currently there was no sign of recovery in these areas and that he did not expect any within the next two years. Expenditure in the current year will be Pounds 5.45m. Mr Chapman wanted to raise the cost of competing with CRT and so was keen to gain BS5750 and Investors in People standards. Some Pounds 250,000 will go on internal assessors and Pounds 100,000 on multi-media technology.</p>

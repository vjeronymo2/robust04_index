Teams representing the three parties were meeting on Monday  afternoon to set up the four-way summit. "Preparations for the  summit are in progress," a spokesman for Constitutional  Development Minister Roelf Meyer's office said.    Mr Meyer was involved in discussions with ANC Secretary  General Cyril Ramaphosa.    The Transitional Executive Council's [TEC] management  committee adjourned early on Monday afternoon to allow  participants to take part in planning meetings.    A TEC management committee source said the discussions were  one prong of a two-pronged strategy to ensure there were free  and fair elections in Natal/kwaZulu. The other was security  force action.    The Mandela/De Klerk/Buthelezi/Zwelithini summit will be the  first face-to-face meeting of the four leaders.    It is being seen as a high-level attempt to arrest the  deteriorating security and political situation in the country  just one month short of the April election.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini by </F> Giovanni Minoli; place and date not given; from the "Mixer"  program -- live or recorded]    [Excerpts] [Minoli] Well, Mr. Fini do you consider it to be  a compliment or an insult to be called a fascist by Umberto  Bossi?    [Fini] I am indifferent to what Bossi says about me. It  almost makes me want to laugh.    [Minoli] Why?    [Fini] Bossi is a very strange character and his extreme  envy  has been demonstrated. [passage omitted] He tried to get votes  from the south, those votes which he now despises so much, but  the south sent him back to the valleys.    [Minoli] You said that Bossi reminded you of Hitler trapped  in his Berlin bunker, a man with delusions of grandeur and a  tendency towards suicide. Are you joking, he is an ally after  all.    [Fini] No, I am not an ally of Bossi.    [Minoli] But this a serious accusation.    [Fini] Yes it is, but it was also a form of revenge for me,  because he is always calling me a fascist [passage omitted]. I  am not in alliance with Bossi.    [Minoli] What is Bossi's worst defect?    [Fini] Well I think that he is too convinced of the  possibility of obtaining votes by shouting, and he shouts in  many circumstances and so he appears inadequate in his role.    [Minoli] Is there anything that you envy in Umberto Bossi?    [Fini] Not particularly. Certainly, some time ago I used to  envy his votes, but not now because I will obtain more votes  than him. [passage omitted]    [Minoli] What effect does Bossi telling his supporters not  to  vote for Silvio Berlusconi have on you as an ally?    [Fini] But as I have said for the hundredth time I am not an  ally of Bossi. [passage omitted] I am not an ally of Bossi  because no one could make an alliance with Bossi over two  fundamental questions: identity and solidarity. I believe that  this is embarrassing to Berlusconi -- Bossi's hostility is  embarrassing. Bossi set up the Freedom Alliance not because he  believed in it, but because he found that it was necessary to do  so.    [Minoli] Do you think that this continual exchange of  insults  is advantageous to the common cause?    [Fini] It is advantageous because whoever listens does not  vote for Occhetto [leader of the Democratic Party of the Left].  Perhaps he will vote for Fini. [passage omitted]    [Minoli] If you win, you say: no government with Bossi, but  each one for himself.    [Fini] I do not demonize anybody. If Bossi...    [Minoli] I want a precise answer. If Bossi were fundamental  in order for your alliance to govern...    [Fini] He must accept two questions which for us are more  fundamental than government: national unity and solidarity  between the north and the south. [passage omitted] I believe  that until 1938 fascism was useful for Italy, not good or bad,  but useful. [passage omitted]    [Minoli] Do you still believe that Benito Mussolini is still  the greatest statesman of the 20th century?    [Fini] In Italy certainly, without a shadow of a doubt.  [passage omitted]    [Minoli] You said; I am not a racist. Racism is an authentic  evil. However, you said that all forms of begging must be  suppressed. Who are these beggars?    [Fini] A beggar is not necessarily somebody whose skin is a  different color. Begging is a crime which must be punished in  some way. I do not believe that Italians like being disturbed  in certain circumstances. However, there is absolutely nothing  racist in my opinion. [passage omitted]    [Minoli] Do you believe in the death penalty?    [Fini] We have gone beyond this question. We used to ask  that an article of the military peacetime code which made  provision for the death penalty be applied. Today we no longer  ask for this, because that article has been abolished.    [Minoli] So you do not believe in the death penalty?    [Fini] No, I would be never be the one to push the button or  pull the lever. It is matter of conscience.    [Minoli] Do you believe in God?    [Fini] Of course. [passage omitted]    [Minoli] Do you really believe that as Berlusconi says there  is a communist threat?    [Fini] Yes, there is a danger represented by the Left.  [passage omitted] Myself and Silvio Berlusconi both consider  Achille Occhetto an enemy to be defeated. [passage omitted]    [Minoli] In a few words, what does it mean to be right-wing  today?    [Fini] It means having a nonmaterial view of life. It means  having a conception of a fully functioning state which  guarantees rights and fulfills its duties. It means having an  idea of nationhood under which all those who live in a certain  territory are governed by one state. [passage omitted]    [Minoli] Berlusconi is an ardent supporter of the free  market. Is there not a true fundamental incompatibility on the  subject of principles and values?    [Fini] No, there is no incompatibility. Berlusconi is  certainly a supporter of the free market. I believe that the  free market is indispensable, but that it should be equal, and  therefore a market which makes guarantees for small and  medium-sized businessmen. [passage omitted]    [Minoli] Have you spoken to Silvio Berlusconi about this?    [Fini] We have not spoken about the issue concerning the  workings of the free market. I believe that he must explain to  me why he does not agree with me on this point.    [Minoli] Here on the "Mixer" program, Umberto Bossi said  that  the anti-trust laws which he had in mind would kill Fininvest.  Do you have any plans for passing anti-trust laws?    [Fini] No, I am not convinced that we need such laws.  However, I do believe that it is necessary to review the system  of television ownership in this country - both public and  private. [passage omitted] Above all it is important that both  private and public sector television are on an equal footing.  RAI has two elements compared to the private sector which make  it stand out. It has an income from the television license, and  if RAI closes its books in the red then the state intervenes...    [Minoli, interrupting] Yes but they are re-organizing RAI...    [Fini] It's an easy enough thing to do with our money.  [passage omitted]    [Minoli] So you do not believe in the privatization of RAI?    [Fini] Not at all; otherwise we would merely have a private  television system. [passage omitted]    [Minoli] What do you like most about Silvio Berlusconi?    [Fini] His sincerity because he is the type of person who  makes his feelings clear. I also think that he is successful  because in the past politics was all too often incomprehensible,  and he speaks about politics in a clear way.    [Minoli] What do you like about him the least?    [Fini] The fact that he is convinced that he is the center  of  the political universe. [passage omitted]    [Minoli] What are your defects?    [Fini] I have many defects. Sometimes I do not ask for my  rights strongly enough. [passage omitted] I have never called  you up asking you why you have never invited me on your show.    [Minoli] From a personal point of view, what is your worse  defect?    [Fini] Sometimes I am unable to express my feelings in some  circumstances. However, I do have feelings.    [Minoli] Do you think that Berlusconi is the Freedom  Alliance's candidate for the post of prime minister?    [Fini] We must let the electors decide. By voting the  electors decide what the make-up at the center of any given  slate is. [passage omitted] I believe that Berlusconi has the  capability to assume the role of president.    [Minoli] Do you want this?    [Fini] Let the electorate decide this. If the voters give me  more votes than Berlusconi, then why should I hold back?    [Minoli] Then you will be standing for president?    [Fini] No, I am not standing for the post. Let the electors  decide. [passage omitted]    [Minoli] Bossi said that he had formed an alliance with  Berlusconi in order to pry him away from Segni and Martinazzoli,  and also because he owns television stations. Why did you form  an alliance with Berlusconi?    [Fini] Above all because under a first-past-the-post voting  system one cannot waste time or energy. Not allying ourselves  with Berlusconi would have meant starting at a disadvantage.  [passage omitted] Forming an alliance with Berlusconi was a  political necessity. The system of proportional representation  no longer exists. Our alliance has become firmer because we  have points in common.    [Minoli] Do you consider the alliance to be a marriage of  love or convenience?    [Fini] Neither one nor the other. [passage omitted]    [Minoli] Do you believe in the idea of politics as a form of  marketing? Do you think that this is a step backwards or  forwards?    [Fini] I think that it is a tremendous step backwards. There  will be trouble if politics becomes a sort of market where one  trades what is in front of him. Politics is, above all, about  planning, it must be based on certain values and it must be a  concrete response to the problems of the people.    [Minoli] After the elections, what do you think must be done  about the Tangentopoli scandal?    [Fini] The first thing that I would do is to make the guilty  pay back every single lira that they stole. [passage omitted]  There are many people who would prefer to see them poor but free  rather than in prison for three months and millionaires. When  Tangentopoli is over we must rehabilitate those in power. At  present only the power of the judiciary is considered by the  Italian people to be credible. [passage omitted]    [Minoli] I will ask you a final question. Do you really  think that following the fall of the Berlin Wall and the  reunification of Germany, Italy should claim back Istra, Pula,  and Dalmatia as you have proposed?    [Fini] I did not say this. What I said, and I will repeat  this, let us not forget that those are Italian lands, in the  same way as Japan does not forget the Kuril Islands.    [Minoli] Not only does it not forget them, in the long term  it wants them back.    [Fini] Yes, but only by means of a treaty, by using  diplomatic means and by reaching an agreement with the other  country concerned which in this case is Russia.    [Minoli] In other words we are not going to war to get them  back.    [Fini] Not at all. We will never go to war to get these  lands back. Furthermore I will say something else. Let us be  careful before we send our soldiers to the former Yugoslavia.    [Minoli] Do you agree with this?    [Fini] It must be clear that all those who are shooting at  each other in the former Yugoslavia appreciate the presence of  Italian soldiers in the country. If there is just one faction  which says; we do not want the Italians, then it is better that  the Italians stay at home.</p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Haider plays xenophobic card in Austria: Right-wing party leader takes a hard line on foreigners MR Jorg Haider has Austria's political establishment running scared. The charismatic leader of the right-wing Freedom Party (FPO) is calling for a drastic change in Austria's policy toward foreigners and has set the government an ultimatum to accept a 12 point-programme on tougher immigration rules by November 15. If the Social Democratic Party and the conservative People's Party, the two members of the ruling coalition, do not submit, Mr Haider is threatening a nationwide petition drive. Representatives of all other parties, the big newspapers and the Catholic church have rejected his initiative and accuse him of inciting hatred and violence against foreigners. 'In contrast to Germany, our arsonists are not standing on the street, but are sitting in parliament,' said Ms Madeleine Petrovic, the parliamentary leader of the Greens. Mr Haider's 12 points include some measures the government claims are standard practice, such as the deportation of alien criminals, while others are policies that could not or should not be instituted, critics say. Mr Haider is calling for the halt of all immigration until the problem of illegal aliens in the country has been solved 'in a satisfactory way'. He also wants an amendment to the constitution specifying that Austria is 'not an immigrant country'. Both of these would violate international conventions and the rules of the European Economic Area treaty, which Austria signed earlier this year. Another proposal to limit the number of foreign students in any school class to 30 per cent could be achieved only by US style bussing in parts of Vienna with a high share of foreign residents. It would also affect thousands of children born in the country who have German as their mother tongue and are no different from Austrian children. Still, observers say the Freedom Party could collect as many as 1m votes, out of a population of 7m, feeding on the growing xenophobic sentiments in the country. Austrian law does not require the government to hold a referendum because of a petition. But a successful drive would put the two ruling parties on the spot. If they dismissed the initiative, they would open themselves to charges of ignoring the people's will. If they adopted any of the proposals, Mr Haider could claim a great political victory. Austria has not experienced the kind of right-wing violence against refugees seen in neighbouring Germany. But the influx of thousands of people from Eastern Europe and former Yugoslavia seeking asylum and work - 50,000 from Bosnia alone - has brought the question to the top of the political agenda. In a recent poll, 79 per cent said they do not want new immigrants. In the latest sign Austria is not immune to growing intolerance and racism in Europe, 80 graves were defiled in a Jewish cemetery in the town of Eisenstadt south-east of Vienna last Sunday. The populist Mr Haider has used real every-day problems and vague fears in the population for his political purposes and has made inroads into the other parties' voting blocs by appealing to xenophobia and racism. Last November, the Freedom Party achieved 23 per cent in communal elections in Vienna after campaigning on an anti-foreigner platform. This latest initiative comes at a time when the party's rise in the national polls has levelled off at about 17 per cent. Unwilling to stand still, Mr Haider is using the petition to step up his offensive against the ruling parties. In an effort to pre-empt him both the Social Democrats and the People's Party have shifted to the right on immigration issues. New laws were passed last summer to restrict the number of asylum seekers and foreign workers. Mr Erhard Busek, FPO chairman, last month demanded the deportation of thousands of illegal aliens. Mr Haider has even received support from Mr Helmut Schuller, director of the Catholic charity Caritas and a leading advocate of a liberal immigration policy. Other leading church representatives quickly distanced themselves from Mr Schuller. As always when he makes controversial outbursts, Mr Haider faces some dissent within his own party, although the number of credible opponents is small following a number of resignations and one sacking in the past year. Ms Heide Schmidt, a ranking FPO member of parliament and her party's presidential candidate last spring, is the most important remaining critic, but she has been pressured to withdraw her opposition to Mr Haider's latest campaign. Her likely departure from the party's leadership would remove the last internal resistance to Mr Haider's nationalistic course, but it may cost the party credibility, if not votes.</p>

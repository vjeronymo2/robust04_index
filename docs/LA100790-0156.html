			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VETO MESSAGE NEARLY A SHUTDOWN CASUALTY  </P> <P> President Bush wanted to veto Congress' stopgap money bill Saturday to  underscore his determination to shut down the government until a  deficit-reduction deal was done, but he apparently had trouble finding someone  to type up the veto message.  </P> <P> It seems the "non-essential" clerical staff had been sent home already.  </P> <P> At the White House, many of the offices were dark and tourists with tickets for  tours were left standing on the sidewalk as the impact of the budget breakdown  was felt.  </P> <P> When Bush made an unusual appearance at the White House driveway to announce  his rejection of the continuing resolution, he said he hadn't actually vetoed  it yet. "Need a typewriter in there to get it done," he said.  </P> <P> Later, his personal secretary, Patricia Presock, could be seen typing  frantically at her desk just outside the Oval Office.  </P></p>

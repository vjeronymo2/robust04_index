			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>   [Text] Soviet-time "red passports" expire on July 1 as the  government decided not to renew them, Prime Minister Mart Laar  told a government briefing on Tuesday.    All Estonian citizens should by now hold Estonian passports  and older people who have not obtained a new passport should  have no difficulties in receiving their benefits as post  stations would accept old passports as ID's, Laar said.    Laar also said that by September a booklet would be issued  for foreigners in Estonia where they can find information on  applying for a foreigners' passport, Estonian citizenship, etc.</p>

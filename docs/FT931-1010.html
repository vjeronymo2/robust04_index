			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Bank 'will not compromise' on new reports THE BANK of England yesterday said it would not welcome Treasury interference in the preparation of its new quarterly reports on Britain's inflation performance. Professor Mervyn King, the Bank's economics director, told a banking seminar: 'There is no way we will compromise on our judgment.' The Bank issued the first report last month, intended to stiffen anti-inflationary resolve by monitoring the government's progress in pursuing its 1 per cent to 4 per cent target. At the seminar, organised to explain the workings of the independent German Bundesbank, Prof King made clear he favoured greater independence for the Bank of England, although he said the Bank was not 'campaigning' for it. Asked about the Bundesbank's history of taking unpopular decisions which have sometimes unseated Bonn chancellors, Prof King gave an independent-minded quip at the expense of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer. 'Nothing could improve the popularity of the Bank of England more than being thought responsible for the resignation of the chancellor of the exchequer,' he said. Prof Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's board member responsible for economics, said countries with independent central banks were most likely to have lower inflation. 'It is amazing that comparatively few countries have so far decided in favour of the independence of their central banks,' Prof Issing said. On the subject of the Bank's inflation reports, Prof King said these studies  -with the Bank's new remit to produce price stability - were 'innovations for monetary policy in this country'. Prof King, responsible for the content of the reports, said he sent a first draft of last month's document to the Treasury for comment, partly as a 'courtesy' and partly because he expected some 'helpful' reactions. The Treasury made comments on largely technical points. 'Some were helpful, and some we didn't take on board,' he added.</p>

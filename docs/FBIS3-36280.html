			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Veronika Romanenkova] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 4 TASS -- The January 14 incident,  which occurred when Vasiliy Tsibliyev and Aleksandr Serebrov on  board Soyuz TM-17 spaceship flew over the Mir orbital station,  was described by Serebrov in an ITAR-TASS interview on Thursday,  as "normal" and the one which was to be expected. The spaceship  "touched" the station because "methods for maneuvers had not  been optimised on the ground". "Nothing would have happened if  methods suggested by us were used", he said.    A special commission inquired into the incident. It has  become known from reliable sources that a draft decision has  already been prepared and will be signed in the coming days.    Serebrov believes that the blame for the incident is  expected  to be laid on the cosmonauts, whereas only one member of the  commission met him to get first-hand information.    In the opinion of a number of experts, the psychological  aspect should be also taken into account because Tsibliyev and  Serebrov were due to return to the earth way back in November  but had their space mission extended by almost two months (in  all, they stayed in orbit for 197 days) owing to difficulties in  the timely supply of booster rockets. It was literally at the  last moment that the cosmonauts got an assignment to fly over  the station and photograph it.    "The value the orbital complex has grown very much of late.  Besides, it will be actively used to implement a Mir-Shuttle  international programme. Therefore it is necessary to be very  careful to rule out such incidents in the future," Viktor  Legostayev, deputy chief designer of the Energia scientific and  production amalgamation, told ITAR-TASS, emphasising that the  station, which has been in orbit since 1986, is very reliable  and withstood not only the contact but also a recent meteoric  shower.    Nevertheless, Tsibliyev's and Serebrov's work in orbit was  cited by space sector chiefs who attended a ceremonial meeting  marking the cosmonauts' return to earth. The chiefs thanked the  crew of the 14th main expeditlion for the succesful  accomplishment of all research and experiements and  congratulated them on being decorated with high state awards.    Tsibliyev will be 40 and Serebrov will be 50 later this  month.</p>

Modern billboards with a cardinal  bird, an attractive young woman, and seductive lips will  persuade the electorate of the importance of voting for the  Liberal Party candidates. Pedro Gomez was tasked with changing  the party's image.    [Begin Gomez recording] The goal is to motivate those who  are  liberal to participate, as well as to make them remember the  party's achievements. [end recording]    Beyond the red billboards, the Liberals have changed their  old hymn and put modern music to their messages on voting,  social welfare, and divorce. Things at the Conservative Party  are different. The day after tomorrow, Andres Pastrana will  make his presidential candidacy official, and the Conservative  National Directorate [DCN] is working full steam ahead on the  preparations for the 18 February convention, which will seek to  draft a platform for the candidate, who undoubtedly will be  Pastrana.    [Begin DCN member Cornelio Reyes recording] The name of  Andres Pastrana is gaining more supporters as the party, its  masses, and leaders are aware that he is the only viable,  possible, and winning option.

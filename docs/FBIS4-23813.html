			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Charmeela Bhagowat] </F>   [Text] Bold plans to control violence and crime and to  rebuild war-ravaged Reef townships were revealed by PWV  [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] safety and security chief  Jessie Duarte yesterday. In a report to the standing committee  for safety and security at Nasrec [National Exhibition Center]  near Soweto, Duarte said the creation of peace and the  rebuilding of communities on the East Rand were high on her list  of priorities.    Other priorities included the establishment of community  policing forums, car theft, rape, allegations of police torture,  and gun control legislation.    Duarte said the improvement of working conditions for  policemen and the upgrading of police stations were also  "absolute necessities".    "Job satisfaction is certainly not the motivating factor for  entering the SAPS [South African Police Service]. Rather, job  necessity seems to be the factor motivating people."    She added that solving the problem of disillusionment,  without looking at a programme of affirmative action for black  police personnel in particular, was not possible.    Duarte said efforts to stabilise the East Rand had already  begun, with the creation of an IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]-ANC  working group to look at the opening of "no-go areas", the  resumption of train services between Kwesini and Katlehong, and  the security of residents returning to their homes.    She explained proposals to reorientate members of  self-defence and self-protection units created to protect  communities and hostels. Duarte said a programme, organised by  the PWV MEC [member executive council] for education, had been  established to enable members of the units between the ages of  13 and 18 to attend six- month "reintegration school programmes"  to prepare them for admission to ordinary schools.    Members between the ages of 19 and 24 would be put through  adult literacy programmes and be assisted with job creation or  entrance to tertiary institutions.    And older members would be assisted in joining the police  force as reservists or organised into neighbourhood watch  programmes.    Duarte said that according to the defence force about 20,000  illegal weapons were in circulation on the East Rand and an  amnesty or gun collection campaign would retrieve only about 10  percent of the weapons.    One of the problems was community scepticism about the  police  force and the number of weapons illegally owned by criminals,  said Duarte.    The "unprecedented" increase in rapes and violent crime  against women had prompted the urgent need for members of the  police force to be trained to deal with victims, said Duarte.    She also proposed the creation of a commission of inquiry to  investigate police torture.</p>

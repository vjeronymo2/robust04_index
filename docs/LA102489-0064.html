			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: CHANGE OF SEASON TAKES TOLL ON ALABAMA RACING  </P> <P> Officials of Birmingham Race Course have learned the hard way that football is  king in Alabama.  </P> <P> Their summer meeting was so profitable that track officials decided to seek  permission to provide racing through December. Now they want to shut down Nov.  19.  </P> <P> "We will never race against football again," said Stanley Phillips, executive  vice president of Delaware North, which manages the track. "We made a mistake  by staying open after Sept. 9."  </P> <P> During the summer meeting, the track averaged $450,000 a day in bets for 75  days of racing. But during the first six racing days in October, the average  fell to $197,000.  </P> <P> "We've been trending downward and there's no sense fighting it," Phillips said.  </P> <P> Add horse racing: Ross Peddicord of the Baltimore Evening Sun on the beginning  of Arabian horse racing at Laurel Race Course in Maryland: "In the first  Arabian race, Burning Sand, one of the sport's top 3-year-olds (Arabians do not  race as 2-year-olds), was scratched in the paddock because of discrepancies on  his foal papers.  </P> <P> "It would be comparable to saying that a top thoroughbred 2-year-old, such as  Adjudicating, was not really Adjudicating, but a ringer, and finding it out  after he had already won four of six races and broken a track record.  </P> <P> "According to Patty Kolb, Laurel's identifier for both Arabians and  thoroughbreds, the discrepancies were not minor, but ones that any  conscientious official would easily pick up.  </P> <P> " 'The horse was registered as having four dark feet, but one foot was  striped,' Kolb said. 'He was listed as having three white snips on his nose,  but only had one. An identifiable cowlick was missing on his left side.' "  </P> <P> Last add horse racing: Birmingham wasn't the only track to feel an autumn  chill. Paul Moran of Newsday on the recently completed thoroughbred meeting at  Belmont Park:  </P> <P> "On-track attendance, during a meeting that saw the most important races of  autumn play to tiny live crowds, was down by about 5% to a disgraceful daily  average of 10,938 for the 42-day session. Handle, more than $108 million for  the meeting, was down by 7% on track. New York City OTB was off by about 2.5%."  </P> <P> Trivia time: Who was the only pitcher to win at least one World Series game in  five consecutive years?  </P> <P> Summing it up: Before Sunday's news conference during which postponement of the  World Series was announced, the Oakland Athletics and San Francisco Giants  worked out.  </P> <P> Manager Tony La Russa of the Athletics was saying that former USC star Mark  McGwire might eventually win a Gold Glove, when a grounder rolled through the  first baseman's legs.  </P> <P> "Nice play, Mark," La Russa yelled.  </P> <P> "There are 26 other managers I can play for," McGwire joked.  </P> <P> "And I make 27," La Russa shot back. "USC math."  </P> <P> There are, of course, 26 major league teams.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Allie Reynolds of the New York Yankees, 1949-1953.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Coach Buddy Ryan after his Philadelphia Eagles beat the Raiders  Sunday for their third consecutive victory: "Good teams win three in a row.  Great teams win four in a row." GARR KLUENDER  </P></p>

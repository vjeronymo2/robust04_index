			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Leading Article: A new target for inflation Sterling's expulsion from the ERM on September 16 1992 was followed by a typically British improvisation of a new framework for monetary policy. The time has now come to put that framework on a longer-term basis. Yesterday's figures for producer prices show why the counter-inflationary framework needs to be fortified. Output prices for manufactures were up only 0.1 per cent in November. But strong inflationary pressure is revealed in the 2.4 per cent jump in input prices over the month and the 7.9 per cent over the year. The more credible the framework, the easier it will be to hold the line on output prices. Credibility has not yet been achieved, however, as is shown by the gap between yields on index-linked and conventional gilts, now running at slightly over 4 1/2 percentage points. Similarly, yields on gilts are 1 percentage point above those on D-Mark bunds. The current framework has three principal elements: a target for the retail price index (less mortgage interest payments) of 1-4 per cent, falling to the lower half of the range by the end of the parliament; the Bank of England's inflation report; and the publication of the minutes of the monthly meetings between the chancellor of the exchequer and the governor of the Bank of England. This framework suffers from four defects: first, the chosen inflation index includes changes in indirect taxation, to which monetary policy should not normally respond; second, the range of 1 1/2 percentage points for the end of the parliament is too narrow to be consistently hit, given current knowledge, with potentially serious consequences for credibility; third, there is no target beyond the end of the parliament, within less than two and half years, while the lag between policy action and outcome is at least two years; and, finally, many financial contracts have a much longer maturity than the life of a parliament, which means the target's duration is self-evidently too short. The solution to the first problem is to switch to a target for what the Bank of England calls RPIY, which excludes indirect taxes. The solution to the second is to move to a range of 3 percentage points once more, but at a lower level, to reflect the fact that the annual rate of inflation is now substantially lower than the 4 per cent or so of late-1992. A sensible range would be 0-3 per cent. The solution to the third and fourth problems is to challenge the opposition to reject the proposed new target range. That would put Messrs Brown and Blair on the spot, since refusal would imply that they are inclined towards higher inflation. Ideally, however, they would accept it. Certainly, it would be in their interest to do so, since they too need low long-term interest rates. If Labour were to accept, the UK would possess a cross-party consensus on the long-term monetary framework. It would have reached that destination in a typically muddled way. But at least it would be there.</p>

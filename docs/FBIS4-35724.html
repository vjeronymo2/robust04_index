			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 2 Jun (MENA) -- In a statement today, 'Umar  al-Muntasir, Libyan secretary of the General People's Committee  for Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation -- foreign  minister -- said that "Libya is against secession in Yemen no  matter what the price." He said that Libya supports "imposing  unity by the force of arms."    Responding to a question on his opinion should the price for  forced unity be 50,000 dead, al-Muntasir said: "We support it  even if the price were to be 100,000 dead; we are unity crazy."  It is worth noting that al-Muntasir is participating in the  Nonaligned Movement Conference currently being held in Cairo.</p>

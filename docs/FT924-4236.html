			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Economic Viewpoint: EC - time for normal budget principles The economic generalist cannot hope to rival the knowledge of the enthusiastic specialist. But occasionally studies made by analysts of a relatively unbiased outlook come to his rescue. Thanks to a Chatham House study by Sir Michael Franklin and an Institute for Fiscal Studies one by Stephen Smith*, I am emboldened to enter the area of the EC budget, which has emerged as one of the most contentious issues for the Edinburgh summit, and express some ideas which are 'European' without being communautaire in the Brussels dirigiste sense. The EC budget is likely to amount to well over Ecu60bn in 1992. If you take off a fifth to convert it into sterling and add a fifth to convert it into dollars, you have a rough idea of its order of magnitude. It is limited to a ceiling of 'only' 1.22 per cent of the combined gross national product of the Community - a proportion of GNP representing 4p on the basic rate of UK income tax. The Common Agricultural Policy still accounts for the lion's share of Community expenditure, although it is down from 80 per cent in the 1970s to 58 per cent. But Sir Michael fears that it may not fall much further for the remainder of the 1990s, as the reduction of price supports envisaged by the MacSharry plan will for a time be more than offset by an increase in direct grants to farmers. The next largest item, accounting for nearly 30 per cent of the budget, goes to the Structural Funds, a combination of the Regional and Social Funds, the mere names of which cause Labour economic spokesmen to salivate with pleasure. The Regional Fund was originally conceived as a way of channelling money to the UK via its depressed areas. But the net gains turned out to be small and the Commission argued for greater discretion on the use of resources. Today Ireland is plastered with notices saying: 'This project is financed from EC funds.' The traditional revenue source for the EC budget, customs duties and levies on imports, now accounts for only a fifth of EC income. Some two-thirds of total revenues now come from cash payments from governments. Member countries are taxed partly by a so-called VAT levy. This is a misleading name for a tax based on the proceeds of an imaginary VAT with a yield of 1.4 per cent on an agreed standardised basis. The deficiency is made up by direct contributions related to GNP. The UK rebate is 66 per cent of the difference between its share of attributed Community expenditure and an adjusted version of its VAT contribution. Other members contribute to the rebate in proportion to their share of Community GNP, with an alleviation of a third for Germany. Unfortunately, a British proposal in the early 1980s to seek a budgetary safety net of general application was rejected. The sources of present tensions emerge from the table and chart. Luxembourg, which has the largest GNP per head by a suspiciously high margin, is a net beneficiary. The UK, with a slightly below-average GNP, is a net contributor even after the rebate. Spain has the biggest legitimate grievance. Its GNP per head is put at 75 per cent of the EC average. But its net receipts amount to less than 1 per cent of GNP, much less than that of the other poor countries and not much more than that of Denmark, which according to the official statistics, is the second-richest member after Luxembourg. All the main Efta applicants for EC membership, such as Sweden, Switzerland and Austria, are prosperous countries which should make modest net contributions. Czechoslovakia and Hungary could be financed from the net receipts of Efta applicants; and even Poland would not break the bank. The Commission disputes the whole principle of net balance. It is said to be impossible to put a cash value on countries' non-budgetary gains from EC membership. A more convincing argument relates to the 'Rotterdam effect'. The Dutch contribution, for instance, is inflated by customs levied on goods shipped through Rotterdam even if they are destined for other members. Even more to the point: CAP purchases to maintain prices in any one country benefit all EC farmers. The original Delors proposal was to increase the structural funds by about a half in net terms between 1992 and 1997 and increase the direct 'GNP' contribution. This would provide the resources for yet another instrument known as the Cohesion Fund for environmental or 'trans-European' projects in the poorest states. The pre-Edinburgh discussions look for a redistribution of expenditure and sources of revenue to rectify anomalies. The UK wants to maintain the present 1.22 per cent of GNP budget ceiling for another three years and then go up to 1.25 per cent in 1998-99. The Commission and the southern countries are prepared to stretch the timetable to 1999, but still want to increase the EC budget to 1.37 per cent. This is hardly the issue to turn John Major into a national hero. Would it not be better, as Franklin suggests, to have an explicit budgetary key in which a corrective factor would be applied to overrule unadjusted budgetary transfers when they produced absurd results. Mervyn King, the present economic director of the Bank of England, showed in an earlier incarnation that a modestly progressive system of EC net payments would make Spain by far the largest gainer, without the Spanish government having to build a single unwanted bridge or dam to extract the cash from Brussels. A corrective override would have enormous advantages. The Commission would no longer have, in Sir Michael's words, to 'propose programmes, sometimes of doubtful efficacy, as the sole means of achieving transfers to poorer countries'. Indeed a smaller budget could lead to larger redistribution - especially if the concept of negative payments were allowed. The UK and Spain would be treated under the same formula. What are the obstacles to such a single payments key? Above all it is the desire of the Commission and its sympathisers in member governments to increase the EC budget for its own sake as a communautaire gesture. This is paralleled by the so-called reflation initiative, in which all the emphasis is placed on spending increases, national and Community, when a better effect might be obtained by a temporary tax cut, and where the gains from international co-ordination would be clearer. A late-hour switch of UK attention from the size of the EC budget to an ability-to-pay formula would be regarded as an anti-EC gesture. But good ideas need not die and this one should be kept alive when it is discovered that neither Maastricht nor Edinburgh has solved the main problems of the Community. *The EC Budget, Royal Institute of International Affairs, London SW1; Fiscal Studies, Nov 1992, London WC1E 7AE.</p>

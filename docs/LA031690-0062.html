			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH / VIDEOS: TELLTALE SIGNS WARN OF PIRATED RENTAL TAPES  </P> <P> How do you know when you've rented a pirated tape?  </P> <P> If you're like most people, you don't, according to Mark Harrad, communications  director for the Motion Pictures Assn. of America. The discovery isn't made  until they put the tape on their VCR at home and are hit with the poor quality  of the sound or the picture -- fuzzy and blurred color.  </P> <P> But there are tell-tale signs to look for before you get the tape home, Harrad  said.  </P> <P> First, the label of a pirated tape looks handmade or Xeroxed. "If the ink  smudges or there's a black-and-white, typed label on a tape released by a major  company, it's possible the tape was illegally made," he said.  </P> <P> Second, if the cassette has a brand name -- like Scotch or Maxell --  prominently displayed, it may be a pirate. Harrad said that you rarely find the  tape brand name boldly showing on legitimate cassettes.  </P> <P> Once you get the tape home, there's another sign of an illegally made cassette  -- an excess of unused tape at the end. "If the movie is only 103 minutes and  there's 120 minutes worth of tape, you might have a pirated tape," he said.  "The video companies don't waste tape. When they have their movies duplicated,  they're not going to leave 18 minutes of unused tape. That's throwing money  away. But a pirate would leave that extra tape."  </P> <P> It's possible, Harrad added, that some of these signs don't mean the tape is  pirated. The retailer could have replaced a label that had been ruined somehow  or the tape could simply be defective.  </P> <P> Chances are that a large percentage of renters have rented a pirated tape.  Harrad said that 10% of all video stores deal in pirated tapes at some time.  Retailers either make the tapes themselves or buy them from pirates who sell  them at bargain rates.  </P> <P> Last year, the MPAA assisted law enforcement agencies in 227 raids,  confiscating more than 86,000 pirated tapes. Most of these raids were for  violations of the federal copyright law. But Harrad added that more and more  charges are being filed against pirates based on state and local laws.  </P> <P> Harrad said this record number of raids doesn't mean there's been an increase  in piracy. It's a result, he pointed out, of a larger investigative force and  more cooperation from state and local officials, plus more help from consumers  and retailers.  </P> <P> If you suspect a retailer of piracy, you can report it to the MPAA anti-piracy  hotline ((800) NO-COPYS or (800) 662-6797). MPAA investigators do not  immediately swoop down, Harrad said. They will watch suspect stores over a  period of time to make sure the complaint is justified.  </P></p>

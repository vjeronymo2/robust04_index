			<p>920328 FT  28 MAR 92 / Firm faces winding-up petition by Bank THE BANK of England is to seek the winding-up of Jackson Financial Services, an accountancy partnership in Sutton, south London, on the ground that it has been acting as an unlicensed deposit-taker, David Barchard writes. A petition for winding-up is to be heard in the High Court in June. Mr Philip Wedgewood Wallace and Mr Roger Smith, both partners in KPMG Peat Marwick, have been appointed joint provisional liquidators. A tip-off led Bank investigators to the discovery that Jackson was taking deposits from more than 100 customers. It is the 35th case in less than a year in which the Bank has moved to close an alleged unlicensed depositor.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Cables to anchor Pisa tower Scientists plan to anchor the Leaning Tower of Pisa to thick steel cables buried deep underground to help stop it tilting further. Mr Michele Jamiolkowksi, an engineer working with other experts to save the tower, said yesterday that work on the project would start next month. It would involve sinking 10 steel cables up to 50m below ground and anchoring them to a reinforced concrete neck that would be built around the base of the 14th century tower, which leans about 5m off the perpendicular. The scheme is a temporary solution until a more permanent way to stabilise the tower's famous slant can be found.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 8 KYODO -- A subcommittee of the ruling  coalition's tax reform panel came up with a report Wednesday [8  June] calling for administrative and fiscal reforms as a  precondition for a raise in indirect taxes, officials said.    The officials said the report focuses on reorganization of  92  government-backed corporations and administrative reforms of  local governments.    The document did not name those corporations to be abolished  or consolidated, they said.    The officials said the report stressed the need for the  government to push ahead with reform measures at both central  and local administration levels to line up public support for  tax reforms -- specifically a hike in the consumption tax rate  which now stands at 3.0 percent.    The panel laid down five principles for a thorough review of  government-backed corporations within fiscal 1994 to map out a  reorganization plan in the early part of fiscal 1995, the  officials said.    The principles call for corporations that have attained  their  goals to be abolished or scaled down and for those which are  unproductive to be reorganized, they said.    The report stopped short of proposing consolidation of six  ministries and agencies, including the Construction, Transport  and Agriculture Ministries and three agencies, saying simply  that the government should take a positive step on the matter,  the officials said.    The report called for restructuring of local governments to  reduce personnel and promote efficiency, they said.</p>

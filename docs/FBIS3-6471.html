According to Seoul radio, in a meeting with reporters on 15  March, Yi Yong-tok, South Korean puppet unification board  minister, made absurd remarks that the Panmunjom working-level  contacts for the envoy exchange would end in failure, that the  result of the contacts is unpredictable, and the like.    Puppet defense minister Yi Pyong-tae also openly talked  about  resuming the Team Spirit joint military exercise this year when  he met with the U.S. undersecretary of defense that day, saying  that the exchange of special envoys between the South and the  North was unlikely to be realized.    The puppets' insidious remarks of discouraging [chanmurul  kkionnun] the working-level contacts for the envoy exchange  vividly show that the Kim Yong-sam group has no will to discuss  pending issues between the North and the South.    It is entirely related to the South Korean puppet clique's  unjust behavior [pudanghan chosawa kwallyon toemnida] that the  North-South working-level contacts for the exchange of special  envoys, which have been resumed according to the agreement  reached in the New York contact between the DPRK and the United  States, went four rounds in March but failed to get anywhere.    The South Korean puppets' maneuver to create deliberate  obstacles [inwijogin nangwan] to the envoy exchange was utterly  proven in the seventh working-level contact. The South side  objected to our side's proposal for announcing a joint  communique informing that the two sides reconfirmed the will for  the envoy exchange and agreed to exchange special envoys at an  early date. It also blindly [toponoko] objected to our side's  suggestion that the issues of observing the principle of  national independence, deciding on the way of national  reunification, and promoting the great unity of the whole nation  be stipulated in the draft agreement with regard to the missions  of special envoys.    The measure our side has taken is a constructive  [konsolchogin] proposal that creates a significant momentum not  only for hastening the envoy exchange but for making a new  starting point in North-South relations and giving hope to all  compatriots who are concerned about the prospect of the envoy  exchange.    Nevertheless, the South Korean puppets are trying to prevent  the envoy exchange from being realized and are driving the talks  to a dangerous situation by stubbornly insisting that they  cannot accept the epochal measure proposed by us.</p>

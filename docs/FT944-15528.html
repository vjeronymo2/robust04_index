			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Precarious peace The Middle East peace process took another important step forward yesterday with the initialling of an outline agreement between Israel and Jordan. With the Hashemite kingdom now joining the Palestinians on the path completed only by Egypt, there is a mounting sense that the process is irreversible. Confidence would have been greater had it not been for events last week in Israel, where Palestinian extremists came alarmingly close to wrecking much of what had been achieved. The alarm is all the greater because the main proponents of peace knew all too well of the dangers in over-reacting to such calculated provocation. Hamas, on the one hand, and a Jewish extremist fringe on the other, have both shown this year their capacity for politically motivated murder. The terror attack by Hamas in central Jerusalem last week, and the subsequent kidnap and killing of an Israeli soldier, are part of a depressingly predictable pattern. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, is right to expect that the Palestinian police force should maintain order in the newly-liberated territories. But to attempt to link the future of the peace negotiations with the ability of the Palestinian police to prevent Hamas from committing acts of terror in Israel proper is dangerous. Although Mr Rabin and Mr Yassir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, find no pleasure in each other's company, they share a common objective in seeking to blunt the appeal and activities of Hamas in its bid to sabotage the peace agreement. To this end, the security forces of both sides need to co-operate, not to apportion exclusive responsibility and subsequent blame for security failures. At the same time, the two men need to work on limiting the appeal of Hamas to the wider Palestinian population, which means redressing the economic deprivation and political grievances that are still rife throughout the occupied West Bank and liberated parts of the Gaza strip. There is culpability on both sides for failing to move the peace process forward with greater urgency. Mr Arafat's reluctance to consult or delegate has delayed the creation of an effective bureaucracy, and with it hundreds of millions of dollars in international aid. Mr Rabin's desire to tie down every last detail of each accord in a way which stifles any sense of Palestinian self-determination has served to dissipate much of the goodwill that surrounded the initial breakthrough. Withdrawal of Israeli forces from the rest of the West Bank and elections for Palestinians to choose legitimate leaders are urgently needed. Israel should allow the elections fairly to reflect Palestinian opinion and should recognise their results, whether they legitimise Mr Arafat's leadership or replace him with others more capable of pursuing Palestinian aspirations. The practice of democracy can only assist peace. The agreement initialled in Amman yesterday has contributed to sustaining the wider momentum for peace, while continuing US efforts offer hope for progress between Israel and Syria. But events of the past week have been a reminder of how critical the core issue of Israel's relations with its Palestinian neighbours is to the entire fabric of peace.</p>

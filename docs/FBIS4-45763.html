			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Juan V. Sarmiento Jr.] </F>   [Text] President Ramos yesterday, lifted the ban on the  entry of industrial wastes into the country, aggravating fears  among environmentalists that this would open the floodgates to  the dumping of toxic wastes here.    Mr. Ramos has ordered the Department of Environment and  Natural Resources and the Bureau of Customs to lift the ban on  the importation of used plastics and paper wastes as well as  scrap iron and steel.    He also authorized the release of similar shipments which  have been held by customs authorities.    Mr. Ramos said exempting waste materials from the import ban  would help save dollars for the country and provide local  industries with cheaper raw materials.    "Such exemption is based on the economic impact such as  potential stoppage of the...industry operations due to  unavailability of process(ed) materials as well as potential  loss of foreign exchange," Mr. Ramos said in a memorandum to  Environment Secretary Angel Alcala and Customs Commissioner  Guillermo Parayno Jr. [sentence as published]    Alcala said plastic scraps are four times cheaper than the  plastic raw materials and that paper waste would reduce  dependence on virgin pulp taken from trees.    As for the iron and steel industry, Alcala said the local  supply cannot meet domestic demand of 500,000 metric tons a  year. The construction industry is the main user of iron and  steel.    Aided by the government's weak monitoring capability,  traders  have been shipping toxic wastes to the Philippines.    In March, a Greenpeace patrol blocked a Russian-registered  container ship, Gamzat Tsdasa, delivering 42 tons of toxic  computer scraps from Australia to Manila.    Greenpeace said computer scraps are often contaminated with  asbestos and other toxic materials.    Two months ago, another shipment of 45 containers of "PVC  scrap," a hazardous waste, from Germany was reported on its way  to the country.    Trade of hazardous waste is banned by the Basel Convention  on  the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes.    Maximo Kalaw Jr., president of Green Forum Philippines, said  the importation of hazardous wastes is also prohibited under  Republic Act 6969, also known as "The Toxic Substances and  Nuclear Wastes Control Act of 1990."    But Greenpeace said the, Philippines has been unable to  detect and intercept incoming shipments of thousands of tons of  hazardous wastes, including scrap metal, plastic waste, old  computers and lead scrap.    Greenpeace statistics showed that from 1990 to 1993, a total  of 64,385 tons waste were shipped to the Philippines from the  United States, Australia, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom.    Greenpeace described the Philippines as a "major dumping  ground of plastic waste" when it allowed entry to shipments of  18,000 tons of U.S. plastic scrap from 1991 to 1993.    The United States shipped 27,226 tons of scrap metal to the  Philippines in 1990 alone.    The United States has admitted dumping toxic battery waste  to  the Philippines and other countries.</p>

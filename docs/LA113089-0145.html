			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 36 ARRESTED IN L.A. PROTEST OVER EL SALVADOR  </P> <P> Thirty-six people were arrested Wednesday at the Federal Building in downtown  Los Angeles while protesting U.S. support for the government of El Salvador,  the second such demonstration and mass arrest there in a week.  </P> <P> Hours later, the Rev. Jesse Jackson offered his support to local opponents of  the Salvadoran government, who said they received death threats this week.  </P> <P> Workers at the Central American Refugee Center and priests at La Placita Church  said the threatening letters, which arrived Monday, were signed by a group  calling itself "The Catholic Anti-Communist Movement."  </P> <P> Over the last two weeks, Los Angeles-area opponents of the Salvadoran  government have held more than a dozen marches, sit-ins and candlelight vigils  to protest the assassination of six Jesuit priests in El Salvador and  continuing political violence in the Central American country.  </P> <P> Written in scrawled handwriting on notebook paper, one of the the letters  declares in Spanish: "All of you will die because you are part of the  (guerrillas). Just like they are destroying El Salvador, you will be  destroyed!"  </P> <P> At a press conference Wednesday at La Placita Church, Jackson linked the  violence in El Salvador to the Los Angeles death threats, which named Father  Luis Olivares and other clergymen at La Placita as potential victims. "Today,  priests are being killed in El Salvador and threatened in Los Angeles," he  said.  </P> <P> Jackson also reiterated his calls for an end to U.S. military aid to the  Salvadoran government of Alfredo Cristiani and for negotiations between the  government and the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.  </P> <P> "We have blood on our hands," Jackson said. "The American people do not know  that it is on the basis of our military aid that death squads kill people" in  El Salvador.  </P> <P> The Cristiani government, which is supported by the Bush Administration, has  denied that its armed forces killed the Jesuit priests.  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Council members Michael Woo and Richard Alatorre were among  half a dozen civic and religious leaders who attended the afternoon press  conference. Some of the religious leaders, including the Rev. James Lawson of  the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, were arrested earlier in the day  during the protest at the Federal Building on Los Angeles Street.  </P> <P> Demonstrators first gathered at the west entrance of the building, which they  blocked in last week's protest, but found the area taped off by officers of the  Federal Protective Service. The group then moved to the building's south  entrance on Temple Street, where some protesters chained themselves to the  doors.  </P> <P> Those arrested, including actor Martin Sheen, were cited for trespassing and  released, according to Mary Filippini, a spokeswoman for the Federal Protective  Service.  </P> <P> Sheen was among 64 who were arrested in last week's protest.  </P> <P> Two more protests are planned for the coming week, at the Federal Building in  Westwood and at the Salvadoran Consulate in the Westlake area, said Mary Brent  Wehrli of the Southern California Interfaith Taskforce on Central America,  which helped organize Wednesday's demonstration.  </P> <P> Olivares said his church will continue to support such protests despite the  latest threatening letters. He and other activists in Los Angeles first  reported receiving death threats in 1987.  </P> <P> Detective Steve Spear of the Los Angeles Police Department's criminal  conspiracy section said several individuals, all Salvadoran residents of Los  Angeles, have been "looked at and scrutinized" in the investigation of the  earlier and recent threats, but that no charges have ever been filed and no  arrests are imminent.  </P></p>

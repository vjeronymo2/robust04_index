			<p>BFN     [Text] Dear listeners, we now present a report on the  latest situation in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] and the  border between Armenia and Azerbaijan.    Although the mediation effort to find a peaceful solution to  the NKR problem is being maintained, Azerbaijan's military  forces have continued to fire on the Armenian positions at the  NKR front lines with various types of arms every day. We  already reported in our previous broadcasts that the Armenian  side wishes to remain committed to the agreement that has been  reached on a cease-fire. In fact, the Armenian defense units  have not returned the fire and refrained from retaliating  against provocative activities in Martuninskiy Rayon today.    Meanwhile, no incidents occurred on the border between  Armenia and Azerbaijan during the past day.    Azerbaijan's military forces attacked an area on Armenia's  border, which is only five km from Noyemberyan, the night before  last. An enemy battalion, supported by armored vehicles,  attacked the defense positions in the vicinity of [place name  indistinct]. A wave of artillery shelling preceded the  onslaught. The enemy units tried to approach the  Noyemberyanskiy Rayon center. They managed to advance in a few  areas. However, the Armenian border units repulsed their attack  at 0300 the next day. Azerbaijan's units were forced to retreat  after losing many men and military equipment. The Armenian side  also suffered casualties.    The Azerbaijani mass media organs claimed several days ago  that the Armenian military units penetrated up to five km into  the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. The objective behind the  dissemination of such unfounded reports is to justify the  Azerbaijani Military Headquarters' aggressive intentions.  However, the enemy side must realize that it will not be able  to achieve its objectives through aggression. Armenia's border  guards are capable of appropriate retaliation against the enemy  units.    Azerbaijan has been reluctant to relinquish its inauspicious  intentions. Consequently, innocent people have been killed or  wounded. How will the Azerbaijani Military Command Headquarters  account to the families of the troops who have been killed in  the latest clashes?</p>

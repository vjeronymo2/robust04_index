			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Financial Times Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (30): Postscript EQUITIES HAVE started to show their attractions again. The table indicates that many of those investors who opted for unit and investment trusts in 1992 did better than those who stuck with the building society. Over the year, the average gain among the international investment trusts, for example, was 22.3 per cent. That gain was helped by sterling's dramatic depreciation after Black Wednesday. But even in Britain, the average UK general unit trust rose 11.1 per cent. That return is effectively net, because basic-rate tax is deducted at source from dividends and few investors pay capital gains tax. Building society investors will have done well to earn more than about 7 per cent net over the entire year (based on Halifax BS figures). Glancing at the tables, 11 of the 14 unit trust sectors would have beaten the building society return, as would 10 of the 13 investment trust sectors. And looking back five years, any investors who were bold enough to buy trusts in January 1988 (right after the crash) will have made some very healthy profits: Pounds 1,000 invested in Foreign &amp; Colonial, the largest investment trust, would have turned into Pounds 2,559; the same sum in the Newton Income unit trust would have become Pounds 2,003. The biggest gains were obtainable in the Far Eastern markets. Oriental investment trusts which exclude Japan have shown an average rise of 44 per cent over one year and 186 per cent over five; among unit trusts, the equivalent figures are 36 per cent and 181 per cent. Whether investors will be lured into buying trusts by these performance figures is a difficult question. Many will have bad memories of having bought at the top of the market in 1987, and may be cautious about buying into equities at a time when the UK stock market is hovering around an all-time high (in nominal terms, at least). On the other hand, with returns on building societies now down to meagre levels, a higher-rate taxpayer can enjoy a better income from some unit and investment trust Peps than from cash. In the US, low interest rates have caused many investors to switch from cash to shares; perhaps their transatlantic cousins will follow suit. Those who like 'bottom-fishing' may be lured by the disappointing returns achieved in the smaller companies sector, where investor hopes were high in 1987. Smaller company shares underperformed in each of the years 1989-92. Some day they will recover, and unit and investment trusts will be the best way for small investors to take advantage. Many commentators are confident that the smaller companies revival will occur in 1993. Mind you, they said that about 1992 as well.</p>

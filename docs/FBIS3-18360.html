Diplomatic sources said the Finns had obtained a last minute  concession in the form of clauses safeguarding its market in  preserved fruit and vegetable against saturation by foreign  competition.    Talks had continued between EU and Finnish representatives  even though the negotiations had missed their highly-publicised  political deadline of midnight Monday.    The agreement followed that of Sweden earlier in the day,  leaving Austria and Norway's terms still to be finalised.  Finland and Sweden were seen as the least problematic  applications.    Talks were continuing late Tuesday on Austria's membership.  Norwegian negotiators, who walked out of talks earlier in the  day, had still not returned but had indicated they were prepared  to resume negotiations.    "It works with Finland, we are continuing with Austria,"  Kinkel told journalists. Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes  said EU officials hoped to reach agreement with Austria later  Tuesday.</p>

			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOBILIZING OF RESERVES A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY, DEFENSE CHIEF HINTS  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Tuesday that no decision has been made to  call up more reservists because of the crisis in the Persian Gulf, but he  hinted that it is a distinct possibility.  </P> <P> Noting that some National Guardsmen already are helping transport troops to  Saudi Arabia, he added: "With so many people going overseas, somebody is going  to have to take those places here in this country."  </P> <P> He also noted that the military relies on reservists for some specialized  skills that may be needed.  </P> <P> Asked specifically if the reservists are going to be mobilized, Cheney said  that no decision has been made "in terms of an overall call-up of the reserve  units." He noted that the President has the authority to call up 200,000  personnel for 90 days, and that could be extended 90 days.  </P> <P> Cheney added: "The fact of the matter is we have over the years built a very  heavy reliance on reserve units into our forces. The concept that Congress has  pursued in prior administrations is that certain key functions would be  performed or assigned primarily to reserve or guard units.  </P> <P> "The result is, for example, when you start to look for medical personnel,  you'll find an awful lot of those are reservists. The way you fill that kind of  need, in the event of a major deployment like this, is to call upon those  individuals."  </P> <P> He noted that some reservists were used in the invasion of Panama, adding:  "Lots of times we are able to do it on a volunteer basis. Just send out a  notice we need so many people of a certain type of skill, and in a relatively  small operation, that's adequate."  </P></p>

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bond strength fails to boost flagging equities - Market report The payroll and unemployment data from the US received a somewhat muffled response from the UK stock market yesterday. Share prices rallied from earlier losses but were drifting off again in thin trading at the close of the session. British government bonds had a firm session, although prices slipped off the top as US bonds reacted to the employment statistics. Early trading saw the FT-SE 100 Index extend its gain above the 3,100 mark, helped by a steadier bond sector. But London was clearly in no mood to move far ahead of the US employment statistics. Trading volume was poor. The market dropped sharply in its initial response to the US data and, despite the later rally, the market view was that the statistics will maintain pressure on the Federal Reserve to tighten policy again, perhaps after Tuesday's mid-term Congressional elections. The FT-SE 100 Index fell through 3,100 to touch 3,093.1, the day's low before rallying to close at 3,097.6, a net fall of 6.8. Traders admitted to a 'dreary day's business', although the analysts were busier as they scrutinised interest rate prospects on both sides of the Atlantic. The general view on near-term prospects for UK shares remained highly cautious. The more revealing picture of the day came from yet another fall in Seaq trading volume which, at a mere 509.5m shares, was about one third down on Tuesday's figure. Poor volume continues to present problems for the market although individual deals continue to provide profitability for the big names. A substantial placing in Forte shares was believed to have taken place outside the market. A leading US brokerage house told clients just before the London close to 'look for the Fed to raise rates next week by 50 basis points. Beware of central bank intervention if the dollar begins to weaken'. It expects strong growth in the US industrial sector which would put further upward pressure on US capacity utilisation, an area which has badly upset markets over the past couple of months. However, there was no sign yesterday of further intervention in the currency markets by the Federal Reserve. London securities houses were also cautious on the outlook for domestic rates, reminding clients that this week's inflation report from the Bank of England still leaves open the likelihood of a rate rise by, at the latest, the beginning of next year. However, on a brighter note, the president of the Bundesbank said in London that he saw no threat of inflation in Germany, and his comments were favourably received in the bond markets. The gilt-edged market was firm from the opening of trading and moved ahead sharply when the US Federal bond sector took the US employment data calmly. At best, the long-dated UK government bonds were around 7/8 ahead, although these gains were trimmed to around  9/16 by the close. Short dates also firmed as the expected timetable for base rate rises appeared to move back a shade. The Bank of England announced that it is issuing a further Pounds 700m in tranches of existing government bonds, to be available for trading from Monday. The broader range of the stock market continued to recover. Free from the influence of the dollar stocks and London's stock index futures markets, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index added 3.8 to 3534.6. Next week is likely to present further problems for global stocks markets in the form of the US mid-term elections, as well as a heavy list of auctions of Federal securities. These will lead the markets towards the next meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee on November 15 on which interest rate worries are now focused.</p>

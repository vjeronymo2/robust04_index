			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Albania stops second exodus More than 15,000 Albanians have been prevented from attempting to flee the country aboard ships at the Adriatic port of Durres, the authorities said. A police official in Durres said groups of young people had tried to make their way to the port area of the town, about 30km west of Tirana, in what looked like a repeat of an exodus in 1991 when thousands crammed on to ships to flee to Italy. Police said special forces had blocked roads entering Durres from the south and east, turning back about 15,000 Albanians in the last three days. Those turned away mostly came from the towns of Elbasani, Librazhdi, Fieri and Lushnja. Young people caught by police said they had heard rumours the port would open and ferries would be leaving for Italy. More than 20,000 Albanians tried to flee the country on ships in March and August 1991, following the collapse of 40 years of hardline communist rule. Most of them left on rusting ships moored in Durres for Bari and Brindisi in Italy. Italian authorities sent most of them back.</p>

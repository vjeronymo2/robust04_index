			<p>SUMMARY                              Seeking to exploit what he perceives to be a rift in the  coalition that liberated Kuwait, President Saddam Husayn has  presented the UN Security Council with a virtual ultimatum,  threatening implicitly that if it fails to take significant steps in  coming weeks toward lifting the sanctions, Iraq may cease to  cooperate with the UN Special Commission and adopt a confrontational  posture.  Coming amid signs that the sanctions are causing  increasing economic difficulties in Iraq, Saddam's move reflects his  impatience with the Security Council's failure to lift the sanctions  in response to Baghdad's diplomacy and selective compliance, his  desire to frustrate effective future monitoring of Iraqi weapons  programs, and his unwillingness to make further concessions in  compliance with UN resolutions -- such as recognizing the border  with Kuwait.                         END SUMMARY     In a 13 March speech, which Iraqi media played up as an ultimatum  threatening confrontation if a date for lifting the sanctions is not  set, Saddam demanded that the Security Council implement Paragraph  22 of Resolution 687 -- allowing Iraq to resume its oil sales --  "immediately and without any conditions."  He warned that if Deputy  Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz returns from the UN Security Council  session without the Council's agreement to activate Paragraph 22,  then Iraq's people and leadership would have "no choice but to  decide what they believe will give them hope . . . in the direction  they believe is sound" (Baghdad radio).     Media Highlight Speech     Tightly controlled Iraqi media immediately began to portray  Saddam's speech as an ultimatum and to prepare the Iraqi public for  confrontation.  For example:     -- The daily Babil, owned by Saddam's son 'Udayy, said that  Saddam's speech "defined the contents of the decisive Iraqi  confrontation with the enemies" (Iraqi News Agency [INA], 17 March).     -- The daily Al-Qadisiyah (See Note 1) claimed Saddam's speech  gave the Security Council "the last chance . . . to lift the  sanctions without delay or conditions" (INA, 15 March).     (Note 1) Around mid-September 1993, Al-Qadisiyah was removed  from the supervision of the Defense Ministry and affiliated with the  Information Ministry, which now controls this paper as well as Al-  Jumhuriyah (Al-'Iraq, 18 September 1993).  Probably more than an  economy measure, this change, made by a Revolution Command Council  decree, may have been designed to limit the political power of the  Defense Ministry.     -- Interpreting Saddam's speech as threatening an end to or  reduction in Iraqi cooperation with the United Nations, the Ba'th  Party daily Al-Thawrah said that if the Security Council does not  lift the sanctions, Iraq will choose "a new road, different . . . in  terms of its approach to [UN] resolutions and committees," a road  that will prove Iraq has "other options" aside from cooperating with  "colonialist interpretations of UN resolutions" (INA, 15 March).     Earlier Signs     Saddam had already foreshadowed a possible change of policy in  his 16 January Gulf war anniversary speech, in which he pledged that  "we will not relinquish our people in the northern part of the  homeland, nor will we stand idle toward the continuation of the  blockade and the violation of our sovereignty in southern Iraq."  In  that speech, he also warned "all evildoers, masters and satellites"  - and especially "some evildoers from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait" --  not to "miscalculate" because "the punishment of the criminals is an  eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth" (Baghdad radio).     Explaining the Shift     In his 13 March speech, Saddam explained that a shift from  diplomacy to confrontation may prove necessary because Iraqis who  advocated concessions seem to have been wrong while Iraqi hardliners  seem to have been right.  He said Iraq had "thus far" employed  "diplomatic efforts" to achieve "a better level of understanding by  the Security Council" because "many people in our country" had  "expected" that this policy "would make some people, whose hearts  have no feeling, show a flexible position and open the doors again  to the Iraqi people."     Saddam contrasted Iraqis who favored the diplomatic policy with  other Iraqis who were "quite convinced that the criminal level of  aggression and the way sanctions were implemented . . . came from  minds without any conscience."  He said these Iraqis, evidently now  including himself, believed that "despite Iraq's offers and  responses," its diplomats would discover that "there is nothing  being given in return" and that the Security Council's Paragraph 22  is being used merely as a "tactical cover to make Iraq fulfill its  obligations" while the Security Council fails to fulfill its own  obligations.     Minimum Demands     Indicating his minimum demands, Saddam castigated UN Special  Commission Chairman Rolf Ekeus for failing to provide a timetable  stating when the probationary period for monitoring Iraqi weapons  production would begin and end.  Saddam insisted that the Iraqis  must know when they can start selling oil so that they "will be able  to make their plans, see what they can do, and prepare themselves  psychologically and economically for the required duration."     Saddam also revealed his resentment that Ekeus was working to  turn UN Security Council Resolution 715 into an effective monitoring  instrument.  He claimed Ekeus had said that as soon as Iraq approved  of 715, he would write a report to the Security Council, but when  Iraq approved it, Ekeus said, in Saddam's words, "we must first  start monitoring and make sure that Iraq is implementing 715 the way  we want -- the way Ekeus wants  -- in order to make sure Iraq is  committed."  Saddam claimed that the probationary monitoring period  should have started as soon as the two cameras to monitor missile  testing were installed and turned on.     'Aziz Letter     In a letter to the UN Security Council president on 16 March,  'Aziz reiterated that Iraq "demands" that the Council apply  Paragraph 22 "immediately and without any additional restrictions or  conditions" and that it "reject the tendentious political  interpretations of its resolutions that some states are seeking to  impose on the Council."  Rejection of Iraq's demand, he said, would  "certainly lead to a reassessment of the situation and to an action  [tasarruf] that will protect the Iraqi people from the harm to which  they are being exposed."     Indicating that at least for now Iraq will not recognize Kuwait  and the Iraq-Kuwait boundary, as required by UN Security Council  Resolution 833, 'Aziz said that if the sanctions and the no-fly  zones are lifted, the issue of Kuwait "could then be discussed in  accordance with the rules regulating relations among states"  (Baghdad radio, 17 March). (See Box 1)     Perceived Rift     Baghdad appears to believe that now is an opportune moment to  exploit what it perceives as a serious rift within the alliance that  liberated Kuwait.  For example, the Information Ministry's  mouthpiece Al-Jumhuriyah has claimed that the United States has  become "virtually isolated in its calls for the continued  enforcement of sanctions against Iraq, particularly since it has  seen with its own eyes the disintegration of its international  coalition" (INA, 6 March).  Iraqi media have recently listed France,  Russia, and China as among the countries showing understanding for  Baghdad's position.  In a recent article, Saddam's press secretary  'Abd-al-Jabbar Muhsin advocated using a policy of "intimidation" and  "temptation," denying trade benefits, priority in debt payments, and  other benefits to "any country not currently adopting a just and  equitable stand" and offering corresponding benefits to countries  now helping Iraq to lift the sanctions (Babil, 24 February).     Information Ministry First Under Secretary Nuri Najm al-Marsumi  argued in Al-'Iraq -- the daily of the pro-Saddam Kurds -- that  Iraqi diplomacy and U.S. mistakes had helped create "a serious  fissure within the anti-Iraq alliance" and that "current  international and regional circumstances" provide Iraq with "a  serious and true opportunity for lifting the unfair embargo."  Therefore, he said, Iraq must "draw the world's attention" to its  determination and capability "not to remain idle" if the sanctions  continue and to its current "rallying" around Saddam "to thwart the  aggression once and for all and to achieve the decisive victory" (8  March). (See Box 2)     Implications     Saddam clearly is unwilling to recognize Kuwait, as required by  UN Security Council Resolution 833, unable to stay in power without  repressing his people, as required by Resolution 688, and surprised  by Ekeus' determination to treat Resolution 715 as an effective  means of monitoring Iraqi weapons.  Nevertheless, he seems to  believe that to protect his proclaimed status as "Iraq's historic  leader" and to avoid being perceived as weak, he needs to manipulate  the Security Council into setting a date for Iraq to resume selling  its oil.  He is therefore hoping that his threat to adopt a new,  presumably more confrontational policy will break up the U.S.-led  coalition and erode the sanctions.     If his ultimatum is rejected, Saddam will almost certainly feel  compelled to do something to carry out his threat.  He may be  content with an intensified propaganda campaign, directed in  particular to Arab and Islamic countries, and with repeatedly  threatening and then carrying out a gradual reduction or sudden  cessation in Iraq's present degree of cooperation with the United  Nations.  However, one cannot rule out Saddam's giving up on efforts  to lift sanctions and therefore seeking a victory in another area,  such as a move to regain control of Iraqi Kurdistan.                   Box 1:  Denying Kuwaiti Legitimacy     Saddam's consideration of a change of policy is based partly on  his unwillingness to go any further to comply with UN resolutions.  For example, Iraqi leaders and media have signaled their continuing  intention not to recognize the legitimacy of Kuwait, its government,  or its border with Iraq.     -- In an address to pro-Saddam foreign visitors on 18 January,  Saddam personally denied the legitimacy of the Kuwaiti rulers,  claiming that by their own actions they had lost the right to rule.  After accusing them of lying in 1990 in order to make the U.S.  public "accept the idea of war" against Iraq, he said that "when a  Muslim ruler lies, then he has lost every legitimate right to be a  ruler" (INA).     -- Commenting on Saddam's statement in his 16 January Gulf war  anniversary speech that "we will not turn wisdom into a prelude for  weakness and despair," Information Ministry First Under Secretary  al-Marsumi explained that, while "wisdom and necessity" have led  Iraq  to accept UN Security Council resolutions, Iraq will not simply  agree to "whatever it is asked for."  In particular, it will not  "guarantee the security of the bandits, the rulers of the Kuwait  governorate and Saudi Arabia" despite the fact that this is what  "the Americans want" (Babil, 2O January).     -- The practice of referring to Kuwait as the [Iraqi]  "governorate of Kuwait" has continued (for example, Al-Jumhuriyah  editor Salah al-Mukhtar in an article in Babil, 3O January; Babil,  1O and 12 February).  More recently, Saddam's press secretary 'Abd  al-Jabbar Muhsin has repeatedly referred to Kuwait as "Kazimah," the  Iraqi-imposed name for Kuwait City under the occupation (Babil, 10  March).                     End of Box 1                 Box 2: Economic Deterioration     Official efforts to prepare the public for a change in policy  have come amid signs of increasing economic deterioration that  Baghdad perceives as a threat to Iraqi steadfastness and morale.  For example:     --  A Babil editorial under a pseudonym used by Saddam's son  'Udayy castigated the Cabinet for decisions that allegedly caused  the dinar's exchange rate to plummet between September 1993 and  January 1994, thereby allowing Iraq's "enemy" to make "some gains in  the arena of the economic battle."  The editorial, citing a UN  statement that called for deferring any discussion of lifting the  embargo until Iraq's good will had been tested for a year, implied  that Iraq could not last another year unless the dinar's slide is  reversed.  It therefore suggested that the success or failure of a  ministry should be judged by its contribution to the strength or  weakness of the dinar (2O January).     -- Saddam's press secretary 'Abd-al-Jabbar Muhsin attacked "a  handful of misled Iraqis" who "raise prices whenever the enemy  escalates its onslaught and its conspiracies" and who have become a  danger to Iraqi "morale and steadfastness" (Al-Qadisiyah, 22  February).     -- The 1994 budget and investment plan was 25 percent below the  1993 figures (Baghdad radio, 29 December).

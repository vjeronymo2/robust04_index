			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report] </F>   [Text] Since the signing of the agreement with the PLO  there has been an increase in the number of stone-throwing and  petrol bomb incidents and a decrease in the number of shooting  and stabbing incidents: 180 petrol bombs were thrown in the  three months preceding the agreement, whereas 315 were thrown  since the signing of the agreement on 13 September. On the  other hand there has been a sharp fall in the number of shooting  and stabbing incidents. These figures were relayed from the  prime minister's bureau to Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu at  the latter's request. The Likud claims that the government is  hiding the figures in order to justify the claim that the  intifadah has subsided.</p>

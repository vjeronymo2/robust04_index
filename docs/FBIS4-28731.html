			<p>BFN     [Text] Kampung Gajah, Sat.-- The Government will take firm  action against the Al-Arqam missionary group, including  restricting its activities and possibly detaining its leaders,  Deputy Home Minister Datuk Megat Junid Megat Ayob said today.    He said the group's activities had reached a level which  could divide Muslims and create tensions in the country. He  said there were also elements of excessive devotion shown by  some Al-Arqam members who appeared to believe that the group's  leader Ashari Mohamed was the only person qualified to  administer the country.    "Such elements could create tension among the Malays and  cause fear among non-Muslims to the extent of undermining  national security," he told reporters after opening the Bukit  Chawi UMNO [United Malays National Organization] branch general  meeting here.    He said Al-Arqam had 10,000 committed members who were  prepared to do anything on the orders of their leaders apart  from 100,000 ordinary followers.    Megat Junid said Al-Arqam members had taken to calling  Ashari  "Abu Ya" (father) and were willing to do whatever he commanded  for fear of being accused as traitors.    The ministry was working with the Islamic Centre to  investigate the activities of Al-Arqam and 40 other missionary  groups from the social and security aspects before taking  further action, he added. He said the government assimilated  Islamic values without force and provided good models to let  non-Muslims make their own evaluation.    Asked whether Al-Arqam had been warned over its deviations,  he said the government was waiting for the result of the Islamic  Centre's investigation.    He said there had been occurrences of religious fanaticism  in  the past such as the destruction of temple images in Kerling and  the attack on a police station in Batu Pahat which led to deaths.    "So the government does not want the activities of Al-Arqam  and other missionary groups to cause a repeat of such  incidents," he said.    Megat Junid also revealed the activity of a missionary group  which practised recitations in candle-light and accompanied by  the playing of drums and clarinets.    "Members of this group include the wives of well-to-do  people  and businessmen," he added. He said the group was motivated by  self-gain and greed.</p>

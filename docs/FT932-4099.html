			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Gasholder damaged after bomb explosion ANTI TERRORIST squad officers joined police forensic scientists and an Army bomb disposal squad yesterday searching land near to a Gateshead gasholder which was damaged early on Wednesday by an explosion and fire, Chris Tighe writes. More than 400 people were evacuated from nearby homes but nobody was injured and there was no damage outside the site, the biggest gasholder compound in Tyneside. Detective chief superintendent Barry Stewart, head of Northumbria police CID, said the incident was being treated as a crime. It was too early to say how the explosion was caused. However, it resembled an explosion in April at the Esso oil storage terminal in North Shields for which the IRA claimed responsibility. British Gas Northern chairman Mr James Marris said it was very unlikely that the incident was caused by normal operations. The company confirmed that the intruder alarm had sounded. An off-duty British Gas employee living nearby raised the alarm and 80 firefighters fought the blaze for an hour. The gas supply to the gasholder was immediately cut off. The hole is now under water. It will be weeks before it can be examined. Earlier this year the IRA claimed responsibility for an explosion and fire at a gasholder in Warrington, Cheshire.</p>

			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Survey reveals flotation pitfalls MORE than 40 per cent of small companies quoted on the London Stock Exchange believe the disadvantages of flotation outweigh the advantages, a survey suggests. The survey reveals that many companies have not realised the aims that brought them to the market in the first place and some are now considering going private. The survey covers companies with a market value of under Pounds 30m. The findings will fuel concern that recent highs achieved by the market have prompted a large number of companies to float without properly thinking the decision through. 'Being quoted does not always turn out as managements thought or were led to believe. Although the majority of respondents thought being quoted advantageous, the realisation of the nature of the associated disadvantages seems to have been a shock,' the survey says. A total of 44 companies, all with substantial directors' holdings, responded to the survey commissioned by Rutherford Asset Management, which manages Pilot Investment Trust set up to invest in small UK quoted companies. It found that half of all respondents with a full listing want to reconsider their quotations. Also, 23 per cent of USM-quoted companies will reconsider the benefits of quotation, with half of these likely to go private. Only two of the 'important motives' for floating were achieved by more than 50 per cent of respondents.</p>

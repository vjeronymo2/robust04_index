			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: No fun for fund of funds A 'FUND of funds' sounds like the ideal unit trust for the first-time equity investor. The average investor is probably bewildered by all the different categories of unit trust - from UK growth to Australasia, from Japan to international growth. A 'fund of funds' allows the investor to leave that decision to the professionals, who select the best trusts from a company's stable in order to create a nicely diversified portfolio. However, what sounds good in theory has not worked so well in practice. Not one of the trusts in the sector has delivered a positive return to investors over either three or five years. The average 'fund of funds' has delivered a loss to its unitholders, even with reinvested income, over one, two, three and five years. Now Midland Bank has revealed plans to reorganise its Managed Portfolio trust, the biggest in the sector. Instead of investing in unit trusts the revamped fund, renamed Midland Balanced, will buy equities directly. As a consequence, it will be classed in the international balanced sector, rather than in 'funds of funds'. So what has gone wrong with the fund of funds concept? The main problem has been the depressed state of the world's stock markets. Five years ago, in the summer of 1987, shares were trading at then record levels, in the expectation of years of continued economic growth. Then came the crash of October 1987. In the UK, the main share indices are still no higher than they were five years ago; in Japan, they are considerably lower. There are few unit trust sectors which can show even half-way decent performance figures over five years. Just six sectors can boast that an average trust earned the investor a profit, and in two of those cases, Japan and north America, the overall return has been under 10 per cent. The best sector has been gilt &amp; fixed interest, where the average investor has returned 32.4 per cent over the five years to August 1. Managers of 'funds of funds' therefore have had the odds stacked against them. The only way they could have avoided a loss was by concentrating on a limited number of sectors. But many managers cannot do so - Lloyds Bank Mastertrust, for example, is required to hold at least 60 per cent of its portfolio in UK equities. Difficulties can also arise from the rule which prevents a 'fund of funds' from investing more than 20 per cent of its assets in an individual trust. This limits the manager's options, particularly if, say, he feels that gilts are going to outperform equities. Poor performance aside, there is another problem - the scope for double charging. In some cases, the investor pays an annual management charge to the 'fund of funds' manager, who in turn is buying units in trusts where a further annual charge is levied. At least the investor does not have to pay the manager's initial charge twice. The 'fund of funds' manager can normally buy units at the creation price, which is essentially the bid price plus the manager's cost in buying and selling shares (the market maker's spread, commission etc). There are 43 'funds of funds' in the sector with a total of about Pounds 770m under management on August 1. The revamp of Midland's Managed Portfolio, which had Pounds 272.9m under management, will reduce the sector by over a third. The size of Midland's fund's increased greatly in 1988, when the group launched unit trust personal pension plans. Most pension investors like the implied security and stability of a managed fund. But the result was that the Midland managed portfolio became the biggest single investor in many of the bank's unit trusts. If the managed fund then wanted to sell its holding, that caused terrible problems for the other unit trust managers. Under Midland's plan, the new Balanced trust will be established and holdings in Managed Portfolio will be transferred into it (subject, of course, to unitholders' agreement). Midland will also take the opportunity to streamline its unit trust range, with five other trusts (Meridian Growth, Meridian Income, International High Street, Capital and Smaller Companies) also being absorbed by the Balanced fund. Midland says the new Balanced fund will have greater flexibility than before and expects it to be the flagship of its unit trust range. Investors will certainly be hoping that the new structure will produce better performance than the old - Midland Managed Portfolio was bottom of its sector over three and five years.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FUNDS OF FUNDS: FIVE YEAR RECORDS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Trust                                  % fall  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Abbey Mastertrust                        -8.5 S&amp;P Masterfund                          -13.2 Lloyds Master                           -13.4 Kleinw't Master                         -14.5 Invesco Managed                         -15.9 Sun Life Master                         -16.8 Midland Managed                         -19.7  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

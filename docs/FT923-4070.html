			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Jobs: How to be an ever efficient worker - Evidence that vocation does not mix well with vacation, nor even with intermediary ingestion 'AM I contaminating you?', asked the Jobs column, just back at work from four weeks' leave. 'H'm,' said its partner Bill Hall, without looking up. 'I ask in the cause of serious scientific inquiry,' I persisted. 'H'm,' he replied, continuing to peer at his screen. What prompted my query was Diane Summers's report in last Thursday's FT on research by the Cedar International consultancy into the way holidays affect productivity. The broad finding - that the effects are dire - will of course be no surprise to anybody. But how dire they are came as a bit of an eye-opener. The productivity-dip is evidently so bad that for every working day we have off, our employer in effect loses two. Moreover, while it startled me, that estimate seemed perfectly plausible to psychologist Cary Cooper of University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. 'There's a sort of holiday infection that contaminates everyone around the person who has been away,' he explained. Hence my question to my partner. After all, if I was contaminating him, the best way to reduce the productivity damage would surely be for me to go on holiday again until his next break was due. Alas to judge by the response, far from being infected, he hadn't even registered that I was back. Whereupon I lapsed into silent contemplation of another of Professor Cooper's ideas. It's that we would do well to stop having a long holiday once a year and instead take shorter breaks more often. The result, he thinks, would be less preoccupation with preparations beforehand and less rustiness afterwards. So the cost in lost productivity to our employers would be lower while we'd be just as well recuperated. Well, while that's perhaps so in broad terms, personal experience again rebuts it. Whatever lengths of holiday the Jobs column has taken - ranging from three days to six weeks - the productivity losses have been much the same, and the recuperative effects barely if at all detectable. But, as a one-man sample is no test of any hypothesis, I raked through the paper mountain that used to be my desk seeking research on shorter holidays. Unfortunately, the only example I could find concerns an extremely short one (although some make it last far longer than others): namely, the lunch-break. It crops up in an article by Peter Wright of Edinburgh University in the British Psychological Society's latest journal. Here is Dr Wright's account of various researchers' findings on the effects of lunch-breaks on productivity. 'Errors of shift workers show a sharp increase at 2pm as do instances of falling asleep at the driving wheel and other measures of driving efficiency . . . . Blake (1971) reported a performance de-crement after lunch on a wide range of tasks - signal detection in a vigilance task, mental arithmetic, disjunctive reaction time, and card sorting.' Then, for good measure, he adds a stomach-churner (which I've italicised): 'Craig (1986) found a clear post-lunch dip in efficiency of detecting sensory events, but no change in performance when food was not consumed.' So it seems that, if efficiency's the aim, we should not only take shorter holidays, but stop eating between work-stints to boot. HAPPILY another kind of hunger - the jobs-famine - is at least slightly eased by a post in Abu Dhabi offered by recruiter Andrew Duncan for an international investment concern. Being unable to name it, he promises to abide by any applicant's request not to be identified to his client at this stage. He seeks an information technology specialist to take charge of systems development. So candidates need management skills besides full technical knowledge of IT applications outside as well as in the investment field. Salary about Pounds 75,000 tax-free. Family housing among other typical expatriate perks. Inquiries to Andrew Duncan Associates, Oxford House, Oxford Rd East, Windsor, Berkshire SL4 1EF; telephone 0753 832144, fax 0753 832166. NOW to the underlying table giving a selection of the latest indicators of world-wide living costs compiled by P-E International management consultants. Anyone wanting the full survey, which covers many more places than the 60 I've included and costs Pounds 310, should contact P-E's Simon McBride at Park House, Wick Rd, Egham, Surrey TW20 0HW; tel 0784 434411, fax 0784 471404. The cost indices all refer to specific cities instead of countries as a whole, and are based on prices in London at 100. Alas, owing to problems in devising an internationally consistent measure of housing costs, they are omitted. Another snag is that, since such surveys are time-consuming exercises, the findings are not bang up to date. The price-levels reflected by the index figures are those which prevailed last April. Even so, the inflation rates are the latest available, and the indices are calculated at the exchange rates in force on August 31. To update for subsequent changes, take the exchange rate in the table, divide it by the later rate, and multiply the result by the table's index figure.</p>

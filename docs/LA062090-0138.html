			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MANDELA RECEIVES HERO'S WELCOME ON ARRIVAL IN N.Y.  </P> <P> Nelson Mandela took New York City by storm today, riding up Broadway in a  bulletproof glass "greenhouse" as a sea of confetti rained down and hundreds of  thousands of New Yorkers cheered and shouted, "Keep the pressure up!"  </P> <P> The extraordinary outpouring of goodwill delighted the 71-year-old Mandela, who  arrived weary and reportedly feeling faint from an exhausting world tour aimed  at keeping up the pressure on white-ruled South Africa to end apartheid.  </P> <P> The South African black nationalist leader declared that he knew he had friends  in New York but never dreamed he was so loved. His weariness seemed to melt  away amid the cheers.  </P> <P> Mandela arrived with a message of hope. In prison for 27 years until February  and still unable to vote in his own country, the deputy president of the  African National Congress declared that he can now see "light at the end of the  tunnel" for an end to apartheid.  </P> <P> The ethnic mosaic of New York paraded in front of him as he made his way up  Manhattan's "Canyon of Heroes" -- the traditional parade route for a hero's  welcome here -- in the "Mandelamobile" specially designed to protect him.  </P> <P> Set on a blue flatbed truck it looked like a greenhouse or even a  picture-windowed guardhouse. It was a far cry from the open car used in past  ticker-tape parades by such figures as aviation pioneer Charles A. Lindbergh  and the astronauts who went to the moon and a clear sign of the nervousness of  a security-conscious era.  </P> <P> A 30-foot-long papier-mache Chinese dragon snaked its way up lower Broadway to  welcome Mandela, followed by Irish bagpipers, American Indian dancers, South  Korean drummers, Kurdish dancers, Formosans, Jews, Arabs, Italians, Ethiopians,  African-Americans and Polish marchers to name a few.  </P> <P> Crowds were 10 and 12 deep on the sidewalks. The cheering was non-stop. A sea  of confetti, ticker tape, streamers and even toilet rolls rained down on the  parade. Some of the signs used to hail Mandela were clearly used before. On the  back of one sign denouncing apartheid was a demand that Britain leave Northern  Ireland.  </P> <P> It was a day for vendors selling buttons with Mandela's photograph, his name  and his cause. "Free Man -- Nelson Mandela" and "Free at Last" were but two  available.  </P> <P> The crowd was joyous and unrestrained in its enthusiasm. Mandela waved and  flashed a broad, open smile as he sat next to his wife, Winnie, and New York  State Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and New York Mayor David N. Dinkins, the city's first  black mayor.  </P> <P> People perched on the tops of skycrapers and in windows for a glimpse of the  extraordinary scene. There was so much confetti thrown that it looked as if New  York had a snowstorm in June.  </P></p>

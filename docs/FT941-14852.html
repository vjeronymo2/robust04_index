			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: Falling debt lifts Union Carbide in final quarter Fourth-quarter profits at Union Carbide were comfortably ahead of market expectations, thanks to falling debt and the effects of cost-cutting, the US chemicals group said. Although its full results will not be released until the middle of next week, the company said earnings per share for the period would be about 25 cents, higher than most market estimates. It earned 23 cents a share in the previous three months, and 12 cents a share in the fourth quarter of 1992. Union Carbide said margins for some of its major products were lower than a year earlier, reflecting the continuing overcapacity in the chemicals industry. However, earnings were higher due to lower fixed costs and interest expense. The company has been pushing through a cost reduction programme designed to save around Dollars 400m a year, and had previously projected interest costs last year of around Dollars 75m, down from Dollars 140m in 1991.</p>

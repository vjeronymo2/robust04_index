			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MALATHION CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> I wonder if your readers in Medfly quarantine areas are aware of the state's  proposed spraying schedule for malathion. After receiving our notice that "your  area is being put on an approximate 21-day treatment schedule beginning with  this treatment," I called the California Department of Food and Agriculture.  </P> <P> The "21-day treatment schedule" means that we are to be re-sprayed every 21  days until March. Then we are to be re-sprayed every 14 days until June. After  that we are to be re-sprayed every 7 days until full eradication. And that  eradication is doubtful according to some of the scientists who helped develop  the original program (Part A, Jan. 11).  </P> <P> All this is to be done just so we can export our fruit to Japan without  treating it.  </P> <P> MITZI SHPAK  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

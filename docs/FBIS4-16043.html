			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Own correspondent" report under the general headline: "We </F> Must Not Become Hostages to Expediency. This Is Not in Russia's  and Ukraine's Interests"]    [Text] In the view of Admiral Igor Kasatonov, first deputy  commander in chief of the Russian Federation Navy, the Odessa  events amount to "a state armed action aimed against Russia."  If logic is to be followed, Ukraine, which is trying to justify  the actions of special purpose unit members, should long have  commanded "Halt," the admiral noted. Events are unfolding  further, however; the Black Sea Division has been proclaimed  "Ukrainian," and by the time Adm. Feliks Gromov, commander in  chief of the Ukrainian Navy, comes to Odessa, Ukrainian flags  will be hoisted along with other trappings of "the  nationalization" of a Russian military unit. This "state  hooliganism" has also discredited even the date of Odessa's  liberation, and efforts to seize the hydrographic ship have  disrupted the navigation security system in the Black Sea, Adm.  Kasatonov stressed. Arrests and harassment of Russian officers,  and the sight of children wounded by splinters of broken glass  were characterized by Igor Kasatonov as "an unprecedented  action, in which the attacking side just waited for the Russian  side to fire the first shot."</p>

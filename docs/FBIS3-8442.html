Mr. Petre Roman, president of the Democratic Party  (National Salvation Front) [PD-FSN] presented this lecture,  while Messrs. Dan Amedeo Lazarescu, vice president of the  National Liberal Party [PNL], and Andrei Plesu, acted as  collocutors.    At the beginning of his lecture, Mr. Petre Roman referred to  an inescapable fact:    "Reform is our country's road beyond communism. Certainly,  all the former communist countries are experiencing a reform  process. For us and in general, reform means seeking economic,  social, and political normality, a normality of mentality,  day-to-day normality, and, in the final instance, normality from  a historical perspective. What is at stake is seeking not only  our initial normality. We also have to ensure a synchronization  with developments in the Western world and our entry into  today's flow of world history. This self- discovery may be  achieved not because it represents a recovery, but only because  it represents the key to our access to modernity. In this  century, Romania has run up a deficit of modernity caused by the  fierce struggle with the numerous vicissitudes of history. This  deficit exists and manifests itself in institutions with hardly  any power, in a faulty and often confusing operation of  democracy, in acute economic inefficiency, and in the  insufficient competence of the most dynamic segments of  practical activity. For those who love freedom, the way of  post-communist transition cannot be anything other than openly  moving toward the free world and then fusing with it (...)  Romania's integration into the free world is not an ideal, but  a tangible stage of our hopes. Our strength lies in the fact  that we are able to say what we are; and we would be more  powerful today if we clearly stated what we want to be (...)    "For us easterners, our mission is to reestablish and repair  the thread that was broken on the eve of World War II and  replaced, for almost 45 years, by communist integration with the  internationalist Gulag. Our country's totalitarian past did not  only mean lagging behind, but also being torn away from its  times altogether. We are able to demonstrate that communist  totalitarianism isolated us compared with the progress made in  the free world. Because it was utopian, communism felt  threatened by everything that was real and thus became obtuse  and terrorizing."    Referring to Romania's economic situation between the two  world wars, Mr. Roman specified the following:    "The statistics demonstrated that the main influence on the  rhythm, proportions, and structures of the economy was exerted  by the process of expanding the free market, a process that was,  however, characterized by a hesitant liberalization practice."    He specified that "the statistics on our country's economic  situation revealed disturbing facts: Both at the end of the  inter- war period, and in 1989 -- after 45 years of communism --  Romania ranked 23d out of the 24 European states. In 1989, the  country's GNP was 3.5 times lower than the European average.  Also in 1989, for one GNP unit Romania used to consume 10 times  more prime energy than Western European countries. During the  25 years of Ceausescu's dictatorship, $230 billion was injected  in our economy, which ranked 23d in Europe in terms of  efficiency. Given the injection into the economy of such  important sums of money, it would have been absolutely normal  for economic efficiency, in general, to come close to the  European average, something that was not even achieved in, let  us say, the better periods of the dictatorial regime. (...) The  communist regime, specifically the Ceausescu one, made Romania  lose out on the great and truly revolutionary changes in Western  society. I am talking of the technological revolution both in  industry and agriculture of the 1960's, the revolution of  inexpensive energy and the technological economizing on energy  of the 1970's, and, finally, of the data processing revolution  in the 1980's."    For Romania's integration into the free world, it is  necessary, in Mr. Petre Roman's opinion, to take a number of  measures: "Genuine national policies have to be put into motion,  policies with precise aims, meaning primarily restructuring and  privatization to ensure efficiency; conversion to eliminate  waste; and adjustment and training to improve competence. We  are no longer allowed to neglect, by any means in our political  activity, such key words in the modern world as profitability,  efficiency, efficient management, and productivity. It is clear  that only economic freedom can ensure efficiency; exercising  this freedom, however, should not generate unbearable effects  for numerous people. (...)    "Thus we favor a competitive and equitable economic order.  To overcome our historically accumulated economic and social  deficit, Romania needs to adjust its economic credit, for a  relatively short time, to the development model based on  intercorrelated strategies. Namely: Obtaining resources for  financing credits; giving an impetus to all kinds of investment;  the development of markets to encourage profitable investment;  and a selective and dynamic role of the state in managing and  guiding the development process."    Summing up the ideas of his lecture, Mr. Petre Roman  formulated the following objective: "Economic reconstruction and  political democratization to ensure genuine national  sovereignty." He stressed that without assistance on the part  of the free world, Romania will not be able to integrate into  Europe and recover.</p>

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Management: Cultural revolution in Whitehall - Following last week's White Paper, Peter Norman looks at the Treasury's plans for reform Sir Terry Burns, permanent secretary to the Treasury, feels rather like a harassed home-owner who started some necessary repairs and has found more and more problems that need solving. What began in early 1992 with an internal enquiry into the style, workload and external image of Whitehall's pivotal ministry has burgeoned into a drive for management reform and a crusade to change the Treasury's culture in readiness for the 21st century. Reform is in part externally generated. The Treasury, which oversees the government's economic and budgetary policy, is having to adapt to decentralisation and delegation among its 'client' ministries in Whitehall. Even before last week's White Paper for restructuring the Civil Service, the creation of more autonomous bodies such as next step agencies, and the questioning of traditional civil service activities were forcing the Treasury to change its ways. More subconsciously, the Treasury is trying to put five difficult years behind it. It has been blamed for policy failures such as the early 1990s recession and Britain's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism in September 1992 and accused of failing to understand the needs of British business. It has problems of sagging morale. Earlier this year, an attitude survey of its 1,400 staff revealed deep unhappiness. While senior officials complained of long hours when these were spent on unnecessary work, staff lower down feared for their jobs in the event of contracting out activities to the private sector and market testing. Add to all this, the launch of the fundamental review of the Treasury's spending and running costs - announced in the November 1993 Budget - and the scene is set for a large-scale, internal shake up. Change at the Treasury 'is like starting work on part of your house where you can see it needs a significant effort, and finding that is just the beginning,' Sir Terry says. 'You start wanting a new kitchen, and you suddenly discover you need new wiring. Change becomes more difficult because the scale of it increases.' Sir Terry likens the Treasury's functions to those of a head office in a company. Spending decisions, for example, are decentralised in other departments, leaving the Treasury to hold the ring and ensure that policy is coherent. But if management practices change elsewhere in the system, then the role of head office also has to change. The emphasis in other ministries on setting objectives against which the management of agencies can be judged is difficult to reconcile with a detailed 'command and control' style of management of public-sector activities by the Treasury. In the present review, Sir Terry says the Treasury 'is looking quite fundamentally at the sort of jobs we do and asking 'Should we be doing them?''. He wants to place more emphasis on setting the agenda and getting the framework for policy right so that the department is less involved with detail and second guessing others. Because of the breadth and depth of the department's self examination, the Treasury has adopted a gradualist approach to change. It is not following the example of the Bank of England, which recently started and completed its biggest management restructuring since 1980 in just six months, at the cost of some bruised feelings in Threadneedle Street. But change is under way in the form of management delayering and pushing down responsibility to lower levels. Late last year, the Treasury effectively took out a layer of top management immediately below permanent secretary level. Its top mandarins are now known as directors. They have greater responsibility for their budgets than before and their duties are more clearly defined in their job titles. This is partly to emphasise the very different tasks carried out inside the Treasury and to create clearer entities in the department in the belief that this also can help push responsibility downwards. Further detailed work on the organisation of directorates and the allocation of resources inside the Treasury is being carried out as part of the fundamental review. This task has been handed to Jeremy Heywood, a young high-flyer and formerly principal private secretary to chancellors Kenneth Clarke and Norman Lamont. However, change at the Treasury is not just about organisation charts. Inspired partly by the attitudes survey and his own experiences since entering the Treasury in 1980 when he came to fill the post of chief economic adviser from the London Business School, Sir Terry also wants to change the Treasury's culture. 'I'd always been slightly worried about the general relations that the Treasury had with the outside world,' he says. On becoming permanent secretary in 1991, he gained a greater insight into the nature of the Treasury's relationships with other parts of Whitehall. 'People who were really quite quiet would write the most strident letters backwards and forwards to each other,' he recalls. 'When I'd say, let's have something more polite that makes the point, they would often turn round and say 'fine'. They weren't always happy writing strident letters either. That was just the way it was. 'That's what culture is. It is where people inherit styles and ways of doing things and it often turns out that each individual in the process is not really very happy with it. 'That is when a change of culture is needed. What we are doing now is trying to bring about a lot of the changes that people themselves actually want to make, but which have not been properly articulated.'</p>

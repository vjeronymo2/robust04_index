			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: CBS sees record year after strong third term CBS posted record earnings for the third quarter and forecast a best ever full year. For the three months to end-September, the group reported net income of Dollars 118.3m, or Dollars 7.39 a share, compared with Dollars 42.7m, or Dollars 2.76, in the corresponding period of 1992. On a consolidated basis, CBS's net sales were Dollars 752.6m, up 12 per cent on the 1992 quarter. The results included a one-time gain of about Dollars 3.20 a share, reflecting the settlement of legal disputes and tax proceedings. The buoyant performance reflected the strength of the network's programming. Last month's debut of Late Night starring Mr David Letterman, the popular chat-show host, bolstered CBS's commanding lead over its rivals. The CBS television network realised a 15 per cent gain in revenues and a substantial increase in operating profit, in spite of the continued sluggishness of the US economy. In addition to higher advertising pricing, the improvement was attributed to the absence of last year's coverage of the US political party conventions, which fail to attract big viewing audiences. The board raised the quarterly cash dividend to 50 cents a common share, from 25 cents, the level in effect since the first quarter of 1991. For the first nine months of 1993, net income was Dollars 279.9m, or Dollars 17.62 a share, on net sales of Dollars 2.47bn. In the comparable period last year, net income was Dollars 47.7m, or Dollars 3.08 a share, on slightly improved sales of Dollars 2.54bn.</p>

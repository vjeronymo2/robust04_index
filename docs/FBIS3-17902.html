The decision was prompted by a letter to the chamber from  the  coordinating council of the "Democratic Russia" movement, citing  numerous instances of violation of the Constitution and flouting  of citizens' electoral rights in the course of the preparation  and holding of the present elections in Russia's regions.    The opinion of the members of the chamber's council was  unanimous: This "election sickness" can only be cured on the  basis of a reliable legal foundation, which does not at present  exist.</p>

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: Liechtenstein banking group profit soars 75% BIL GT, the leading banking group in Liechtenstein, has reported a 75 per cent jump in 1993 consolidated net income to SFr141.3m (Dollars 97.1m) and proposed raising its dividend from SFr13 to SFr17. The group, formerly known as Bank in Liechtenstein, said it benefited from a falling interest rate trend which encouraged investors to shift funds from short-term instruments to the equity and bond markets. Total revenues rose 34 per cent to SFr553.3m, with fees and commissions accounting for nearly two-thirds of the total income. The bank itself achieved record income, and GT Management, the London based fund management group, had a 'very successful year'. The group's funds under administration soared 43 per cent to SFr55.2bn. The directors warned that the exceptional business growth rates of the past two years were unlikely to be maintained, but said the group had made a successful start to the current year.</p>

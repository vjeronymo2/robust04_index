			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Beijing, 23 Jun (XINHUA) -- Foreign Ministry  spokesman Wu Jianmin commented on the Korean nuclear issue and  answered reporters' questions concerning the Rwanda crisis and  the Yemeni civil war at a press conference this afternoon.    On the Korean nuclear issue, Wu Jianmin said: U.S. President  Clinton announced today that the United States would hold the  third round of talks with the DPRK in Geneva in early July to  seek an overall improvement of relations between the two  countries; and it that would also stop pushing for sanctions  against the DPRK in the UN Security Council. Meanwhile, the  DPRK and ROK have reached an agreement on holding preliminary  talks for a summit meeting between them. We are happy to see  these positive developments on the Korean nuclear issue and  appreciate the wise attitude adopted and positive efforts made  by the parties concerned for a peaceful settlement of this issue.    He said: Dialogue, instead of exerting pressure, is the  basic way for a peaceful and proper settlement of the Korean  nuclear issue. This conforms to the interests of all parties  and helps safeguard peace and stability on the peninsula. We  sincerely hope that all parties concerned will treasure and  seize upon this important turning point; hold consultations and  dialogue with an equal, pragmatic, and sincere approach; and  make constructive efforts to bring about a denuclearized,  peaceful, and stable Korean peninsula.

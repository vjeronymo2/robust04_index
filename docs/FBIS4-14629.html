			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 2 Apr -- In the long run there will be no  groups of Russian border troops in the CIS states. They will be  replaced with operational groups consisting of a small number of  officers and specialists whose task will be to help the local  troops responsible for protecting the border, Colonel General  Andrey Nikolayev, commander in chief of the Russian border  troops, told an ITAR-TASS correspondent last night on his return  from Bishkek.    He said the accords signed in Bishkek have created a legal  foundation for Commonwealth citizens serving in Russia's border  troops. Over the next few years they will account for 30 to 50  percent of the personnel.    A. Nikolayev said that during his conversation with Kirgiz  President Askar Akayev questions of training national cadres  were discussed, along with additional measures for strengthening  the border between Kirgizia [Kyrgyzstan] and Afghanistan. They  also worked out a unified border policy. The border troops  commander stressed that, as before, his views on ensuring  security on the Commonwealth borders coincided with those of  President Akayev and other heads of state.    A. Nikolayev said that additional measures aimed at  stabilizing the situation on the Tajik-Afghan section of the  border would be discussed at a conference of the Commonwealth  heads of state scheduled for the middle of April. He expressed  his satisfaction at the fact that a government delegation from  Tajikistan is to have a meeting in Moscow with opposition  leaders. However, in the opinion of the border troops chief  commander, a disruption of the dialogue or reluctance on the  part of one of the sides to continue it may result in a fresh  escalation of tension in Tajikistan and on the Tajik-Afghan  border.</p>

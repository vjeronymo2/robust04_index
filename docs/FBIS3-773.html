			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by E H Kemp] </F>   [Text] Ermelo March 13 SAPA -- Neither President F W de  Klerk nor Independent Electoral Commission Chairman Johann  Kriegler knew about the declaration of unrest areas in 52  magisterial districts, African National Congress [ANC] President  Nelson Mandela said on Sunday [13 March]. Addressing about  15,000 people at a rally in Wesselton outside Ermelo, he said he  had telephoned Mr de Klerk and Mr Justice Kriegler on Saturday  night after an ANC rally in Kimberley was prohibited in terms of  the declaration. Mr Mandela said Mr de Klerk told him he had  not known about the declaration and the subsequent banning of  the ANC rally. Mr Justice Kriegler, whose commission has to  ensure that the April election was free and fair, had also not  been consulted about the matter.    "The amount of confusion and lack of consultation among  members of the government is frightening. One department does  not know what another is doing. There are times when even Mr de  Klerk does not know about matters of fundamental importance."    The ANC leader said the declaration of unrest areas seemed  "calculated to undermine free and fair elections".    He said he had also discussed with Mr de Klerk the  controversy surrounding Housing Minister Louis Shill's  R90-billion [rand] housing scheme. He said it was wrong for a  government minister to make announcements on important issues  without prior consultation with other institutions and parties  involved in the transition process. "These are the actions of a  government which is panicking because they see the writing on  the wall. They are abusing their position to do things which in  terms of the sane policies, they should not be doing."    Mr Mandela received a thunderous welcome when he arrived at  the Wesselton stadium at about 3PM. Drum majorettes and  drummers led the procession as the ANC leader, on the back of an  open bakkie [pickup truck], waved and gave clenched fists  salutes. Mr Mandela, who was accompanied by the ANC's candidate  premier for the Eastern Transvaal, Matthew Phosa, and Prince  James Mahlangu of the Intando Yesizwe [Will of the Nation] party  of kwaNdebele, also inspected a company of Umkhonto We Sizwe  [Spear of the Nation, ANC armed wing] troops from the Chris Hani  detachment.</p>

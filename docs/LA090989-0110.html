			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACADEMICIANS WILL TRY TO PROVE SHROUD OF TURIN IS NOT A FAKE  </P> <P> A group of academicians say they will try to prove that the controversial Turin  shroud, which many Christians have believe bears the imprint of Christ's body,  is not a medieval fake.  </P> <P> More than 300 people attended a two-day conference late this week in Paris, the  first since the Roman Catholic Church announced last October that carbon-dating  tests proved the cloth was a clever forgery from the 13th Century.  </P> <P> The findings seemed to rule out the possibility that the shroud, which bears  the bloodstained image of a bearded man, was used to wrap Christ's body.  </P> <P> But some scholars, convinced that more can be learned about the yellowing cloth  in Turin Cathedral since 1587, are determined that the matter should not stop  there.  </P> <P> Marie-Claire Van Oosterwyck-Gastuche, a Belgian expert on carbon-dating,  criticized the way the so-called carbon-14 tests were carried out.  </P> <P> But Michael Tite of the British Museum, who coordinated the research in the  United States, England and Switzerland and was the only carbon-14  representative in Paris, dismissed the doubters.  </P> <P> "I have no doubt in the accuracy of the tests. But there's no scientific  argument against peoples' faith," Tite added.  </P></p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Metals group chief ousted: Six directors of Frankfurt-based conglomerate lose jobs The dazzling career of Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch as chief executive of Metallgesellschaft came to an ignominious end yesterday when he was sacked as head of the Frankfurt-based conglomerate. Mr Schimmelbusch, a charismatic Austrian businessman, built the company into one of Germany's largest industrial groups. Together with Mr Meinhard Forster, the group's finance director, he was ousted following a meeting of Metallgesellschaft's supervisory board. The meeting was convened to examine the mounting problems of MG Corp, the group's US-based trading subsidiary, which have triggered a liquidity crisis in the company as a whole. Mr Schimmelbusch and Mr Forster were sacked on the grounds that they had failed to keep the supervisory board informed of developments at MG Corp and may have acted in breach of German corporate law. Four other directors left the management board after reaching agreement with the supervisory board. Mr Kajo Neukirchen, a former chief executive of the Hoesch steel group, who has a reputation in Germany as a tough restructuring specialist, was appointed as Mr Schimmelbusch's successor with immediate effect. Four further new directors were appointed, three from outside the Metallgesellschaft group. The forced personnel changes are highly unusual for so large a German company, bearing witness to the gravity of the problems at MG Corp. Last week Metallgesellschaft was forced to turn to its bankers to negotiate new credit lines after MG Corp was obliged to make large 'margin payments' - cash calls - on oil futures contracts taken out in New York. Last week Deutsche Bank, a big shareholder in Metallgesellschaft as well as creditor, backed the company's line that the liquidity problems were temporary, caused by technical developments in the oils futures markets. It was clear from yesterday's announcement that investigations undertaken by the banks in the meantime have uncovered far more serious problems. The statement from the company cast little light on the scale of Metallgesellschaft's problems, saying that investigations to date had uncovered deficiencies in controls and management at MG Corp. The investigations into MG Corp and other US subsidiaries would continue, Metallgesellschaft said, and it was likely that the provisional loss of DM347m (Pounds 137.6m) reported for the year to the end of September would have to be restated. Turnover for last year was DM25.5bn. Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, Germany's two biggest banks which own more than 10 per cent each of Metallgesellschaft, said they would continue to provide financial support for the company.

			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Portugal (5): Stumbling blocks still need to be overcome - Project Finance PORTUGAL is enjoying an unprecedented era of infrastructure development. A new 11km, Es121bn (Pounds 530m) bridge is to span the Tagus estuary at Lisbon. A railway crossing will be added below the existing bridge - all in time for 1998, the year when Lisbon hosts the inter- national exhibition Expo 98 that will lead to a major facelift for the eastern side of the city. In the power sector, a consortium led by the UK's National Power is paying Electricidade de Portugal, the state-owned power company, Es183bn to take over over the construction of two 300MW coal-fired power plants at Pego in central Portugal. The deal could eventually extend to four units. Natural gas is be introduced into the country and one, probably two, gas-fired power plants will be built downstream. The total cost of European Community and government infrastructure development between 1989 and 1993 is estimated at Es3,500bn and a similar sum is expected to be spent to the end of the century. What distinguishes the above projects from the billions being spent on new motorways, bridges, railway improvements and telecommunications is that all are being financed by phenomena new to Portugal - project finance, in the strict sense of private sector enterprise in which the cash flow of the project is enough to pay back all the loans raised without recourse to shareholders. Previously, major infrastructure projects in Portugal were carried out by giant state-owned enterprises and financed by loans to enterprises that had the state guarantee of Portugal Inc. Government officials do not deny that has led to the building of one or two white elephants. 'Following the wave of privatisations that Portugal has experienced it no longer makes sense to farm out all the major projects to state-owned companies,' says Mr Abdool Magid Vakil, chairman of the Lisbon-based Efisa investment company. 'The government believes that, if it can get the private sector involved, they will be much more careful and scrutinise everything and in this way avoid the possibility of building another costly white elephant.' But so far Portugal's experience with project finance has failed to overcome some initial stumbling blocks. 'It's a little worrying,' says Mr Filipe Crisostomo Silva, a director of Banco Finantia. 'Portugal has been involved in this for three or four years now and so far has failed to close one deal.' The first project to turn sour was the Es130bn plan to introduce natural gas. The government called off two years of talks in March between an international consortium led by Gaz de France (GDF) and EDP after the two failed to agree on prices and risk-sharing. 'We would rather have no deal than a bad deal,' Mr Luis Pereira, Portugal's energy secretary, said. He blamed GDF, saying it had expected EDP to take on exaggerated risks. It had insisted on fixed costs that were too high and had undermined the talks by reviving already agreed questions close to negotiating deadlines. GDF said it remained determined to bring off the project if only the points in dispute could be overcome. The Portuguese government has set a deadline of mid-May to decide on what route it will take to bring natural gas into the country. The difficulties leave a question mark over a 900MW plant powered by natural gas that is being constructed in Portugal by a Siemens-led consortium - which cannot be financed until there is a guarantee of natural gas reaching Portugal - and over plans for a similar plant to be built by 2001. 'The failure of the gas project could be a bad precedent because project finance lives off credibility,' says Mr Crisostomo Silva. 'International banks have to trust in Portugal, in the stability of the Portuguese government and the economic situation. When you start having problems like the gas project, people might look at Portugal as an unsafe, unstable country and resources may be diverted elsewhere.' A project much nearer financial closing than the natural gas project is the Pego power plant deal. But it, too, has been delayed. The closing was due to have been signed on March 31 but problems arose in three areas: an EC question over the competition status of EDP signing a 28-year exclusive deal to purchase power from the plant and difficulties over both the contract for coal to be unloaded and over the contract for rail delivery of the coal. The finance package in place behind the Pego deal is as complex a deal as any major international project finance agreement. It involves the issuing of ordinary shares in Lisbon, shareholder loans, and two Deutsche Mark non-recourse loans to be provided by two syndicates of banks. One is an 'offshore facility', the other a 'domestic facility' provided by Portuguese banks. Analysts predict financing the new bridge project will be even more complex than the Pego plan. The main guarantee for Pego is the power purchase agreement to be signed by EDP. In the case of the new bridge, which also brings with it the concession for the existing toll bridge, many complex factors have to be examined. A list of eight international consortia for the bridge project has been cut down to five and should be reduced to two before the end of the year. Their proposals for the build, operate and transfer deal will have to take into account how many cars will cross the bridge, what toll should be charged, how soon can the consortium hand back the bridge to the state, what will be the impact of the new rail crossing over the existing bridge and other, difficult to assess questions. 'Portugal is learning from its mistakes,' believes Mr Crisostomo Silva, 'I think you will now see the government waiting longer to choose the preferred bidder and guaranteeing first that it actually has the banks and the money behind it before going into detailed negotiations.'</p>

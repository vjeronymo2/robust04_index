			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: GUS surges The continuing onward march in the share price of Great Universal Stores - the stock has risen nearly 7.5 per cent in the past week - was prompting widespread speculation in the market yesterday. Perhaps the wildest but strongest rumour at the market opening was that the chairman of Kingfisher was resigning to join GUS as chief executive  - a story hotly denied by both camps. However, it had the effect of unsettling the Kingfisher share price, which fell away sharply and failed to recover in spite of good news on French interest rates. Other stories linked to GUS included speculation that its enfranchisement of its non-voting shares next month might be accompanied by a share buy-back scheme. This would not be the first time cash-rich GUS has undertaken such a move, although analysts were sceptical that it would do so just now. Another rumour suggested that an announcement on a new commercial development was imminent. GUS 'A' shares advanced 55 to 2158p. Turnover was 850,000. Kingfisher retreated 9 to 647p.</p>

			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Observer: Teleological technik The wheel of fate comes full circle, if you give it enough time. Back in the 1950s BMW was in poorer shape than Rover ever was. It so confused its customers - how could they trust a manufacturer which produced cheap three-wheel bubble cars and large expensive Grand Tourers - that the management wanted to put BMW into voluntary liquidation. They put the idea to shareholders. Bavarian pride took over - the management got the push instead. Clearly BMW was fated to become a big name in British motoring terms. Ford in Britain once produced a television advertisement which was never shown because it was considered in poor taste. It featured a Spitfire speeding through blue skies, while a voice-over declared: 'During the second world war Ford built hundreds of thousands of aircraft engines in Britain. That's why today the British do not have to say: Vorsprung durch Technik.' How wrong they were.</p>

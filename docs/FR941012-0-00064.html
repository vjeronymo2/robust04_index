			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another commenter proposed that a different testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard be adopted in OSHA's final rule:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> I propose to replace ``ballistic nylon or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent protection covering each leg from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upper thigh to boot top or shoe top'' by ``leg  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protective device in conformity with the standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NQ 1923&hyph;450 ``Protective pad for chain saw  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operators' trousers and leggings. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> NQ 1923&hyph;450 is a test standard developed in Quebec Province, Canada. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This performance standard covers all the requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for safety leggings such as the minimum coverage and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum performance level. This performance level is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measured in conformity with the standard NQ 1923&hyph;450  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Protective pads for chain saw operators' trousers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leggings_Determination of stopping speed and cut-through time.'' These two standards have been adopted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by a consensus of employers, workers, manufacturers of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fabrics and PPE, government and workers' compensation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boards. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Other participants opposed specific criteria for leg  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection performance for several reasons (Tr. W2 206&hyph;07,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OR 472&hyph;75, 496&hyph;98, 513&hyph;14). First, some argued that there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were no national consensus or State standard to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidance on specification standards. Second, others  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commented that a specification standard limited to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``ballistic nylon'' was too restrictive (Ex. 5&hyph;30; Tr. W2 189&hyph;90). Third, others stated that there are no standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishing specific performance criteria of the material  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for leg protection. For example, APA testified: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> APA does not know of any state leg protection apparel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard in existence or under development. I can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report to you that our association has a special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committee working on the development of a safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apparel standard, and this committee has generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accepted the Quebec Research Institute testing method,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and now it's kind of rewriting this testing method to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet the American Society of Testing Materials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidelines. So the committee is close to completing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its work on endorsing an approved test procedure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The next step in the committee's charge is to develop a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> voluntary performance testing standard that would apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for leg protection, safety boots and other apparel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> That's going to be a little way down the road. It's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> own opinion that the work of this committee is not yet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mature and that OSHA should probably not attempt to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include any specific performance testing standard for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leg protection or other safety items at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> They're recommending that you defer the inclusion of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific leg protection performance testing standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> until the next revision of the OSHA logging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations, whenever that might be. It may be ten  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years from now or fifteen years from now. At this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> point in time, we feel it's much more important to get  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any safety equipment worn, rather than to worry about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether or not it meets specific performance standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Tr. OR 472&hyph;75). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> APA also testified that regional differences in chain-saw operations also precludes a specification standard for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leg protection:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> I would also say in general our feeling is that logging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is so different obviously in every part of the country  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that often we've got to have lead-way for the types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leg protection that might be appropriate for a person  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> working in the swamps of Louisiana as opposed to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mountains of Montana. Not that we know what those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differences might be, but that in general we feel like  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the loggers in those areas should be able to have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity to design or approve a leg protection that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be appropriate for their situation (Tr. OR 207&hyph;08). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The record shows that leg protection for chain-saw  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operators is essential to prevent injuries. According to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the WIR survey, 64 percent of injuries to chain-saw  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operators were due to kickback, an accident that usually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results in injury to the leg (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The WIR survey also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicates that 22 percent of all injuries reported were to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the leg.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA believes that leg protection made of ballistic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nylon or equivalent material is effective in preventing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injuries to the leg. A study by the French Farmers'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mutuality indicates that ballistic leg protection was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective in preventing 12 leg injuries in 91 loggers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> studies over an eight-month period (Ex. 37). Testimony and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments show, however, that there is no accepted testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measurements standard in this country on leg protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance. In addition, the foreign standards that do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exist have not been generally accepted or used in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> country. Nonetheless, OSHA believes that a performance-based requirement for leg protection to provide protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against contact with a moving saw chain will provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexibility for employers while encouraging technological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> innovation, such as the work by APA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Technology: IBM widens legal battle - 'Altered memory' is at the heart of the dispute Somewhere in Europe, earlier this year, microchips in the main memory of an IBM mainframe computer overheated, burning a hole the size of a centime in the printed circuit board on which they were mounted. Investigation of the resulting machine failure has given IBM a reason to widen to Europe a campaign of litigation it has been pursuing against computer leasing and engineering companies in the US. Computer leasing practices differ substantially in the US and Europe but IBM's essential allegations against the leasing industry are that: Its computers and components have been appropriated without its knowledge or permission. Vital parts of IBM systems have been counterfeited and passed off as genuine. Shoddy workmanship on the part of some engineering companies has led to systems failures; memory chips have been soldered to printed circuit boards for which they are inappropriate, resulting in overheating. The latter two complaints constitute what has become known as the 'altered memory' issue. Companies it is suing in the US include Comdisco, the world's largest computer leasing company which has annual revenues of over Dollars 2bn. Comdisco rejects the charges fiercely and has spent millions of dollars in its defence. In Europe, the first overt sign of IBM's campaign has been the beginning of proceedings against Phoenix International, a Surrey-based computer brokerage and subsidiary of Phoenix Computer Associates of the US. Phoenix has since complained to the European Commission. The issue of 'altered memory' has become a cause celebre in Europe, provoking cries of outrage from the local leasing community. IBM is now at loggerheads with the European Computer Leasing Association (Eclat), the 80-member strong trade body. Its director general, Geoffrey Sewell, said this week that after many meetings he is disappointed that it has so far proved impossible to resolve the issue: 'In my opinion, if the use of this sort of litigation were to escalate, we could be heading in Europe for what I believe is happening in the US; the use of litigation as a business tool to slow down competition. At the end of the day, it will be the user who pays'. The dispute over altered memory, however, is confusing a more fundamental argument: the question of who will control the market for second hand IBM computers - a market worth some Dollars 10bn in Europe alone. The leasing companies believe that IBM, desperate to improve market share and revenues, wants to drive them out of the business and, as part of this strategy, is creating doubt among customers about the integrity of second hand systems. IBM totally rejects this interpretation, arguing its only concern is to protect its reputation and its customers. Nick Temple, IBM (UK) chief executive says: 'Generating anxiety among customers is not the thing to do. Our objective is to stop the counterfeiters and restore confidence in genuine parts'. IBM computers predominate in the world's data centres. Its mainframes, costing Dollars 1m upwards are 'big ticket' items, such as jumbo jets and merchant ships and, as such, support a healthy second hand market. The price and resale value of a second hand system can be predicted with reasonable certainty over its entire life. This is the basis of leasing industry economics. IBM has its own leasing company, IBM Credit Corporation, dealing in new and second hand machinery but the third party leasing industry is concerned almost entirely with used equipment. To meet its customers' requirements it has to reconfigure and reassemble mainframes and memory, using components from a variety of sources. To hold their book value, all these components must qualify for IBM maintenance. A healthy second user market provides customers with three advantages Eclat says: First, the option to buy IBM equipment from a source other than IBM. Second, the opportunity to sell surplus equipment at a fair market price. Third, it forces competition between new and used equipment, which keeps IBM on its toes technologically. The European dispute turns around altered memory. In February IBM warned that IBM memory cards altered by independent engineering companies using IBM chips would no longer be covered by IBM maintenance agreements. If a machine failed as a consequence of problems with an altered memory board, the customer would be charged for time and materials. Memory boards are expensive - between Pounds 100,000 and Pounds 200,000 each. Computing time while a machine is out of action for inspection is also expensive. The leasing industry argument is that reconfiguration is essential to their operations and that IBM has not, in the past, objected either to the reconfiguration process or to maintaining reconfigured machines once they had passed initial inspection. (There is an important semantic point here; reconfiguration refers to putting together systems in different ways and is quite legitimate; IBM is objecting to the creation of memory boards from chips unsoldered from existing units.) The leasing industry believes that IBM is attempting to spread fear and uncertainty among users to encourage them to go only to IBM for new and second hand equipment. Joseph Kafka, head of Comdisco in the UK says: 'I feel IBM has won the short term battle; it has scared the users'. The leasing industry, itself, has to some extent played into IBM's hands. A high risk, high profit business, it has had its share of problems. The case of Atlantic Computers, which contributed to the collapse of British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings, illustrated this. Altered memory is another example. There are, no doubt, some engineering companies cannibalising memory, sticking IBM labels on non-IBM parts and soldering slow memory on to boards where only high-speed chips should be used. IBM has every right to seek to outlaw such practices and reputable leasing companies are in agreement. Kafka says: 'At Comdisco we have never altered any form of memory nor do we have the capability of doing so'. Sewell says: 'Eclat does not support the use of memory modules which do not conform to IBM's design specification or where workmanship is not of an acceptable standard'. But he argues that the leasing companies have the right to reconfigure machines and that IBM is wrong, retrospectively, to decide not to maintain altered memory cards. IBM's offering is an inspection and replacement service, the cost of which must be borne by the customer. Temple of IBM says: 'I am not going to subsidise a whole industry'. Eclat, on the other hand, is arguing for a moratorium on maintenance on all memory installed on large IBM mainframes in Europe prior to February 1992. It also wants better identification methods to make it easier to recognise altered memory. Even IBM cannot always tell altered from original boards, Eclat says, an argument the manufacturer hotly disputes. The arguments seem finely balanced; on one side, IBM protecting its name for quality; on the other, the leasing industry its right to meet its customers' requirements under the umbrella of a dominant manufacturer. Inevitably, the leasing industry harbours suspicions about IBM's motives. It says the altered memory issue has given it a fortuitous stick to beat its leasing company competitors, especially Comdisco. Some argue that to enjoin a rival in a legal battle discourages potential predators. Is the dispute really IBM's way of warning off Fujitsu, the Japanese company which is resolved to overtake IBM as the world's largest computer manufacturer, from making a bid for a US leasing company? Whatever the truth, the battle seems likely to cost the leasing industry and its customers dear.</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Survey of Relaunching the Ruhr (6): Strong catalyst for change - An ambitious plan is under way to transform the history and heritage of the Ruhr into an architectural and industrial celebration / The Emscher Park international building exhibition who was born in Dublin in 1806 and died in Dusseldorf in 1885 - would have been proud of it. In 1866 he started sinking the first two deep shafts of a coal mine in the fields near Castrop-Rauxel, an unlikely Irish entrepreneur who joined the 'coal rush' which launched the German Ruhrgebiet, and with it, Germany's industrial revolution. He called it nostalgically Erin, after his native land. It was always a battle to prevent the pit from flooding, and after a decade, Mr Mulvany sold Erin, and a second colliery, Hibernia, at Gelsenkirchen, to the new generation of German capitalists emerging in the region. Today, the pit-head winding gear over Shaft Number Four stands lovingly restored, painted an appropriate bright green, bearing the name of Erin in huge capitals, as the symbol of a new industrial estate emerging from the wasteland left behind by more than a century of coal mining. By 1895, the pit was producing 430,000 tonnes of coal a year, and employed 1,458 men. In 1973, at the height of the oil crisis, it reached a peak production of 1.48m tonnes. And on December 31, 1983, it closed - priced out of the market. The pit heaps have vanished, and the contaminated earth surrounding the former coke works has been bulldozed into modest hillocks to decorate a new landscape. Saplings have already been planted in neat avenues, and they are starting to dig out an ornamental lake to decorate the site. DM30m has been set aside by the state of North Rhine-Westphalia to bring back a bit of green to the land of Erin. The industrial estate at Castrop-Rauxel is just one of more than 80 projects in an extraordinarily ambitious plan to transform the history and heritage of the heart of the Ruhr into an architectural and industrial celebration - and thus lay the basis for new industry, new jobs, and a new environment for the area. The Emscher Park international building exhibition was conceived back in 1988 as a way of combining the disparate efforts of 17 towns and cities, with a population of more than 2m, and covering an area of some 800 square kilometres, into a concerted effort to revive the entire region. 'They call this the Emscher zone, which sounds very disparaging in German,' says Mr Dieter Blase, a project leader at the headquarters of the exhibition, housed in the converted transformer building at the former Rheinelbe colliery in Gelsenkirchen. 'This is the heart of the region's problems, the result of a century of chaotic urban development. Our task is to heal the landscape, and at the same time attract new industry. We are trying to integrate old and new buildings, and to ensure the highest quality of the projects. We are trying to bring back a sense of pride, a culture of architecture and construction to the region.' The idea of the building exhibition goes all the way back to the 1851 Great Exhibition in London, when the Crystal Palace was built, and since then has been repeated in cities like Stuttgart in 1927, Hanover in 1951, and Berlin in 1957 and 1987. But this is the first time it has been attempted over such a wide area all at once. It covers the entire area from Duisburg in the west to Bergkamen in the east, a corridor of 80 kilometres along the line of the former Emscher river and the Rhine-Herne canal. The fundamental idea is to create an Emscher country park, with large expanses of green space for recreation, linking the unused land between the cities. In addition, there are four main project areas designed to provide a focus for the exhibition: To revive and redevelop the Emscher 'river,' which is today not a river but an open sewage system; it involves the ecological redesign of 350 kms of open sewers, and the construction of biological filtration plants, as well as an attempt to reconstruct a natural river. Under the slogan of 'working in the park,' to develop a number of high-grade industrial and commercial sites - like Erin - on former coal, iron and steel sites. Under the theme of 'new housing and forms of living,' to renew the best of existing workers' housing settlements, like garden villages, and create new housing with a high architectural value. To preserve the most important industrial monuments to keep the region's history alive, and find ways of using the old buildings for new purposes. Virtually all the projects in the exhibition have been organised as competitions, with the 80 schemes under way chosen from 450 originally submitted. The most glamorous - and dramatic - is the plan to transform the inner harbour at Duisburg, the great steel-making city where the river Ruhr flows into the Rhine, intended to re-integrate the old city centre with its industrial heart. There the competition was won, out of 47 contestants, by an ambitious design from Sir Norman Foster, the British architect, to build a great semi-circular block of offices and service-industries around the inner basin of the harbour, while at the same time renovating the warehouses and mills which line the waterfront. The problem remains to attract enough outside private investment to make such an ambitious DM100m project viable, and, so far, the more modest schemes in the rest of the area are making more rapid progress. At the former Waltrop colliery, for example, the whole complex of mine buildings erected just before the First World War is being converted into units for small businesses, at a cost of some DM25m. A furniture maker is already booked to move into the old locomotive engine house. A print shop will be in the milk bar, and an architect's firm in the old machinery control room. There will be offices in the wages hall, where the miners drew their weekly pay, a car repair company, and a steel erector, on green field sites next door. All are local companies seeking to expand, rather than new investors attracted to the region. Mr Blase is conscious that the marketing effort needs to improve - 'till now there have been only bad sites available,' he says. 'Now for the first time we're producing good sites. But we need to get the right people to come in. 'The economic promotion people are working very traditionally, and simply marketing the sites. By next year we will have an excess of sites, so they must start looking for investors with innovation potential, who are set to expand.' He sees one big advantage over similar attempts to restructure old industrial areas in Britain: the Ruhr region is the most modern of Europe's old industrial areas, and the basic infrastructure does not require modernisation. There is an excellent autobahn system, with ample capacity, and good rail links. 'Our idea of structural policy is very different to the British idea,' he says. 'Here, it is primarily a question of networking and co-operation, bringing people together to produce new ideas.' He cites as an example, the need to persuade traditional Ruhr construction companies, for years the leading specialists in railway construction, shaft-sinking and tunnelling, to switch to the new growth area of water supply and sewerage replacement schemes - as required by the reconstruction of the Emscher river system. That is precisely how he sees the building exhibition as a catalyst for change, and new growth. And yet, in a curious way, history also repeats itself. At Erin, the main problem faced by the new industrial estate is how to prevent the water in its artificial lake leaking into the old mine workings. Mr Mulvany, whose mine was flooded out three times, and finally abandoned for 10 years before they mastered the problem, must be wearing a wry Irish grin.</p>

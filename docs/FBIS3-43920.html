Mr. Natchaba, who  was accompanied by Colonel Wala Cisine, Col. Sei Memene, and  Squadron Leader Gnaotcha, told the diplomats that our country,  which was recovering from its state of crisis, was once again  shaken by a terrorist attack on 5 and 6 January. This attack  was aimed at the head of state and, particularly at preventing  the upcoming legislative elections from taking place.    Mr. Natchaba then went on to present the outcome of the  attack in which 67 people including a Brazilian died, 28 others  were injured, and extensive material damage was caused. Col.  Cisine, on his part, presented the weapons seized or abandoned  by the attackers. These included 27 light weapons, explosives,  bombs, heavy weapons, as well as transmission and logistic  equipment which were seized at a villa in Kojoviakope district  and at the homes of Mr. Kponton and Mr. Kuvaye in Nukafu  district. He also presented vehicles with RT-G registration  numbers as well as public and personnel transport vehicles with  OI registration numbers that bore reconnaissance insignia.

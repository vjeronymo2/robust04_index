			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee prices slide to 22-year lows - Week in the markets IN A generally quiet week for commodity markets coffee stood out like a sore thumb. With producer selling revealing a sad lack of buying interest robusta coffee prices at the London Futures and Options Exchange continued their inexorable slide to the lowest level in 22 years. As the July futures price fell to Dollars 738 a tonne on Thursday some dealers suggested that the market was due for an upturn, pointing out that many speculative traders would have short positions to square up when the market bottomed out. And that point in the present price cycle might be reached soon, they said, as declining returns made producers more reluctant to sell. Others argued, however, that, reluctant or not, many producers had no choice but to keep selling because of the need to finance debt repayments. In early trading yesterday the former group seemed to have got it right; producer selling appeared to have dried up and profit-taking and bargain-hunting purchases prompted rises by midday ranging from Dollars 6 to Dollars 16 a tonne. But the bears regained the ascendancy in the afternoon, following a lower opening at the New York market. The July position, which had rallied to Dollars 748 a tonne at one point, dipped to Dollars 726 before closing at Dollars 728 a tonne, down Dollars 59 on the week and Dollars 269 from the beginning of this year. Ivory Coast selling, which has been a notable factor in the recent coffee price decline, weighed heavily on the cocoa market this week, and seems set to do so for some time. Traders are aware that, having delayed the start of this year's cocoa marketing campaign because of depressed price levels, the Ivory Coast, the world's biggest producer, will have to maintain its sales at a much higher level than usual for the remainder of the season. 'If, according to World Bank guidelines, the Caisse de Stabilisation in the Ivory Coast has to sell three quarters of the new crop by end-September, they need to sell at least 20,000 tonnes a week,' one London trader told the Reuters news agency yesterday. Normally by this stage Ivorian sales would have slowed to about 9,000 tonnes a week. London cocoa futures prices set fresh 16 1/2 -year lows this week before steadying somewhat yesterday. The July delivery price closed at Pounds 589 a tonne, up Pounds 5 on the day but Pounds 19 down on the week. The two-weeks of talks on the International Cocoa Agreement that ended yesterday in Geneva had no discernible market impact. As had been predicted the meeting of producer and consumer members under the auspices of the UN Committee on Trade and Development made little progress towards reving the market stabilisation functions of the moribund pact. Delegates agreed to meet again in July. In an otherwise uneventful week at the London Metal Exchange the zinc market continued to be distorted by a squeeze on supplies available for nearby delivery. As the exchange's warehouse stocks grew by another 8,500 tonnes to a record 244,775 tonnes the three months position fell Dollars 12 on the week to Dollars 1,292.50 a tonne. But the squeeze fears pushed the cash price up Dollars 32 to a 16-month high of Dollars 1,371.50 a tonne, widening the cash premium to Dollars 79 a tonne, from Dollars 35 at the end of last week. Aluminium prices dipped to five-week lows on news of labour contract deals had been reached at Alcoa and Reynolds of the US. The cash quotation recovered Dollars 8.25 of the fall yesterday but still ended Dollars 18.50 down on the week at Dollars 1,289.50 a tonne. All was fairly quiet in the precious metals market until the last two days of the week. Then platinum put on a spurt that left the London price Dollars 8 up on balance at Dollars 350.15 a troy ounce at the afternoon fixing. Later it moved farther ahead to Dollars 354 an ounce. Traders said the rise reflected chart-inspired investment fund buying in the New York market that reversed a 12-week downtrend. At London's International Petroleum Exchange the crude oil market had a more active week, with the July position putting on 68 cents at Dollars 19.49 a barrel before easing a little yesterday. The rise reflected the more optimistic view being taken by traders of oil demand prospects. Mr Peter Gignoux, head of the energy desk at Smith Barney in London said there had been some strong buying from oil refiners in the US. 'The second quarter is providing shopping opportunities for those who like to line up barrels for later in the year,' he said. 'When the market started to run they thought they'd better buy or miss the boat.'  ----------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close)  ----------------------------------------- tonnes  ----------------------------------------- Aluminium    +3,250  to  1,216,500 Copper       -1,450  to    279,650 Lead         +5,175  to    135,150 Nickel         +270  to     26,478 Zinc         +5,450  to    244,775 Tin             -20  to     12,060  -----------------------------------------</p>

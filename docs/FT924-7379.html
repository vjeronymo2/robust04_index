			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Arts: Angels in America - Theatre The final image of Millennium Approaches, the first half of Tony Kushner's epic American play, Angels in America, sears itself on the memory and piques the imagination: an angel hovers over the sick bed of an AIDS patient, about to speak. In the 18 months since Millennium Approaches was first staged in San Francisco and at London's Royal National Theatre, an enormous amount of attention has been focussed on just what that angel is going to say. Even before Kushner had completed the play's second half, Perestroika, Angels in America was being hailed as the great hope of the American theatre; the pressure on him must have been enormous, and it shows in the work. Perestroika had its premiere in Los Angeles last week as part of the Mark Taper Forum's seven hour long production of Angels in America. The angel finally spoke, and her news for mankind is grim. So is the news on Perestroika; it is over long, preachy, and - what is more disturbing - so ponderous that it blunts the brilliance of Millennium Approaches. Millennium Approaches strains the seams of its form; Kushner had so much to say and such a need to say it that words, character and plot seemed barely able to contain him. Only through a play this vast could he communicate the depths of his alarm about the AIDS crisis and of his indignation about the heartlessness of Reagan era America. Scenes bump into and overlap with other scenes. Imagination and fantasy mingle with harsh fact: a desperate, lonely housewife's valium trip intersects with the feverish hallucinations of a gay man with AIDS. Fictional characters, at once emblematic and individual - a closeted gay, politically conservative Mormon; a self-indulgent gay Jewish leftie - share the stage with historical characters so extreme they seem imagined: Roy Cohn, the homophobic, homosexual ultra-right-wing politician who died of AIDS; and Ethel Rosenberg, whom Cohn helped condemn to death for treason. Millennium Approaches is almost too long, its language almost too heightened, the politics too front-and-centre, but we excuse the fact that it teeters on the edge of excess because Kushner's subject matter is extreme and his immersion in it total. If Millennium Approaches is Kushner's diagnosis of what is ailing America, then Perestroika is his fruitless search for a solution. In it he tries to wrap up all the plots that he set in motion and to find a unifying meaning behind his subject matter. He seems to be shouldering all the world's burdens, trying to find answers to problems it is going to take years to remedy. The two works together push Millennium's near excesses over the edge. Plots that had emblematic significance become convoluted story telling and what was brilliant writing starts to seem like so much showing off: snappy repartee between gay men becomes reductive queeniness and rousing political debate becomes heavy-handed polemicising. Flaws in the way characters are drawn start to show - is nurse Belize really anything more than a comic foil? and does Hannah Pitt, Joe's mother, have a purpose other than to add another female presence and to give companionship to Prior, the man who is dying of AIDS? Kushner is clearly struggling for control of the play, and with his ending concedes defeat. By having Prior address the audience directly about facing the AIDS crisis with bravery, Kushner throws away all pretence of dramatisation and hits the audience in the face with his message. Directors Oskar Eustis, who has been closely involved with Angels in America since he commissioned it for San Francisco's Eureka Theatre over five years ago, and Tony Taccone have put together a serviceable but unextraordinary production in which everything seems to be happening at 75 per cent of its possible intensity. The music could be more exciting; characters on stage are under-used when they are not the focus of the action; John Conklin's set could be more visually interesting; and the technical tricks could be faster and louder. The performances are, with one exception, spot on. Ron Leibman's Roy Cohn is scarily good - all spluttering, bellowing gusto. Others stand out include K. Todd Freeman, whose Belize raises the withering glare to high art; Joe Mantello, finding what is loveable and loathsome about Louis and Stephen Spinella, who make's Prior's struggle with AIDS moving but never maudlin. Cynthia Mace as the valium-addicted Mormon housewife, Harper, is the only weak link; her laboured, mannered speech pattern makes her monologues seem over-written. The best news about the Los Angeles Angels in America is that it is not finished yet. Kushner is reportedly not happy with the production and there will be major changes before it transfers to the New York Shakespeare Festival's off-Broadway Public Theatre in February.</p>

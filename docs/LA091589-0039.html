			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE SENATE REJECTS 15-DAY WAITING PERIOD TO BUY GUN  </P> <P> Gun-control advocates in the state Senate lost a hard-fought battle to impose a  15-day waiting period on the purchase of hunting rifles and shotguns Thursday  after having scored a victory over the firearms lobby by pushing through  legislation limiting the capacity of ammunition clips.  </P> <P> Strongly opposed by the National Rifle Assn., but carrying the tacit support of  Gov. George Deukmejian, the waiting-period bill failed on a 14-22 vote  following a daylong battle.  </P> <P> The clearly disgusted author, Assemblyman Lloyd G. Connelly (D-Sacramento),  whose bill at one point came within three votes of passage, told reporters that  the NRA had exerted immense pressure on the Senate.  </P> <P> The ammunition clip bill was finally approved after several roll calls on a  bipartisan 21-15 vote, the bare margin required in the 40-member Senate. Then  it was returned to the Assembly to face another expected intense fight,  probably today, as the Legislature rushes toward a midnight adjournment of its  1989 session.  </P> <P> That measure, authored by Assemblyman Johan Klehs (D-Castro Valley), limits the  capacity of ammunition clips in rifles to 15 rounds.  </P> <P> The senators' reluctance to support the waiting period bill, considered the  most far-reaching gun-control measure of the current session, contrasted with  the relative ease by which the Senate last spring passed the nation's first ban  of semiautomatic assault weapons over the stiff opposition of the National  Rifle Assn.  </P> <P> Some senators who supported the assault rifle ban refused to vote to restrict  the number of bullets in an ammunition magazine to 15, despite the appeals of  Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia), who sponsored the bill on the Senate floor.  </P> <P> "No sportsman needs a capacity of more than 15 rounds," said Davis, a hunter  who opposed the assault gun ban.  </P> <P> Davis noted that only a few hours earlier in Louisville, Ky., a printing  company employee used an assault rifle to kill seven fellow workers before  killing himself.  </P> <P> The emotional fervor for more gun controls in California was prompted Jan. 17  when a deranged drifter named Patrick Purdy murdered five children in a  Stockton school yard with an assault rifle. His two AK-47 clips contained about  50 rounds each.  </P> <P> Shortly after the killings, Deukmejian, a long-time opponent of new gun  controls, called for extending to rifles and shotguns the 15-day waiting period  already required of handgun purchasers. The waiting period allows law  enforcement authorities time to conduct a background check of the prospective  buyer to determine whether there has been any mental illness or major criminal  activities.  </P> <P> But since the assault gun legislation was enacted last spring and the NRA  suffered one of its worst defeats at the hands of a state legislature,  enthusiasm to impose additional gun controls has plummeted. One top NRA  official suggested that the switch may be due to reelection jitters by  lawmakers in rural areas who fear the wrath of gun owners.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Additional Provision  </P> <P> In addition to establishing a waiting period for long guns, from small  .22-caliber rifles to 12-gauge shotguns, the Connelly bill would make it more  difficult for people involuntarily committed for psychiatric evaluations to  purchase firearms.  </P> <P> The bill also would put firearms off limits to people convicted of certain  violent misdemeanors and would require that casual sales of all firearms,  including those at gun shows and swap meets, be transacted through a licensed  dealer and subject to the 15-day waiting period.  </P> <P> Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), who sponsored the  Connelly bill in the upper chamber, conceded that it would "inconvenience" gun  buyers but insisted that it did not "constitute an infringement" on anyone's  rights.  </P> <P> "It properly balances the needs of law enforcement and society with the  interests of the gun-owning community," Roberti said, noting that the state  Department of Justice estimates that the bill would annually catch an  additional 10,000 people who are not legally eligible to buy firearms.  </P> <P> He said such people now get guns "and then shoot up their neighborhoods, their  families. . . . Think about it -- 15-days to buy the most lethal weapons. Is  that unreasonable where we would catch 10,000 people who shouldn't own these  weapons?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Great Inconvenience'  </P> <P> But Sen. John Doolittle of Rocklin, the Republican caucus chairman, deplored  the bill as a "great inconvenience" to law-abiding gun buyers. He insisted that  it would not deter criminals who "are going to buy their guns just like they  buy their illegal drugs and keep on committing their crimes."  </P> <P> The restricted ammunition clip legislation would not apply to .22-caliber  rim-fire rifles or to competition target shooters.  </P> <P> Sen. Don Rogers (R-Bakersfield), a strong supporter of the NRA, said some  people living in "very isolated" desert regions of his sprawling district have  told him they fear the arrival of strangers and want no restrictions on gun  clips.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of people out here in California who may not be hunters or  sportsmen who still would like to have the freedom of choice . . . to protect  their homes and their families," he said.  </P> <P> Davis retorted: "There are people who would like a machine gun, but they can't  have it. With 15 rounds, you can scare the hell out of anybody."  </P> <P> Deukmejian has not taken a position on the bill.  </P></p>

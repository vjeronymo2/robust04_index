			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / International Bonds: Traders mark time as Columbus Day curbs activity THERE were relatively few new issues in the international bond market yesterday as the public holiday in the US restricted activity. However, syndicate managers expect a wide range of new issues to emerge over the next two weeks. Belgium is expected to raise Dollars 500m through a fixed-rate offering of 10-year Eurobonds, priced to yield about 30 basis points over underlying US treasuries. Banks made their bids for the deal yesterday and the mandate should be awarded today. Depfa, Germany's largest mortgage bank, could launch its Eurosterling issue today or tomorrow, via Salomon Brothers and UBS. The issue of 10-year Eurobonds is likely to raise about Pounds 500m and be priced to yield 20 to 25 basis points over UK government bonds. Regarding Turkey's planned Eurosterling issue, lead manager SG Warburg said that it was not in a position to comment on the details of the offering following news last Friday that Moody's, the international credit rating agency, had placed Turkey's long-term credit rating under review for possible downgrading. However, based on the feedback from investors following Moody's announcement, SG Warburg remained optimistic that the deal could be launched during the course of this week. Banco Bamerindus, Brazil's third-largest private-sector bank, is expected to launch a Dollars 100m offering of five-year Eurobonds next Monday. Mr Anthony Pain, the bank's international and corporate director, said the bonds were likely to be priced to yield between 450 and 475 basis points over underlying US Treasuries. The market is waiting for two issues from the European Community, one denominated in Ecu and the other in D-Marks. Among yesterday's issues, Fisons, the UK pharmaceuticals company, made its first public bond issue since 1986 when it raised Pounds 100m through an offering of 10-year Eurobonds. The yield spread of 120 basis points over gilts was seen to be fair in view of the company's lack of a credit rating and the residual negative sentiment following its poor equity performance. The bonds closed at 98.70 bid, with the spread intact. Fokker, the Dutch aircraft manufacturer in which Daimler-Benz took a majority stake via its Deutsche Aerospace subsidiary last April, raised DM500m through an offering of five-year Eurobonds. A put option on the bonds was seen as an insurance policy for investors who had bought the bonds because of Daimler's commitment to building Europe's leading aircraft manufacturing group. Bondholders can exercise the put option in 1996 if Deutsche Aerospace decides to take its stake in Fokker below 50 per cent. Minus full fees, the bonds were priced to yield 81 basis points over medium-term German government notes. The bonds were trading at 99.30 bid in the afternoon, within fees.</p>

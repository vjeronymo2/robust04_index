			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: N-plant costings attacked THE Public Accounts Committee yesterday accused the government of complacency in estimating the cost of scrapping nuclear facilities. Mr Robert Sheldon, the Labour chairman of the House of Commons watchdog on public spending, expressed fears that a heavy burden could fall on the taxpayer if present government estimates of the costs proved to be wrong. He said: 'I see a lot of assumptions made, not taking into account the very serious consequences if you get it wrong.' The committee is examining this month's National Audit Office report on nuclear decommissioning, which put the total cost of scrapping nuclear power stations and fuel plants, as well as some military facilities, at Pounds 17.9bn. Uncertainty over future nuclear liabilities disrupted the electricity privatisation three years ago and nuclear facilities were left in government hands. Sir Peter Gregson, permanent secretary at the department of trade and industry, said that the government currently believed that the costs of decommissioning the facilities of the generators Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear would be covered by the companies' provisions. The government has undertaken to pay for the eventual scrapping of the Atomic Energy Authority's facilities, and some of those of British Nuclear Fuels. However Mr Michael Stern, Conservative MP for Bristol North West, said that the government's record of estimating decommissioning costs had been 'abysmal'.</p>

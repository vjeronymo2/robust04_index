			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A civilian technical expert was fired by the Navy after he complained of faulty  radar equipment, the Hartford Courant reported. Joseph C. Richards, 42, of  Lyme, Conn., told the paper he was dismissed from the Navy's Supervisor of  Shipbuilding office in the Electric Boat Shipyard at Groton, Conn., after he  reported problems with electronic towed array sonar systems towed behind  688-Class attack submarines. Richards, who is appealing his dismissal, said  that because of mistakes made at Electric Boat, a division of General Dynamics  Corp., sonar systems worth millions of dollars sometimes must be abandoned to  keep the tow cable from fouling the submarine's propeller.  </P></p>

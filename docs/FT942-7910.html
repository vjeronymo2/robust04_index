			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Major gives veto pledge as Euro-poll battle starts: Launch of manifestos sees PM's record come under fire Mr John Major last night put preservation of Britain's national veto at the heart of the Conservative campaign for the European elections as opposition parties said the June 9 poll would be a referendum on his leadership. The launch of the three main parties' European manifestos saw the political truce which followed the death of Mr John Smith disintegrate into a furious row over how much power each was ready to cede to Brussels. Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour leader, and Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said the elections would give voters the opportunity to judge the 'dismal' record of Mr Major's government. But at a rally last night in Bristol, Mr Major launched a bitter attack on his opponents' European policies: 'The other parties believe in a federal European state . . . they would put our national veto at risk.' Using language calculated to appeal to Tory Euro-sceptics, the prime minister insisted the Conservatives were alone in offering an absolute commitment to preserve the national veto. He said: 'Conservative policy will always be governed - first, last and always - by cool calculation of Britain's national interests.' Earlier, Mr Major had issued a plea to disgruntled Tory supporters not to protest at the government's domestic policies by staying at home on June 9, insisting: 'This election is not some trivial opinion poll'. The prime minister's tone suggested that a carefully-crafted manifesto commitment to a positive approach to Europe would be accompanied on the campaign trail by a much tougher emphasis on the defence of British sovereignty. Mrs Beckett rejected the charge that Labour would give up the national veto in areas such as defence, foreign and taxation. She said the prime minister's comments were 'nothing short of despicable'. She added: 'He knows that he is lying about Labour's approach to the veto. But he doesn't care.' Mr Ashdown conceded that the Liberal Democrats would end the veto in most areas. But he stressed his party would decentralise decision-making in the EU. With all three parties sensing the national mood favours sceptical rather than enthusiastic Europeanism, the Liberal Democrats hedged their commitment to a federal Europe with a promise of a referendum on the next stage of integration. Mr Major dismissed the idea, arguing the 1996 intergovernmental conference would not lead to any further shift in sovereignty from Britain to the EU. He said there was no prospect in the foreseeable future of a single European currency. But Mrs Beckett revealed a significant shift in her party's policy by leaving open the possibility that it might back a plebiscite on the outcome of the 1996 conference. The clearest division between the main parties was on the social chapter of the Maastricht Treaty. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats said they would sign up immediately while Mr Major said that would cause British job losses. The Conservative manifesto struck a balance between underlining a commitment to Britain's place in Europe and attacking the alleged plans of the opposition parties to support a European superstate. As Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, dismissed the possibility of an early return by sterling to the European exchange rate mechanism, Mr Major denied there were any divisions within the cabinet over the government's platform. Labour and the Liberal Democrats insisted in their manifestos that Conservative divisions and the opt-outs from the social chapter and a single currency had left Britain powerless on the sidelines of Europe.

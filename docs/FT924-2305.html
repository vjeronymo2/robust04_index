			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Weak response to bleak economic outlook - Growth THE economic recovery initiative at the summit may, with luck, add a little to EC growth next year. But the package, which EC leaders hope will support investment of more than Ecu30bn (Pounds 24bn) through new Community loans and guarantees, falls far short of addressing the EC's real economic problems and is unlikely to prevent further rises in unemployment. At Edinburgh, neither the leaders nor their finance ministers tackled seriously the issue of Germany's deficit financing of eastern Germany and the current problems of the European Monetary System. Yet it is Germany's inability to reduce rapidly its dependence on borrowing for the new Lander that transmits high short-term interest rates to the other members of the European exchange rate mechanism and has contributed to recent strains in the European Monetary System. The EC package skirts round these fundamental problems. Instead member states are encouraged to manage their economies more efficiently in the hope that this will encourage investment. They are urged, where possible, to divert public spending to infrastructure and capital projects away from current spending such as wages. At Community level, these efforts are to be topped up by the mobilisation of new funds through the European Investment Bank (EIB) and a new European Investment Fund (EIF) with the aim of supporting investments of Ecu30bn or more over the next few years. Mr Norman Lamont, the UK Chancellor, said the two funds 'were important and imaginative initiatives that involved very substantial amounts of money that would lead to more investment.' The EIF will be capitalised at Ecu2bn, to be subscribed 40 per cent by the EIB, 30 per cent by the Commission and 30 per cent by financial institutions. This capital will enable it to give guarantees worth between Ecu5bn and Ecu10bn for projects to be carried out with other organisations. These projects, which could include investment in small and medium sized companies as well as infrastructure spending, could, the EC leaders hope, be worth up to Ecu20bn. In addition, the EIB will create a new 'lending facility' that will allow it to extend credits totalling Ecu5bn to co-finance infrastructure investment in the Community in 1993 and 1994. According to Mr Henning Christophersen, the economic affairs commissioner, the money will be used largely to finance 'missing links' in the EC's transport system. These will include improved cross-border motorway, rail and gas pipeline links inside the EC. The EIB may also use the funds to finance projects in central and eastern Europe, perhaps jointly with the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Mr Christophersen said the Ecu5bn in loans could support projects worth Ecu12bn. Mr Lamont was more cautious, putting the likely investment at Pounds 7bn or Ecu8.5bn. To allow the EIB to operate more flexibly, the summit agreed that it will be able to use the new facility to provide a maximum of 75 per cent of planned financing for projects compared with its normal participation ceiling of 50 per cent. The combined loan and grant ceiling for projects with a grant element will be raised to 90 per cent from 70 per cent. The growth initiative was the summit's response to an increasingly bleak economic outlook in the EC. Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, had told fellow leaders that the meeting had to make its relevance clear to the people of Europe by focusing on jobs and growth. Mr Christophersen said growth next year was unlikely to be much more than 1 per cent after 1.1 per cent to 1.2 per cent this year. EC unemployment, at a around 11 per cent next year, would be back at the levels of the mid-1980s, he said. Capacity utilisation in industry was only 79 per cent. Inflation was falling, but not sufficiently to pave the way for a decline in interest rates. National measures, including wage restraint, could make an important contribution to lowering borrowing costs, he said. But lower interest rates were not sufficient in themselves to boost investment. Many companies and consumers were caught in a debt trap. For that reason, the Community had decided on its growth initiative. The new facilities, which should be ready to start operating in about six months' time, will be flanked by increased spending on poorer EC countries through the so-called cohesion funds agreed at the summit. The EC also intends to improve the management and efficiency of its research funding and place more emphasis on training. Mr Christophersen also stressed the importance of completing the single market, progressing with deregulation and privatisation, speeding up the approval of common norms and standards and introducing tax incentives for investment. In their final statement, the leaders ruled out any large-scale fiscal boost by reaffirming their determination to fulfil the tough economic convergence criteria in the Maastricht treaty. Although some member states - notably Germany - had approached the idea of a growth initiative with scepticism, the summit communique said the leaders were 'convinced' that the measures would boost confidence and growth and create jobs. However, Mr Christophersen indicated that the loan and guarantee package would not make up for a recession-induced shortfall of investment in the EC, which he estimated at about Ecu40bn next year. The success of the package will depend on how far companies, organisations and governments link up with the EIB and EIF to exploit the new loans and guarantees. The commissioner said many EC transport projects had been identified which could profit from the schemes and also suggested that there could be a positive 'announcement effect' from the summit. But such optimism could not disguise the age old problem with such projects. Measures such as the EIF and special EIB facility are meant to create confidence. But they can only boost the economy if there is sufficient confidence among investors to want to use such facilities in the first place.</p>

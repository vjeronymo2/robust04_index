			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Personal View: Capitalist tools for Chinese workers China's embrace of 'market-based so-cialism' requires that its policymakers turn to a new mix of policy tools for managing their economy. With more than 13 per cent growth last year, mismanagement could lead to economic overheating and a 'hard landing' similar to that seen in 1989. As this economic dynamo gropes towards 'socialism with Chinese characteristics', its reformers should search abroad for adaptable financing techniques to ease the way. For example, to rein in 20 per cent urban inflation, Beijing is again requiring that workers buy government bonds. The accompanying discontent could be softened by allowing workers to swap the bonds for shares in their employer. This would remove the need to pay inflation-fuelling interest payments and transform the forced savings into an investment whose value could be influenced by the workers' efforts. France's recent sale of 'Balladur bonds' offers a precedent, where purchasers were allowed to exchange this public debt for shares in Banque Nationale de Paris or any other French privatisation. Such worker-oriented swaps could help motivate China's dispirited workforce  -a key challenge facing both the old and the new socialism. Certainly, worker ownership should cause no ideological nose bleed, even among the most conservative members of the state council. Employees of state-owned enterprises could also be allowed to exchange employer-held Beijing bonds for a stake both in their employer and its suppliers and distributors. This would help to foster a commercial commonality of interest similar to Japan's Keiretsu-based 'communitarian capitalism'. Likewise, where China's banks hold poor-performing loans, that debt could be swapped for equity - akin to Germany's 'stake-holder capitalism' where lenders often hold client shares. With proper training, China's bureaucratic bankers could be transformed into a positive force for economic reform. As bank-monitored companies grow stronger, they could again turn to loans - to repurchase these shares from workers via an employee stock ownership plan (Esop), a financing technique utilised in more than 10,000 US and UK corporations. Esops could also provide a market for foreign investors' shares, offering a means for transforming foreign capital into politically palatable worker ownership - while also enhancing China's appeal to those investors worried about a ready exit for their funds. Similar financial hybrids also hold promise. For example, due to a propensity among Chinese to save, economic reformers live with the spectre of a potentially inflationary currency 'overhang' (Chinese banks hold savings totalling some 15 months' wages for every worker). The frustration of the Chinese at the lack of alternative investments became apparent last year in Shenzhen when a shortage of shares in a public offering led to a riot. Also troubling for reformers' efforts is the tendency of state-run banks to funnel nationwide savings into urban locales, including speculative real estate, starving the rural sector of capital. Encouraging workers to invest in their employer is an obvious first step. As the next logical step, residents in certain communities could be allowed to buy shares in companies located in those communities. In addition to soaking up local savings, such mechanisms would also provide local companies with a needed, non-bank source of funds. Such investment vehicles could mimic capital markets, but without the absentee capitalist aspect shunned by socialist ideologists. Also, granting locals access to mechanisms for investing savings locally can boost national savings and dampen inflation. Financial engineering could help replace dwindling provincial tax revenues. For example, service-providers (electricity, telecommunications, etc) could allow consumers to invest in bonds, with proceeds earmarked to finance local services. Those bonds, in turn, could be swapped for shares paying in-kind dividends (such as telecommunication services). Farmers holding state-issued IOUs could be allowed to swap a portion of that debt for shares in support services, such as a fertiliser plant, collecting in-kind dividends similar to those paid by farmers' co-operatives worldwide. China has a historic opportunity to design an extraordinary economy, combining prosperity with political stability. Importantly, reformers could ensure that China is owned largely by working Chinese. The challenges are immense. Yet with financial creativity and experimentation, China can tap the dynamism of market forces and remain true to its core principles.

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Technology: How to disable a virus Researchers in the UK unveiled a new approach to vaccination at a medical conference in the US last month. The scientists from Cambridge and Sheffield Universities and Cantab, a Cambridge biotechnology company, have discovered how to disable a virus in such a way that it can activate a full immune response but not spread within its host. The DISC (Disabled Infectious Single Cycle) approach is being developed first for herpes. By deleting one gene (for glycoprotein H) the scientists have created a virus which is capable of only one complete round of replication but which looks normal to the host cells. Animal studies show that the DISC herpes virus can protect successfully against infection. It induces protective immunity much more effectively than vaccination with conventional inactivated virus. Now Cantab plans to move on to human clinical trials, probably starting next year. Alan Munro, Cantab research director, says the company wants to produce a vaccine against HSV-2, the virus that causes genital herpes. It could prevent infection in the first place or it could stop the symptoms recurring in people who had already become infected. Although there are competing technologies for making vaccines by disabling or attenuating viruses, the Cantab scientists believe DISC gives the fullest range of immune responses - and therefore the best protection against infection. In principle, it should be possible to extend the DISC approach to vaccines against other viruses. 'We're thinking about other potential targets,' Munro says. 'Selecting targets is always a combination of assessing clinical need and technical feasibility. 'Unfortunately the technical problems with the viruses where the need is greatest, such as HIV, are quite substantial.'</p>

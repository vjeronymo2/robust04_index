			<p>BFN     [Text] The first Brazilian trade mission since the  reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Vietnam in 1989  departed on 15 April for Hanoi. The group, which is headed by  Ambassador Celso Marcos, chief of the Itamaraty Trade Promotion  Department, is made up of diplomats and representatives of  several sectors of the economy.    The trip's purpose is to detect business opportunities as a  result of the Vietnamese economic opening since the end of last  year. The civil construction, energy and electricity, oil and  petrochemical, agrobusiness, and car parts industries are  represented in the mission, AGENCIA BRASIL has reported.    The Vietnamese Government already has informed Itamaraty of  its interest in developing economic and trade relations with  Brazil, especially in infrastructure projects. There are  considerable possibilities in other fields, another Brazilian  diplomat said. Thus, these contacts may increase bilateral  trade, like in the fields of food and heavy machinery  manufacturing.    The oil field also is interesting for Brazil, which is why  Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation], Braspetro  [Petrobras International, Inc.], and Furnas [Furnas Electric  Power Plants, Inc.] have sent representatives on this mission.    Foreign Minister Celso Amorim believes the intensification  of relations with Vietnam may open new markets for Brazilian  companies as well as for Vietnamese companies. Last year,  Brazilian exports to Vietnam were $4.2 million, while imports  from there were $13.5 million. Brazil imported nearly $3 million  worth of rice alone. The main goods exported by Brazil were  chemical products and industrial equipment.    The rapprochement with Vietnam is part of the Brazilian  Foreign Ministry's strategy to increase trade with the Asian  countries that have had the greatest economic growth indexes in  the whole world in the past few years. Nearly 16 percent of  Brazilian international trade is carried out with this region.  Trade with this region, according to Itamaraty, is well below  its potential.    Beside the mission that went to Hanoi, Itamaraty also will  demonstrate interest in intensifying diplomatic relations with  Vietnam by choosing a building for a Brazilian embassy. The  Brazilian Embassy in Singapore is currently responsible for  Brazilian interests in Vietnam.</p>

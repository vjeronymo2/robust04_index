			<p>940411 FT  11 APR 94 / Pakistan and US deny deadlock Pakistan and the US yesterday concluded talks without progress on Washington's proposal to supply up to 38 F-16 fighter aircraft in return for a verifiable cap on Islamabad's alleged nuclear weapons programme. However, the departure of Mr Strobe Talbott, US deputy secretary of state and the most senior US official to visit Pakistan for almost six years, was followed by a joint statement in which both sides played down any suggestion of a deadlock. The two countries said they would continue efforts towards halting, then reducing and finally eliminating weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles in South Asia. But they gave few indications on specific steps to promote that goal. Mr Talbott's arrival in Islamabad followed weeks of speculation over Washington's latest efforts to encourage Pakistan to open its nuclear facilities for a one-off inspection, to verify that the programme is capped at a level below that required to produce fissile material. In return, Washington offered to supply up to 38 of the 71 F-16 fighter aircraft which Pakistan had ordered four years ago. Despite Islamabad's payment of almost Dollars 650m (Pounds 445.2m) towards the Dollars 1.4bn dollar deal, their delivery has been blocked by concerns over the nuclear issue. The US offer was rejected by Pakistani leaders including Gen Abdul Waheed, the chief of the army staff. Islamabad says any move to open up unilaterally its facilities without forcing India to do the same would compromise security interests. However, both sides emphasised that they had much in common as a basis for close relations. 'The end of the cold war has unquestionably put some strain on our relationship these past few years,' acknowledged Mr Talbott, in a reference to Pakistan's role in former US attempts to resist Soviet expansion.</p>

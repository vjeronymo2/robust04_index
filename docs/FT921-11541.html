			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Arts: Faure's Requiem - Queen Elizabeth Hall Tuesday's Faure Requiem was given by the Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique, (fancy name]), the Monteverdi Choir and a group of boy choristers from Salisbury Cathedral under John Eliot Gardiner. In itself it proved so complete an experience, so transportingly beautiful, so fully committed to communicating the substance of this extraordinary masterpiece, that one almost forgot an important point was being emphasised thereby. Faure's original form of scoring for the work, for chamber forces, was highly personal and imaginative; but it was disapproved of by his publishers and eventually suppressed in favour of the familiar later one for large forces more conventionally disposed. In recent years there have been several attempts at reconstruction of the chamber Requiem (followed by notable recordings); this latest had the benefit of a new edition (soon to be published) by the leading Faure scholar Jean-Michel Nectoux, along with the Roger Delage, which draws on autograph material found at the Madeleine in Paris. It is wholly convincing in vocal and instrumental layout, more so (I think) than any previous effort of Faure rediscovery. Hearing the Requiem this way exposes with new potency of impact and intensity of detail the singular, unrepeatable greatness of its artistic conception. Too often, in all but the most stylishly disciplined of 'traditional' performances, one feels the musical invention being swamped by the sound, or else the players and singers being tethered to a semi-perpetual level of polite mezzoforte in order to allow a balance of parts to be maintained. The fewer the participants, the greater the possibility for keen, pointed musical attack, for unfettered involvement and a wide range of dynamics in all the lines - and the greater the expressive power to be tapped from the notes. Gardiner understands the power of those notes. His reading, underpinned by a cleanly purposeful rhythmic tread, lightly floated in its melodic lines, entirely free of both churchy sentimentality and musicological piety, was a marvellous example of this conductor's interpretative art. The economy and intimacy of the music, its capacity for saying so much, so deeply, with so little flounce or excess verbiage, seem his natural territory; the sound of the performance and the sense of the music were made inextricable. The choice of soloists - the admirably grave but unpompous Swiss bass-baritone Gilles Cachemaille and Catherine Bott the bright, true soprano  -was part of the same process. It goes without saying that a chamber-sized Requiem places an added burden of accuracy and control on its executants, which all here shouldered with unarguable confidence and authority. The first half was a spread of wonderful French a capella choral music, by Saint-Saens, Debussy and Poulenc (Un Soir de neige and the shattering Figure humaine), wonderfully delivered by the Monteverdi Choir. Altogether, this was a concert of exceptional richness.</p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee producers 'may have to go it alone' COFFEE PRODUCING countries, many of which are finding it difficult to pay growers a subsistence wage, are increasingly realising that they may have to take unilateral action to rescue their industries from impending collapse, according to the latest monthly market report from GNI, the London futures brokers. When the International Coffee Organisation meets from September 21 to 30 in London producers will finally discover how serious consumers are about a new international pact. 'Further delays in negotiations or consumer insistence on an unrealistic price range will force the origins (producers) to go it alone.' With arabica coffee prices near 50 cents a lb and robustas near 30 cents, producers are united in believing prices need to rise. However, before taking action they would have to overcome the mistrust that followed the collapse of the international coffee agreement's export quota system in July 1989. The necessary trust to work together should prices rally to 70 cents a lb 'may not yet be in place', says GNI. The best chance for co-operative action lies with the arabica producers. More than 80 per cent of the world's best arabica is grown in Central and South America. Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua already speak as one at the ICO 'and would probably act as a cohesive unit in an arabica cartel' along with Brazil and Colombia, the two biggest producers. The cartel would first have to tackle the consumer stockpile of 18m bags (60 kg each). Of this 5m bags is stored in US warehouses and certified for delivery against the New York arabica futures market. 'At 50 cents a lb the arabica cartel could theoretically buy all the excess exchange stocks for around Dollars 330m or just a fraction of the Dollars 5.2bn which the Brazilian government has made available to its farmers to finance the 1992-93 coffee harvest,' GNI points out. But it adds that the US authorities will 'not be a willing party to any outside attempt to push up coffee prices'. The robusta producers would find it much more difficult to act together as the production from 36 countries is spread again across Africa, Asia and America.</p>

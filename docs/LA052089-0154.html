			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PHOTOGRAPHY: PORTRAITIST HAS CAMERA, WILL TRAVEL  </P> <P> Once a year, photographer Steve Dawson of Newport Beach steps out of his world  of high-glitz portrait studio work, forgets about pleasing clients and solving  problems, and takes pictures just for the fun of it.  </P> <P> For 10 years, Dawson has gone on photographic safaris with a small group of  portrait photographers from all over California.  </P> <P> "We all got into photography because we loved it," said Dawson, 35. "It was a  real passion. In turn, we were all able to make a living at it and start our  own business. We love photography and do it every day but to be able to . . .  do something in the fine art or photojournalist field aspect (is great). It's  almost like therapy. . . . Instead of pleasing the client, I please myself."  </P> <P> If the contrast of scenery weren't enough, Dawson also switches camera formats,  from the 2 1/4-inch Hasselblad or Mamiya that he uses for portraits to a Canon  35-millimeter for his travel photography.  </P> <P> The 35-millimeter is "a lot faster; it gives you the ability to move a lot  quicker," he said.  </P> <P> The trips have varied since the first one the group took, a camping trip to the  ghost town of Bodie, Calif. Other trips have been to Yosemite, Death Valley,  the Grand Tetons, Bryce Canyon, China and Kenya.  </P> <P> "We get up at dawn and photograph all the sunrises, shoot all day and then  photograph the sunset," Dawson said.  </P> <P> Forty 12-by-18-inch color prints of Dawson's images from China and Kenya are on  exhibit through next Friday at his studio, Dawson &amp; Associates, 4001  Westerly Place, Suite 103, Newport Beach. The hours are from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.  For more information call: (714) 833-7816.  </P> <P> Currently Dawson shoots formal portraits, glamour shots, corporate work, family  groups, weddings and senior portraits. He received most of his experience while  working as the general manager for Dunlop-Turney, one of the largest portrait  studios in Glendale, where his wife, Toni, also worked. After 10 years, they  selected Newport Beach for their own studio and have been in business there for  2 1/2 years.  </P> <P> "We wanted to live in an area we would really enjoy," he said. "Also, we needed  a market for the type of work we produce. The areas of Newport Beach, Irvine  and Costa Mesa are just perfect. We've had a great acceptance."  </P> <P> Dawson finds a dramatic difference between photography in his studio and on his  safaris. He especially liked China, which has only been open to Americans since  1974, because it was still rare to see foreigners in some parts.  </P> <P> "We were able to get out into the countryside," he said. "They had not seen  Westerners before. They were fascinated by us and curious. They were very warm  and friendly.  </P> <P> "One of the things I did, being a portrait photographer, was to take a Polaroid  camera. We would go out into areas and start walking, especially in the small  towns and villages, and then shoot Polaroids.  </P> <P> "The people there had never been photographed before. You would get the entire  village watching the picture develop. At the same time one of us would be  shooting Polaroids while the others would be shooting chromes (Kodachromes). It  was a fabulous experience. You couldn't speak the language, but the picture  said it all."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Former President Jaime Paz Zamora has announced his  definitive withdrawal from political life and his party  leadership. Paz Zamora was distressed by the numerous  accusations that he permitted the creation of a drug trafficking  network within his administration and that many of the leaders  of his party participated in it. Jaime Paz Zamora sent the media  a recorded message in which he said he did not commit any  crimes, he only made mistakes in good faith.    [Begin recording] [Paz Zamora] My dear fellow countrymen,  from the day of my last speech during the inauguration on 6  August of 1993...    [Unidentified reporter, interrupting] Paz's face was  slimmer.  The dramatic moment showed on the former president. He is  obviously affected by the drama afflicting his party and many  important MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left] leaders.  Jaime Paz Zamora faced the camera sure that millions of citizens  would hear his definitive decision to withdraw from political  life. He was overwhelmed by the accusations made by the Special  Antinarcotics Force [FELCN] that he permitted the alleged  coverup of drug trafficking activities during his government and  that some of the leaders of his party had direct participation  in it.    He was firm at the beginning of his message and had a  hopeless look at the end. The former president used his farewell  speech to try to instill hope in citizens who today have major  doubts about his performance as head of state.    [Paz Zamora] I want to give my version of the latest reports  linking us with drug trafficking that have shocked the country.  The first thing I want to say on this matter, with all clarity  and firmness, is that we never committed any crime. But just as  clearly I must recognize, dear fellow countrymen, that there  were mistakes, lack of prudence, or incorrect appreciation of  situations and behavior. I also must admit to maintaining  relations with some people in a good faith that was close to  naivete.    [Reporter] Jaime Paz Zamora later said that it seems there  are too many ill-intentioned attitudes. It seems that it is not  important to seek the truth but to inflict political damage, he  added. I cannot permit, he said, that by tarnishing my dignity  as a former president that the issue will continue tarnishing my  country's dignity.    [Paz Zamora] Dear fellow countrymen, listen to me well. With  the same love and respect I always had for you, with calm and  firmness, I want to announce that I have made the undeclinable  decision to withdraw from the party leadership and national  political activities. You have known me for many years. I have  always acted in good faith, with good will, in all matters and  with all people. I have acted under the guidance of moral  principles that I learned from my family and the Bolivian  people. Achievements have a prize; mistakes produce consequences  that must be admitted with honor and dignity.    [Reporter] This is what Jaime Paz Zamora said on 26 March.  He  did not want to answer questions. This is why he sent the  recorded message to the most important radio and television  stations and newspapers. The man who founded MIR on 7 September  1971, who for many years was an active and charismatic leader,  who was almost killed during an attack because he was an alleged  nuisance to the 1980 dictatorship, the man who on 6 August 1989  was sworn in as president of the Republic, was thus withdrawing  from political life. He assured and admitted to the people that  he had made mistakes but did not commit any crime. [end  recording]</p>

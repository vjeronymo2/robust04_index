An official source from the Vidin  police announced this at a news conference today. Following  questioning, 18 of the 21 persons were released. The three  remaining in custody for further questioning are the ship's  captain Kostadin Stoyanov, 39, from Ruse; the captain's first  mate, Atanas Denchev, also from Ruse; and the engineer, Dimitur  Krumov.    The only woman found on board was the wife of one of the  members of the crew and holds a seaman's passport, Nikolay  Dechev, chief of the Vidin police, announced at the news  conference. In my personal opinion, the story of the hijacking  of the Khan Kubrat by armed persons is a put-on, he added. The  regional police chief said that the entire operation of  detaining the vessel at 1500 on 13 March was carried out  superbly and that the organization had worked perfectly.    The National Investigation Service opened an investigation  into the case on 8 March, and its investigations will extend to  several regions: Vidin, Pleven, Blagoevgrad, and Ruse. Nikolay  Dechev believes that the investigation into the Khan Kubrat  incident will be concluded fairly soon.</p>

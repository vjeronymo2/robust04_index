			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Seoul warned on car imports The European Commission's deputy director general for industry has warned South Korea that pressure is mounting in Europe for a reduction of Korean car imports unless Seoul opens its market to foreign competition, Reuter reports from Seoul. In 1993, South Korea exported about 100,000 passenger cars to Europe but imported only 363 European cars. Foreign imports accounted for a mere 0.2 per cent of the total South Korean market of about 1m last year.</p>

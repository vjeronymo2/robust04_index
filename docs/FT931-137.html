			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Psion's Pounds 1.4m falls below expectations PSION, the manufacturer of hand held computers and data communications equipment, disappointed the City with profits before tax of only Pounds 1.4m against expectations of over Pounds 3m. Analysts were mollified, however, by the return to profitability - it lost Pounds 2.2m before tax last year - and by a 64 per cent increase in revenues generated through organic growth. The shares dipped 1p to 120p. Turnover was Pounds 35.1m, compared with Pounds 21.3m, chiefly due to the success of the Series 3 hand-held computer, successor to the Organiser. Mr David Potter, founder and chairman, said some 103,000 units had been sold to date. Sales of the Series 3 totalled Pounds 18.2m in 1992 compared with Pounds 1.9m. Earnings per share came to 4.33p against losses of 8.13p. A proposed final dividend of 1.5p makes a total for the year of 2.5p (2.4p). Psion, once among the cream of UK high technology stocks, has still to prove it can fulfil its early promise. Gross profit margins last year were lower than budget resulting in a less than satisfactory return on sales, Mr Potter said. Analysts are predicting pre-tax profits of Pounds 3m this year, equivalent to earnings per share of 9p and a prospective multiple of 13.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Riyad Mansur in Amman] </F>   [Excerpt] The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has  stated that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's meeting with  King Fahd was not genuine, but artificial. It added that the  Tunis [PLO] leadership thinks the world supports it at a time  when the Palestinian Oslo group began to split up. Hamas said  the U.S. Administration is trying to activate the Syrian track  to make up for the stalled Palestinian track.    Official Hamas Spokesman Engineer Ibrahim Ghawshah urged Dr.  Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi to join the Palestinian opposition because  it is the origin. He accused Faysal al-Husayni of representing  a phenomenon opposed to that of his father. He urged him to  stop following this path and return to the road followed by  'Abd-al-Qadir al-Husayni, the martyr of Palestine.    Ghawshah told SAWT AL-SHA'B that no force can prevent Hamas  from performing its duty and struggling against the Israeli  occupation. [passage omitted]</p>

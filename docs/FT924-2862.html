			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / International Company News: GM faces truck safety probe A US federal government agency has launched an investigation into the safety of pick-up trucks made by lossmaking General Motors which could lead to the costly recall of nearly 5m of the vehicles. The action by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration follows complaints from consumer groups that the trucks, made by GM between 1973 and 1987, have unsafe petrol tanks. The tanks are fitted outside the vehicle's heavy steel frame and are alleged to be vulnerable to rupture and catch fire if the truck is hit from the side. Ms Marion Blakey, administrator of the NHTSA, said the investigation did not mean the agency had decided there was a safety defect. However, further analysis was required. There are some 4.7m of the trucks on the road and a recall to correct any safety problems would be extremely costly for GM when it is struggling to regain profitability. The company has defended the safety of the vehicles but it suffered a setback last week when the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety said the trucks had 'an unnecessarily high risk of fire'.</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / MPs cast doubt on benefits from freed gas market A cross-party committee of MPs yesterday cast doubt on claims that the planned liberalisation of the domestic gas market would lead to substantial savings for consumers. The Commons trade and industry committee said in a report which gave a guarded welcome to liberalisation that consumers would benefit from a choice of supplier, and some cost savings were likely. But Mr Richard Caborn, the committee's Labour chairman, said there was no evidence that liberalisation would bring 'immediate and substantial price cuts'. Many prospective rivals of British Gas have predicted that competition could result in savings of as much as 10 per cent on current prices. Mr Caborn's view was echoed by Conservative committee members. Mr John Butterfill said the abolition of British Gas's monopoly on supplying 18m households was unlikely to produce a 'consumer bonanza'. The government and several independent gas marketing companies disagreed. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said he would be surprised if 'a very significant number of consumers' were not offered such discounts when the market was opened in 1996. Several independent gas marketers yesterday said they stuck by their forecasts of 10 per cent price cuts. Mr Caborn said the committee found that the scope for reductions was limited as a high proportion of costs were fixed. He said only '25 per cent of the total price of gas would be open to competition'. The committee welcomed the government's 'more pragmatic' approach to liberalisation. Two modest regional pilot programmes are planned in 1996 and 1997 before full competition in 1998. The committee was also assured that competition would not result in 'millions of losers' as British Gas had claimed in the past. But Mr Caborn said parliament should receive a full report on the performance of the pilot programmes before full liberalisation was allowed to proceed. Mr Eggar said it 'gives me no problem' if the committee wanted to stay close to the issue. But he was less receptive to the committee's suggestion that the new gas bill address detailed concerns. Both the Department of Trade and Industry and Ofgas, the industry regulator, prefer that the primary legislation be kept relatively short, with the detailed conditions of competition contained in the new public gas supply licenses being prepared by Ofgas. The committee agreed that the introduction of competition would lead to differences in pricing for various categories of gas customers. But it emphasised that there should be no unfair discrimination against low volume users.</p>

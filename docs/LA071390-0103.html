			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 'JEFF AND JER' BOOST MORNING RATINGS FOR B100 RADIO  </P> <P> Two months after making a well-publicized jump from KKYY-FM (Y95)to KFMB-FM  (B100), morning pranksters Jerry St. James and Jeff Elliott have established  themselves as the morning team to beat, according to the Arbitron ratings  released Wednesday for the spring quarter.  </P> <P> In addition to a dramatic increase in B100's morning ratings share, the new  ratings book shows the contemporary hits format of KKLQ (Q106) in first place  overall, the position it has held for the past three years, with a 9.4 rating  share among listeners 12 and over, down from a 10.3 share in the winter book.  </P> <P> KSON, simulcast on AM (1240) and FM (97.3), again posted big numbers with its  country format. After a respectable 6.7 share in the winter book, KSON moved up  to a 7.5 share among listeners 12 and over in the spring, placing it second  overall. The rock 'n' roll of KGB was third in the 12-plus category with a 7.1  rating share, up from a 6.1 in the winter.  </P> <P> Big jumps also were recorded by KCBQ-FM (105.3), which moved from a 2.6 to a  3.6 with its oldies rock, and XHTZ (Z90), which switched from rock 'n' roll to  a contemporary urban format in the spring and jumped from a .8 to a 1.9 share.  </P> <P> A ratings share represents the percentage of the listening audience that tuned  to the station for at least five minutes in an average quarter hour. Although  they illustrate the overall size of a station's listening audience, the 12 and  over numbers are generally discounted by radio station executives, who market  their stations to specific demographic groups.  </P> <P> Overall, KGB was number one in the 18-34 category, followed by Q106 and XTRA-FM  (91X), while KSON won among listeners 25-54, followed by KGB, Q106 and the  "Lites Out" jazz of KIFM (98.1).  </P> <P> "There was more listenership in this book," although KIFM's ratings dropped  slightly, said KIFM General Manager Bruce Walton. "We're doing a good job of  keeping our listeners around, especially in the spring when (the start of  Padres) baseball affects our men listeners."  </P> <P> In the case of "Jeff and Jer," B100 scored big in the 25-54 age group, its key  demographic target audience. In the last ratings book, for the winter quarter,  B100 was ranked fifth in the morning among listeners 25-54 with a 6.0, while  Y95 with "Jeff and Jer" was sixth with a 5.6 share.  </P> <P> "Jeff and Jer" started work at B100 five weeks into the 12-week ratings period.  But there is no doubt they made a substantial impact, posting an 8.3 share  among listeners 25-54 years old. That was enough to move B100 into first place  in the morning in the key 25-54 group, ahead of KSON's Jack Diamond and Lisa  Bent with an 8.0 and the 7.1 rating posted by KFMB-AM's (760) Mac Hudson and  Joe Bauer.  </P> <P> B100 had been a perennial power in the morning since 1984, when the "B-Morning  Zoo" starring the "Rich Brothers" debuted. In April, though, the station dumped  the zoo concept and hired "Jeff and Jer."  </P> <P> The station promoted the new show heavily, including throwing a large party and  running television commercials featuring the duo with paper bags over their  heads, a tactic that arose when Y95 refused to allow B100 to use the names of  the pair until their Y95 contract expired.  </P> <P> To a certain degree, the numbers can be attributed to increased listener  sampling in the wake of numerous recent changes in morning programs.  </P> <P> "That might have made the (ratings) jump a little quicker," KFMB General  Manager Paul Palmer said. "We're dealing with people who were listening to the  Zoo, who we were trying to keep, and a number of people who came over from  other stations."  </P> <P> Overall, B100 showed only a slight increase in the 12 and over category, moving  from a 4.5 to a 4.8. KFMB-AM (760), buoyed by the San Diego Padres broadcasts,  went from a 4.6 ratings share to a 6.7.  </P> <P> In other significant ratings changes, the mellow music of KYXY-FM (96.5)  dropped from a 5.0 to a 3.7 among listeners 12 and over, but the equally mellow  format of KJQY-FM (Sunny 103) didn't pick up the slack. Once a ratings power,  when it was known as "KJOY," Sunny 103 and its slightly more upbeat format,  slipped from a 5.3 to a 4.4.  </P> <P> The new rock of XTRA-FM (91X) posted a slight gain in the 12 and over category,  going from a 4.3 to a 4.8 share, and KSDO-AM (1130) went from a 6.0 to a 5.7.  </P></p>

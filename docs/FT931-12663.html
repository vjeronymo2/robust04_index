			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Bid for RHM was considered by board TATE &amp; Lyle seriously considered making a bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall, the milling and baking group recently bought by Tomkins for Pounds 935m. Mr Neil Shaw, chairman, replying to a question at Tate's annual meeting, said it had decided not to go outside its core business, where further opportunities remained for global expansion. RHM would not have been value for money as more would have had to be spent to extend a new leg overseas. A diabetic shareholder asked when the new sweetener Splenda would be on the market after the disappointment of delayed regulatory approval in the US. Although it was already for sale in Canada, he was told the best estimate for its debut in the UK was two to three years. Another questioner expressed concern about group borrowings of nearly Pounds 900m, before cash and deposits, and gearing of nearly 90 per cent on net assets of Pounds 720.6m. He asked whether the group would benefit from UK base rate cuts. Mr Paul Lewis, finance director, said that with most of the debt in US dollars, the average interest rate paid had already come down to 7 per cent. The group was very cash generative and interest payments were covered five times by operating profit. Lower UK rates would reduce the return on sterling deposits.</p>

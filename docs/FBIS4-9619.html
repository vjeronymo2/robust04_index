			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Stipe Mesic, president of the Croatian </F> Parliament and founder of the Croatian Independent Democrats, by  Edita Vlahovic; place and date not given: "We Are Not Causing a  Crisis But Strengthening Croatia"]    [Text] [Vlahovic] Have you left the Croatian Democratic  Community [HDZ]?    [Mesic] No, not yet.    [Vlahovic] Is it not unusual that, while you are not only a  member of the ruling party but one of its leaders, you are  founding a new party?    [Mesic] Our membership will formally be canceled when we  found the party and when party documents are adopted at the  constituent assembly.    [Vlahovic] After Josip Manolic's replacement, you said you  feared that a large number of people would be persecuted on all  levels and in all HDZ structures. Has it come to that, and if  it has, how extensive is it?    [Mesic] Fortunately, it has not yet come to major  persecutions "on the vertical level," but there is roll calling.  Unfortunately, there have been unprecedented provocations  against Josip Manolic, president of the Chamber of Counties,  like those in the darkest Stalin period in Russia. Among those  who spoke up was the German HDZ Youth, which declared both  Manolic and myself bolshevik criminals. They even resort to  name calling. Meetings in villages and towns at which Manolic  is exposed are in full swing. Something like that is not  customary in democracy, but here, after confronting opinions,  there is public lynching. Therefore, we often go back to  totalitarianism.    [Vlahovic] Apart from Mr. Manolic, are other deputies also  under pressure?    [Mesic] All deputies suspected of joining myself and Joza  Manolic are being interviewed and questioned at present.    [Vlahovic] Who conducts those interviews?    [Mesic] Members of the presidency and the party president  himself.    [Vlahovic] After the discussion on Manolic, has the HDZ  Presidency talked about your dismissal, too?    [Mesic] They never discussed it, but it is not difficult to  conclude that it was just a matter of time when they would put  the subject on the agenda. I was the one who was attacked  first. Remember, they suggested that I leave the country so they  could finish some discussions, which I allegedly hindered. I  refused to do so and said the only thing I would do would be to  go on vacation. I could make that concession, as I underwent a  minor operation in the meantime and returned to work a month  later. Naturally, people think I would agree to a kind of  sinecure, but I did not become politically active with that in  mind. My goals are much bigger and I cannot be bought by  sinecure.  <H5>  Tudjman Is Neither a Leftist Nor a Rightist </H5>   [Vlahovic] What is actually the reason behind your conflict  with President Tudjman? In your opinion, is President Tudjman a  leftist or a rightist?    [Mesic] He is neither a leftist nor a rightist. He likes  authoritative power and thinks he can lead a party in a  bureaucrat-like manner, but that is impossible. A party is a  living being and cannot stand that kind of leadership.  Therefore, those of us who have been in the party since its  establishment are not satisfied with that kind of party  leadership. We wanted the HDZ to be a party that would realize  our program goals and become a democratic party that can discuss  all questions and that the decision of the majority be  implemented.    [Vlahovic] At what point did President Tudjman start to  deviate from those program principles?    [Mesic] When he started to interfere in all institutions of  the system, from the parliament to the judicial system.  Dictatorship is introduced by attacking institutions. We want  to defend institutions -- in other words, democracy.    [Vlahovic] Who, in your opinion, influences the politics of  President Tudjman the most?    [Mesic] Probably someone close to him. I have not been  close to him in about two years, so I do not know who is the  most influential. I think the president himself is the man, for  his vision of democracy is something that objectively is not  what he thinks it is.    [Vlahovic] Do you think they will attempt to dismiss you  from your position as president of the parliament?    [Mesic] I do not know what they will attempt to do, but the  issue of the ratio of powers in the parliament will be settled  right there. The way in which they went after Manolic was one  of the causes for my reaction. When, at the session of the  party presidency, we decided without voting -- I repeat, without  voting, for they keep claiming it was a unanimous decision, and  there was no ballot whatsoever -- to pass the case of Manolic on  to the court of honor, they should have done that. That would  be a democratic procedure. However, to telephone the parliament  to begin that action, right after or even during the session, to  collect 36 signatures that very day, that is Bolshevism at its  peak.  <H5>  New Relations in the Parliament </H5>   [Vlahovic] Parliamentary crisis is obviously mounting. Are  you going to cause early elections?    [Mesic] No, that is not the issue. This is all about new  relations in the parliament, which does not necessarily mean  early elections. This is not about the president of the  republic either. He has his constitutional authority and he must  do it, but those of us in the parliament have our constitutional  authority as well. Therefore, this will only strengthen the  autonomy of the parliament and democracy. There is no reason  for early elections, especially since we accept and support the  program of the government.    [Vlahovic] How will the founding of the Croatian Independent  Democrats influence the HDZ?    [Mesic] Some members of the HDZ who are not satisfied with  the implementation of original principles of the party will  surely join us or, to be precise, they will stay true to those  original principles, for they are our starting point.    [Vlahovic] What kind of reaction do you expect from the  state officials -- for example, from President Tudjman?    [Mesic] I expect more sensible politics, especially as it  has turned out, in the case of Josip Manolic, that parliament is  unlike any other institution. I hope that the president and the  people who advise him will realize that the question of  relations in the parliament is one thing and the question of  other institutions is quite another. Relations in the  parliament cannot be settled by extra-parliamentary games.    [Vlahovic] A part of the public, especially some political  parties, fear this could lead to a dictatorship.    [Mesic] There will be fewer of those fears after this, for  we are about to prove that we are a pluralistic and democratic  society and that democracy has deep roots here.    Warmongers Safe in Their Seats [subhead]    [Vlahovic] Are you counting on the support of the  opposition?    [Mesic] HDZ leaders have been trying to convince our  representatives that many members of the opposition will now  join the HDZ. We will see.    [Vlahovic] What do you think?    [Mesic] I think that is wrong information.    [Vlahovic] Do you think there is a connection between the  announced large number of strikes and those political  developments?    [Mesic] No, but we predicted it would come to that. By  means of monetary technology, we curbed inflation and reached  the point where we must increase production and involvement of  capital. Furthermore, to be involved in a war, which we are  supporting in this or that way -- it is quite clear that we  supported the Herzegovina Croats in their conflict with the  Muslims -- this unnecessary and absurd war, which brought  nothing but death and destruction to both the Croats and the  Muslims, to finally sign the agreement on confederation. And  now to interpret this as a natural consequence is an offense to  all those who were involved and paid a high price for the war.  We must say how much the war cost, where the money from sold  apartments and companies goes, and where the money given by the  Croatian emigration is. For I know very well that some  countries offered to give us weapons for free, and was it  necessary to purchase and pay a high price for something we  could get for free? We could get weapons from countries that  support us, provided we stop the conflict with the Muslims.  However, the conflict kept escalating.    And now, some people in Bosnia-Herzegovina who initiated the  conflict between the Croats and the Muslims are firmly holding  their positions and are probably trying to thwart the Washington  agreement.  <H5>  We Must Find Out Where the Money Went </H5>   [Vlahovic] You mentioned the money given by the Croatian  emigration with regard to embezzlement several times. Do you  have any clue, or perhaps even proof, of how the money is being  spent?    [Mesic] We know that the least amount of funds went to  economic processes and programs. We must find out where the  money went.    [Vlahovic] According to Prime Minister Valentic, Croatia is  now at the most critical stage of economic stabilization. Do  you think those stormy developments on the political scene will  influence the implementation of the stabilization program very  much, and if so, how?    [Mesic] The very process we are initiating will enable the  world to trust Croatian democracy a bit more. We are not trying  to cause a crisis; we want to strengthen Croatia as a  law-governed state. Then Croatia can also be a serious partner  to foreign investors.    [Vlahovic] You said you supported the government's policy,  but President Tudjman strongly supports Prime Minister Valentic,  too. Have you also contacted the prime minister? What is the  position of the government in this situation?    [Mesic] Yes, I talked to the prime minister on Tuesday [19  April] as well. There should be no crisis in the government.  We must give it all our support, provided that this process of  democratization wins us some foreign capital and investments.  That is our way of helping the government.    [Vlahovic] With regard to your views on transformation and  privatization, do you think the government is closer to your  views or to politics created by President Tudjman?    [Mesic] The government has taken a first step toward  denationalization, and it was those HDZ hawks that made it take  the subject off its agenda. We demand that the process of  denationalization be addressed, that people be given back what  is rightfully theirs, and also, regarding tenants, that they be  protected and put on an equal level with everyone else. It is  possible to do all that, if we start with new economic projects  and if we immediately sell all military-owned and other  apartments and allocate those funds to the construction of new  apartments.  <H5>  Avoiding Essential Problems </H5>   [Vlahovic] You have mentioned hawks again. Who are those  people? Are they in the state leadership?    [Mesic] Yes, those are the people who think problems can be  solved by means of some palliative measures. They are obviously  avoiding the essential problems more and more.    [Vlahovic] Does your leaving the HDZ mean that the ruling  party now overwhelmingly holds that it is impossible to reach a  political compromise between the Croats and the Muslims and  preserve the integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Mesic] There is something I cannot grasp. Some people -- I  will not name them but they know what I am talking about --  harbor an illusion that they can negotiate the division of  Bosnia with Milosevic and then solve Croatian problems. There  cannot be any agreement with Milosevic regarding the division of  Bosnia. It would result in a chain reaction; there would be new  aggressors, and the world will not allow that. The only way out  is to form an alliance with the Muslims and those Serbs who  support the integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina and then to make an  agreement with that state as with any other state.    [Vlahovic] In his reply to President Tudjman, Manolic  mentioned organized crime in Herzeg-Bosna and the fact that it  is supported by some Croatian institutions. Who are those men?    [Mesic] That is difficult for me to say. The institutions  that are involved in that must say so. Today we can only talk  about what we see is happening. If people buy enormous amounts  of fuel that cannot be spent by Herzeg-Bosna, that means that  they are selling it to someone else. Therefore, it is a chain  reaction, but it is not up to me to determine what this is  actually all about.  <H5>  To Attain Autonomy of the Parliament </H5>   [Vlahovic] As president of the parliament, what prevented  you from initiating the establishment of parliamentary  commissions that would examine those phenomena that were also  discussed in the parliament?    [Mesic] The parliament and its commissions of inquiry cannot  as yet be efficient, for they must be regulated by law. Such a  law is now being drafted and I believe it will soon be adopted.  We tried everything so that the parliament, apart from its main  function as a legislative body, can also act as a controlling  body, and by means of parliamentary committees, we are trying to  influence all institutions to implement regulations brought by  the parliament. I do not want to undermine the responsibility of  the parliament, but considering the pressure we have been under,  it has not been easy to attain autonomy of the parliament.    [Mesic] Your group has demanded that the right wing of the  HDZ leave. In your opinion, which people should not be in the  political leadership?    [Mesic] We are no longer asking anyone to leave. We are  leaving instead.    [Vlahovic] Can you comment on the position of Croatia and  the prospects for implementing the Washington agreement after  the fall of Gorazde?    [Mesic] Obviously, there have been some secret agreements  and underhanded deals. The fall of Gorazde is nothing but a  conspiracy against the sovereignty of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We  will probably find out who was involved, but now we must use all  available means and international mechanisms to make the  international community finally commit itself on who is the  aggressor and take steps against it. There have been many  victims in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but there will be even more  victims if one allows the division of Bosnia- Herzegovina.  Gorazde is the final lesson for the international community to  take action.    [Vlahovic] You said that for some two years now, you have  not been in the circle that creates the politics of the ruling  party. Therefore, you have not agreed with the politics of  President Tudjman for two years. Why did it take you so long to  go public about that?    [Mesic] I did not participate in making decisions, but I  have been trying through various party and state mechanisms to  influence Croatian politics in the country and abroad. I  thought it possible to set it straight, but now we realized that  if one cannot have an open and honest discussion within the  party about problems that will tomorrow be much more topical  than they are today, then we must act in this way.  <H5>  [Box 1, p 3] </H5> <H5>  International Support </H5>   [Vlahovic] Which members of the opposition did you contact?    [Mesic] Leaderships of all parties, but for one reason only:  to convince them that we will not tread on their political  ground. We respect their programs and their membership. We do  not want to see some uncontrolled processes happen. We want  those parties to keep their space, to become even stronger, to  the benefit of Croatia. Our action also aims to strengthen  Croatian democracy. Croatia comes first for us. But what kind  of Croatia? Democratic, social, human Croatia, in which human  rights will be protected. Croatia in which crime and mafia  cannot survive.    [Vlahovic] Do you have international support?    [Mesic] The world still supports democratic processes, and  this is an absolutely democratic process. We will be absolutely  supported by the world. Those who advise the president to  strike at democratic processes are not working for the benefit  of him or Croatia.  <H5>  [Box 2, p 3] </H5> <H5>  Where Is the Money Emigration Gave Us? </H5>   [Vlahovic] Conflicts in the HDZ have been noticeable for a  while. Why solve them at this very moment? Why are you forming  a new party right now?    [Mesic] We had no other choice. We tried to settle this in  the party by discussing all problems, which are evidently  present in the society. We put all that on the agenda.  However, the party, or better yet the president, disregarded  that. We must have an honest discussion, but if that is not  possible within the party, then we will do it in public, for the  public is the best judge. We must say whether we are satisfied  with the transformation or not. Nowhere in the world could the  rumor about 600,000 German marks of state funds to purchase an  apartment for a minister so he could then buy it for 40,000  German marks hold. Where will those state officials who will  succeed the present ones live? Judging by the results of the  present ones, I am not sure they will hold on to their positions  for very long. And finally, there is the question of funds  provided by our emigration. Those are enormous amounts of money  about which the parliament knows nothing and neither does the  Croatian Government. Those funds are in foreign banks and we do  not know who controls how and why they are spent. Croatian  emigration and the public must know where the money is.    [Vlahovic] Could that not be discussed in the ruling party?    [Mesic] No, that was strictly a taboo.  <H5>  [Box 3, p 4] </H5> <H5>  Who Is Responsible for the Politics Toward Bosnia-Herzegovina </H5>   [Vlahovic] You said there were indications that the  Washington agreement will not be implemented. Who will fail to  do so? What will be the consequences?    [Mesic] It is not that some will fail to do that, but I am  certain that some are trying to block the Washington agreement.  They appear to be supporting it, but are actually working  against it. They will not succeed in that; they will only  manage to compromise themselves and the people they represent.    [Vlahovic] Can you tell us who is the creator of the  politics toward Bosnia-Herzegovina that lead to founding  concentration camps for the Muslims, destruction of the Mostar  bridge...?    [Mesic] The Croat-Muslim conflict was harmful for both  nations, but it did not do much good for the Serbs either, for  they thought the world would tolerate the aggression. In  fighting against each other, the Croats and the Muslims suffered  heavy casualties, and now everyone is friends again now that  they have signed the agreement. That means it should not have  come to the war in the first place. The problem was in bringing  the political decision to confront the Muslims. Who is behind  whom? I do not know. When Josip Manolic criticized Gojko Susak  -- for he was in charge of Bosnia-Herzegovina, he went there, we  did not -- and, after all, we could see on television who was  photographed together: Vice Vukojevic and Gojko Susak, it is not  difficult to conclude who supported which option. However,  President Tudjman allowed no criticism and, in his address in  the Club of the HDZ Representatives, he took responsibility for  that politics.  <H5>  [Box 4, p 4] </H5> <H5>  Susak Is Incompetent </H5>   [Vlahovic] At the latest session of the Parliament, Minister  Susak and his responsibility for the explosion in Duboki Jarak  was in the focus of discussion. What do you think about the  demand of the opposition to reconsider the question of his  political responsibility?    [Mesic] Commissions in charge of that matter will definitely  reach certain conclusions, and judicial authorities will make  corresponding decisions. However, this is a matter of political  responsibility of the person who organizes the work and rules of  behavior in the army, and that is the Defense Ministry. We know  who is in charge. When it comes to such extent of damage and  such heavy casualties, then it would be honorable for the  minister to offer his resignation; whether it will be accepted,  that is another matter. I do not insist on that, but I insist  that Susak offer his resignation. One million of inhabitants of  Zagreb were in question, and the explosion could have spread to  the nearby chemical plant and gas installations. There could  have been unpredictable consequences, and our minister did not  interrupt his visit to Herzeg-Bosna, a sovereign state, and we  know he did not go there in cooperation with the Sarajevo  authorities, and he did not come to the sight of the explosion  nor did he return to his ministry. Ask him where he went.    [Vlahovic] To what extent is Minister Susak responsible for  such politics?    [Mesic] I do not think he knows how responsible he is,  because he is not competent enough for the job. Let us face it,  he cannot do the job.    [Vlahovic] Who should answer this question, then?    [Mesic] The supreme commander, of course.</p>

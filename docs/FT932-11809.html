			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (7): Manufacturers are kept guessing - The UK Industry THE size and structure of the UK executive car market has been dictated, to a very large extent, by two price 'break points' and - since 1988 - a 2-litre engine size threshold above which company car taxation levels increase considerably. Carmakers and importers have adjusted their production and marketing strategies to take advantage of this. That they have felt constrained to do so is an illustration of the importance of the business car sector relative to their total sales. For example, although BMW makes 'only' 40 per cent of its sales to business 'fleet' buyers - its own definition is a company taking 10 or more of its cars - it believes that as much as 85 per cent of its total sales are business-linked, through sales to accountants, small partnerships and similar entities. Thus these purchases are also subject to company car taxation calculations. From next year, the existing tax framework will be dismantled in favour of a much simpler system based on a percentage of a car's retail list price. Company executives will then be much freer to choose what cars they like. For the moment at least, what those buyers will like remains a matter of important guesswork for manufacturers seeking to determine what their future model line-ups should be. Some strands of likely change are starting to appear, however. One of the most important is diesels. The arguments in their favour are already powerful. They are much more economical than equivalent petrol models, by up to 30 per cent. This is assuming greater importance as the price of fuel continues to rise by well in excess of inflation. The price premium demanded by manufacturers for their diesel models is also disappearing as economies of scale on diesel engine production increase. And, important in terms of improving their performance in the executive sector, the larger engines size needed to deliver supposedly similar performance to a petrol engine will no longer be subject to a tax penalty next year. The volume manufacturers fit diesels in their executive car ranges as a matter of course. But the take-up to date has been relatively low because of their sedate image and the engine-size tax penalty. However, the latest high-speed turbocharged car diesels, far from being inferior in performance to glamorous-sounding multi-valve 'Gti'-type cars, are superior to them in most normal conditions of use. Their relatively much greater torque delivered at low engine speeds is more usable than high power - as the executive sector itself is poised to discover. Citroen is setting the ball rolling with a 'Volcane' version of its ZX which it is marketing as a 'hot hatchback' in every sense, including outright performance. Nevertheless, beneath the bonnet is a turbo diesel also capable of up to 50mpg. But the watershed will be reached in mid-year when BMW, the German executive car maker whose image has been built largely on high performance, launches a range of diesel cars in the UK. It is doing so with trepidation, anxious that its performance image should not be prejudiced among British customers who have been buying some 40,000 BMWs a year. Nevertheless, many industry observers believe its initial 900 sales target is an underestimate of likely demand for a car still capable of about 120mph. Vauxhall, Ford and some other makers also expect an increase in the capacity of petrol engines chosen by many buyers as a result of the tax penalty disappearing. Under the existing taxation regime, the 'typical' executive car has tended to be a highly specified model of just under 2 litres. Now, they expect, many buyers of such cars will be willing to pay a bit extra for, say, a 2.5-litre V6 of the type that Vauxhall has just put into production at Ellesmere Port. A further significant number of buyers, they believe, will opt for the larger engine but a less luxurious specification in order to minimise their liability to tax under the incoming list price taxation scheme. With traffic congestion continuing to increase, an already apparent business car market trend towards smaller cars - so-called 'downsizing' - is likely to be boosted further by the new freedom to specify cars with larger engines. Vauxhall has already caused a stir in this context by launching the V6 in a relatively cheap version of its medium-sized Cavalier. A big problem with analysis of the executive sector is that each manufacturer tends to define the sector differently. However, BMW is widely regarded as the archetypal 'executive' car. On its analysis, the lower end of the executive car market - which it defines as including its own 3 Series, Volkswagen Golf GTi and VR6, top specification Cavaliers, Rover 400s and similar - was badly hit last year by a sales drop of 19.75 per cent in a total market which was almost unchanged from 1991. In unit terms, sector sales fell from 555,319 to 445,637 - within which, however, BMW's own share rose from 4.6 to 6.3 per cent. But it was a long way behind segment leader Ford whose share was 22.5 per cent - even if down from the 25.7 of 1991. However, previously the sector had been doing relatively much better than larger executive cars, which were themselves hit by the imposition of the 2-litre tax break in 1988, causing a sales plummet in 1989, for example, of bigger-engined cars typified by Jaguars and BMW's 7 Series. The 'middle' executive segment typified by BMW's 5 Series also went into a sharp downturn in 1991, by more than a quarter, so that last year the fall of 6 per cent to 105,802 from 112,554 was relatively mild. It is a sector fought over fiercely by, among others, Volvo's 800 and 900 Series cars, Granadas, Rover 800s, Saabs and mid-range Mercedes. Last year, BMW saw its share shoot up to 10.3 per cent from 5.9. But its satisfaction was minor compared with that of Rover, which knocked Ford off its market-leading pedestal and down to fourth place. It is volume manufacturers, rather than their more obvious rivals, that companies such as BMW and Audi have most cause to fear. For all the volume makers are seeking to acquire for their more expensive products exactly the same type of image that BMW and its cohorts are most anxious to protect. Rover, with its just-launched 600 range - developed jointly with Honda, whose own Accord version is now in increasing production at Swindon - provides one of the most obvious examples of that threat. Strictly speaking, it is no more a 'volume' manufacturer than BMW - indeed Rover's own output was considerably lower than the Bavarian manufacturer's last year. But Rover has been working hard to distance itself from its BL 'volume car' roots and many believe that with the 600 its success will accelerate sharply. Professor Garel Rhys of Cardiff Business School, a motor industry guru, is one such believer. He only half-jokingly refers to the new Rover as the 'BMW 400'.</p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POMONA CEMETERY ACCUSED OF MIXING, DUMPING CREMATION ASHES  </P> <P> The state attorney general's office is looking into allegations that workers at  a Pomona cemetery mixed together the ashes of cremated corpses in a garbage can  and dumped them in a vacant lot that is now a construction site.  </P> <P> The allegations, made by three former employees who lost their jobs at Pomona  Valley Memorial Park earlier this year, have been investigated by the state  Cemetery Board, which finished its report earlier this week. The attorney  general's office received the report Friday and will issue its response next  week, spokeswoman Christie Mullen said.  </P> <P> John Gill, executive director of the Cemetery Board, would not comment  specifically on the report's findings, but said the board uncovered sufficient  evidence to warrant consideration by the attorney general.  </P> <P> "You wouldn't send it on to your attorney if you didn't have something," Gill  said.  </P> <P> The general manager of the cemetery, John Lemons, did not return phone calls  Friday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Inquiry Started  </P> <P> In a press conference Friday, attorney Thomas E. Frankovich told reporters that  ashes may have been dumped illegally at the construction site across the street  from the cemetery for more than 20 years. Frankovich is representing four  families who had relatives cremated at Pomona Valley Memorial Park, and he was  joined at the press conference by four former cemetery employees.  </P> <P> The investigation began last month when former cemetery workers Jeff Uwnauich,  Joseph Hatchett and Manuel Estrada charged that the dumping of ashes was a  standard practice at the cemetery. Uwnauich and Estrada were laid off by the  cemetery in April and Hatchett was fired in March.  </P> <P> Another former employee, Anthony Tamburro, who worked at the cemetery from 1961  until his retirement in 1974, said at the press conference that the alleged  practices were commonplace when he worked there. He supervised cremations for  three of those years.  </P> <P> In about 90% of the cremations performed at the cemetery, all the ashes and  crushed bones would not fit in a single urn, Uwnauich told reporters. The  excess remains were placed in a 20-gallon trash can, which was taken  periodically to the lot across the street from the cemetery and its contents  dumped in a hole, he alleged.  </P> <P> Mixing together human ashes in such a manner has been a misdemeanor in  California since 1984. The Cemetery Board may also impose administrative  penalties, including suspension or revocation of a cemetery's license, if human  remains have been improperly handled, Gill said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Three Bodies  </P> <P> In addition to the dumping of ashes, Uwnauich and Hatchett alleged that they  once saw workers cram three bodies into a crypt designed for two. Silver and  gold dental filings extracted from the ashes reportedly were sometimes pocketed  by employees or kept by the cemetery.  </P> <P> Frankovich said he plans to ask the attorney general to order an exhumation of  the lot. The land was purchased last year by Upland-based Lewis Homes  Management Corp. and is being graded for the construction of 90 homes.  </P> <P> Frankovich, who has offered a $1,000 reward for information about illegal  cremations at the Pomona cemetery, said none of the families he represents know  for certain that their relatives' ashes were dumped in the lot.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Assumes Worst  </P> <P> However, Alice Alexandre, whose parents and 18-year-old son were cremated at  the cemetery, said the former employees' allegations have caused her to assume  the worst.  </P> <P> "I am looking out in that field, knowing my son's out there," she said. "Part  of my son and my parents is out there. Something's got to be done. . . . This  is the worst kind of betrayal."  </P></p>

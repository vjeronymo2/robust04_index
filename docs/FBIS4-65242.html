			<p>BFN     [Text] The diplomats remain hopeful of finding a political  solution to the Bosnian crisis. Alain Juppe met Bill Clinton  this afternoon, and will be in Geneva tomorrow for the meeting  between the American, Russian, and European foreign ministers.  Having said yesterday that the French UN soldiers would not  spend another winter in Bosnia, Juppe today said that he  believed dialogue could still overcome the violence. He was  speaking to our Washington correspondent, Philippe Reltien:    [Begin Juppe recording] I hope that for the first time, the  great powers concerned with finding a solution to the crisis in  Bosnia will be able to speak with one voice. Which voice will  that be? It is still too early to say at present, but it  appears that an agreement is being drawn out along the following  lines: an urgent appeal to the warring parties for a cease-fire,  and a general and immediate cessation of hostilities across the  whole of Bosnia for several months. Secondly, it must be  repeated that Bosnia is an independent state within its borders,  and it is a member of the United Nations. Thirdly, it must be  noted that within Bosnia-Herzegovina, there are several  communities which want to have the power to administer  themselves, and in fact the Croat-Muslim accord is proof of  this. Finally, we would like to have certain indications as to  the distribution of territories between these different  communities.    I have the impression when I read the correspondence we have  received on this subject from both the Russians and the  Americans that the limits set out in the European Union action  plan -- that is 51 percent for the Croats and the Muslims on one  side, and 49 percent for the Serbs - could form the basis of an  accord. I certainly hope so. [end recording]</p>

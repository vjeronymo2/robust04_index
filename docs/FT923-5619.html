			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Property: On the Scottish estates, rich buyers are no longer biting - James Buxton finds that the Scottish property market is lean and mean THE PHRASE that best describes the way the Scottish residential property market differs from that of England is: 'leaner and meaner.' The Scottish market is leaner because it carries a much less prominent belly of unsold properties - with the obvious exception of the amply proportioned sporting estate sector and, to a lesser extent, country houses. It is meaner in that values are generally lower than in England, the scale of borrowing is less and Scots are enjoying the advantages of being more prudent. The housing market has come to life since the general election. The easiest way to measure this is to visit what amounts to the trading floor of the Edinburgh housing market, the Edinburgh Solicitors' Property Centre. In Scotland, solicitors rather than estate agents handle the bulk of housing transactions. Probably nowhere is their grip stronger than in Edinburgh where they have 80 per cent of the market. They display the thousands of properties on their books in one large shop in the centre of the city. Whereas the Halifax house price index for the year to March 1992 showed prices falling by up to 8 per cent in parts of England and Wales, for Scotland it registered a rise of almost 4 per cent, nearly keeping pace with inflation. However, the Halifax figure, reflecting the whole of Scotland, may paint a picture that some people living in the central belt of Scotland would not recognise. Colvil Johnston, of the estate agents Slater Hogg &amp; Howison, says that house prices in the central belt fell by between 12 and 15 per cent after the market peaked in 1989 (a year later than in England), though rose again last year by 5 to 6 per cent. The Scottish average was kept up by the performance of the Aberdeen and Dundee areas. In Aberdeen prices have risen by 11.7 per cent over the past 12 months because of the strength of the local economy which is driven by North Sea oil. Scottish houses never suffered boom and slump to the same extent as the southern half of England. Price were pushed up in the period to 1989 partly by people moving up from England, such as returning Scottish expatriates and recruits to the financial services sector. The shake-out that followed was smaller than in England because the boom had been so much less excessive. As Johnston explains, Scots generally borrow a much smaller proportion of their salary than English people to finance house purchases and their salaries tend to be a little lower. However, two sectors of the market have suffered badly: the market for larger houses and for estates, both of which are affected by factors in the south of England. The flow of money for house purchases from the south has dried up in the last 18 months as people there found it almost impossible to sell their houses. According to Robert Balfour, of Bidwells in Perth, prices for country houses with land have fallen by between 10 per cent and 40 per cent in the last year, and most houses priced at over Pounds 200,000 were unsold at the end of last year. Although the general election removed uncertainty, he says this part of the market is still in recession. Bidwells is offering Feddinch, a seven bedroom country house two miles from St Andrews in Fife. It is surrounded by a 243 acre estate and is on the market at a guide price of Pounds 800,000, though it is available either as a whole or in seven lots, including the walled garden, cottages and arable farmland. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley in Edinburgh has a small number of important properties on sale, although Colin Strang Steel says the market is only now coming to life, not least because the miserable spring made it difficult to take appealing photographs of houses. It is asking for offers over Pounds 450,000 for Ratho Hall at Ratho, Midlothian, just to the west of Edinburgh and only two miles from the airport. Ratho Hall is a pretty Georgian house surrounded by 22 acres of garden, woodland and fields. Typically of tightly-held houses in the Edinburgh area, it is coming on the market for only the second time in more than 40 years. In the Borders, the Scots baronial mansion of Dawyck (pronounced Doick) is on the market for Pounds 550,000. Dawyck is at Stobo, in Peeblesshire, in a specially pretty part of the Tweed valley and stands next to an arboretum run by the Royal Botanic Garden of Edinburgh. Dawyck is being sold jointly by Knight Frank &amp; Rutley and Sotheby's International Realty with 61 acres, three cottages, a lake and gardens. The biggest overhang in the Scottish property market is in sporting estates, demand for which reached its peak as late as 1990, but has now evaporated. Demand is weak because, as Andrew Smith of Strutt &amp; Parker in Edinburgh says, 'a sporting estate is a luxury item and the people who were buying them before are often those worst hit by recession.' Supply is strong because some of the same sort of people need to realise assets. There are about 20 estates still on the market from last year covering about 250,000 acres of hill, bog and river. They include the 77,000 acre Mar Lodge estate near Balmoral on Deeside, which US multi-millionaire John Kluge has been trying to sell for a year. Conservation organisations are trying to assemble a financial package to which the government would contribute to buy Mar Lodge 'for the nation.' Into this unpromising market has come an island, the kind of property that usually generates enormous interest. Gigha, off south-west Scotland, is being sold through Savills in Edinburgh. The vendor is Interallianz Bank of Switzerland which took possession of it as creditor of Tanap Investments, a property company run by Macolm Potier, a businessman who bought it in 1898. Gigha is six square miles and has a mansion, a hotel, fish farm and superb gardens which flourish in the moist air of the Gulf Stream. No asking price has been set.</p>

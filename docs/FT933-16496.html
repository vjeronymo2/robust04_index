			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Probe involving Allcock continuing, says Yard: The tax investigator - This week claim, counter-claim and hoax over the Asil Nadir affair competed for attention in parliament and the press. FT reporters look at the latest twists in an increasingly bizarre saga SCOTLAND YARD said yester-day that an inquiry involving Mr Michael Allcock, the suspended Inland Revenue investigator linked to the Nadir affair, was continuing. Scotland Yard stressed that Mr Allcock had neither been arrested nor charged, although it is understood that his suspension relates to allegations that he had offered foreign subjects working in the UK non-tax status in return for bribes. Mr Allcock was suspended from his duties as head of the Inland Revenue's Special Office 2 in September last year as a result of what his solicitor Mr Michael Jones said earlier this week were allegations of bribery. Neither Mr Allcock nor Mr Jones was available for comment yesterday. But in an interview with the Financial Times before publication of the Michael Mates correspondence Mr Jones referred to the 'unorthodox methods ' pursued by Mr Allcock as part of his job. Mr Jones explained that the sensitivity of much of the work that his client carried out in the course of his duties meant that he would maintain informal contacts with other agencies including the Serious Fraud Office. According to Mr Jones the Revenue's Special Office 2 had the task of looking into the tax affairs of 'rich and powerful people'. It emerged yesterday that two senior fraud squad detectives in charge of Mr Allcock's case are on annual leave. Mr Jones, however, is understood to be preparing a statement in response to the Mates correspondence. There is no suggestion that police inquiries into Mr Allcock's affairs are in any way related to Mr Nadir, although Mr Allcock is named in the correspondence exchanged between Mr Mates and Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general. The correspondence includes an alleged minute of a meeting on September 21 1990 purportedly attended by Mr Allcock and a colleague from the Revenue in the boardroom of Vizards, Mr Nadir's solicitors at the time. The alleged meeting took place on the day after the SFO raid on South Audley Management. According to the minute the two officers had described the SFO raid as a 'monumental disaster.' Yesterday Mr Peter Knight, a solicitor with Vizards who was also alleged to have been present at the meeting, was not available for comment. The alleged minute referred to one of the Revenue officers present at the meeting as saying that he was extremely concerned about the possibility that Mr Nadir particularly would think that leaks 'had originated from the Inland Revenue'.</p>

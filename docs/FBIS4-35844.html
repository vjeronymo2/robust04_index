			<p>BFN     [Text] Islamabad -- Pakistan government has no intentions  of dramatically increasing its defence budget for the next  financial year, highly placed government sources told this  correspondent on Saturday.    "We have no intention of increasing the defence budget in  real terms.    This should not be taken to mean that we do not take the  country's defence requirements seriously but we cannot afford to  be irresponsible with our finance," these sources said.    Experts were expecting a heavy raise in Pakistan's defence  budget this year, after India increased its defence spending by  a whooping 29 per cent in its budget for fiscal 1994-95,  starting April 1, 1994.    "The extraordinary increase by India is basically a strategy  to preserve a deterrent. However, unlike India we do not have  the kind of resources to give such a massive raise in the  defence budget," noted the source.    Islamabad has been applying a cut in real terms, that is  after discounting inflation, on defence spending for the last  three years.    In the Federal Budget for fiscal 1993-94, defence spending  claimed Rs 89.1 billion [rupees] or about a third of the total  budgeted expenditure. This was about two per cent increase over  the previous year's revised estimate of Rs 87.4 billion.</p>

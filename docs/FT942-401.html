			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Midlands lines up overseas projects Midlands Electricity said yesterday that negotiations for participation in two overseas generation projects were at an advanced stage. It would not say where the deals were, but it is thought to be looking at projects in China, Pakistan and Turkey. The statement accompanied news of a 17 per cent rise in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 195.4m and a 16 per cent increase in dividend to 23.2p, a rise slightly more modest than Seeboard's 17.5 per cent, the largest so far in the sector. The prospective deals, in which the company would be an investor rather than operator, represent a growing trend among regional power companies to diversify abroad. Until recently regional power companies have been cautious of investing outside the UK, partly because of the experience of water companies which were privatised before them and in some cases encountered severe difficulties with their overseas expansion. However, in recent weeks Yorkshire Electric has spent more than Pounds 100m on a stake in Stockholm Energi, and Norweb, serving the north-west of England, has spent up to Dollars 40m buying into a Virginia, US, co-generation company. Mr Bryan Townsend, Midland chairman, said the overseas risks were minimal. In each case the investment would be about Pounds 20m and because the deals would be highly geared, the banks were taking the main proportion of the risk. 'All we require is a modicum of unregulated income. Perhaps 15 per cent of profit will be from generation by the end of the decade. If we tie up these two deals, we would be interested in perhaps one more.' Midlands' share price gained 23p to 575p yesterday as all the regional electricity companies responded positively to hints that the forthcoming pricing review by the industry regulator would be less severe than feared.

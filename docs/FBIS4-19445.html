			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Kinkel by Ulrich Wickert in </F> the studio in Bonn on 18 April -- recorded]    [Text] [Wickert] The discussions today [by European Union  foreign ministers in Luxembourg] did not yield much. Is this  now the end of Gorazde?    [Kinkel] I am just as unhappy as the people who are watching  what is going on here, this stranglehold of the Serbs on  Gorazde. At the moment, I cannot say whether it is the end. I  hope not. The situation is the following: Air strikes have  become difficult, because one would have to carry them out  against the 60,000 Muslims surrounded by the Serbs and in part  also against UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] soldiers, who are in  the town or at least have been there up to now. On the ground  no country is willing to send soldiers for combat missions. And  I cannot blame anyone for that.    [Wickert] Air strikes should perhaps have been carried out a  few days ago.    [Kinkel] Well, air strikes were indeed carried out but they  were always directed against weapons aimed at UNPROFOR. These  were the demands of the UN, and this was done. The air strikes  against the town itself would necessarily always have been aimed  at the civilian population.    [Wickert] You yourself now demand that the Russians  intervene more and exert more pressure, but Russian special  envoy Churkin says that talking with the Serbs is over, as they  are just abusing us.    [Kinkel] Yes, this is a sad sign for me. The Russians have  the strongest influence on the Serbs, and if this influence is  now lost or decreases, then the situation will become even more  difficult. Therefore, today in Luxembourg, we, the 12 foreign  ministers of the European Union, have decided to try once again  to bring together the United States, the Russians, the  Europeans, and Owen and Stoltenberg, and to make another try.    [Wickert] Well, you can bring them all together, but the  Serbs are quite obviously laughing.    [Kinkel] They are obviously determined to do everything.  This is the bad thing.    [Wickert] Well, then something has to be done. U.S.  President Bill Clinton wants to lift the arms embargo against  the Bosnian Muslims. What do you say to that?    [Kinkel] There is no majority for that in the European  Union, and I understand that. Clinton does not have any ground  forces there. The French have 6,000 men there, the British more  than 2,000, the Danish and the Belgians, too. They have the  duty to care for their soldiers. They have had many, many  deaths. I also tell the citizens in the FRG, who keep demanding  combat missions: Are you willing to send your own sons there,  to such a war?    [Wickert] Then the only thing one can do is to withdraw the  UN troops.    [Kinkel] No, this would not be the right thing either. We  cannot let the people in the besieged town in the lurch in this  situation. Today, we, the European foreign ministers, were of  the opinion that this should not be done and that,  unfortunately, the only thing we can do in this difficult  situation is to keep trying.    [Wickert] What does keep trying mean?    [Kinkel] Well, we have achieved quite some things in the  political peace process -- Sarajevo, the opening up of Tuzla....    [Wickert] Okay, but these are things that you did not  achieve by talking but by threatening with the use of force.    [Kinkel] No, no, this only applies to Sarajevo. The other  things -- the cease-fire in Krajina, the opening up of Tuzla --  were achieved without any direct NATO threats.    [Wickert] But that was achieved at a time when one still  could talk. Sarajevo was achieved by military pressure and  Gorazde could probably also have been saved by military pressure.    [Kinkel] No, Gorazde is in a different situation  geographically speaking and is obviously far more difficult than  Sarajevo for military reasons. However, Sarajevo was also  prepared in political talks, in diplomatic talks. This is  forgotten so easily. It was not only military measures.    I must say again: Who is supposed to go there? Our German  sons? We cannot go there. We cannot go there because of our  constitutional situation. We are damned bad advisers to others,  and we should restrain ourselves. Am I supposed to tell the  British, the French, the Belgians, and the Danish: You have to  send your sons there and let them bleed to death, also on our  behalf. We always say that we are safe on our constitutional  side. We cannot go there, also because of the historical  situation. We should restrain ourselves. I can only say: Be  careful.    There is a good purpose in the fact that no combat troops  have been sent in so far.</p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A daughter's greedy friend My wife and I have drawn up reciprocal wills under which all our estate on the death of one of us will go entirely to the survivor and, in the event of the latter's death, the remainder will be divided equally between our spinster daughter and our married son. However, a problem has arisen in that our daughter is living with a woman partner whose domination and cupidity lead me to think that she will share in any legacy bestowed on our daughter. I have no wish that this woman should benefit under my own will. Without necessarily obliging my wife to follow suit, I would like advice on how to make sure that the part of our joint estate which goes to our daughter does not pass under the control of her lesbian friend. The estate is to be administered by our solicitors, acting as trustees. At present, your children would receive the estate absolutely on the death of the survivor of yourself and your wife. This could enable your daughter's friend to enjoy the property. It might be more appropriate for you to draw up a will trust so that, on the death of the survivor, the income is payable to your daughter but she has no entitlement to the capital other than at the discretion of the trustees. It is, of course, crucial that the trustees are chosen carefully, and you might wish to leave a side letter instructing them how they are to act. In this event, the income would be your daughter's as of right and her friend could enjoy part of it - but not the capital. If, however, your daughter made an adequate case to receive an element of the capital within the trust, then the trustees could be happy to advance capital if they were satisfied that her friend would not enjoy that capital at the same time. An alternative form of trust which could be even more appropriate is a discretionary one, under which payments of income or capital could be made to your daughter only at the discretion of the trustees without her having any entitlement to payment as of right. In any case, I suggest that both of you take legal advice on re-drafting your wills. This reply was provided by Barry Stillerman of accountant Stoy Hayward.

			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT RAINS ON A PARADE OF ANDRETTIS AT INDY;  </P> <P> MOTOR RACING: MARIO, SONS MICHAEL AND JEFF AND NEPHEW JOHN COULD BE THE RACE'S  FIRST FOUR-CAR FAMILY. QUALIFYING IS POSTPONED TO TODAY.  </P> <P> Mario Andretti is celebrating his Silver Anniversary as an Indianapolis 500  driver, and he would like nothing better than to have his family become the  first to have four drivers in the race.  </P> <P> Mario, son Michael and nephew John have been in the past two 500s, equaling a  family record set by the Whittington brothers, Don, Bill and Dale, in 1982.  This year, Mario's second son, Jeff, is making his first attempt to join the  family in the race.  </P> <P> Heavy rain Saturday wiped out what was to have been the first day of qualifying  for the 74th Indianapolis 500, but it was a welcome sight to the Andretti clan.  Prospects are for more rain today, and if that occurs and the four-lap time  trials are delayed until next weekend, it would be even better for them.  </P> <P> "It's been a tough week, trying to get our cars sorted out, so a delay would  help us," said Mario Andretti, who won the 500 in 1969 and has been frustrated  since in trying to get No. 2. "Little Al (Unser) and the Penskes showed us what  can be done Friday, but we do need more time to figure out how they're going so  fast and we're not."  </P> <P> Unser ran 228.502 m.p.h. in a Lola-Chevy in the late afternoon Friday, the  fastest lap ever at Indy. It was well ahead of Rick Mears' official record of  224.254 and his unofficial 226.231, both run last year.  </P> <P> Two Penske-Chevrolets, driven by defending 500 champion Emerson Fittipaldi and  Mears, also were faster than 226 m.p.h.  </P> <P> The fastest Andretti speeds, both in Haas-Newman Lola-Chevys, are 225.655  m.p.h. by Mario and 223.453 by Michael. John, in a March Porsche, did 220.913.  </P> <P> "Seeing Little Al's 228 shows me that it can be done, but he got a perfect tow  from Emmo (Fittipaldi) and caught a good one," Mario said. "It was a (public  relations) lap, not a true indication of what to expect when qualifying starts.  When you're out there all alone, the speeds tend to slow down, maybe two or  three miles an hour.  </P> <P> "When a car's ahead of you, as long as you can see it, you get a tow, just like  the draft in NASCAR. Even if it's a long ways down the track, it punches a hole  in the air that has to help. When you're running alone, you can feel the  difference, and it shows on the clock, too."  </P> <P> Hopes of having four Andrettis in the 500 took a setback Friday when Jeff hit  oil dropped by Tero Palmroth's Lola Cosworth and slammed into the wall in the  middle of the fourth turn.  </P> <P> "I was following Tero and he was black flagged for leaking oil, so I backed off  just to be safe," Jeff said. "Then the back of the car came around with no  warning."  </P> <P> Jeff, 26, was hospitalized briefly at Hanna Medical Center for a bruised left  knee, but was released to drive.  </P> <P> "Jeff's OK, but it looks like we'll have to get him another car so he can be  ready next week," Mario said. "We're trying to get one from Carl Haas that  Michael and I drove last year."  </P> <P> It won't be quite the same. Instead of a Chevy engine, which Mario and Michael  have, the new car will have a slower Cosworth.  </P> <P> Keith Leighton, co-owner of the Jeff's car, said he thought the crew could get  the original car repaired by the middle of the week.  </P> <P> "I think we can pick up right where we left off," Jeff said. "We won't lose any  momentum. Hopefully, Mother Nature will rule in our favor and rain out this  first weekend of qualifying."  </P> <P> Jeff Andretti is unique in one respect -- he had never sat in an Indy car  before driving in rookie orientation last month.  </P> <P> "Jeff's the truest rookie out here," his brother Michael said. "All of the  other guys have at least driven in a race or two, but Jeff came here last month  and took to the place.  </P> <P> "He has always been strongest on the ovals, especially the fast ovals, so  Indianapolis was a natural for him. He is one of the smoothest drivers I have  ever seen, and that's what it takes here. I think we're going to see a strong  rookie run from him."  </P> <P> Jeff Andretti has a powerful legacy to follow. His father was rookie of the  year in 1965 and his brother co-rookie of the year (with Roberto Guerrero) in  1985.  </P> <P> The youngest Andretti's racing background has been in karts, in which he won 21  of 43 events in 1981-82; in Formula Fords, as Sports Car Club of America rookie  of the year in 1984 when he won six of 13 races; in Super Vees, in which he was  co-rookie of the year in 1985; and in the American Racing Series in 1986-87-88.  </P> <P> His biggest moment in racing to date came in 1986 when he won his first ARS  race at Pocono, the same weekend that Mario won an Indy car race in which  Michael had started on the pole.  </P> <P> "It was the biggest thrill I ever had in racing," Mario Andretti said of the  weekend. "It was something you could never program, having all of us on the  podium at the same time."  </P> <P> Michael, 27, sees distinctive differences in the beginnings of his career, now  in its eighth Indy car season, and Jeff's.  </P> <P> "Jeff has had a tough road because he found it hard to get sponsorships, and  you can't run good equipment without sponsorship," he said. "That's the  toughest part of this business, lining up sponsors. When I started out, I was  fortunate to have good equipment and caught the attention of the right people.  </P> <P> "It all comes down to having a good race car under you. When I came here for my  rookie year, I felt I had a legitimate contender to win the race, and that  feeling did a lot toward pushing me along.  </P> <P> "I had already driven some fast laps at Indy before I ever took rookie  orientation, so it wasn't new to me the way it was to Jeff."  </P> <P> Despite his obvious disappointment at not being able to match the Unser and  Penske team speeds, Mario Andretti says that the inclination to coach Jeff has  not been a distraction to his own effort.  </P> <P> "There are certain things I can tell him or Michael can tell him," Mario said,  "but ultimately he has to do it on his own. We talked to him about his line  (around Indianapolis Motor Speedway's 2.5-mile rectangular oval), and he  listened and he picked up five miles an hour in a short time."  </P> <P> Jeff Andretti's fastest lap has been 209.001 m.p.h., run Tuesday.  </P> <P> "What I like about him is that he is well aware of what he's doing, and he's  not in over his head," Mario Andretti said. "He went through rookie orientation  very impressively. Basically, he's on his own. When we have a break in  practice, we go over and see what's going on with his car, but that's about  all."  </P> <P> Nor does Mario see much significance in the fact that this is his Silver  Anniversary race.  </P> <P> "No way, in my wildest dreams, could I have imagined that I'd be coming here  with my two sons 25 years after my rookie year," he said, "but as far as  celebrating is concerned, we'll celebrate if we win.  </P> <P> "If we don't, we'll wait for 26."  </P></p>

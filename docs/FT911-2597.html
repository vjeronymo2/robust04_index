			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / German Green party conference does not support 'realo' takeover Despite an incident when a delegate aimed a water pistol at another member of Germany's Green party the Greens took steps towards creating a more conventional party structure at their weekend conference. However, they did not, as had been expected, support a full-scale takeover by the pragmatic 'realo' wing. The conference abolished the rotation principle, under which representatives served only one term in office, and which had helped to mark the Greens as a counter-culture movement rather than a real party. Also, a group of far-left ecologists decided to leave the Greens. However the Greens stopped short of swallowing all the 'realo' medicine and elected two left-wing leaders.</p>

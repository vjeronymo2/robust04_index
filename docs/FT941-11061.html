			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Italy wants to keep Japanese car curb The Italian government has asked the EU Commission to retain the 1993 ceilings on Japanese car imports for the current year, writes Robert Graham in Rome. The move follows a disastrous year for car sales in Italy and the prospect of only a modest recovery in the second half of 1994. Despite the revaluation of the yen, the Fiat-dominated Italian car market is deeply concerned by the potential of Japanese suppliers - either through direct sales or via 'transplants' from Japanese factories within Europe. The request was made last week in letters from Mr Paolo Baratta, Italian trade minister, to Sir Leon Brittan, commissioner for external economic relations and Mr Martin Bangemann, commissioner responsible for industrial policy. For 1993 it was agreed that Japanese car sales should be limited to 4.5 per cent of the total. This meant the Japanese could sell 38,000 vehicles, some 2,300 more than the previous year.</p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANDIDATES AND PROPOSITIONS IN TUESDAY'S L.A. ELECTION  </P> <P> I find it ironic that The Times has endorsed Mayor Bradley for reelection and  then in the same editorial pointed out how ineffective Bradley has been in  dealing with the many problems that are choking this once fine city of ours. In  backing Bradley and, for that matter, all the incumbent city councilmen, aren't  you taking a chance that we will be faced with nothing more than four more  years of status quo?  </P> <P> FRANK J.

			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRUG CHARGES IN SHERIFF'S DEPT.  </P> <P> The editorial was a wonderful example of liberal arrogance. In espousing such  leftist ideals as greater bureaucratic regulation and divestment of resources  from law enforcement, the editorial contradicts the spirit of positions that  Times' editorials have previously maintained.  </P> <P> For instance, a law making parents criminally responsible for their children's  gang involvement was bitterly opposed in these pages. Yet your editorial seeks  to hold Block personally responsible for the self-serving actions of a few of  the vast number over whom he holds jurisdiction. Need I remind you that it was  the Sheriff's Department itself which launched these fruitful investigations,  without the prompting of outside "experts" such as your editorial writers.  </P> <P> At a time when your writers are lauding a Marxist dictator for being benevolent  in defeat, despite his success in avoiding real elections for over 10 years,  you should show at least an iota of respect for the sheriff's actions.  </P> <P> SCOTT HARPER  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

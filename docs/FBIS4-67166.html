			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Juan Jose Coello] </F>   [Text] Mexico is living a narcodemocracy and  narcotraffickers have achieved socioeconomic influence, Eduardo  Valle Espinoza, former adviser to the Attorney General's office  [PGR] of Diego Valades and Jorge Carpizo, has stated. Valle,  who resigned on 1 May, stated the foregoing in his resignation  letter.    "After learning of the above, I ask: When will we have the  courage and political maturity to tell the Mexican people we are  living in a narcodemocracy? Will we have the intellectual  capability and ethical strength to say that Amado Carrillo,  Arellano Felix, and Juan Garcia Abrego are, inconceivably and  degradingly, the promoters and even pillars of our socioeconomic  growth and development?    In his resignation letter, the official briefly explained  the  narcotrafficking problem in Mexico and he recognized his failure  to dismantle the Matamoros Cartel led by Juan Garcia Abrego.  This was a task which had been assigned to him by Valades.    "I recognize that I did not have the capability to apprehend  the public leader of the Gulf of Mexico Cartel. I truthfully  did all that I could within my means. I failed and regrettably  admit it," the former PGR adviser stated.    His resignation had been kept silent for unexplained  reasons.    "I am leaving as I entered. I have no money, but I have  gained knowledge and experience. Nobody can say I harmed anyone  without a true juridical basis. I can look anyone in the face  and feel no shame," he stated in his letter.    Valle Espinoza also questioned the programs and plans to  fight narcotrafficking and raised the possibility that the  assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio may have been drug-related.    "Nobody can conceive of a political project in which the  narcotrafficking lords and financiers are not included, because  if he does so he is dead." Perhaps evidence of that will be  found in relation to the 23 March incident in Tijuana.  Although, I warn, I don't have any more information about that  infamous act than that which is publicly known.    In the last part of his letter, Valle Espinoza thanked  Carpizo and the president for their trust, which he claims he  never failed. Valle Espinoza was appointed to his post in early  1993.    Valle Espinoza began to hunt down Garcia Abrego with the  support of 30 agents, all heavily armed and recruited by  himself. He was also provided with communications equipment,  vehicles, two helicopters, an aircraft, and a big budget.    According to official investigations, the Gulf Cartel, known  previously as the Matamoros Cartel, has $10 billion in  resources, heavy political and police influence, and an "Army"  of over 500 men. The PGR is investigating since last week the  transfer of Garcia Abrego and his principal deputies.    Valle's actions resulted in the arrests of 10 drug  traffickers and the confiscation of at least 50 properties in  various states of the republic.</p>

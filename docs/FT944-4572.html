			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Berlusconi loses ruling on TV ownership The possession of three commercial television channels by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest media empire has been ruled unconstitutional. The ruling, published yesterday by Italy's constitutional court, will force a big shake-up of Italian television ownership. This already seemed likely with a referendum pending early next year on the future of the current television structure. The decision comes at a time when there is increasing concern about the conflict of interest between Mr Berlusconi's role as prime minister and his ownership of Fininvest. Last month he promised to float his television interests on the stock market to resolve the problem; but the court ruling makes the valuation of these interests - split among a plethora of companies  -even more complicated. Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest, whose three channels control 45 per cent of the market and account for 85 per cent of commercial television, has until August 1996 to comply. Yesterday Mr Fedele Confalonieri, Fininvest chairman, said the group would fight hard to prevent the potential loss of one and perhaps two channels. In 1993 Fininvest's television interests generated income of L3,877bn (Pounds 1.5bn) and returned profits of L288m. At present the operations of the three channels are closely integrated, relying on shared facilities and a common film library valued at about Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 770m). The group hopes to exploit a part of the court's decision which recommended that the current limit of 12 channels be eliminated. Mr Confalonieri said if the total number of channels was expanded beyond the current legal ceiling of 12 then the dominant position of one group owning three channels would be removed. This liberalisation of the market would help Fininvest to hold on to its three channels. The ceiling can only be removed by parliament. Another solution he suggested, albeit interim, would be for Fininvest to lease one of its channels. The dominant position of Fininvest in commercial television, a unique situation in a European Union country, was formalised by a law in 1990. The law was the result of a highly politicised trade-off between Mr Berlusconi, then closely linked to Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader, and the political parties. In return for Mr Berlusconi being allowed to retain three channels and a near monopoly position of commercial television advertising, the RAI, the state broadcasting organisation, was left free to be controlled by the leading parties - the main channel by the Christian Democrats, the second by the Socialists and the third by the then Communists. Small television operators led by Telemontecarlo, Videomusic and Elefante TV challenged the law, ending up in the constitutional court.</p>

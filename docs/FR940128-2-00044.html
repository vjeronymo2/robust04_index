One of the commenters enclosed letters in support of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments from three nonprofit agencies employing people with severe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disabilities which have subcontracts to package folder tabs for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> folders. That commenter indicated that addition of the folders to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Procurement List would have a severe impact on the firm and its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees, particularly when other recent Committee actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacting the firm are taken into account. The commenter also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated that these folders provide most of the work it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subcontracts to three agencies employing people with severe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disabilities which make tabs for use with the folders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the figures available to the Committee, the impact of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the loss of sales for the folders on this company, together with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the impact of the earlier actions, does not rise to a level which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Committee normally considers severe adverse impact. As for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible loss of employment for the commenter's workers, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Committee feels that it is outweighed by the creation of jobs for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> people with severe disabilities, whose unemployment rates greatly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceed those of people without disabilities. In addition, for at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least the first two years after the JWOD agencies assume supply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility, the commenter will be afforded the opportunity to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compete as a supplier of folder tabs to the nonprofit agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which will produce the folders. Thus, any impact on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters and its employees would be mitigated by the opportunity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they will have initially to compete to supply the folder tabs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of the three nonprofit agencies which are the commenter's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subcontractors for the folder tabs participates in the JWOD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program. According to that agency, its subcontract with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter only recently produced work for its people with severe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disabilities, and at very low wages. While the nonprofit agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been led to expect a constant flow of this work, it has no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guarantee that this will occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the JWOD-participating agency's subcontract work volume is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> typical of that provided to the other two nonprofit agencies (which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both the JWOD agency and the figure for subcontractor employees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided by the commenter suggest it is), the commenter's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Government business for these folders is only a portion of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total folder business. Consequently, even if the commenter is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> successful in competing to supply the folder tabs to the nonprofit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies which will produce the folders, addition of these folders  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Procurement List should not markedly diminish the amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subcontract work which would be available to the three nonprofit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies employing people with disabilities. Moreover, if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter (or the JWOD-participating subcontractor agency) is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> successful in bidding to supply the folder tabs to the nonprofit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies which will produce the folders, the work for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subcontractor agencies could actually increase for at least two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years since the commenter currently provides less than half of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Government requirement for the folders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, it should be noted that the commenter could discontinue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing this work to the nonprofit agencies employing persons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with severe disabilities if it chose. The commenter indicated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it would take only a small investment to automate this work. On  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the other hand, placing the folders on the Procurement List  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guarantees that people with severe disabilities will be involved in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> producing them for the Government. The Committee believes the jobs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its action would create outweigh the possible loss of employment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for employees of the commenter's subcontractors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The other commenter also indicated that it was being significantly impacted by this and other recent additions to the Procurement List. It also provided a small amount of information to  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> substantiate its claim that small businesses like itself are being forced out of the commercial market by large office products companies. Because of this development, the impact of additions to the Procurement List is magnified as there are fewer opportunities to recoup losses to the Procurement List in the commercial market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The impact of this and other recent Procurement List additions on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this commenter, as a percentage of the commenter's sales, is less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than half the impact on the first commenter. In the Committee's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> view, neither impact rises to the level of severe adverse impact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given the small impact figure for this commenter, the Committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not believe that the effect of a shrinking office products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market for small businesses, if such is the case, is significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enough to make the impact on this commenter severe.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consideration of the material presented to it concerning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commodities, fair market price, and impact of the addition on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current or most recent contractors, the Committee has determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the commodities listed below are suitable for procurement by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c and 41 CFR 51&hyph;2.4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I certify that the following action will not have a significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors considered for this certification were:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

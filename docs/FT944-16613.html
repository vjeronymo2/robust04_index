			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Mary Schapiro takes CFTC helm Ms Mary Schapiro will take the chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission this week, giving the agency a permanent chief for the first time in nearly two years. Her confirmation as the chief US derivatives regulator came last week, after being delayed for four months by a political dispute between Mr Jesse Helms, the powerful southern senator, and Mr Mike Espy, the US agriculture secretary. Although the 38-year-old Ms Schapiro kept a low profile during the dispute, both she and powerful people from the industry she will regulate have been anxious for her to start work. The CFTC has been without permanent leadership when financial regulators have been re-examining their treatment of derivatives, with the agency at best playing a consultative or catch-up role. Having suffered for years from an image as a toothless watchdog with questionably cosy relationships with its industry, the CFTC's stature and its staff morale were further damaged by the low priority the administration gave to filling the chair. Now the agency's traditional constituency, the US futures exchanges, fear the CFTC's lack of status will put them at a disadvantage as global rules on derivatives trading are forged. In her new post, Ms Schapiro has oversight of private derivatives markets as well as established futures exchanges. She will also become part of the president's working group on financial markets, which for the past year has been focusing on non-listed derivatives. Since 1988 she has served as a commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission, a regulatory agency that dwarfs the CFTC in terms of budget, staff and mandate. Asked about the perception that the SEC's competency far out-shines the CFTC, Ms Schapiro said: 'I don't want to compare the agencies  -it wouldn't be fair. I'd just like to say that the SEC is as fine an agency as I'd ever like to work in, public or private, and I'd like to bring the SEC's tradition as a fair, strong and tough regulator with me to the CFTC.' Ms Schapiro says one of her first actions will be to look at the CFTC's structure. 'The agency isn't growing, but its mandate and the markets it supervises are. Realistically, I have to find a better way to do the job with the resources we have.' The CFTC's 1995 budget is Dollars 50m, compared with the SEC's Dollars 300m. The CFTC has been criticised for neglecting its enforcement duties while devoting too much energy to desk work. Ms Schapiro, who started her career as a CFTC enforcement attorney, says she wants to change that image. 'I don't believe you can have an effective regulatory agency without an effective enforcement division. It doesn't matter how good your rules are if you can't enforce them,' she said. The agency must also ask Congress for reauthorisation this year. 'I'm hoping very much that this reauthorisation will not absorb all the agency's time and energy. My goal is to get the agency reauthorised quickly,' Ms Schapiro says. Although Ms Schapiro's nomination last May was widely praised by executives at US futures exchanges, her extensive knowledge of the industry may over time prove perplexing to them. She will be the first experienced regulator with extensive derivatives knowledge to head the CFTC in more than a decade.</p>

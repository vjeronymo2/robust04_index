			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICHARD EDER: E PLURIBUS ENGLAND;  </P> <P> THE BUDDHA OF SUBURBIA BY HANIF KUREISHI (VIKING: $18.95; 283 PP.)  </P> <P> "My name is Karim Amir, and I am an Englishman born and bred, almost."  </P> <P> It is a start worthy of Dickens; one of those bagpipe sentences whose skirl  heralds the book to come, and whose bumpy drone nourishes it as it goes along.  "The Buddha of Suburbia" is London subverted -- notice that "almost" -- by  reality.  </P> <P> There is London as idea: St. Paul's, sweet Thames, the Changing of the Guard,  the National Theater, helmeted bobbies, bowler hats, bespoke tailoring, Big  Ben, Bow bells, Pearly Queens and the lot. And there is London of those who  came, in one way or another, because of the first London; and who put a mosque  at Regents Park; kohl, dall, funny smells and funny accents in Southall; and  Caribbean markets and unemployed anger in Brixton.  </P> <P> Hanif Kureishi, author of the film "My Beautiful Laundrette," again shows us  England and her Third World, this time in a novel. He writes of Indian  shopkeepers, punk groupies with spiked green hair, grandmothers in saris and  their granddaughters hooked on Germaine Greer, soccer hoodlums, lords' sons in  Italian shoes and no socks, and avant-garde art snobs with private incomes. He  weaves together a London that is terminally fragmented; he writes about  traditional Londoners and the people they take account of only when they take  the wrong bus.  </P> <P> The weaving is done through the wonderfully observant and comically desperate  voice of Karim, son of an Indian father and an Anglo mother. They live in a  dingy south London suburb and float between worlds. But it is Kureishi's point  that the worlds themselves are floating.  </P> <P> Dad, as Karim calls him, is a minor government employee, and miserable at it.  But it is not his real life. He is a flowery Bombay cock-of-the-walk: warm,  impulsive and flirtatious. When Karim was 3 and 4, Dad would take him to  tearooms and dispatch him to ladies at nearby tables with the message: "My  daddy wants to give you a kiss." Later, he draws on his heritage to practice  yoga and give courses in Eastern mysticism.  </P> <P> Dad is a big hit with the local middle class, particularly with Eva, who is  brassy, arty and shrewd, and steals Dad from his family. Karim is torn. He goes  with his father to Eva's seances in turquoise flared trousers, see-through  shirt, scarlet vest with gold stitching, high-heeled blue boots and a headband  -- a mixture of Indian and hip -- but he weeps at the news that Dad is leaving.  Dad weeps too, and covers him with kisses. The weeping and kissing are done in  public; tropical disturbances at a south London bus stop. Dad is trying to go  to Eva's; he has to ask Karim for the right bus.  </P> <P> Karim knows all the buses. He is solidly in with the matted-hair rock 'n' roll  set at his school; he listens to pop stars on his radio, and he has the right  moves. But he floats too. He is bisexual -- in a novel about blurred identity,  even sex is blurred -- and makes love both to Charlie, Eva's beautiful,  rock-musician son, and to Helen, whose father has a hairy back and hates  "blacks."  </P> <P> He also makes regular love with Jamila, his best friend. She has done drugs and  sex since puberty; she is utterly liberated and politically aware; her idols  are Greer, Malcolm X and Kate Millett. But her father, Anwar, is on a hunger  strike because she refuses to marry a husband whom his family in Bombay has  picked out for her.  </P> <P> Floating worlds. The Indians are trying to cope with being English. The English  have lost any real identity of their own. Dad, the suburban Buddha, is a big  hit; he even converts Karim's chauvinist Uncle Ted, whose hobby is football  rioting.  </P> <P> Eva will move to central London and get in with the art crowd. She will take  Dad with her; his guru work will go out of demand, but he will remain as  cheerfully full of himself as ever. Jamila will marry Changez, her bespoke  husband, but she will not sleep with him.  </P> <P> Karim will get a theater job playing Mowgli in "The Jungle Book." He will move  up to a fashionable avant-garde group, working up a character based on his  Indian relatives. It will feel like exploitation, but it will lead to a  high-paying TV job; and by that time, having been exploited, sexually and  otherwise, by his up-market English associates, he won't much care.  </P> <P> Kureishi's story turns thin and cartoonish in its later sections, when Karim is  dealing head-on with the snobby London set. Other English writers, from Waugh  on, have told us everything possible about its hollowness and decay. Kureishi's  pages on the decadent New York entertainment scene -- Charlie has become a  punk-rock star -- are equally thin and brittle. But the portrait of Karim's  inner struggle, and that of his family and friends, is richly comic and quite a  bit more.  </P> <P> There is Changez, for example, Jamila's imported husband. We first see him as  "the man walking towards England." He is a one-man foreign country right in the  middle of Heathrow Airport: tubby, bald, carrying two rotting suitcases and  full of illusions about a fine marriage and a fine English future. They will be  punctured, one by one.  </P> <P> Changez is hopeless at working; he falls asleep in his father-in-law's store.  Jamila treats him with the utmost severity, making him sleep on the couch while  she sits in the bedroom doing her political studies. Eventually she moves them  both to a commune, where she takes lovers of both sexes.  </P> <P> Changez yearns continually, but with immense dignity. With one deformed arm and  no looks, he is lordly nonetheless. He is a god exiled into hard times, but he  never doubts himself. And he delivers a splendid speech of outrage in Jamila's  anarchist, vegetarian, free-love (but not for him) commune:  </P> <P> "All you here in this house, you good types, talk of the prejudice against this  Yid and that black burglar bastard, this Paki and that poor woman. . . . But  what about ugly bastards? What about us? What about our rights to be kissed?"  </P> <P> In his account of his countrymen making their way in England, Kureishi tells us  more about England, perhaps, than he does when he attempts a direct portrait.  It is in the lovely deflections of his highly colored, life-asserting Indians  that we see the social hollows and pallors of their hosts. Karim's south London  schoolmates, and the aimless husbands and wives who flock to Dad's Buddha  sessions, are as floating and unplaced in Thatcherite England as the immigrants  are.  </P> <P> In an odd way, "The Buddha of Suburbia" is a counterpart to Tom Wolfe's  "Bonfire of the Vanities." Both books show the Western city pressed upon by a  non-white Third World. Wolfe's book, clever but cold, shows us simply what it  is like to be pressed. Kureishi's witty and exhilarating novel -- despite its  awkward and disappointing second half -- shows us what it is like to be that  Third World.  </P> <P> We see the people in the streets, subways and little shops from whom we tend to  avert our eyes, or at least our sympathy. In averting them, we become less  visible to ourselves. We could use a few Kureishis over here.  </P></p>

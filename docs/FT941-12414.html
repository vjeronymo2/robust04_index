			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Bundesbank will not pass reserves to EMI The Bundesbank's president, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, has ruled out transferring any of its currency reserves to the newly-established European Monetary Institute. Speaking at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, he stressed that the EMI would have only an advisory role throughout the so-called phase two of the process towards European monetary union. Responsibility for monetary policy would remain in the hands of member country central banks. He pointed out that, according to the Maastricht treaty, important decisions of the EMI during this period would have to be unanimous. The treaty permitted central banks to transfer reserves to the EMI, but Mr Tietmeyer said he had not heard of any country willing to do so. 'The Bundesbank will not do this. We feel we are equipped to manage our reserves in the appropriate way. Of course this will change when we move into the situation of a European central bank.' He also cautioned the EMI against promoting the Ecu as a currency. 'The EMI's task is to facilitate but not to promote the Ecu. The Ecu is not a currency, it is a basket, and there are exchange risks in it during phase two.' The EMI, which is to be located in Frankfurt, began work on January 1 and has the task of preparing the ground for eventual monetary union, due in 1999. Mr Tietmeyer said he did not believe lasting monetary union could be achieved without a parallel political union of EU countries. He said numerous issues connected with monetary union still had to be resolved, including what the main policy aims of a European central bank should be. While the Bundesbank set priority on money supply targets, the Bank of England stressed price stability, and other countries pursued exchange rate policies, he said. Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, said the EMI's most important task was to prepare the ground for monetary union, seeking solutions to technical obstacles in member countries and promoting standardisation of statistics.</p>

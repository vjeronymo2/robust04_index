			<p>BFN     [Text] A document from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent  to our news desk 6 April states that Mozambique and Lithuania  have decided to establish diplomatic relations at ambassadorial  level as of 30 March.    The document says the decision was made due to the two  countries desire to develop relations of friendship and  cooperation in the political, trade and economic fields, based  on the 18 April 1961 Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations.    Relations between the two countries will be based on  principles of sovereign equality, mutual respect, self  determination, independence, territorial integrity,  noninterference in the internal affairs of each country, as  provided for in the UN Charter.    The document from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also says  that the two countries are convinced that establishing  diplomatic relations between them corresponds to the interests  of both states and will strengthen peace and international  security.    The agreement formalizing this decision was signed by Pedro  Comissario, Mozambican ambassador extraordinary and  plenipotentiary to the United Nations, and Ambassador Anicetas  Simutis, Lithuania's permanent representative in the United  Nations.</p>

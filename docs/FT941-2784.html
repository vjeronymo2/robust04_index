			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (5): Flow of funds quickens - Foreign Investment While Poland remained in default on its foreign debt it was forced to rely primarily on foreign governments and the international financial institutions for the bulk of its foreign borrowing requirements. This will now change. The World Bank alone set aside more than Dollars 3.5bn for lending to a wide range of projects in Poland from agricultural modernisation to banking reform and environmental protection. The EBRD has more projects in Poland than any other former communist country and the International Finance Corporation has invested more than Dollars 250m. Until now the rate of disbursement has been rather slow, reflecting bureaucratic and political delays and institutional limitations to Poland's capacity to absorb such funds. But the London Club agreement opens the way to a much more efficient use of capital by allowing Poland's fast-growing enterprise sector to raise equity capital abroad and allow the Polish state to raise funds from the syndicated loan market on more favourable commercial terms. Recent months have seen a considerable increase in foreign equity investment. But the Dollars 2-3bn which has flowed into Poland over the past four years compares poorly with Hungary which has attracted more than Dollars 7bn and has only a quarter of Poland's nearly 39m-strong domestic market. The bulk of equity investment has been made by the multinational consumer goods manufacturers who have been busy buying and modernising existing plants and shops, building new greenfield factories and bottling plants and advertising heavily to create brand recognition and brand loyalty. The two biggest foreign investors to date are Fiat, which has committed Dollars 2bn to expanding output and building up the country as the sole source for Europe-wide sales of its new Cinquecento model, and Coca-Cola which has already invested Dollars 170m and has committed another Dollars 50m in fierce rivalry with Pepsi-Cola. But the fast expanding list of consumer goods companies attracted by the prospect of a rapid growth from a low base in a large market now includes the leading deter-gent and household ware companies, including Unilever, Procter and Gamble, Henkel, Benckiser and Cussons, the big fast food chains from McDonald's to Burger King and Pizza Hut, and a growing number of chocolate, con-fectionery and food processing companies and breweries. Latest forays into the consumer field include Cadbury Schweppes, which has just built a Dollars 30m chocolate factory on a greenfield site near Wroclaw, and Nestle which paid Dollars 25m for a 45 per cent stake in the Goplana confectionery factory near Poznan. At the beginning of march Heineken paid Dollars 40m for a 25 per cent stake in Zywiec, the recently privatised brewery. The Heineken deal, in particular, revealed how high the cost of acquisitions has risen in recent months. This follows the spectacular revaluation of the presumed worth of quoted companies on the Warsaw stock exchange where prices rose ninefold in 1993. The Warsaw Bourse Index has risen a further 50 per cent so far this year. A wave of new listings and new share flotations is expected in 1994. The rising cost of buying Polish companies has highlighted the prescience of those bold and long-sighted enough to enter the Polish market four to five years ago when good potential assets could be had for a song. High on the list of successful early birds is Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) which has invested well over Dollars 100m and much managerial and technical input but now employs more than 8,000 people in a series of strategic sectors well placed to take advantage of the expected infrastructure investment boom which lies ahead.</p>

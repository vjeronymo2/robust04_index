A high-level meeting could take place in April.    Deputy Foreign Minister Koichiro Matsuura flew into Brussels  from Washington yesterday night. He was due to meet this  morning with Jacques Delors, [European Union Commission]  president, as well as with Horst Krenzler, EU director general  for external economic relations, to inform them of the  U.S.-Japan trade talks which broke down this weekend. There are  now regular contacts between Brussels and Tokyo "so that,"  according to Japanese diplomatic circles, "no discussion goes on  in Washington without Europe been kept informed."    Nevertheless, the Europeans also hope to take advantage of  this situation to review their own trade relations with Japan.  The overall framework was established in July 1991 with the two  parties signing a joint statement which, among other things,  tentatively provided for an annual meeting at the highest level.  A few days later an agreement was concluded according to which  the Japanese agreed to voluntarily limit their car exports to  Europe. This remains the only specific trade agreement between  Japan and Europe. This is the reason why the Twelve felt a need  to review a number of sectors in which European firms believe  their market share in Japan is insufficient as compared to their  worldwide performance.  <H5>  Meeting Tentatively Scheduled for April </H5>   The process -- known by its English acronym "TAM" [expansion  not given] -- began last winter. First, it seeks to identify,  sector after sector, the fields in which European exports to  Japan are markedly lower with respect to world markets. Then,  it focuses on the reasons for such variations in the hope of  remedying them. Completion of the list, which includes dozens of  industrial and service activities, is due soon. Then, concrete  conclusions will have to be drawn at a ministerial-level  meeting, tentatively scheduled for the month of April "if the  political situation in Japan allows." But between the  statistical exercise -- in which the Japanese have proved quite  willing to cooperate -- and a hypothetical political decision  regarding the opening of Japanese markets, there is a gap which  is unlikely to be crossed easily, despite the low profile  assumed by Europe over the past two years as a result of its  decision to focus on dialogue rather than conflict.</p>

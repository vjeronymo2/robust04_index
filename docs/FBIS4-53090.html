			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Japan's chief economic  planner said Monday [May 16] the nation's economy will stage a  bona-fide recovery during the current fiscal year.    "The Japanese economy will likely get onto a path of  full-fledged recovery during fiscal 1994," which started on  April 1, said Yoshio Terasawa, director general of the Economic  Planning Agency [EPA].    The economy will receive a boost from brisk housing  investments and income tax cuts, which will help reduce  inventories of durable goods, he said.    He predicted consumer spending will pick up, thereby  improving private-sector sentiment, and that capital investments  will eventually start recovering.    Consumer spending and corporate capital investments are two  main driving forces for the economy.</p>

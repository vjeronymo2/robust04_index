			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Lamont backs PM after attacking policies MR Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, last night declared his support for Mr John Major, the prime minister, a day after delivering a wide-ranging attack on government policy. 'John Major will have my support,' Mr Lamont said. 'The Conservative party does not want a leadership election, and there will be no leadership election. Mr Lamont's declaration, delivered on BBC television, followed a day of mounting criticism of his attack on the prime minister from former cabinet colleagues. However, rightwing backbenchers said uncertainty about Mr Major's hold on Downing Street would continue until after the Conservative party conference next month. Sir Teddy Taylor, MP for Southend East, said Mr Lamont had given a public airing to views held privately by ministers who were unable to speak out. He said the conference would be 'very difficult'. Mr Major dismissed Mr Lamont's criticism, in two newspaper articles published yesterday, as 'sad and disingenuous'. He said speculation about a leadership challenge was 'silly'. The prime minister's response was echoed by cabinet colleagues. The strongest reaction came from Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, who said the sight of 'ex-ministers rewriting history' was 'sickening'. Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, claimed Mr Lamont's comments had been ignored by regional officials attending a morale-boosting meeting in Cardiff. 'The issue which has been raised with me is that of loyalty to John Major, support of John Major as prime minister,' he said. 'There is no question whatsoever about that.' Significantly, rightwing ministers also spoke out in support of Mr Major. Mr Michael Forsyth, employment minister, said much of the debate was 'surreal'. Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, said it was 'sad that Norman does think it necessary to continue to comment in this vein'. Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the 1922 committee, which represents all Conservative backbenchers, said the 'vast majority' of Tory MPs supported Mr Major. However, in a comment which reflected the unease in the party, Sir Marcus said it appeared that 'Norman Lamont is going to be a loose cannon on the back benches'. In his appearance on BBC's Question Time, Mr Lamont said he would like to return to the cabinet, but ruled himself out as a leadership candidate. He also repeated his challenge to the prime minister to rule out British participation in European monetary union. Downing Street said this was an empty challenge because the prime minister had already described the timetable for monetary union set out in the Maastricht treaty as unsustainable. Lord Jenkins, a founder of the Social Democrats, said on the programme he found Mr Lamont's behaviour 'distasteful'. Mr Lamont 'was not up to the job' as chancellor, he added.

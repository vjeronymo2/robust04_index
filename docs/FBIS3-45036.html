He added  that the two sides should not deal with sensitive political  issues in their working level talks.    Mr. Tang made these remarks in a report delivered at the  third session of the first council of ARATS. He noted that  certain new matters had arisen in the course of routine  cross-strait talks on the implementation of the agreement  reached by the heads of the two organizations. Since Taiwan had  introduced into the working talks certain political and legal  issues including matters which had not yet been settled, this,  Mr. Tang said, was seen as a violation of the direction in which  the two sides should be moving. He stressed that the two  non-governmental organizations should base their work on  economic and routine affairs.    Mr. Tang urged the Taiwan side to return to the consensus  reached in the talks between the heads of the two groups, saying  he hoped ways leading to a solution of routine matters would be  found in a bid to reach an agreement acceptable to the two sides  on the basis of mutual respect, equality, seeking truth from  facts and common ground while reserving differences. The aim is  to continue with the talks between the two sides in order to  facilitate links and cooperation between them and to push  forward cross-strait relations.</p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Foreign losses spark selling in New York Wall Street LOSSES ON overseas equity markets, prompted by concern about the global economy, led to heavy selling of US stocks yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 30.80 down at 3,277.61, its lowest for more than a month. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fell 2.83 to 410.93, while the American SE composite lost 1.65 to 383.17 and the Nasdaq composite 4.75 to 563.88. Turnover on the New York SE was 192m shares. In Tokyo overnight, stocks fell to their lowest levels for six years, which sparked a sell-off in major European markets. That set the tone for a weak opening in the US, and within the first few minutes the Dow had registered a 20-point decline. The selling spread throughout the market and, as on Monday, motor shares were particularly weak. Ford receded Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 42 3/4 in turnover of 2.2m shares, General Motors weakened Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 38 7/8 in similarly active trading, and Chrysler slipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 18 1/2 . Bankers Trust climbed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 61 1/4 on news of an 11 per cent gain in second quarter net income to Dollars 205m. Banc One dipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 43 7/8 after announcing the Dollars 125m acquisition of Illinois-based First Community Bancorp, which forged ahead Dollars 8 1/4 to Dollars 26 3/4 , and a joint venture with three other regional banking groups to form an electronic payment services company. Other bank stocks lost ground, with Wells Fargo retreating Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 69 1/2 , Chemical Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 34 7/8 , BankAmerica Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 44 7/8 and Chase Manhattan Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 25 7/8 . Compaq jumped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 27 3/4 on reporting second quarter net income of 35 cents a share, up from 23 cents and well above the 29 cents expected by analysts. Upjohn rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 33 7/8 in active trading after the company said its scientists had created a compound which it believed is more potent in blocking the growth of the HIV virus than its AZT drug. Harley-Davidson advanced Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 27 1/8 on news of second quarter operating income of 49 cents a share, up from the 45 cents recorded a year earlier. Canada TORONTO closed lower after moderate trading. The TSE 300 index declined 13.1 to 3,412.1, while falls outscored advances by 305 to 238 after a volume of 23.9m shares valued at CDollars 317.7m. Imperial Oil gained CDollars  5/8 to CDollars 44 5/8 . The company reported a second-quarter profit of 30 cents a share, compared with year-earlier earnings of 3 cents.</p>

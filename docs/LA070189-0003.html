			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPANESE-AMERICANS PUT IN CAMPS;  </P> <P> K. R. BENDETSEN; HELPED PLAN WWII INTERNMENTS  </P> <P> Karl R. Bendetsen, one of the chief architects of the government's internment  of Japanese-Americans in World War II, has died at his home here after a heart  attack. He was 81.  </P> <P> Bendetsen, a retired president and chairman of the board of Champion  International Corp. of Stamford, Conn., and undersecretary of the Army in the  1950s, died Wednesday.  </P> <P> In 1942, Bendetsen, then a major in the Army provost marshal general's office,  was assigned as a liaison officer between the Justice Department and the  Western Defense Command, after officials decided that Japanese-Americans  represented a potential threat to national security during World War II.  </P> <P> He devised a system that divided the West Coast into prohibited military zones.  He also designed a complex system of passes and permits for Japanese immigrants  that the Justice Department and the FBI refused to oversee because of a lack of  manpower. That gave supervision of Japanese immigrants, and later Americans of  Japanese ancestry, to the Army, which subsequently ordered their internment.  </P> <P> As the controversy over the internment grew over the years, Bendetsen was  called on to testify and to give statements on the background of the internment  process.  </P> <P> Researchers determined that he had written a letter "saying he didn't feel it  was appropriate (to the government's position) that the American public know  that plans were already in place to intern the Japanese-Americans" even before  the attack on Pearl Harbor.  </P> <P> Those who spent time in the camps were eventually awarded reparations.  </P> <P> Bendetsen's military decorations included the Silver Star, three Bronze Stars,  three Legions of Merit and a Distinguished Service Medal. He was also the  recipient of the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award.  </P> <P> After the war, Bendetsen resumed his San Francisco law practice. He was  appointed assistant secretary of the Army in 1950 and undersecretary in 1952.  </P> <P> He became chairman, president and chief executive officer of Champion Papers, a  forest products company, in 1965 and retired in 1972.  </P> <P> From 1980 to 1984, he served as a member of a presidentially appointed  commission to study the Strategic Defense Initiative, also known as "Star  Wars."  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A NEW ALLEGIANCE TO THE VEIL;  </P> <P> FEMALE WARRIORS OF ALLAH;  </P> <P> WOMEN AND THE ISLAMIC REVOLUTION BY MINOU REEVES (E. P. DUTTON: $17.95; 210  PP.; 0-525-24712-2)  </P> <P> In the decade since the overthrow of the regime of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi  and the start of the Iranian revolution, a virulent strain of Islamic  fundamentalism has spread throughout the Muslim world, espousing a social order  that appears to promote medieval attitudes, to restrict individual freedoms and  to foster misogynist beliefs. Yet, women in one Muslim country after another,  many of them educated in the West, have flocked to its banner, repudiating  Western clothing and value systems and declaring themselves willing to fight  and die for their beliefs.  </P> <P> Those early Western-inspired feminist movements in such countries as Egypt,  Iran, Lebanon and even Turkey, which sought to improve the lot of women through  legislation limiting polygamy and restricting men's freewheeling divorce and  custody rights, appear to be dead. In their place have emerged widespread  demands to return to Islamic roots, to rescind foreign-inspired legislation, to  reintroduce Islamic sharia law, to re-segregate educational systems. And  everywhere, women appear in the forefront of a movement to return to a  seemingly outmoded way of life, one that restricts their activities and limits  their choices.  </P> <P> Minou Reeves seeks to explore the reasons for the resurgence of Islam in the  late 20th Century, to explain the baffling paradox of women who freely  sacrifice their lives in war, bravely engage in guerrilla attacks, actively  take part in combat, yet voluntarily return to the veil, historically a symbol  of their exclusion from public life.  </P> <P> In seeking to uncover the sources of a phenomenon that has baffled and even  frightened many world leaders, the author links the resurgence of Islamic  traditions to anti-Western attitudes, whose roots lie in centuries of  confrontation between the West and the Islamic world, and more recently in  "anti-colonialist" and "anti-imperialist" sentiments born of post-World War II  experiences with foreign powers.  </P> <P> She outlines the historical development of repressive customs and attitudes  toward women in Muslim societies, in spite of Islam's originally liberating and  progressive tenets. She delineates the absorption into Islam of such  pre-existing local customs and practices as veiling and polygamy, showing how  obscurantist exegetes reinforced the misogynistic attitudes of patriarchal  societies.  </P> <P> She follows the emergence in the late 19th and early 20th centuries of Muslim  reformers in Egypt and Tunisia who objected to misogynistic interpretations of  the Koran and the hadith (the sayings of the prophet Muhammad). She touches  upon early 20th-Century reforms in such countries as Tunisia, Iran and Turkey,  which resulted from attempts at modernization inspired by Western models. She  sees feminism within the broader framework of nationalist and socialist  tendencies of the time.  </P> <P> The major contribution of this book lies in the author's sketching of the  larger historical and political framework for today's Islamic revival and in  making it clear that the resurgence of Islam cannot be understood outside of  the nationalist revival. The author has tackled a large and complex subject and  has managed to weave together many strands into a comprehensible and valuable  whole.  </P> <P> A narrower focus, however -- on Iran alone -- might have made this an even more  valuable book. The author has spread herself thin by attempting to cover too  much. Although she singles out Iran as the major moving force behind the  Islamic revival, in touching on events in a number of other Muslim countries  she neither does justice to them, nor to Iran. Had she concentrated exclusively  on the Iranian revolution, the author might have succeeded in exploring the  resurgence of Islam in far greater depth.  </P> <P> She might, for example, have examined in more detail -- and with actual  anecdotal accounts -- the difficulties that a tradition-bound and  underdeveloped country such as Iran faced when trying to compress several  hundred years of modernization into one or two decades. She might have  explained what cultural aspects of Western culture have been so offensive to  Muslim sensibilities as to have provoked violent rejection.  </P> <P> She might have recounted, through the testimony of those who lived through the  revolution, what it was like to have experienced the trauma and the chaos of  those times. She might have studied, through the words of Iranian religious  leaders (many of whom are at odds with one another), the unresolved conflicts  over national goals, philosophy, and identity that continue to plague Iran and  that, at a deeper level, were to some degree responsible for the force of the  explosion that rocked this ancient land.  </P> <P> Furthermore, by limiting her sources to published documents, the author, in the  end, does not succeed in leading the reader across the cultural barriers to see  events as an insider.  </P> <P> Despite these shortcomings, however, this book is a much-needed corrective to  the paucity of objective information available to Western readers on the  subject of Muslim women. It goes a long way toward combatting much  disinformation, as well as misinformation, on the Muslim world in general and  its women in particular.  </P> <P> Finally, writing as she was at the height of Iran's xenophobic anti-Westernism,  the author could not have foreseen the current trend in Iran toward moderation  and pragmatism, as exemplified by the ending of the Iran-Iraq war. Recalled  from the front, women are having to put down their arms and set aside their  virulent anti-Western rhetoric. What role they will be allowed to play, amid  the high unemployment and economic chaos of their war-torn and  revolution-ravaged land, remains to be seen. But that is another chapter, and  it has not yet been written.  </P></p>

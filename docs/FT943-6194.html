			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Ceasefire will bring political challenges: White House at 'fever pitch'; Paisley demands talks at Number 10; Reynolds briefs Irish cabinet The question on everyone's lips in Whitehall yesterday was not whether there would be an IRA ceasefire but whether it would be permanent. As speculation that an announcement was imminent reached fever pitch, Downing Street drummed out the message that it has stuck to consistently since last December's Downing Street declaration - that only a permanent end to violence was good enough. Yet there was no denying that even a temporary ceasefire would subject all parties in the conflict to intense new pressures. If the cessation of IRA violence were permanent, London has promised that it would be ready to enter into 'preliminary exploratory dialogue' with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, within three months. In a letter to Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, in April, Downing Street explained that this dialogue would have three purposes: To explore the basis on which Sinn Fein would be admitted to an 'inclusive political talks process'. To exchange views on how Sinn Fein would be able in time to play the same part as the current constitutional parties in Ulster's public life. To examine the practical consequences of ending violence. What is not clear is the attitude London would take to the highly sensitive subject of handing in weapons. Downing Street said yesterday it would expect 'the law of the land' to be observed, apparently leaving the door open for paramilitaries with firearms licences to keep their weapons. Also unclear are the questions of the treatment of IRA prisoners and the extent to which the army would be withdrawn from Ulster's streets. When the issue of prisoners has arisen before, London has been quick to rule out the notion that there could be a general amnesty, while emphasising that it is normal to consider a prisoner's likeliness to reoffend when deciding how long he or she should serve. Until loyalist paramilitaries abandon their armed campaign, the need for a significant security presence will remain, although it is reasonable to expect this to be re-oriented towards countering the loyalist threat. Work would continue, meanwhile, on the joint framework document London and Dublin expect to inject fresh impetus into political talks. Optimists think this could be completed as soon as next month. A permanent end to IRA violence would also be expected rapidly to earn Sinn Fein an invitation to Mr Reynolds's pet project, the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, referred to in the joint declaration. The forum's aim would be to make recommendations on ways in which agreement and trust between both traditions in Ireland could be promoted and established. London would have to work hard to reassure unionists - and sceptical Conservative backbenchers - about the direction events were taking. If the IRA declared a ceasefire which was not permanent, it would, on the face of it, fall short of London and Dublin's demands and be insufficient to break the stalemate. Realistically, however, it would put both governments under immense pressure to respond with conciliatory gestures aimed at convincing republican leaders to make the ceasefire permanent. The longer the ceasefire lasted - perhaps accompanied by a second high-profile visit to the US by Mr Adams - the more these pressures would grow and the harder it would become for the two governments to maintain a united front. The republican strategy would probably be to emphasise continually how difficult it had been to convince hawks in the movement to lay down their arms, while exploiting any opportunity to drive a wedge between London and Dublin. Under such circumstances, the attitude of the US government could have a crucial bearing on whether London and Dublin ultimately decide to deviate from their present stance. In the short term, the two governments would probably be at pains to signal that the political process was moving ahead satisfactorily in spite of Sinn Fein's continued absence. This could best be demonstrated by early completion of the framework document. But a non-permanent ceasefire would put republican leaders under pressure too, because it is far from clear how patient IRA hawks would be if a significant period elapsed without government concessions. Continuing loyalist attacks would serve only to make IRA trigger fingers more itchy. The Sinn Fein leadership is well aware that a legacy of the indefinite ceasefire declared in 1975 was a murderous feud between the official IRA and the provisionals which weakened the movement for years. With the diligence and determination of the latest UK-Irish initiative having served to expose the IRA's isolation, republican leaders know that if another similar split were provoked, there would be no comebacks.</p>

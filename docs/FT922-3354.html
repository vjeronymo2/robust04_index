			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / International Company News: Shares in Northern Telecom fall on forecast NORTHERN Telecom shares fell sharply yesterday after the Canadian-based telephone equipment-maker painted a gloomy picture of its second-quarter prospects. The company's share price plunged 7 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday morning to CDollars 43 but then firmed slightly to close at CDollars 43 3/4 . The shares reached an all-time high of CDollars 57.50 as recently as last January. Dr Paul Stern, Nortel's chairman and normally an inveterate optimist, warned institutional investors in New York yesterday that the second-quarter's financial performance was likely to be 'below expectations.' Revenues are now expected to be below the USDollars 2.1bn posted in the second quarter of 1991. Besides the effects of the recession, Dr Stern said some business in the US has been deferred pending the award of modernisation contracts. Revenues will also drop by about 5 per cent as a result of the sale of some businesses which were acquired as part of Nortel's purchase of STC, the UK telecommunications group, in March 1991. These units were included in second-quarter 1991 earnings. Dr Stern expressed confidence, however, that growth would resume in the second half, thanks to the recovery of deferred business, a strong order book, and the elimination of distortions caused by the STC divestments. Nortel has reported unbroken improvements in quarterly earnings for more than three years. But the STC acquisition has accounted for much of the recent rise. STC has been integrated into Nortel's European operations, and the company says it is unable to calculate the UK company's precise contribution.</p>

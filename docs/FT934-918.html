			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Business and the Environment: Wood out of waste If you eat a hamburger at McDonald's, you could be sitting at a table made partly from waste polystyrene packaging and throwaway razors. Brothers Andrew and Robert Billson have developed a process in the UK for blending polystyrene wastes to make a hardwood substitute ready for immediate use without further machining. McDonald's and the Alton Towers amusement park are among their first customers. The Billsons have cracked one of the main problems of recycling: how to achieve a product valuable enough to cover the costs. Their Durawood sells at a price comparable with that of hardwood after finishing. It never needs painting, does not rot and resists insects. Robert Billson, who took a degree in recycling, likens their polystyrene-blending process to those he used when making alloys for cars and aircraft from waste metal at the original Billson family company. Andrew Billson was a shipwright's apprentice, before managing the fitting out of shops, restaurants and the Heathrow Penta hotel. After coming across some plastic wood made from polystyrene and using it to construct a picnic table, he asked Robert to join him in setting up Savewood Products which is based on the Isle of Wight. Polystyrene in its crude state is denser than water, and pentane, an inflammable gas, has widely been used to reduce its density. The Billsons looked for something safer and found an agent which generates carbon dioxide. As the plastic is drawn through an extruder to form lengths, carbon dioxide bubbles inside are stretched, so they resemble the vessels in wood and give a graining effect. Wood made from polystyrene requires flame retardants, usually including poisonous antimony trioxide, but the Billsons again found a safer substitute. They also decided to colour their wood with iron oxide, rather than organic or cadmium dyes.</p>

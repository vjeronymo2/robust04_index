			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / ITT launches shake-up of its car parts business ITT of the US yesterday announced a shake-up of its Dollars 3.5bn-a-year (Pounds 2.27bn) international automotive parts business in response to cost-cutting pressures from vehicle makers. The main focus of the restructuring will be in Germany, where the motor industry is making the most urgent demands for cheaper components. According to Mr Klaus Lederer, who will head the new ITT Automotive Europe, Mr Ferdinand Piech, the Volkswagen chairman, wants prices reduced by 30 per cent over the next three years. In response, Mr Lederer plans to pass the pressure down the line to his outside suppliers. He said the present list of 2,000 parts makers would be reduced by 30 per cent within two years. A crucial part of the restructuring is the merger of ITT's five hitherto stand-alone German businesses, Alfred Teves, SWF, De Koning, WIVO and ITT Bergneustadt, which will be rolled into ITT Automotive Europe. This concern will be responsible for all the group's brake and electrical systems businesses, including 11 German plants and a further 14 outside Germany. Cornerstone of the operation will be Teves, a leading supplier of braking systems. Mr Lederer will run ITT Automotive Europe from the existing Teves headquarters in Rodelheim, near Frankfurt. The new European unit will employ more than 17,000, including 13,500 in Germany. It will have annual sales of DM4bn. Buying in DM1.8bn of parts a year, it will have virtually double the purchasing power of Teves alone, said Mr Lederer. The European unit will be largest of three profit centres within ITT Automotive, based outside Detroit. These bring together what have previously been nine separate operating subsidiaries with 71 factories in 11 countries. The restructuring, planned since September last year, is the first full-scale response from a component maker to the mounting pressure on its prices and margins from western vehicle makers. Volkswagen, for example, says it suffers a 20 per cent cost disadvantage in comparison with French car makers and 30 per cent and more against the Japanese.</p>

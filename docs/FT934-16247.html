			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Truly, widely and deeply: Japan's recession is exposing widespread structural problems in the economy Japan is beginning to realise that its economic problems might run deeper than it had earlier imagined. This is not like other recessions. Until now, Japan's postwar economic slowdowns were caused mainly by external shocks, such as the 1973 oil crisis or the rise in the value of the yen sparked by the 1985 Plaza accord to curb the appreciation of the dollar. It was as if, in previous slowdowns, the economy had broken an arm, argues a senior executive at a leading Japanese securities house. The pain was intense, but the body remained healthy enough to ensure a quick recovery. This time, though, the economy has a circulatory disorder, caused both by external shocks and internal weakness, he says. A cure will therefore be harder to find and convalescence will take longer than in the past. A look at some of the latest indicators supports this diagnosis: Gross national product shrank by an annualised 2 per cent in the second quarter of this year. GNP in the current quarter is probably in decline too, which means Japan has slipped from an economic downturn into full recession. Most private-sector economists believe growth for the full year will be less than 1 per cent, the fourth year running in which the pace of growth has slackened. The previous occasion GNP faltered, in 1986, the economy recovered smartly in the following year. This time, recovery will come at the earliest in the second half of the tax year to March, according to official forecasts. Some private-sector economists believe recovery could be as far as a year away. Last week, the government reported a 2 per cent annualised fall in industrial output for August, down for the 23rd consecutive month, the longest decline on record. Inventories of unsold stocks continued to rise, by 0.7 per cent, the fourth monthly increase in a row. The jobs market shows no sign of pulling out of a two-year slide, illustrated by a fall in the number of jobs on offer to 70 per 100 applicants in August, from 72 in July, according to the Labour Ministry. Consumer confidence remains weak, with a 4.2 per cent decline in department store sales in August, the 15th month of decline, says the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Companies will cut capital investment for the fourth year running in 1994, according to the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan, raising worries that industry's capacity to respond to an upturn in demand will be diminished. The external pressures at work on the economy are well-known. The yen's more than 20 per cent rise against the dollar this year has saddled corporate Japan with heavy foreign exchange losses, Y1,000bn this year for the car industry alone, estimates Mr Yuichi Nakamura, president of Mitsubishi, the electronics goods and car group. On top of this, industry faces a downturn in demand at home and in most of its main export markets, even in fast-developing China. The weakness of the domestic economy means demand for imports is sluggish, with the result that the trade surplus continues to rise, so pushing the yen higher. As if that were not enough, evidence is mounting that the recession has uncovered structural problems in the economy that had been hidden by the steep rise in asset values that came to such an abrupt halt three years ago. The new coalition government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa has recognised this and done almost everything it can to stimulate growth. That includes deregulation measures, a Y6,150bn package of infrastructure spending and business loans. The Bank of Japan has helped with a three-quarter percentage point cut in official interest rates to a new low of 1.75 per cent. The only thing Mr Hosokawa has not yet been able to do is to respond to corporate pressure for a cut in income tax, seen as a vital stimulus to depressed consumer spending. On the question of income tax cuts, the fragile coalition is deadlocked. The Social Democratic party, the largest coalition member, has refused to accept a rise in sales tax to fund any cut in income tax, which is seen as essential by most of its government partners and the powerful Ministry of Finance. A compromise could emerge by the end of the year in the shape of an immediate income tax cut, to be funded by a rise in sales taxes in two years. Corporate Japan's recognition of its structural weaknesses is evident in the speed with which it has acted to cut capacity, by contrast with previous short dowturns, when many companies preserved capacity and continued to invest in hope of better times. The reduced capacity has brought a wave of job cuts, unprecedented in postwar times. This has provoked widespread fears that corporate Japan's tradition of jobs for life will break down. 'The time of employment insecurity has come,' warns a recent headline in the Asahi Shimbun, a daily newspaper. Cost-cutting by companies entered a new phase last month when NTT, the telecommunications group and a pillar of the industrial establishment, announced that it wanted to shed 10,000 staff, through voluntary retirement, by next year. As expected, NTT's move further undermined the 'jobs for life' ethos and encouraged others to follow; Toshiba is to cut 5,000 jobs, Honda 3,000, and Kawasaki Steel 3,200. Most of these job losses will take place over three to five years. So far, Japanese companies have managed to avoid making widespread redundancies, relying instead on natural wastage. This has helped keep the unemployment rate steady at 2.5 per cent in August, but this figure excludes the variously estimated 800,000-1.2m employees who are surplus to companies' needs but are still kept on the payroll. How much longer their hard pressed employers, many facing a fourth year of profits decline, will be able to afford to retain so many surplus staff is uncertain. The job market's weakness is a symptom of wider change in the industrial economy, as reflected by the continued shift of manufacturing capacity out of Japan to cheaper locations in south-east Asia. Japanese companies' decision to relocate manufacturing to low-cost sites overseas is a response to the rise in the value of the yen and the long-term general pressure on costs as their markets mature. This trend, strongest in the consumer electronics and car industries, clearly cannot be reversed once the domestic economic recovers. These developments have fuelled a debate on which new industry, if any, will provide the fresh engine of growth to compensate for the maturity of the consumer electronics and car sectors. Japan's postwar success in planning shifts in industrial dominance from textiles to shipping, then to cars and electronics, is being put to a fresh test. Planners at Miti and at a special government panel are working overtime on this question. There are no clear answers yet. Another structural weakness revealed by Japan's recession is the sclerotic state of the banking system. Banks are still scarred by the collapse in asset prices that came with the start of the downturn. This left banks with heavy bad debts, in some cases worryingly concentrated with a handful of top customers. A sharp decline in new lending which began three years ago shows no signs of easing. Officially, bad debts account for 3 per cent of the leading banks' loans, though the proportion rises to nearly 10 per cent if the more stringent US definition of what constitutes a bad loan is applied, says Ms Alicia Ogawa, investment analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia, the securities house. The economic consequence of all these structural problems - the surplus workforce, the industrial economy's maturity and the banking system's weakness - is to diminish Japan's future growth potential. When consumer and corporate confidence does recover, probably some time in the second half of next year, Japan will settle down to an average annual growth rate of 2.5 per cent-3 per cent, compared with 3.5 per cent-4 per cent in the 1980s, forecasts Mr Peter Tasker, chief strategist at securities house Kleinwort Benson in Tokyo. Most economists agree with him. So do Japanese companies, as reflected by their cuts in capital investment and capacity. Whether they have cut too much is questionable. But one thing is certain. Japan will emerge from recession to face unprecedented challenges to the economic priorities that have assured its success for the past 30 years.</p>

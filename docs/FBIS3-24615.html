Berezhkov: ``A Doctor's </F> Heartache -- Every Other Child in the Russian Federation Has a  Chronic Illness''; first paragraph is PRAVDA introduction]    [Excerpts]Leonid Fedorovich Berezhkov, doctor of medical  sciences and professor, heads the Department for the Study of  dynamics of Schoolchild Health Dynamics, Scientific Research  Institute of Hygiene and Prevention of Diseases of Children,  Adolescents and Young People, of the RF Goskomsanepidnadzor  [State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Oversight].  Our correspondent asked him to answer a few questions.    [Question]How do you generally assess the physical  condition of the youngest Russian citizens?    [Answer]Unfortunately, there is little reason for  optimism. More than half of all schoolchildren suffer from  chronic diseases. In essence this refers to pathology of the  nasopharynx, digestive organs, nervous system, anemia and  allergies.    [Question]What do the scientists predict for the  next few years?    [Answer]Frankly speaking, nothing good. In view of  deterioration of ecological conditions, we should expect a rise  in both acute and chronic diseases, particularly allergies,  bronchial asthma, and dermatitis. Worsening of nutrition will  lead to being underweight, retarded growth, sexual development,  anemia, and diminished constitutional resistance. The more  stress situations there are, the more often we will encounter  mental diseases, poorer immunity, physical development,  pathology of digestive and hemopoietic organs.    [Question]You mentioned the impact of ecological  conditions on child health. In what regions are there more sick  kids?    [Answer]There are the fewest healthy children in  the Central-Chernozem region (33 percent), Volga region (39  percent), the Far East (41 percent), while the best regions are:  North Caucusus (55 percent), North-West (54 percent), and  Kaliningrad (51 percent). The largest number of children with  chronic disease are in Moscow and St. Petersburg. The children  of the Urals and West Siberia do not enjoy good health.</p>

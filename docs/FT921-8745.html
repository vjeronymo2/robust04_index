			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Books: The charms of Catch 22 - Fiction PETTIBONE'S LAW by John Keene Bloomsbury Pounds 8.99, 363 pages BROTHERLY LOVE by Pete Dexter Harvill Pounds 14.99, 294 pages DOUBLE-WOLF by Brian Castro Allen &amp; Unwin Pounds 8.95, 225 pages HELLO DARLING, ARE YOU WORKING? by Rupert Everett Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 13.95, 232 pages YOU ENJOYED Catch 22? You'll love Pettibone's Law, a rip-roaring first novel by John Keene. It does for Vietnam what Joseph Heller did for the Second World War, and does it every bit as well. It is superb entertainment, a wonderfully maniacal book of a kind which Americans always seem to manage better than anyone else. The plot is broadly similar to Catch 22. Smilin' Jack Rawlins is a fighter pilot, posted reluctantly to Vietnam, who keeps his head down and gets through his tour of duty as best he can, pausing only to drink as much as possible and sleep with all the women he can find. He is surrounded by lunatics - a pilot who sings Country and Western as he flies into the attack, another who seeks out enemy fire because it will mean two more points towards his Air Medal - and comforts himself with Pettibone's Law, which states more or less that everybody is mentally deranged until they have proved otherwise. In Vietnam, as in Heller's Italy, to believe anything else is to court disaster. Deranged on the ground, as well as in the air. The only sane people in Vietnam are the Vietcong, who at least know what they are fighting for. On the American side, they are fighting for a variety of reasons - one because he has political aspirations at home, another because he pays no income tax if he can spend a few hours in Vietnam each month, another because he wants to erect a monument to himself in the form of an officers' mess built with stones from a Buddhist temple, and erected by two Americans under the command of a Vietcong prisoner. What none of them is fighting for is truth, justice, the American way. None of them gives a damn about the American way. It has been done before of course, but rarely so well. The author was himself a fighter pilot in Vietnam, and has subsequently emerged unscathed from a university writing programme. He writes from the heart, with such verve and vigour that it seems a fair bet that he will never produce another book as good. It comes as an original paperback, with a note from Joseph Heller. Pete Dexter's Brotherly Love is a story of the Philadelphia backstreets, a battleground between Italian mafia and Irish union bosses. As a child, Peter Flood sees his sister accidentally run over and killed by the Mafia-controlled cop who lives next door. Peter's Irish father subsequently chops the cop's head off (just as, in real life, the New York mafioso John Gotti - who lost his son in identical circumstances - is alleged to have had the guilty neighbour cut up with a chainsaw). Peter's father is killed in turn and Peter is adopted by his uncle. He grows up alongside his cousin, almost as a pair of brothers. The cousin becomes a gangster, but Peter is made of sterner stuff. He seeks a better life, distances himself from his criminal heritage. That he cannot escape his background, and is ultimately trapped by it, forms the crux of the novel. It is a neat little fable, though not as well judged as the author's previous effort, Paris Trout. Double-Wolf, by Brian Castro, is an ambitious reconstruction of one of Freud's most famous cases, seen mostly through the eyes of the Wolf Man himself, but paralleled also by the career of an Australian con man and amateur psychoanalyst, who acts more or less as his double. It is a complex idea, determinedly self-conscious and literary, and tells us, in the words of the blurb, 'many important and disturbing things about the nature of our culture and its roots'. Last, and very definitely least, Hello Darling, are you working? is not so much a first novel as an ego trip for the actor Rupert Everett, who is putting pen to paper in the belief that everyone has a book in them somewhere. The story, not altogether surprisingly, is about an actor just like Rupert himself. There is even a picture of him in his vest on the cover, in case his fans cannot make the connection. What is really disturbing, though, is the suspicion that this witless enterprise might have been intended as a TV series with the author in the star role. If, God help us, that ever came about, it would be only poetic justice if he was passed over for the lead in favour of a professional author. The author might have to learn a bit of acting technique - how to wiggle his eyebrows, how to move up stage without bumping into the furniture  -but nothing that could not be picked up in the course of an afternoon. Acting is easy, after all. Almost as easy as writing a novel.</p>

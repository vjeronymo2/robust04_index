			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Dream comes true as Eritrea heads for independence AN AFRICAN dream that goes back three decades is set to become reality. Over the next three days some 1.2m Eritreans will vote in a referendum which offers independence for what most of the world has regarded as a province of Ethiopia. The suggestion that the outcome of the United Nations-monitored poll will be other than an overwhelming Yes is dismissed by most Eritreans with good humoured laughter or a dismissive wave. The goal has sustained the people of Eritrea, a rugged territory the size of England, through war, drought and famine. Eritrea, which lies along the Red Sea just above the Horn of Africa, in 1961 began its battle for independence  -or as Eritreans see it, the recovery of a lost sovereignty. First against Emperor Haile Selassie and then President Mengistu Haile Mariam's Soviet-backed Derg regime, a guerrilla force took on one of Africa's biggest and best equipped armies. In May 1991 the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) overthrew Col Mengistu's forces and liberated the territory. The new government in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, (EPRDF) immediately supported the EPLF's bid for autonomy and a referendum on the issue. This week's vote will finally secure international recognition and end the long dispute over the colonial boundaries laid down by Italy, Eritrea's colonial ruler from 1890 until its defeat by Britain during the second world war. After 1941, Eritrea became a British protectorate until its UN-sanctioned federation with Ethiopia in 1952. A commitment to multi-party democracy has formed a central tenet in the EPLF's policy since 1987 and Mr Issaias Afewerki, secretary-general of the Provisional Government of Eritrea (PGE), insists the front will be dissolved once a constitutional government is established. But there is still no organised opposition and parties based on ethnic or religious affiliations are outlawed. With official UN recognition, Africa's first state since colonial days to mount a successful secession is now set to receive more than Pounds 88m for reconstruction projects from aid agencies and the World Bank. But the PGE puts the cost of reconstruction to bring the country back to its pre-war industrialised state at Pounds 1.3bn. The country's infrastructure and vital Red Sea port Massawa have been shattered, 80 per cent of its citizens depend on food aid and the annual per capita income is a mere Dollars 77 (Pounds 51). The war ravaged the country's agriculture, on which more than 90 per cent of the population depends, and a third of its topsoil has been lost. The country also faces the imminent return of 750,000 refugees, many of whom had fled to neighbouring Sudan. Mr Haile Woldense, economic development and co-operation secretary, says foreign investment to kick-start indigenous industry is a high priority to avoid the vicious cycle of aid dependency and international debts which has gutted the optimism in many African nations. 'If it is available, foreign support is good but we cannot have programmes based on the expectation of foreign support,' he says. To promote self-sufficiency, the PGE has already designated seven factories for outright sale and another six will be given corporate status. Eritreans exemplify the cliche that a nation's greatest resource is its people. After demobilisation, over 75,000 EPLF fighters stored their AK-47s in central depots and volunteered two years' unpaid labour towards reconstruction. The EPLF forces, a third of whom were women, sought to lay the groundwork of Eritrea's political and economic independence. In exchange for lodging and food rations, they are now building roads and dams, planting trees and have cleared more than 250,000 landmines. Eritrea's relations with Ethiopia will be delicate. Ethiopia will become landlocked, losing control over the ports of Massawa and Assab, although the PGE has guaranteed it access. The most visible opposition to Eritrean's imminent secession has come from Amharic students in Addis Ababa who demonstrated against the UN's intervention in the referendum process. During the visit in January of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, Ethiopian troops fired into the crowd killing one and injuring several others. Mr Afewerki dismisses the protesters as 'remnants of the Mengistu regime and the imperial era' and regards Eritrea's relationship with Ethiopia as mutually beneficial.</p>

			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SWIMMING / THERESA MUNOZ;  </P> <P> TIMES GET FASTER AFTER HER HEART SLOWS  </P> <P> It would strike at any time -- the middle of the night, the beginning of  practice, en route to class on the USC campus. Without warning, Megan  Holliday's heart would begin to race, up to 170 beats a minute.  </P> <P> The freshman distance freestyle swimmer from London, Ontario, was born with  Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome, and has an extra muscle fiber connected to the  upper and lower chambers of the heart that conducts impulses. When the  pea-sized extra fiber was functioning, it forced Holliday's heart to beat too  rapidly.  </P> <P> Holliday noticed the symptoms when she was 11. The rapid heartbeats lasted from  several minutes to more than an hour, although months would pass without an  episode.  </P> <P> Her doctor told her it was only a nuisance that she might grow out of, but  after Loyola Marymount basketball star Hank Gathers collapsed and died of a  heart condition last spring, Holliday's mother, Susan, ordered more tests for  her daughter.  </P> <P> The tests revealed that Megan is in a high-risk group and could suffer a heart  attack at any time.  </P> <P> "I was in shock," Holliday said. "I thought all along it wasn't a big problem."  </P> <P> She was given three options: medication, a catheter ablation procedure or open  heart surgery.  </P> <P> Holliday decided on the catheter ablation procedure, which would destroy the  superfluous tissue, because it would not require a lengthy recovery. On Aug.  20, a Canadian doctor performed the operation, but he was inexperienced with  the technique and it failed.  </P> <P> Upon her arrival in Southern California, Holliday tried medication, but it  backfired.  </P> <P> "I had attacks more often and I was dizzy so the university pulled me out of  the water," said Holliday, who had 12 episodes in four days.  </P> <P> "My mom frantically called around to find a doctor who could do the catheter  ablation procedure. We found one in Oklahoma City who had a cancellation, and I  went on two days' notice."  </P> <P> In a 14-hour procedure, the surgeon, Warren Jackman, positioned a small metal  electrode into the heart via a catheter. Using a high-frequency electrical  current, he destroyed the extra fiber. Five days later, Holliday was back in  the water.  </P> <P> "I never really thought about it as my life being in danger," she said. "The  funny thing is, I only worried about not being able to swim. Everyone else  worried about my health."  </P> <P> Although the procedure was apparently successful, there remains cause for  concern.  </P> <P> "I still get it going too fast, but after a couple of beats it stops," Holliday  said. "I talked to my doctor (in Los Angeles). He said because I'm tuned to my  heart so well I'm going to be on the alert for anything abnormal."  </P> <P> During Christmas vacation or spring break, Holliday will be retested. Her heart  will be stimulated to race to make sure the fiber has not grown back. There is  an 8% recurrence rate, but according to Jackman, there is no recurrence after a  second procedure.  </P> <P> In the meantime, Holliday is concentrating on swimming.  </P> <P> As a 15-year-old, she won two bronze medals for Canada in the 1987 Pan American  Games, but since 1989 she had leveled off -- until last weekend.  </P> <P> Even after missing a month of practice, she improved her time by 45 seconds in  the 1,650-yard freestyle in the U.S. National Grand Prix meet at Belmont Plaza  in Long Beach.  </P> <P> Cal's Sarah Anderson swam a meet-record 16 minutes 22.82 seconds in winning the  1,650 freestyle Sunday in the Grand Prix meet. Anderson also won the 500  freestyle handily at 4:46.32, and the third-ranked Bears won in the women's  division, beating USC, which is ranked fifth nationally, 1,249.5 to 948.5.  </P> <P> Cal and USC split the four relays, thanks to a strong finish by Cal's Amy  Tidball in the last event of the meet, the 400 freestyle relay. Tidball was  caught by Trojan anchor Lisa Dorman at the final turn, but Tidball inched ahead  in the last 10 yards.  </P> <P> "I just held my breath and it really speeded me up," Tidball said.  </P> <P> All was not lost by Dorman, however. She won the 100 freestyle in 50.87 and set  a school record in the 50 with a 23.18.  </P> <P> On the men's side, Arizona State beat USC, 1,111 to 1,022.5. The Trojans were  without five of their top swimmers. Four were benched by Coach Peter Daland for  missing practice and Olympian Dave Wharton, preparing for the World  Championships, swam only in the relays.  </P> <P> The individual highlight on the men's side was Glenn Peoples' 1:59.70 in the  200 breaststroke. The time would have placed him 15th in last season's NCCA  meet, a promising effort so early in the season.  </P> <P> Swimming Notes  </P> <P> Janet Evans had a sore throat and finished fifth in the 400 individual medley  and seventh in the 200 freestyle at the U.S. Open in Indianapolis Nov. 30-Dec.  1. . . . In the 100 butterfly, Santa Barbara's Brian Alderman upset 1988  Olympic gold medalist Anthony Nesty of Surinam and Canada's Marcel Gery, who is  ranked No. 2 in the world.  </P> <P> Arcadia's Natalie Norberg has come a long way since the U.S. Swimming senior  nationals in August, in which she finished 44th in the 200 freestyle in  2:06.46. At the U.S. Open, the 16-year-old from the Industry Hills team won the  silver medal in 2:02.83. . . . Texas sophomore Erika Hansen will not be able to  compete in the World Championships because of a virus. Longhorn teammate Katy  Arris will replace her in the 400 freestyle and Julie Kole, who recently made  an unwritten commitment to attend Stanford next year, will swim the 800  freestyle in her place.  </P> <P> Succeeding James (Doc) Councilman is like trying to replace John Wooden, Bear  Bryant, or Woody Hayes. It hasn't been done successfully by the initial  successor. No wonder the going is rough for Indiana's new coach, Kris Kirchner.  For the first time since 1956, the Hoosiers lost a dual meet to Purdue. . . .  Matt Biondi, Tom Jager and Eric Hansen competed in Flagstaff, Ariz., last  Saturday in two heats of the 50-meter freestyle before 325 at the Northern  Arizona Natatorium. Organizers hoped for a world record, but the fastest time  was Hansen's 23.08, well off Jager's world-record 21.81.  </P> <P> COMING MEETS -- International: World Aquatic Championships, Jan. 3-13, in  Perth, Australia, includes diving, water polo and synchronized swimming. Swim  dates are Jan. 6-13 and include first time long-distance (25 kilometers) race  in the Swan River. NCAA, Men: UC Irvine Invitational, Jan. 5-6; Men and Women:  UC Santa Barbara Invitational, Jan. 3-5; Arizona State Invitational, Jan.  10-13.  </P></p>

The prime minister emphasized that his government would  observe discipline in monetary and budget policies and that it  would continue the privatization process, while also involving  foreign capital. He pointed out that it was necessary to  achieve public support for the economic reforms being  implemented. "We want the reforms to affect not only the elite  but also the whole of society," he said.    Polish President Lech Walesa, in a letter sent to forum  participants, pointed out that "Poland has a central position  between the East and the West, the North and the South, and,  consequently, it must be part of the integrated continent  because this is in the interest of the whole of Europe. Poland  is a country of enormous possibilities and a place where good  business can be done. To place your stakes in Poland means to  choose success," the president added.</p>

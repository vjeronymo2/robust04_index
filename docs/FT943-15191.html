			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Arts: Fanfare for tradition - As the 100th season of Henry Wood Promenade Concerts gets underway, Antony Thorncroft talks to departing director John Drummond At 8 o'clock this Friday evening conductor Andrew Davis will raise his baton, the BBC Symphony Orchestra will take a deep breath and the richly romantic music of Schoenberg's Gurrelieder will fill the Royal Albert Hall. The 100th season of Henry Wood Promenade Concerts will have been successfully launched and all concerned can relax into the familiarity of a Great British Institution. The Prom season, like Wimbledon, is a national tradition that seems to work. Some composers complain that there is not enough contemporary music, meaning their own; fans of music on authentic instruments have their gripes ('tonight's concert can be heard on Radio 3,' shouted waggish Promenaders last year when a Bach harpsichord concerto blatantly failed to carry); there are the odd criticisms about the venue, about the timing of certain concerts, about the absence of great international soloists. But the Proms' status as the biggest music festival in the world, and perhaps the most successful, is secure. Even the BBC, with its current nit-picking self-appraisal, seems to have accepted the inevitable and left the Proms alone. There was talk of the Proms raising Pounds 2m from a sponsor to prevent a 10 per cent cut in the funding of the BBC orchestras but the search was fitful and when John Birt took over as director-general he abandoned the process. The Proms confer prestige; they offer wonderful entertainment opportunities for BBC apparatchiks; they allow the BBC, through its commissions for new music, to pose as a modern Medici; they are impressively popular, with audiences of 84 per cent of capacity last year; and they provide hundreds of hours of cheap, quality broadcasting. The director, John Drummond, is very much the showman who loves the sound of the turnstiles. 'Everything I buy in I pay for through the box office or from advertising. In eight seasons I've always been in the black. About Pounds 2.5m covers all the foreign orchestras and guest artists'. By taking advantage of the sponsored overseas tours by foreign orchestras he reckons he gets them at bargain prices: 11 are appearing this year, ranging from the Berlin Philharmonic to the Los Angeles Philharmonic. 'I am not in the market for paying fortunes to tenors, large ladies, or even conductors. Last year a major singer asked for a grotesque fee. We negotiated it down but she wanted an affidavit signed in front of a Justice of the Peace that we had never paid anyone more. It was ridiculous. We recruited instead a young English singer at a tenth of the cost and helped along her career'. But at almost half the 68 concerts this Prom season, the musicians performing are on the payroll of the BBC and here the costings become trickier. Even so, according to Drummond, 'the Proms are half the cost of Middlemarch'. Nicholas Kenyon, who succeeded Drummond as controller of Radio 3 and who, in 1996, also takes over as director of the Proms, says the actual size of the BBC subsidy is around Pounds 2m a year. 'We've quantified what we get from the Proms and are happy with it', says Kenyon. John Drummond, a big man in every sense of the word, has protected his fiefdom well. Not one for committee meetings, he has been around the musical world, and the BBC, for decades. He seems to have been allowed a long leash as he approaches retirement after the 1995 season, enjoying what has been described as 'wilful isolation' inside the BBC. It says much for the reputation of the Proms that even the slide-rule toting Birtian BBC can still embrace, however temporarily, this maverick talent. Drummond, though perceived as a traditionalist, has added much to the institution - Sunday Proms late night Proms, early evening Proms, Proms in churches, ethnic Proms, jazz Proms, even one ill fated attempt at a Show Tune Prom with Maria Ewing. Experience has taught him that the audience for opera is not a Prom audience - the first London production in decades of Ethel Smyth's The Wreckers at the July 31 Prom is not selling well; that the audience for contemporary music is totally committed but small, no more than 2,000 strong, which means that the Albert Hall would be less than half full; that Sunday concerts are difficult to shift - Promenaders want one night off. Drummond has resisted the embrace of cross-over music, so favoured on the rival South Bank, and he regularly declines evenings of film music and flamenco. His attempts to bring over jazz legends like Oscar Peterson and Ella Fitzgerald failed because of the demands of jazz promoters. 'They want all the box office and I'd never give that to anyone'. He is happy to have dropped Gilbert &amp; Sullivan from the programme; he regrets the apparent British indifference to Haydn. He rates his greatest achievements as the opening up of the Proms to foreign orchestras and the introduction of Sunday concerts, even if they have to be carefully programmed to persuade the weekday audiences to turn up once again. Sir Henry Wood gave his first Prom in 1895, so this year marks the 100th season and next year the centenary. Drummond is seizing on the chance to make his own last two seasons celebratory events: nostalgic and backward-looking this season and adventurous and forward-looking in 1995. The fact that the raft of BBC commissions of new music in 1995, from Berio, Birtwistle, Reich, Williamson, Weir and many more leading composers, might lead to the Proms missing their 75 per cent break-even target and Kenyon facing a nasty deficit, is a small price to pay for such patronage. Certainly 1994 has struck a chord with Promenaders, especially the fanatical 550 who buy a season ticket to stand in the arena, at a bargain price of Pounds 120, for 68 performances. Concerts like next Saturday's, a repeat of a 1900 Prom with 18 works including Boer War ballads, and concerts in tribute to Sir Henry Wood, Sir Malcolm Sargent, Sir William Glock and other great Prom personalities, have helped push advance bookings 5 per cent higher than a year ago. Traditions like a Wagner night, a Viennese night, and the performance of all the Beethoven symphonies, have been revived and revered performers, like violinist Ida Haendel, who made her Prom debut in 1937, are playing again. Music that was first heard at Proms, like Schoenberg's 'Five Orchestral Pieces' and Vaughan William's Fifth Symphony, will be among 68 past premieres lovingly respected. There is one Proms institution that John Drummond has left alone - the Last Night. His predecessor, Robert Ponsonby, tried to douse the high spirits by programming more serious music. Drummond has gone along with the exuberant promenaders. 'Three quarters of an hour of people being a bit silly after 68 concerts is OK by me.' He has even protected the Last Night from more populist attack. 'I know that Shirley Bassey has always wanted to sing there, but she won't in my time'. In Kenyon's time, perhaps, she might. Though Drummond's successor-in-waiting espouses 'continuity, not revolution,' change will be inevitable. There may well be more mini festivals, more themes, weaving through seasons. Kenyon, as a channel controller with budgets to meet, may at least look again at the idea of attracting outside, commercial, money to the Proms. Last week's government white paper giving the BBC a fairly clean bill of health has removed much of the pressure for change, but commercial sponsorship remains on the agenda. Last week, too, the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the major workhorse at the Proms with 15 concerts this year, announced its first ever sponsorship deal, a Pounds 300,000, three year, cash infusion from Land Rover. Kenyon might see opportunities in reducing the hold of orchestral music over the Proms. He might also think that rock, the great art form of the 20th century, could be comfortably embraced as the 21st century approaches. But he still has two years in which to plan. Meanwhile, Drummond is focussing on the job in hand and is uncharacteristically unclear about life after the Proms. He has done the big jobs - running the Edinburgh Festival as well as Radio 3, but missed out on others - like the Royal Opera House. At 60 he seems happy to take things easy, perhaps undertaking a few consultancies. But for the next seven weeks he knows exactly where he will be - in his box at the Royal Albert Hall. He never misses a Prom.</p>

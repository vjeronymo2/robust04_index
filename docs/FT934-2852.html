			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Apportioning pension blame (2) Sir, I am concerned that the publicity given to the Securities and Investments Board's pension transfer review implies that all the wrongdoing lies with the insurance companies and promoters of personal pensions. Their sales people may be guilty of the sins of commission but I believe that the occupational pension schemes must bear some responsibility for sins of omission. What type of pension scheme is it that has so badly presented the benefits it can offer to employees that they can be so easily sold a personal pension policy? What warnings were issues to the employee, ex-employee, or their adviser prior to the transfer from the scheme? Were the alternative benefits  -which may indeed have been superior - properly presented? Why should the whole burden for compensation be put on the insurance company, especially when it seems that some schemes are asking for exorbitant amounts before reinstating members' benefits? Why, indeed, should schemes be allowed to refuse to take back employees who have made an incorrect decision? Would it not be possible for the government to amend the appropriate legislation or Inland Revenue rules? Obviously, if wrong advice is given, insurance companies should pay the appropriate costs. However, many pension schemes, and the employers which bear their cost, will have benefited because of a decision to transfer away from the scheme. If compensation is to be paid, I trust it will be calculated in such a way that no party will be better off financially. I hope the new SIB advisory committee will address these issues.

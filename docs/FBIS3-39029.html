			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jean-Louis Levet, head of the General </F> Planning Commission's Technological and Industrial Development  Department, by Henri Loizeau; place and date not given:  "Strategic Information, Key to Corporate Competitiveness"]    [Text] The General Planning Commission has published a  report on "economic intelligence." The working group, chaired  by Henri Martre, argues that there is an urgent need for the  French protagonists to wake up to this.    [Loizeau] What is the reason for this report on such a  little known concept as economic intelligence?    [Levet] For several years now, the Planning Commission has  been developing lateral and interministerial thinking. When I  started work in the Planning Commission almost two years ago, I  wanted to develop this kind of thinking in the sphere of  industry, following the Mayer report on "information and  competitiveness." The sovereignty of states depends increasingly  on the mastery of technologies and a strong and competitive  industry. With this in mind, strategic information represents  one of the levers determining an economy's worldwide  performance, which in turn combines competitiveness and social  cohesion, as is shown by the example of Germany and Japan.  Similarly, the Clinton Administration is trying to remedy the  American economy's loss of competitiveness by a strategy of  economic security serving employment and based on the  strengthening of the industrial fabric and a response to attacks  from competitors.    [Loizeau] How can "economic intelligence" be defined?    [Levet] The working group chaired by Henri Martre defined it  through the following three functions: Mastery of the  scientific and technological heritage; the detection of threats  and potential opportunities; and the formation of a strategy of  influence serving the national interest and/or the enterprise's  interest. Thus, strategic information management becomes a  fully valid tool in the permanent understanding of the market  situation, the technologies and thinking of competitors, their  culture, their intentions, and their abilities to implement  them. It must serve a dynamic and concerted strategy.    [Loizeau] Which countries are most advanced in this sphere?    [Levet] The two systems which perform best are Japan and  Germany. In Japan, the information system is collective,  focused on the world market, and serving national independence.  In Germany, it is the motor of the national economy, based on  industrial strength. In the United States, however, the economic  intelligence system seems fragmented, based on an  individualistic rationale by the enterprises.    [Loizeau] And in France?    [Levet] In France there is no economic intelligence system  based on a common goal. Historically, the state and the public  enterprises have played a driving role. In the enterprises, the  eighties saw the emergence of technological and competitive  monitoring. But it is not yet really seen as a strategic tool.  The main goal of this report is to help speed up the awareness  which is beginning to emerge in this sphere.    [Loizeau] What are the recommendations which you are putting  forward to ensure that France is not left behind in this crucial  sphere of information.    [Levet] We are drawing up a series of proposals based on  four guidelines:    1. Introducing the practice of economic intelligence  gathering in the enterprise by the direct involvement of general  management, the creation of a position of economic intelligence  network manager, and the motivation of the whole staff.    2. Encouraging the flow of information between government  departments and enterprises. In this area, the state must play  a strong encouraging role.    3. Designing databases tailored to user requirements, for  instance, by launching a national program for the production of  databases with a strategic content and mobilizing the necessary  expertise.    4. Mobilizing the world of education and training by  creating specialized training programs in economic  intelligence....</p>

			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Ruhrkohle to cut 20,000 mining jobs RUHRKOHLE, the largest coal producer in Germany, confirmed yesterday that 20,000 jobs will be axed in the next two years because of the worsening steel crisis, as 70,000 angry steel workers protested in Bonn. The acceleration of job cuts in the German mining industry, an increase of 12,000 over what was originally planned for the next two years, is a direct result of cuts in steel production, where another 35,000 to 40,000 are expected to lose their jobs. The threat of total closure still hangs over one entire pit - the Aden/Monopol mine in Bergkamen where 8,000 coal miners are employed. An entire coke works will close at the end of June. The company had planned to carry out the total 20,000 lay-offs by 1999, with production gradually decreasing to 38m tonnes. But it had speed up its restructuring as orders from steel producers, expected to reach 41m tonnes of coal and coke per year between 1992 and 1996, fell to 32m tonnes. Ruhrkohle said sales in 1992 plunged by 28 per cent. Unsold stocks have steadily increased, from 15m tonnes of coal equivalent at the end of 1991 to a forecasted 20m tonnes at the end of 1993. Faced with a bleak future, steel workers marched over the last three days from the Ruhr valley to Bonn where they reiterated their call for a national steel conference to debate the fate of the German steel industry. 'We are not only stricken by an economic crisis. We are also the witnesses of a profound political crisis,' Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the leader of IG Metall, Germany's giant engineering union, told the crowd. The union is calling on politicians to draw up a long-term strategy for the future of the national steel industry.</p>

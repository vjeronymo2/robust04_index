			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / International Company News: Union Square cuts losses to Pounds 483,000 UNION SQUARE, which has disposed of a significant part of its property portfolio in order to reduce debt, cut its losses from Pounds 10.48m to Pounds 483,000 pre-tax for the year to end-March 1992. Net interest charges fell to Pounds 1.33m (Pounds 4.41m) and exceptional provisions were cut to Pounds 315,000 (Pounds 5.22m). However, extraordinary charges rose to Pounds 4.98m (Pounds 3.78m). Losses per share worked through 0.43p (15.6p). The directors said it had not been possible to conclude discussions with the company's main bankers with a view to renewing existing facilities and securing medium term financing prior to announcing the preliminary figures. They warned that the group's future prospects were dependent on the outcome of the talks but remained hopeful that agreement would be reached in the 'not too distant' future. The results for the year were prepared on a going concern basis and accordingly, the auditors' report carries an appropriate qualification. Union Square's shares are traded on the USM. Its ultimate holding company is Thompson Investments.</p>

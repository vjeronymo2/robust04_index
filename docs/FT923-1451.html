			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Beijing encourages Tokyo trade links - China is set to be Japan's second biggest trading partner IN the past few days, Toyota Motor has expanded links with a Chinese car maker, a group of Japanese trading houses agreed to develop a new Chinese industrial zone, and a transport company, Sankyu, announced plans for a network of trucking routes and warehouses in northern China. The surge of Japanese investment interest in China is matched by the flow of trade between the two countries. The flow is such that China is on the verge of becoming Japan's second most important trading partner, from fifth place last year, and it is likely to consolidate this position in coming months. China's leaders, sometimes wary of an over-dependence on Japan, are encouraging the trend. Li Peng, the Chinese premier, told Japanese executives last week that they could explore for oil in the country's far west, which is an important military region and has been off limits to foreign companies. Next month, Emperor Akihito will visit China and, in his understated way, apologise for the past and laud the future. In retrospect, the emperor's visit may be seen as marking the year in which long-sceptical Japanese companies became convinced that China would realise at least some of its much-touted commercial potential. Trade between the two countries rose by 26.6 per cent in August, compared to a year earlier, as the Chinese Government continued to encourage rapid economic growth and Japanese companies, struggling to find customers at home, were eager to capitalise on the flourishing demand from companies and consumers. For two of Japan's troubled sectors, the electronics and car industries, China has been a source of increased sales when most other markets, even south-east Asia, are flat or falling. Exports of electrical equipment are 20 per cent higher so far this year, while exports of transport machinery have almost doubled. After having been behind the US, South Korea, Germany and Taiwan as Japan's leading trade partner, and aside from a Taiwanese statistical blip last month, China has overtaken all but the US, still by far the most important market. Sino-Japanese trade, in which China runs the surplus, does not include exports to Hong Kong, which are rising sharply and often find their way to southern China. The unofficial trade is particularly heavy in consumer electronics, some of which are subject to a 100 per cent duty in China. It is convenient for Japan that many of its exports do not appear in official statistics, as some Chinese Communist Party elders still have a rather simple view of trade and regard a country with which China has a deficit as an 'exploiter'. Since China launched its economic reforms in late 1978, the trade flow has been characterised by surges and sudden halts, as Beijing turned on or off the tap of foreign exchange. Fearing that the government was losing control of the economy, central planners simply stopped issuing import licences or cancelled allocations of hard currency. However, Japanese industry is growing in confidence that the current rapid growth will endure. Asked to list influences on their attitude to investment, companies frequently cite the crushing of the pro-democracy movement in June 1989 and the ensuing durability of economic reform. After the Tiananmen brutality, China's economic policies were under concerted attack by elderly conservatives intimidated by the pace of development and by the ideological compromises inherent in the free market policies. Attacks were routinely made against 'pernicious foreign influence', giving the impression that the 'open door' was on the verge of closing. But the door has remained open, confirming perceptions that the endless political infighting in Beijing is having increasingly less impact on economic policy. A second reassuring conclusion is that political power has drifted away from Beijing to the provinces, where local officials are often ready to do business regardless of the fluctuating editorial tone of the People's Daily. Mr Yoshiharu Nonaka, general manager of the China section at Marubeni, the trading house, said that Beijing bureaucrats should be given credit for their handling of the economy, which was overheated in 1988, but now appears to have entered a period of sustained growth. He said the stronger yen was prompting his company to look for suitable joint ventures in car parts production: 'We are are looking for these opportunities. Our problems in trade with the US also mean that we have to diversify as much as possible.' A manager at Sanwa Bank responsible for China business said that there does appear to be a clear distinction between the Communist Party's concerns about being faithful to ideology and its desire for rapid modernisation. 'We can see that political and economic factors are now separate in China. We have to be a little bit cautious, but we are also confident,' he said. The Japanese are certainly more confident in committing their money to China, as actual investment rose from Dollars 349m (Pounds 197m) in 1990 to Dollars 579m last year, according to Ministry of Finance calculations in Tokyo. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) expects the rate of increase to continue through this year and that, in the longer-term, Japanese manufacturers will be under extreme pressure to cut costs by producing more components in regions such as southern China or the area around Dalian in the north. Investment in production facilities abroad was disrupted by the 'bubble' economy of late 1980s, when spiralling domestic growth boosted earnings, as did the easy money to be made on financial markets. These factors lessened the incentive to find cheaper suppliers outside the country, and led to increased investment in areas such as Kyushu, the southernmost of Japan's four main islands.</p>

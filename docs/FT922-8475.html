			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: Japanese broker seeks emergency financial aid YAMATANE Securities, a second-tier Japanese broker, has requested emergency financial support from Sakura Bank, a leading commercial bank. The request reflects the severe conditions facing the Japanese broking industry. Yamatane's move comes at a time when the company faces steep losses because of the weak stock market, low dealing volume and compensation payments arising from its involvement in stock manipulation disputes. For the last fiscal year to March, the broker expects to have run up a pre-tax loss of Y9bn (Dollars 67.66m) and an after-tax loss of Y24.2bn. Although Yamatane is the first leading second-tier broker to make such a move, there is speculation that others may follow suit. Second-tier brokers, which have traditionally relied on broking commissions, have been hard hit by the decline in market activity. The downturn has forced the houses to rely more heavily on unrealised gains on stock holdings, which have also been eroded by the sharp falls in share prices. Nine of the 10 second-tier brokers are forecasting losses for last year, while most are cutting costs by closing domestic branches and rationalising international operations. Sakura, which has traditionally enjoyed close ties with Yamatane, said it was considering supplying the broker with low-interest rate loans and sending officials to aid restructuring. Yamatane also hopes to sell some of its long-term bank shareholdings, which could affect already weak Japanese bank share prices.</p>

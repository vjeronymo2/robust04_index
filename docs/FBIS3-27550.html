			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Huanli (1728 3562 0448)] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, 24 Feb (XINHUA) -- Japanese Deputy Prime  Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata met with Chinese Vice  Premier Zhu Rongji here this evening. Both sides exchanged  views on bilateral relations in a sincere and friendly  atmosphere.    After briefing Hata on China's current economic situation  and  the implementation of its reform measures, Zhu Rongji said: "We  are confident that China will maintain a growth rate of 9  percent in the years to come. In the course of reform, China  will try to protect foreign investor's interests. We hope the  Japanese Government will continue to encourage and guide  Japanese enterprises to invest in setting up factories in China.  This is also one important way to enliven the Japanese economy."    Hata said: "I feel relieved after listening to our  excellency's briefing on China's current economic situation.  The development of Sino-Japanese trade and economic ties has  been rapid in recent years. This also demonstrates that China  has made tremendous achievements in its economic reform. In my  talks with leaders of other countries we have talked about  China's economic reform. Japan will, as in the past, continue  to support China's reform and open-door policy, and offer  cooperation. This will not only benefit Japan and China but  will also benefit the world."    Hata reiterated Japan's support for China's bid to restore  its contracting status within the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade.    After the meeting, Hata hosted a banquet in honor of Zhu  Rongji and his party.    Participating in the meeting and banquet were other  principal  members of Zhu's entourage, including He Chunlin, deputy  secretary general of the State Council General Office; and  Chinese Ambassador to Japan Xu Dunxin.</p>

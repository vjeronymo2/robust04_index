			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Panayiotis Paskhalis] </F>   [Text] A Nigerian plane carrying 23 tons of weapons and  ammunition from Israel made a forced landing at Larnaca Airport  last night because of engine failure. The Nigeria Airways plane  took off from Ashdod Airport [as published] for Lagos, Nigeria.  A fault was detected in one of its engines as it flew into  Egyptian airspace. The plane requested permission to land at  Cairo but the Egyptian authorities rejected it strongly so as  not to be accused of offering any assistance to the military  regime.    After the Egyptian refusal, the Nigerian pilots applied to  Larnaca Airport from which they immediately received ...  [ellipses as published] permission to land. According to our  information, the repairs that are needed are such that the cargo  of ammunitions must be unloaded today to avert any danger. A  strong police force reinforced by MMAD [Mobile Immediate Action  Unit] men took strict security measures around the plane and  nobody was allowed to go near it.</p>

			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> CSU OFFICIALLY RETREATS FROM TAYLOR RANCH;  </P> <P> NEGOTIATIONS: AN INFLUENTIAL UNIVERSITY PANEL RECOMMENDS REOPENING THE SEARCH  FOR A SUITABLE LOCATION FOR A NEW CAMPUS. APPROVAL WOULD DELAY CONSTRUCTION OF  A FACILITY BY YEARS.  </P> <P> Citing the likelihood of a lengthy court battle, California State University  officially retreated Monday from what was once an all-or-nothing ultimatum that  the controversial Taylor Ranch site west of Ventura is the only acceptable  location in the county for a new university campus.  </P> <P> Ellis E. McCune, acting chancellor of the university system, said the key  factor in the university's retreat from its once-tough insistence on the Taylor  Ranch site was the threat of a years-long court battle by the owners of the  ranch.  </P> <P> A lack of unified community support, division within the Ventura City Council  over the Taylor Ranch site and the anticipated cost of freeway access to the  hillside site were other factors in a decision to completely reopen the site  selection process, McCune said.  </P> <P> The university's quiet retreat from its earlier position came just one month  after Cal State Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds, who had issued the Taylor Ranch  ultimatum last December, was forced from office, but university officials said  the policy change had nothing to do with her ouster.  </P> <P> "The decision by the owners that they would not sell their property without a  full condemnation procedure, coupled with all the other factors, makes this a  very difficult project," McCune said. "It's problematical whether we could ever  proceed."  </P> <P> The decision Monday to reopen site selection -- a process expected to delay  construction of any new campus in the county by years -- was made during a  meeting at the office of the chancellor in Long Beach by an ad-hoc committee of  trustees charged with finding a campus location.  </P> <P> The full board is expected to approve the recommendation when it meets next  month, said university Vice Chancellor John M. Smart. The mechanics of  literally starting over again will be determined by an advisory committee --  made up of representatives from cities and county staffs as well as advocates  and opponents of the Taylor Ranch site -- that will meet in Ventura on July 13.  </P> <P> At that time, the committee will decide how to evaluate sites, Smart said. He  said the university will examine sites already proposed as well as new  locations never before considered. The committee will then narrow the choices  down and present its recommendations to a consultant who will perform the  necessary environmental impact studies.  </P> <P> While university officials say the ultimate site for a new campus is now wide  open, a parcel of farmland at Rice Avenue and the Ventura Freeway in Oxnard is  one location that is being discussed as a possible option. Another location at  Rose and Central avenues west of Camarillo has also been discussed.  </P> <P> Some Taylor Ranch supporters, including Ventura City Councilman James Monahan,  took Monday's dramatic shift by Cal State as a sign that the university may  never build a campus in Ventura County.  </P> <P> "It's the beginning of the end," Monahan said.  </P> <P> But university officials stressed on Monday that their commitment to Ventura  County is strong.  </P> <P> "We feel the need is there," Trustee Marian Bagdasarian said.  </P> <P> The university chose the 465-acre hillside Taylor Ranch west of Ventura as its  preferred location in 1987, after negotiations fell apart for its first choice,  land owned by the Lusk Co. near Ventura Harbor.  </P> <P> Taylor Ranch heiress Cynthia Wood, her mother and stepfather had previously  agreed to what Cal State officials called a friendly condemnation, in which  they agreed to sell their property under the threat that the state would  condemn it.  </P> <P> That would have allowed the property owners a tax advantage while avoiding the  need for lengthy court action to take the property against the owners' wishes.  </P> <P> But on May 22, the owners cut off negotiations with the university, officials  said. Through their attorney, James Hurley, the owners insisted that they would  fight the state in court to keep their property.  </P> <P> Hurley did not return calls on Monday to explain the owners' change of heart.  </P> <P> "No one is more disappointed than we are with this," said Smart, a Santa  Barbara native who was raised in Ventura.  </P> <P> Although the Taylor Ranch site will still be included in the environmental  impact study, it will no longer be the focus of the report, officials said.  Officials said they will consider sites with a minimum of 200 acres, with good  freeway access, single ownership and little or no community opposition.  </P> <P> The reopening of the site selection process will make it impossible to meet a  four-year target date to open a two-year off-campus center, the first phase of  a campus that would grow over 30 years into a four-year university serving up  to 15,000 students, Smart said.  </P> <P> He could not project a new date for a university in Ventura County, saying only  he hopes that it will be "before the turn of the century."  </P> <P> The decision to pull back from the Taylor Ranch site has already had immediate  effects on the center here, known as the Ventura campus of Cal State  Northridge, said Smart and campus Director Joyce M. Kennedy.  </P> <P> "Our enrollment curve has already been adjusted," Kennedy said. "We had been  approved to grow from 125 to 150 full-time equivalent students. That has been  cut back to 80."  </P> <P> That campus, now located in rented space near Seaward Avenue and the Ventura  Freeway in Ventura, is bursting at the seams with no more room to grow and a  long student waiting list, Kennedy said. Monday's decision, the culmination of  events occurring over the past three months, means that the campus will have to  survive longer in leased facilities.  </P> <P> Russ Baggerly, executive director of the Environmental Coalition and an  outspoken opponent of the Taylor Ranch, said Monday that the county can become  unified in a search for an appropriate university site.  </P> <P> "If they had continued with the Taylor Ranch, it would have killed all the  opportunity for a university in Ventura County," Baggerly said of university  officials. "Now, the opportunities are very bright for finding a site."  </P> <P> Cal State performed its first environmental impact report on Taylor Ranch in  1987, projecting a two-year campus with about 2,000 students. Baggerly and the  Environmental Coalition filed a lawsuit challenging that study, contending that  the ultimate size of the campus should be considered.  </P> <P> In a major turning point in the fight against the Taylor Ranch site, Superior  Court Judge Joe Hadden ruled against the state last November, saying it had to  prepare a second environmental impact report based on the ultimate  establishment of a four-year campus.  </P> <P> As opposition mounted from environmentalists fearing additional air pollution  from students' cars and traffic in downtown Ventura, then-Chancellor Reynolds  told the county that she was not sure whether the state would go through with a  second expensive environmental impact report if there was not the necessary  community support.  </P> <P> In December, she told Ventura County that the state would no longer consider  alternative sites. It was Taylor Ranch or nothing, she said. Supporters in the  community rallied, and trustees decided to order a second impact report on  March 1. By law, an environmental impact report must also consider alternate  sites, but university officials stressed that their focus was the Taylor Ranch.  </P> <P> Reynolds has since left the university system under pressure for reasons  unrelated to Taylor Ranch. She is technically still on the staff until July 1  but has been replaced in her duties by McCune. Smart said her departure is  unrelated to the trustees' reopening of the site selection.  </P></p>

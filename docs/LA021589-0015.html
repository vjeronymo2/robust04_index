			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILL ON 'RACIAL SPOILS SYSTEM'  </P> <P> The truth about "affirmative action" is that we've always had it. It's not a  new-fangled liberal idea to help minorities, as many claim.  </P> <P> The "old boy network" -- nepotism, cronyism, member-of-the-club and alumni-ism  to help favored sons -- was the most successful affirmative action program ever  devised. The only difference is the recipients of this affirmative action were  wealthy white males . . . and still are! Do you think J. Danforth Quayle got  ahead on "merit"?  </P> <P> The question is not whether we will love "affirmative action," but who it will  benefit. Why not give minorities and women a chance?  </P> <P> JOANNE MURPHY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

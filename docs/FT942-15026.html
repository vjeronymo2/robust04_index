			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Loganair close to buy-out deal Loganair, the subsidiary of Airlines of Britain which operates services between Glasgow and Edinburgh and the Scottish Highlands and Islands, is believed to be close to a buy-out by its management. The airline is also expected to announce that it will enter into a franchise agreement with British Airways, which flies to some of Loganair's destinations. This would give Loganair access to BA's reservations system and shield it from destructive competition from its rival. The buy-out of Loganair is expected to be led by Mr Scott Grier, the airline's managing director. Airlines of Britain owns British Midland Airways and the Isle of Man-based Manx Airlines as well as Loganair. Last month Loganair handed its routes to destinations outside Scotland to Manx Airlines in order to concentrate on its services to the Highlands and Islands. Aircraft and staff were transferred from Loganair to Manx Airlines. Although 170 people lost their jobs all services operated by the two airlines were retained.</p>

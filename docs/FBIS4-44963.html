			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with visiting Christian clergy, by Mustafa Kamil; </F> place and date not given: "Blockade Condemned by Visiting  Christian Clergy"]    [Text] A delegation, which included their graces from among  the Catholic patriarchs of some Eastern Churches, visited Iraq  from 28 February to 6 March, at the invitation of the Ministry  of Awqaf and Religious Affairs and his Grace Rufa'il I  Biydawiid, the patriarch of Babil for Chaldeans and the Iraqi  Church. This visit expressed the absolute support of these  patriarchs for the Iraqi people in their confrontation of the  unfair blockade that has been imposed on them.    ALIF BA' met a number of their graces representing the  Eastern Catholic Churches who spoke to ALIF BA' about their  visit's mission and results.    Patriarch Stifanus II Ghattas of the Coptic Church and St.  Mark's missionary in Cairo, affirmed at the beginning of his  talk his church's absolute support of and standing by the  faithful Iraqi people and leadership. He said: "The visit of a  delegation of Eastern Catholic patriarchs at this time has as a  goal reinforcing brotherly relations and strengthening  cooperation with and support to the Iraqi people. The visit  further affirms the support of the Eastern Catholic Churches to  the struggling Iraqi people in their persistent confrontation of  the circumstances of the tyrannical economic blockade, which was  imposed on Iraq through the use of force and arrogance by the  unfair powers that control the world. All religions, blessed  heavenly doctrines, international laws, and religious  institutions condemn this blockade."    He further expressed his deep confidence in the capability  of  the Iraqi people to overcome this crisis saying: "We join the  patient Iraqi people and the world liberals in raising our  voices to demand the lifting of the vicious blockade so that  Iraqis could meet their human needs."    His Grace Archbishop Bulus Emil Sa'adah, the deputy general  patriarch of the Maronite Church in Lebanon, expressed his  happiness at visiting Iraq and affirmed that this visit was one  of support and love for the brotherly Iraqi people who have  faith in the one God. Archbishop Sa'adah said: "In Isaiah,  Chapter 52 tells us about this humanitarian approach when it  states: `How great are the steps taken by those who herald  peace, righteousness, and salvation.'"    He said: "The people of Iraq will overcome all suffering  thanks to the President-leader Saddam Husayn's leadership and  also thanks to the people's unity and solidarity as well as  their rallying around their faithful leadership." He also  mentioned the brotherly Lebanese people who suffered from civil  war, yet, who, thanks to their national solidarity and unity,  could contain and stop the war and attain peace and security.    Archbishop Sa'adah further said: "We pray to the One and  Only  God to have mercy upon the martyrs and place them into heaven as  they have sacrificed with their scented blood and pure souls for  the nation's pride and the people's dignity."    He further affirmed that: "The tyrannical course of  injustice  was very short-lived because this invasion of Iraq was doomed to  fail and these vicious imperialistic plots to go with the wind;  Iraqis would manage to reconstruct what the malicious aggressors  have destroyed with self-help and with a speed that would call  for admiration and impart happiness to the soul."    His Grace Yuhanna Butrus 18 Kasparyan from the Armenian  Catholic Church in Lebanon saluted the Iraqi leadership, most  importantly President Saddam Husayn, for the good care given to  all sects and religions that enabled them to practice their  rites and rituals freely and securely.    He described the continued imposition of the blockade on the  Iraqi people, men and women, of all ethnic groups, religions and  sects, as an outrageous violation of human rights and a vicious  aggression on heavenly legislation and God's commandments, both  of which call for respecting and revering humans and working  seriously for their comfort and happiness.    His Grace Patriarch Mishal al-Sabbah from the Jerusalem  Latin  Church in Jordan prayed to the Almighty God to lift the  injustice and tyranny that the Iraqi people suffer because of  the continued imposition of the worst blockade in human history,  which has been imposed on 20 million people including the  elderly and the children, the sick, and the healthy.    He called upon all philanthropic organizations as well as on  those peace-loving personalities who support people's freedom  and their right to a secure and dignified life, to do their  utmost in order to put pressure on the governments of the great  nations, the United Nations and the Security Council, in order  to immediately and completely lift all kinds of sanctions, so  that the Iraqi people could be provided with all their basic  needs.    His Grace George al-Murr, the Amman Archbishop for the Royal  Roman Catholic Church, described the crime that the forces of  the evil thirty-nation alliance committed against al-'Amiriyah  shelter as the most atrocious incident that he had ever  witnessed. In this incident, people were killed because of a  deliberate crime; innocent souls were delivered up to God in  order to complain about the injustice of humans to each other so  that this would represent a loud cry of outrage and protest  against the barbarism and aggression as well as against  aggression and violence.    As for the Assyrian Church in Lebanon, His Grace Mikha'il  al-Jamil, the deputy patriarch general, in response to the  wicked people's barbarism and aggression, described the  rehabilitation achievements, specially in the areas of  construction and development, as a real victory for the values  of justice, goodness and peace. He said: God Above has blessed  the Iraqi efforts, be it those of the Iraqi people or that of  its leadership; God has granted these struggling and patient  people the will and capability to reconstruct all that the  aggressor destroyed in the most atrocious aggression against  civilization and development; we are very glad to have seen  these achievements.    He further expressed his confidence in the capability of the  great Iraqi people to overcome all calamities and difficulties  because they have an enlightened leadership that has deep faith  and a strong relentless will. The Iraqis also had access to an  accumulation of inherited culture dating back to more than 6,000  years.    His Holiness Father Sannun Andrawus, member of the  delegation's secretariat, director of the Voice of Love radio  station, and the public relations official, said: "Since the end  of war and the silencing of canons, the cultural and  intellectual struggle started because the Arab world currently  faces a media struggle. It is, therefore, that the  responsibility of the media delegation, which comprises 20  persons representing 10 press agencies and radio and television  stations, is to portray the sad situation caused by the  continued unjust blockade imposed on the Iraqi people. Heavenly  religions as well as the laws and customs of civilization could  not understand the rationale of this state of affairs and human  history has not known the like of it. By portraying this  picture, the media delegation hopes that the international  conscience could feel--however slightly--this great people's  suffering."</p>

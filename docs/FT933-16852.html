			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / International Company News: German biscuits group to restructure its business BAHLSEN, the German cakes, biscuits and snacks maker, is to restructure its business with the aim of increasing European market share, according to Mr Werner Michael Bahlsen, managing director. Split into 'sweet' and 'snacks' divisions, the company intends to focus on three brands - Bahlsen for sweet products, Leibniz in the semi-sweet main-stream biscuit market, and Bahlsen Picanterie for savoury snacks. The group, which saw pre-tax earnings drop by more than 50 per cent last year to DM56m (Dollars 33m) on sales of DM1.8bn, compared with DM1.86bn in 1991, is also aiming to extend its eastern European business further. Bolstered by the recent purchase of a Polish confectionery group, sales in the region should reach DM80m this year, Mr Bahlsen said yesterday.</p>

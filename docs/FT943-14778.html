			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Faster payment for exporters Exporters are continuing to be paid more promptly by European customers, as the Continent emerges from recession, NCM Credit, the Cardiff-based insurer, said yesterday in its quarterly survey of export activity. For the first time since the recession began fewer companies are defaulting on bills, it said. The value of payment delays fell 14 per cent in the year to June compared with a 15 per cent reduction in the 12 months ending March. It added, however, that the trading environment in Europe remained difficult and Portugal and Greece were giving cause for concern. The value of payment delays from these two went against the trend, rising 29 per cent and 20 per cent respectively. The proportion of UK companies suffering a loss as a result of non-payment by European buyers in the larger countries remained high, although the overall incidence of loss in the EU fell for the first time since the recession began.</p>

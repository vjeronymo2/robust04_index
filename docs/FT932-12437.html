			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: SE Banken beats off shareholder revolt THE BOARD of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Sweden's largest bank, last night brushed aside an attempt by small investors to call directors to account for last year's heavy losses by marshalling the support of institutional and other large shareholders, including the Wallenberg family. A call by Aktiespararna, the 65,000-member national shareholders' association, for a postponement at SE Banken's annual general meeting of a usually routine item discharging the board of any liability in respect of the bank's 1992 activities was easily defeated when representatives of several large shareholders cast their votes against the move. The item was then passed. The large shareholders included the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, which holds 5.43 per cent of SE Banken, and Investor, the Wallenberg investment vehicle which owns 1.72 per cent. Among institutional shareholders voting against Aktiespararna's call were the SPP, Trygg-Hansa and Skandia life insurance concerns. Little more than half of the small shareholders among the 1,500 present at the meeting supported the postponement call. The shareholders' association wanted a board shake-up following last year's catastrophic results, when SE Banken returned operating losses of SKr5.37bn (Dollars 705m) and reported loan losses of SKr10.9bn. The association, which last week forced the board at Volvo to reveal details of executive salaries for the first time, argued that large shareholders in Sweden have not exerted sufficient control over the running of companies. Mr Bjorn Svedberg, the chief executive appointed last September, told shareholders the bank's operations had shown an upturn this year - first-quarter results are due on May 12 - but repeated earlier warnings of more high lending losses this year and next.</p>

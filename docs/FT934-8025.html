			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: Canberra to sell Moomba pipeline THE AUSTRALIAN government yesterday announced plans to raise over ADollars 500m (USDollars 327m) by selling a controlling interest in the Moomba-Sydney gas pipeline to the Australian Gas Light Company, the nation's largest petroleum pipeline company, and inviting tenders for the remaining equity. The pipeline transports natural gas from the Cooper Basin in South Australia on behalf of AGL, for distribution in Sydney, Canberra and regional centres in New South Wales. It is operated by The Pipeline Authority (TPA), a statutory authority, under a haulage agreement dating back to 1974. It has been politically contentious in the past, and a previous attempt at privatisation, in the 1980s, failed. The current deal is not expected to be completed until mid-1994, and will require enabling legislation to be passed, as well as a new haulage agreement and approvals from the Trade Practices Commission and the New South Wales government. Under the current proposal, the government would sell a 51 per cent interest in the pipeline to AGL and conduct a competitive tender process for the remaining 49 per cent. 'The government expects that total gross proceeds from the sale will be in the range of ADollars 510m to ADollars 550m,' Mr Ralph Willis, finance minister, and Mr Michael Lee, resources minister, announced yesterday. AGL, which is quoted and has other oil and gas trunk pipeline interests in New South Wales, Queensland and the Northern Territory, would receive ADollars 30m compensation for releasing the commonwealth and TPA from contractual commitments to the pipeline's operation, they added. Commenting on the proposed transaction, AGL said the sale represented 'an acceptable solution to the current confusion over future haulage charges' and would result in reductions in haulage charges for 'major gas users, who are currently subsidising smaller consumers'. The company, which has long sought ownership of the pipeline, said it would prefer to see a number of institutional investors own the remaining 49 per cent but added that nothing - from a trade sale to a single purchaser or a public flotation of the remaining equity - had been ruled out by the federal government. The deal could have implications for ICI Australia, part of the UK's ICI group, which plans to build a second pipeline linking the Cooper Basin and Sydney. This would follow the existing pipeline's path, and would be used to transport ethane to ICI's Botany Bay petrochemical plant. Total cost of this project has been put at around ADollars 300m. However, ICI Australia said yesterday that it still expected the ethane pipeline to be built by TPA, and for the project to proceed as planned.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Vietnamese communist puppets on 26 January sent  out more than 200 troops backed by seven tanks to invade a  liberated area north of Sre Noy [in Oddar Meanchey Province].  The people and the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea  ambushed them with mines and attacked them with heavy guns on  the stretch of road at Prey S'at, killing 12 enemy soldiers and  wounding many others. We also seized a significant quantity of  firearms and ammunition and captured two tanks -- one about to  run out of gas and the other about to break down. The enemy  ground troops and the other five tanks hastily retreated behind  their lines.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Ding Jianming (0002 1017 6900)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 27 Feb (XINHUA) -- China has launched a  reform in industry and business tax system in an all-round way,  with turnover tax and income tax as the main contents, since 1  January. The new tax system has been implemented for nearly two  months to date; judged by situations in various localities, the  new tax system has smoothly entered a course of normal operation  and has basically undergone a stable transition.    Following the passage of the new individual income tax law  by  the National People's Congress Standing Committee on 30 October  1993, the State Council successively promulgated six sets of  interim regulations on the collection of value-added tax,  consumption tax, business tax, institutional income tax,  incremental tax on land value, and resource tax. Until now,  except for incremental tax on land value, regulations or rules  for the implementation of the interim regulations governing six  other taxes have been promulgated and enacted. The State  Council recently issued a circular deciding to cancel market  transaction tax, livestock transaction tax, special tax on fuel  oil, bonus tax, and regulatory tax on wages, and delegating the  rights of collecting taxes on slaughtering animals and banquet  taxes to local authorities. This indicates that the major parts  of China's general tax reform package, particular the reform  measures for main categories of tax, have all been released. The  reform of financial and taxation system is the focus of China's  current reform package as a whole, and tax reform is the most  important part in the reform of the financial and taxation  system. The smooth implementation of the new tax system has laid  a firm foundation for stepping up the establishment of a  socialist market economic structure in China.    The present tax reform is an overall, comprehensive, and  structural reform. It involves the readjustment of interests  for every enterprise and individual; therefore, it is more  difficult, has more contradictions, and may involve great risks  if it is not handled properly. The CPC Central Committee and  the State Council have attached great importance to tax reform.  Leaders from the State Council have personally taken charge of  this task and have given many important directions. To ensure a  smooth implementation of tax reform, cadres, staff, and workers  of taxation departments at all levels have done a great deal of  work. Since the beginning of October 1993, taxation organs at  all levels have launched various forms of training for the broad  masses of taxation cadres and factory directors, as well as  enterprise managers, finance and accounting personnel,  tax-handling persons, and even persons in charge of marketing  and purchasing, so that the overwhelming majority of taxation  cadres and enterprises will understand the importance of current  tax reform and fundamentally grasp its major contents and  operating points.    Except for the great concern from the CPC Central Committee  and the State Council, leaders of all localities and departments  have also shown full concern over and support for tax reform.  Principal leaders of many provinces, municipalities, regions,  and departments have made statements to publicize the new tax  system and demanded that their subordinate departments  coordinate the implementation of the new tax system. In a  "national taxation propaganda day" campaign organized by the  State Administration of Taxation on 23 January, tens of  thousands of taxation cadres and enterprise finance officers and  accountants around the country, led by local party and  government leaders, went to the streets to publicize the tax law  and offer consultation services to the public. Meanwhile, to  successfully carry out the new tax system and resolve all kinds  of problems in a timely manner, the State Administration of  Taxation has given more directions and strengthened the  management -- in nearly the past two months since the beginning  of the year, it has issued some 60 documents and fax messages of  various sorts and held two national telephone conferences with  the participation of taxation directors at and above the county  level to directly convey relevant guidelines and requirements to  grassroots taxation bureaus, thus making sure government decrees  go down to all parts of the country without obstruction.    There are several important indicators to tell if the tax  reform is a success: Whether the reform causes fluctuations in  commodity prices and significant price hikes; whether revenue  grows steadily or slides; whether a great quantity of forged  special vouchers for value-added tax and the chaos of tax  evasion through issuing vouchers is revealed; and whether the  reform produces positive or negative influences on production.    -- Reviewing the situation of implementation over the past  two months, commodity prices, the most troublesome problem, did  not fluctuate or rise greatly because of the tax reform. The  irrational sales of electrical appliances and other commodities,  caused by a misunderstanding that consumption tax is an  additional tax added to current commodity prices, soon passed  after an explanation given through propaganda. After the  introduction of the value-added tax, some people misunderstood  the 17-percent tax, which was excluded from the commodity price,  as an additional tax added to the price already including tax.  After repeated explanation by taxation organs and intensive  checks by departments concerned, this problem has been basically  cleared and corrected.    -- The revenue still maintains a trend of higher growth. By  20 February, the state's revenue from industry and business  taxes amounted to 40.7 billion yuan, up 27.3 percent over the  same period last year.    -- Generally, the institution of new tax system did not  adversely influence production and circulation; industrial  production still grows rapidly. According to statistics of the  State Administration of Taxation, the country's industries at  and above township levels achieved 290.3 billion yuan in total  output value in January, up 33.2 percent over the same month  last year. After the extensive launch of value-added tax, many  small-scale taxpayers have encountered some problems in their  production and operations during a certain period of time, but  taxation departments swiftly took effective measures to correct  and resolve the problems.    -- The special vouchers for value-added tax were all in  place  before 1 January. No big problems occurred in the process of  printing, delivery, distribution, and application. Moreover,  improvement has been made to the vouchers' columns, size, and  anti- forgery mark in line with actual conditions; at the  request of enterprises, septuplicate vouchers are now available  in addition to the quadruplicate ones. The State Administration  of Taxation also decided that anti-forgery vouchers unitedly  printed by the banknote printer be used across the country  beginning 1 May to forestall the emergence of counterfeit  vouchers.    It can be said that all walks of life and most enterprises  have greeted the new tax system quite comfortably; foreign  investors in China have dismissed their apprehensions because  their tax burden did not become heavier following the  implementation of the new tax system.    However, we should also be aware that despite the fact that  new tax system has been launched for nearly two months, some  unavoidable frictions still exist in the course of transferring  from the old tax system to the new one. Therefore, in a recent  interview with this reporter, Jin Xin, deputy director of the  State Administration of Taxation said: The achievements we  scored so far are merely preliminary ones, which are not enough  to demonstrate that the new tax system is a complete success.  Many new problems and conditions have yet to fully emerge;  therefore, we should remain sober-minded and study and handle  all kinds of problems in time.    It is noteworthy that China's current tax reform is aimed at  establishing a taxation system that is suitable to a socialist  market economic structure, conforms to international practice,  and tallies with China's actual situation. The guiding ideology  of the reform is: unifying tax laws, imposing taxes fairly,  streamlining the tax system, dividing power rationally,  rationalizing distribution relations, and standardizing  distribution methods. The design of the reform package has  upheld the basic principle of keeping the general level of the  tax burden unchanged. However, because of the uneven levels of  tax burden under the original tax system, it is impossible to  keep every taxpayer's vested interests unaffected after  extensively adopting the value-added tax system. We demand that  all sectors concerned keep the overall situation in mind,  support the implementation of a new tax system from the  perspective of overall and long-term interest, and never  encourage price hikes just because some enterprises have a  heavier tax burden. We should be aware that tax reform is the  foundation for establishing a socialist market economic  structure; once the tax reform is put in place and reaches the  expected results, it will greatly step up the pace of  establishing a socialist market economic structure. Thus the  reform is in the interests of us all from a long-term view.</p>

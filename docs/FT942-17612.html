			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Vengeance of a Union scorned: Ian Davidson argues that the UK has averted one European crisis, but a showdown is inevitable Mr John Major's capitulation over voting rights in the European Union has averted a serious crisis in Europe. But this is at best only a temporary truce in the UK's long-running battle to resist and, if possible, reverse the trend to closer political integration in Europe. The prime minister has abandoned this particular attempt to reduce the scope of majority voting in Europe; but his government remains unreconciled to the objective of a quasi-federalist Union which is supported by most member states. What has happened this week has settled nothing in Britain, and settled nothing in Europe; it is only a short-term postponement of a showdown between the UK and its European partners which is steadily becoming more inevitable. Such a showdown is already lying in wait, in the Inter-Governmental Conference scheduled for 1996. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, tries to minimise the significance of this week's capitulation, by implying that it could be reversed in 1996. In reality, the central aim of the IGC, in the minds of most member states, will be to strengthen political integration. It is therefore bound to be a scene of confrontation between Britain and its partners. Moreover, by then the political stakes will have been raised by another order of magnitude, because the west Europeans will be wrestling with the political implications of expanding their Union into central and eastern Europe. London claims to believe that enlargement of the Union will, or at least should, turn it into a looser, more inter-governmental type of grouping. But most of the other members maintain that a larger Union must become more integrated, and no doubt the candidate countries in eastern Europe will agree with them. Chancellor Helmut Kohl has made clear that he will be pressing for the opening of the European Union to the east; and he has explicitly derided the idea that such an enlarged Union should be turned into a loose free trade area. Paradoxically, the confrontation over blocking minorities blew up precisely because the member states had wanted to avoid it. In the spring of 1992, it was argued, by the Commission among others, that the prospective negotiations to expand the EC, through the admission of the four European Free Trade Association countries, would require a big revision of the decision-making arrangements, including national voting weights and majority voting rules. Decision-making was already difficult enough in the Community of 12; so the rules had to be adapted to make sure that it did not become more difficult in a Community of 16. A second reason was that existing voting weights were skewed in favour of the small members; Germany, for example, has 200 times the population of Luxembourg, but only five times the number of votes in the Council of Ministers. Since all the Efta candidates were small, enlargement would make this bias in favour of small countries even worse. But by the time of the regular European summit in the summer of 1992, governments were having second thoughts. They had been deeply shaken early in June, when the Danish electorate turned down the Treaty of Maastricht. So when the 12 leaders met later that month in Lisbon, they were doubly anxious to avoid any bruising new arguments over politically sensitive issues. They announced that this enlargement could take place without any revision in the principles of majority voting or the future of the institutions. By implication, these questions would be back on the agenda for the following enlargement, taking in the countries of eastern Europe. In the meantime, new members from Efta would have the same voting weights as corresponding existing members, and the required majority thresholds would be adjusted mechanically. Like most decisions born of panic, this was a stupid position to have taken. The 12 were setting up a future situation which would be difficult to change. They seemed to assume that the small countries, which would total 11 of the future 16 members, would willingly give up their voting weight advantage, without compensation; and they ignored the fact that six of them would have to submit this sacrifice of national advantage to a referendum. For the sake of a quiet life now, the 12 were storing up trouble for the future. Even for the short term, the 12 were taking a risk. Such an imbalance in voting power between large and small countries could undermine the legitimacy of the whole system, which is already under challenge in several member states. At one extreme, the UK, Germany and two small countries, mustering more than 40 per cent of the population of the Union, could be outvoted by the rest; but eight small countries, with barely 12 per cent of the population, would command a blocking minority. The original small-country bias was part of the founding bargain between the six like-minded states; but the imbalance is becoming more acute in a Community where members are less like-minded, and some (like Britain) not committed to the underlying premiss of integration at all. If the voting weight bias favouring the little countries is ever to be reversed, the reform will obviously have to be paid for; and the currency of payment will probably have to be more integration. That is the challenging position, as sketched out by the Belgian government: if political legitimacy is said to reside essentially with the nation states and the sovereignty of national parliaments, then this fact must be reflected in the (relative) equality of the nation states in Brussels; but if it is claimed that population counts, then this fact must be reflected in the democratic legitimation of the Brussels decision-making process. In theory this week's compromise settlement should close off until 1996 the danger of a crisis over the institutions of the Union. But that crisis may yet break in through another door, if the German government lives up to its declared determination to hurry the opening of the Union to the countries of eastern Europe. Clearly they will not be ready for full economic membership of the Union for some years to come. But if Germany presses for a different form of political membership, then it will become impossible to resist the reopening of all the issues of decision-making and voting weights and institutional legitimacy, which many had thought had been quietly put off to another day.</p>

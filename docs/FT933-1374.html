			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Management: The Design Council on a crash diet TOTEMS have a nasty habit of being toppled. Three months ago, in the latest chapter of extensive deliberations in Washington on how the Clinton Administration can help improve the quality of design in US industry, Britain's 49-year-old Design Council was held up as a possible model. Along with his counterparts from much more richly-funded Taiwan and Japan, the Council's director-general was one of the main foreign speakers at a three-day talk-in of adminstration officials and other interested parties. But yesterday, the British government served notice on large parts of the Council's activities, on the grounds that some no longer fit the public sector, and that others should be integrated into its own multi-purpose network of 'Business Link' advice centres around the UK. In particular, the Council's direct delivery of various consultancy services to industry will be transferred or sold off during the course of the next year or so. Instead, the Council's work will be refocused on the provision of high-quality analysis and advice on every aspect of design: to all arms of government, to industry, to intermediate bodies, to education, and to the design community. The industry minister expects it to be 'the nation's design conscience'. The exact size, shape and role of the Council's activities will be determined over the next few months by a review team under John Sorrell, the chairman-designate, himself a designer and successful businessman. But it is clear that the new Council will be ultra-slimline, shrunk to a fraction of its current staff of 220 to somewhere between 20 and 50. Government funding will also be much lower than the current annual Pounds 7.5m, possibly Pounds 2m-Pounds 3m. In the cold light of dawn, how should the decision be interpreted? Should Britain's design community and the Council's 22 members - myself among them  -feel betrayed or relieved? Far more important, what impact will the move have on the readiness and ability of British industry to make better use of design, which is an increasingly important competitive weapon, now that technology, quality, service and other 'non-price factors' are becoming little more than tickets for entering the international marketplace, rather than weapons for winning in it? As Ford has found with its Taurus car in America, Rover with its latest model range, and Apple with its PowerBook laptop computer, the character and 'feel' of a product or service, as well as its performance - what Japanese academics call its 'integrity' and 'ability to delight' - can make all the difference. There will be two types of reaction to what pessimists will dub the 'dismemberment' of the Council, and the optimists its 'refocusing'. The first group will cry 'disaster', and point to the hundreds of millions of dollars which the governments of Taiwan, Korea, Japan and a few other countries are pouring into design. In spite of yesterday's strong official protestations to the contrary, they will fear that the Council will ultimately disappear. The second group, in which I include myself, will argue that a body like the Council must be just as ready to undergo radical change as the constituencies which it serves. Countless private- and public-sector organisations in Britain are being torn up by the roots and their justification for existence examined. There is every reason to think that a slim, high-powered research, evangelising and lobbying organisation can win friends and influence decision-makers in business, government, management education and elsewhere. On a smallish scale, just such a role has been played in the US to great effect for several years by the Boston-based Design Management Institute, a private-sector body. The research, publications, conferences and exhibitions organised by its entrepreneurial, close-knit team, on a budget of less than Dollars 1m a year, have given it - and its message - a high profile across corporate America, and in Washington. With more federal funds, which may soon be provided, it would perform better still. In retrospect, the Design Council might have been treated more kindly by Whitehall if it had managed to restore the high-profile campaigning image for which it was noted in the 1970s, and which the government now wants revived and redirected at the business world. Those of us who, behind its closed doors, expressed discomfort at its drift away from its roots in industrial design towards an excessive concern with engineering, should have been much noisier. On the other hand, there was little wrong with the Council's regionalisation of most of its industrial services, in order to reach the grass roots, nor with its materials for schoolchildren - which win high praise from teachers and students alike. But it paid too little attention to the parallel need to convince opinion-formers that design is an exciting, glamorous activity which can transform corporate fortunes. What matters now are five things: that the review team completes its task rapidly; that the government then funds the slimline Council adequately; that Whitehall ensures that activities transferred from the Council do not sink without trace in their new homes - quite a problem, since the first Business Links are only just being piloted; that good staff move with their jobs; and that the government makes it clear that it is prepared to strengthen the design component of its various support schemes for innovation. Such steps are needed, along with a much greater design effort on the part of industry itself, if - like Rover - British business is to be able to compete with its increasingly design-intensive competitors from Europe, North America and East Asia.</p>

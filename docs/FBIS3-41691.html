True, everything luckily turned out without the  tragic finale.    From on board the aircraft flying to Krasnodar from Turkey  came the message: One of our passengers needs emergency medical  assistance. Physicians met the aircraft on the airfield. The  patient had already lost consciousness, and his pressure was  nearly at zero...    The 53-year-old patient was sent to the infectious disease  hospital; however, that left another 27 members of the tourist  group and, in addition, 6 passengers from Krasnodar and 6  Turkish citizens who had arrived on the same flight. The Turks  refused examinations and left the airport on their own business.  The six Krasnodar residents simply hid after passing through  customs. By nightfall, they were collected from their homes by  ``ambulance.'' And the entire tourist group from Naberezhnyye  Chelny were, despite their protests, detained and placed in the  hospital.    ``The next day nearly all of them were sent home to  Naberezhnyye Chelny via a special flight,'' said M. Mkrtchan,  deputy chief physician of the sanitary-epidemiological  oversight's kray center. ``But here everything did not end  without incident: For some reason, the group ``slipped in'' two  persons with symptoms similar to those of cholera, leaving two  healthy persons here. Laboratory studies confirmed the diagnosis  in the two tourists who still remain in our hospital. Later,  studies of specimens collected by us showed that another five of  the group members who had flown off also carried cholera's  causative agent. Of course, we informed our colleagues in  Naberezhnyye Chelny of this fact.''    ``As it turned out, the group going from Naberezhnyye Chelny  to Turkey was in Syria. Barely landing in Krasnodar alive, one  man had already felt bad for several days. He hid his condition,  however, and tried to treat himself. At the  sanitary-epidemiological station's kray center, they told me  that his illness was noticed in the group, but they decided not  to see a physician. The illness was evidently some sort of  complication. Indeed, it was a commercial flight, and the group  had carried many things in from abroad.''    The patients' condition is now improving. No other cases of  cholera in Kuban have been noted.</p>

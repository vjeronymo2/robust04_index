			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (2) Whenever a registrant discloses a security rating pursuant to this paragraph (g), the registrant shall disclose the following for each security rating disclosed:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The identity of the rating organization assigning the rating;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The rating assigned;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The relative rank of the rating within the assigning rating organization's overall classification system;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) A description of what the rating addresses;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) All material scope limitations of the rating;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Any material differences between the terms of the security as assumed in rating the security, and the terms of the security as specified in the governing instruments;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vii) Any material differences in the terms of the security as assumed in rating the security, and the terms of the security as marketed to investors;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (viii) A statement informing investors that a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, that it may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ix) Any published designation reflecting the results of any other evaluation done by the rating organization in connection with the rating, along with an explanation of the designation's meaning and the relative rank of the designation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Instructions to Item 202. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=3 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 6. For purposes of paragraph (g), the term nationally recognized statistical rating organization  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> shall have the same meaning as used in &sect;240.15c3&hyph;1(c)(2)(vi)(F).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. A registrant shall disclose any material limitations to the security rating on the outside front cover page of the prospectus.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. If a registrant includes information about security ratings in a prospectus pursuant to paragraph (g), the registrant shall update the description of each rating as set forth in this instruction 8:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. If a change in a rating already included in the prospectus is available subsequent to the filing of the registration statement, but prior to its effectiveness, the registrant shall include such rating change in the final prospectus. If the rating change is material, or if the registrant is required to disclose a materially different rating from any disclosed rating which becomes available during this period, the registrant shall amend the registration statement to include the rating change or the additional rating and should consider recirculating the preliminary prospectus.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. If an additional rating that the registrant is required to disclose, or if a material change in a rating already included, becomes available during any period in which offers or sales are being made, the registrant shall disclose such additional rating or rating change by means of a post-effective amendment, or sticker to the prospectus pursuant to &sect;230.424(b) of this chapter. However, a post-effective amendment or sticker is not required in the case of a registration statement on Form S&hyph;3 (&sect;239.13 of this chapter) if the registrant timely discloses the additional rating or the rating change in a document incorporated by reference into the registration statement subsequent to its effectiveness and prior to termination of the offering.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. If a registrant discloses a security rating assigned by a non-NRSRO, the registrant also should include the written consent of the non-NRSRO rating organization. With respect to the written consent of any NRSRO, see &sect;230.436(g) of this chapter. When the registrant has filed a registration statement on Form F&hyph;9 (&sect;239.39 of this chapter), see &sect;230.436(g) of this chapter with respect to the written consent of any rating organization specified in the Instruction to paragraph (A)(2) of General Instruction I of Form F&hyph;9.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 230_GENERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS, SECURITIES ACT OF 1933  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 7.

We agree that small entities stand little chance of acquiring licenses in these broadband auctions if required to bid against existing large companies, particularly large telephone, cellular and cable television companies. If one or more of these big firms targets a market for strategic reasons, there is almost no likelihood that it could be outbid by a small business. In the Notice, we proposed that one means to address such problems would be to set aside specific spectrum blocks in broadband PCS that would be reserved for bidding purposes to the designated entities. <FOOTCITE>96</FOOTCITE>  In this Order, we have decided to adopt a modification of this proposal, which should greatly enhance the ability of all designated entities to enter auctions and bid successfully for broadband PCS licenses. Specifically, we establish two entrepreneurs' blocks, C and F, in which eligibility to bid is limited to entities that, together with their affiliates and certain investors, have gross revenues of less than $125 million in each of the last two years and total assets of less than $500 million. In addition, we will prohibit an applicant from bidding in these blocks if any one individual investor in the applicant has $100 million or greater in personal net worth. Together with a reduced upfront payment requirement, we believe this proposal will encourage smaller entities to enter the auctions for broadband PCS licenses and will ensure that ``entrepreneurial'' businesses are granted nearly half of all the broadband PCS licenses being auctioned. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 96 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Notice at &para;121. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 122. NTIA strongly supports this measure, arguing that it ``would be the most direct mechanism for preserving opportunities for small companies in an auction environment.'' According to NTIA, reserving two entrepreneurs' blocks helps significantly in satisfying the congressional directive that competitive bidding not result in an increase in concentration in the telecommunications industries. <FOOTCITE>97</FOOTCITE>  Similarly, Columbia PCS contends that establishment of entrepreneurs' blocks ``provides a good balance between Congress's clear mandate to provide opportunities for designated entities and avoid undue concentration of PCS licenses on the one hand with the goal of capturing the value of allocated spectrum for the American public on the other.'' <FOOTCITE>98</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 97 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Ex parte <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  filing of NTIA, June 21, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 98 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Ex parte <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  filing of Columbia PCS, June 2, 1994. Columbia PCS further states that this measure would spur investment in designated entities and increase their ability to compete against one another and others.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 123. The $125 million gross revenue/$500 million asset caps have the effect of excluding the large companies that would easily be able to outbid designated entities and frustrate Congress's goal of disseminating licenses among a diversity of licensees. At the same time, this restriction does not exclude many firms that, while not large in comparison with other telecommunications companies, nevertheless are likely to have the financial ability to provide sustained competition for the PCS licensees on the MTA blocks. For example, the $125 million gross revenue figure corresponds roughly to the Commission's definition of a Tier 2, or medium-sized, local exchange carrier, <FOOTCITE>99</FOOTCITE>  and would include virtually all of the independently owned rural telephone companies. Limiting the personal net worth of any individual investor or affiliate of the applicant to $100 million will prevent a very wealthy individual from leveraging his or her personal assets to allow the applicant to circumvent the size limitations of the entrepreneurs' blocks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 99 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Local exchange carriers are categorized as Tier 1 and Tier 2 companies by applying the criterion that Sections 32.11(a) and 32.11(e) of the Commission's Rules use to distinguish Class A and Class B companies, respectively. Class A companies are those companies having annual revenues from regulated telecommunications operations of $100 million or more; Class B companies are those companies having annual revenues from regulated telecommunications operations of less than $100 million. The initial classification of a company is determined by its lowest annual operating revenues for the five immediately preceding years. A company's classification is changed when its annual operating revenue exceeds or is under the $100 million mark in each of five consecutive years. The Commission imposes more relaxed regulatory requirements on Tier 2 LECs than on Tier 1 LECs.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Automated Reporting Requirements for Certain Class A and Tier 1 Telephone Companies, 2 FCC Rcd 5770, 5772, 52 FR 35918, Sept. 24, 1987; Commission Requirements for Cost Support Material to be Filed with 1994 Annual Access Tariffs and for Other Cost Support Material, 9 FCC Rcd 1060 n. 3 (Comm.

As noted previously, many commenters asked us to reserve spectrum blocks for bidding only by designated entities. The entrepreneurs' blocks plan adopted herein is similar in concept to the set-aside proposals set forth by the commenters. Therefore, in determining which of the blocks in each market should constitute the entrepreneurs' blocks, we paid close attention to the concerns of those who had advocated set-asides in the first instance. Although the broadband PCS band plan has changed since the Commission first proposed set-asides in the Notice and parties first submitted their proposals in this docket, the general concerns of these parties about the amount of spectrum and geographic territory necessary to compete effectively remain pertinent. Moreover, we adopted the revised broadband PCS band plan in advance of this Order, which afforded interested parties the opportunity to make additional presentations on designated entity incentives in light of the new band plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

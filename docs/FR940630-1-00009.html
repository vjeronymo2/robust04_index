The provisions of the Texas Administrative Code (TAC) at 16 TAC 11.221 and the Texas Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Act that Texas proposes to amend are: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Texas Coal Mining Regulations (TCMR) 778.116(m), Identification of interests and compliance information <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Texas proposes to add language to require a permit application to include information on violations received pursuant to SMCRA's implementing Federal regulations, all SMCRA-approved Federal programs (OSM-administered Indian lands program and Federal programs for States), and all SMCRA-approved State programs, not just the Texas program, and information on air or water environmental protection violations received pursuant to any State laws, rules or regulations enacted pursuant to Federal laws, rules, or regulations and incurred by the applicant in any State, not just Texas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> TCMR 786.215 (e) and (f), Review of permit applications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Texas proposes at TCMR 786.215(e)(1) to require the Commission to consider, as a basis for permit denial, information on cessation orders issued by States other than Texas, and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Texas proposes at TCMR 786.215(f) to require that issuance of permits is specifically prohibited whenever the Commission makes a determination that the applicant, anyone who owns or controls the applicant, or the operator specified in the application controls or has controlled surface coal mining and reclamation operations with a demonstrated pattern of willful violations of the Texas Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Act (TSCMRA), SMCRA, SMCRA's implementing Federal regulations, SMCRA-approved Federal programs, and all SMCRA-approved State programs, not just the Texas program, of such nature, duration, and with such resulting irreparable damage to the environment, as to indicate an intent not to comply with these laws, rules, and regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.

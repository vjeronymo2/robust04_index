			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> 2 INCUMBENTS RAISE OVER $20,000 EACH  </P> <P> Both City Council incumbents have raised more than $20,000 in efforts to fight  off challengers in Tuesday's election for council seats.  </P> <P> Evelyn R. Hart, running against Jan Vandersloot for the District 3 seat on the  council, recorded $21,878 in total contributions to her campaign since she  announced she would run for office, according to her latest campaign financial  statement.  </P> <P> Vandersloot has raised about $8,000, including a $2,000 loan.  </P> <P> In the race for the District 1 seat, three-term incumbent Donald A. Strauss has  collected just over $20,000, including a $5,000 loan. Strauss is being  challenged by political newcomer John Hedges.  </P> <P> The committee to elect John Hedges has recorded $4,800 in contributions,  including a $1,200 loan.  </P> <P> Notable for Hedges is the number of Newport Beach police officers who have  donated to his campaign. During the October reporting period, 29 members of the  Newport Beach Police Department gave money to the Hedges campaign.  </P> <P> Throughout his campaign, and during public forums, Hedges, a former reserve  police officer, has urged additional support to the police force, including  using additional reserve officers to help bolster the department during the  busy summer season.  </P> <P> Neither Councilmen Phil Sansone nor Clarence J. Turner have filed campaign  statements during the election. Both are unopposed and are not collecting  contributions for the race.  </P> <P> The city limits donations from individuals to $200, according to the city  clerk's office. LAURA MICHAELIS  </P></p>

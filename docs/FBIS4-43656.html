			<p>BFN     [Text] The Hague (DPA) -- Outrage and disappointment over  Chancellor Helmut Kohl are currently dominating the atmosphere  in the government quarters of The Hague. Politicians of all  large parties resent the fact that the German head of government  is obviously vehemently opposing the candidacy of his Dutch  counterpart Ruud Lubbers as successor to European Union [EU]  Commission President Jacques Delors.    In an interview with DPA, Lubbers' spokesman Jaap van der  Ploeg even accused Kohl of burdening bilateral relations. "If  Kohl says that he does not want Lubbers per se, German-Dutch  relations will obviously deteriorate," he said.    However, it is not only the small circle around Lubbers that  is criticizing Bonn. Over the past years Jaap de Hoop Scheffer,  the foreign policy spokesman of the Dutch Christian Democrats,  has repeatedly called in parliament for a stronger political  orientation toward Germany -- and he convinced many. "Against  this background it is particularly disappointing that Germany  and France now give the impression that they are arranging  Delors' successor between themselves," he told DPA.    At their meeting in Mulhouse at the end of May, Kohl and  French President Francois Mitterrand reportedly agreed to  support Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene as Delors'  successor. For The Hague, this came as an unpleasant surprise.  Three years ago the chancellor said on Dutch radio: "Ruud  Lubbers would certainly be an excellent Commission president."    Now all newspapers are wondering why Kohl has obviously  changed his mind about Lubbers. The general view is that a  clarification from Bonn is a matter of urgency. The candidacy  of the popular prime minister has long become an issue of  national prestige, and it has dominated the newspaper headlines  for weeks. "After all, Ruud Lubbers is not just any candidate,"  Foreign Minister Pieter Kooijmnas said a few days ago. He has  been prime minister for 12 years, and thus has far more  experience than his Belgian competitor Dehaene.    For the Dutch, it is no consolation that Dehaene is also a  candidate of the Benelux states. On the contrary -- Belgium,  which is a bit smaller, is considered to be a junior partner.  If the "little brother" were to win over Lubbers, the  longstanding politician, this would be doubly unpleasant. It is  hardly imaginable that the Dutch will withdraw in favor of  Dehaene before the decisive meeting of the EU heads of  government next weekend.    "If Lubbers fails, we will blame the Germans alone," a  government spokesman has meanwhile threatened. However, there  are also other voices. "We must not declare a diplomatic war on  Germany," Frans Weisglas, the foreign policy spokesman of the  rightist liberals warns. "The relationship with Germany is far  too important to allow it to be permanently strained because of  a personnel issue."</p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Red meat sector problems hit Norish A fall in pre-tax profits from IPounds 1.11m to IPounds 868,000 (Pounds 857,000) was announced by Norish, the Irish group which provides food refrigeration and distribution services, for the first half of 1994. The company said the results had been affected by difficulties in the red meat sector and particularly hit the Irish stores. Its continued development into commercial markets had reduced the group's exposure to commodity products and the opening of a third store in Britain had accelerated that process. Turnover slipped to IPounds 4.74m (IPounds 5.18m). The dividend is held at 4.47p, payable from earnings of 8.42p (9.88p) per share.</p>

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Troops on alert as decision looms on Perez VENEZUELA'S government put thousands of extra police and national guards on the streets of Caracas yesterday in anticipation of possible violence as the supreme court debated whether to impeach President Carlos Andres Perez on corruption charges. More than 5,000 police, double the usual contingent, were dispatched across the capital while National Guardsmen flanked the avenue leading up to the presidential palace. Security was doubled around the supreme court and oil installations, and the number of troops at airports was increased. During the day city streets were virtually empty as many people stayed at home, fearing possible disturbances. The supreme court was expected to issue its opinion later yesterday on whether impeachment procedures should begin against the President for allegedly mishandling Dollars 17m (Pounds 11m) in government funds. It would be the first time in Venezuela's 35 years of democracy that a leader was forced from office. Mr Perez would be suspended from his post pending the verdict. In his weekly radio address early yesterday, a confidentMr Perez again maintained his innocence, arguing that this was merely the latest attempt - politically motivated - to oust him. 'I know that they want to crush me,' he said. Declining to leave office until he is forced to, he said: 'Here I am and here I will stay. I await the decision serenely.' If the supreme court decides in favour of impeachment, the case must then be reviewed by the senate, which will have to vote on whether the president should be tried. Mr Perez first said he would resign if the supreme court decided against him, but later asserted he would name one of his government ministers to serve as acting president. Mr Perez first held the presidency in 1974-79, a bonanza era when the country was the second-largest supplier of oil to the US. But his second term, starting in 1988, has been marked by political and social unrest in an oil-rich but corrupt country where many live in poverty.</p>

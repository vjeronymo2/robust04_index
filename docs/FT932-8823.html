			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Bonn faces pressure to seek new employer-union accord THE German government will be forced to negotiate a second solidarity pact, designed to finance the cost of subsidies for east Germany, with employers and unions in the coming months. It will for the first time involve substantial cuts in social spending, because of a drastic shortfall in its expected tax revenues, according to senior officials. The grim prospect of new budget cuts in the current year, followed by tough curbs on spending for at least three more years, has been prompted by the forecast of a tax shortfall of DM104.5bn (Pounds 42.4bn) for the public sector up to 1996. The longer-term fear of government advisers is that the recession-induced central government budget deficit, expected to reach DM70bn this year and at least as much in 1994, might become a structural deficit from 1995, in spite of economic recovery. The revenue estimate comes just two months after the first solidarity pact was painfully negotiated between the government coalition, the opposition Social Democrats and the 16 federal states, as well as employers and trade unions. Now the government must persuade the opposition and trade unions that social welfare programmes, exempted from cuts in the first round, as part of the compromise, will have to be included in a solidarity pact mark two. 'The first solidarity pact cut expenses too little and raised taxes too much,' according to one top government adviser. 'This has to be reconsidered. It is not possible to find a solution only through tax rises and higher budget deficits.' The new tax revenue estimates produced by a working group of finance ministry officials, Bundesbank experts and outside advisers suggest a shortfall of DM5.3bn this year, DM25.8bn in 1994, DM32.7bn in 1995 and DM40.7bn in 1996. Actual tax revenues for 1992 are put at DM732bn, estimated to rise by a nominal 2.2 per cent to DM748bn this year, and by 5.1 per cent to DM786bn in 1994. One factor behind the shortfall is sharply rising unemployment, which reduces disposable incomes and tax revenues while increasing the burden on social welfare programmes. Finance ministry officials expect the economy to contract by 2 per cent this year compared with initial forecasts of a 1.5 per cent fall, while they fear unemployment will rise by 500,000 to 3.5m in 1993, and by a further 200,000 to 300,000 in 1994, in spite of gradual economic recovery. The concern in government ministries is that in spite of the urgent need to make further cuts in government spending, current upheavals in the main political parties mean that no action will be taken for several months.

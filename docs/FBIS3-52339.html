It was attended by Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri,  Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri, Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz,  and the British ambassador to Lebanon.    Earlier, the British official held a round of talks with  Foreign Minister Buwayz at Bustrus Palace [Foreign Ministry].  Their discussion touched on the peace talks, developments in  the region, and the participation of specialized British firms  in the reconstruction of Lebanon.    In a joint news conference with Minister Buwayz, Hurd  expressed Britain's support for UN Resolution 425. He praised  the Lebanese people's efforts to rebuild their country. He  pointed out that he is not mediating the peace process, but he  noted his country's interest in facilitating the peace process  on all tracks. Hurd viewed the Lebanese-Syrian coordination in  the peace process as a source of momentum for this process.    The British secretary is scheduled to leave Beirut tonight  for occupied Jerusalem, the second leg of his Middle East tour,  which will also take him to Jordan.</p>

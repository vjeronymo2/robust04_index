(Koyo) requested that the Department of Commerce (the Department) issue a ruling that Koyo's imported forgings, including tower forgings, hot forgings, and cold forgings, be found outside the scope of the antidumping duty order on tapered roller bearings and parts thereof from Japan (52 FR 37352, October 6, 1987). The Department initiated its scope inquiry on September 28, 1993, and granted interested parties an opportunity to comment on whether these forgings fall within the scope of the order. We received comments on November 15, 1993, from the petitioner, the Timken Company, and rebuttal comments from Koyo on November 22, 1993. Due to the significant difficulty presented by this scope inquiry, we have determined that it is appropriate to issue a preliminary determination, in accordance with the Department's regulations (19 CFR 353.29(d)(3) (1993)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Koyo requested the scope ruling in response to a change in the U.S. Customs classification of Koyo's imported forgings. At the time of the original investigation, Koyo's imported forgings were classified as forgings under the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) 606.7340. When the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) replaced the TSUS in 1989 and a specific provision for forgings ceased to exist, Koyo classified its forgings as ``semifinished steel'' under HTS 7224.90, and later, based on the advice of a Customs port, as ``steel articles'' under HTS 7326.19. Customs recently examined the subject forgings and informed Koyo that it considers them to be ``parts of tapered roller bearings (TRBs)'' under HTS 8482.99. Customs generally classifies an article as a ``part'' of another article if that is its chief or principal use. Based on this general principle, Customs determined that under the HTS Koyo's forged rings should be classified as TRB parts as long as they are chiefly used for incorporation into TRBs. Although Koyo's scope clarification request was prompted at least in part by the action of Customs, neither classification choices made by producers nor classification decisions made by Customs determine the scope of antidumping duty orders. Rather, the scope of antidumping duty orders is determined by the Department at the time of the original investigation and issuance of an order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with 19 CFR 353.29(i)(1), in analyzing the scope request in this proceeding, the Department took into account the descriptions of the merchandise contained in the petition, the initial investigation, and the determinations of the Department and the International Trade Commission (ITC). The regulations provide that if the Department determines these descriptions are ambiguous, it will further consider the factors provided for under 19 CFR 353.29(i)(2), known commonly as Diversified Products criteria (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Diversified Products Corp. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 572 F.

The forgings are not machined in any way prior to exportation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei ahead as Kuala Lumpur posts five-month high Foreign investors bought large- capital stocks, while individuals targeted speculative favourites, and the Nikkei 225 average made a marginal improve-ment after fluctuating within a narrow range, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index gained 44.11 at 20,676.84 after a day's low of 20,565.21 and high of 20,700.94. A fall in bond prices, reflecting the rise in the dollar above the Y100 level, caused jitters among some investors. Volume totalled 270m shares, against 304m. The Topix index of all first section stocks firmed 3.21 to 1,656.52 and the Nikkei 300 was up 0.39 at 300.74. Rises led falls by 544 to 418, with 207 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 0.86 at 1,341.21. While investors have been cautious of the stronger yen and the negative effects on the economy, traders said implications for profit margins - due to lower costs - had yet to be discounted in share prices. Salomon Brothers in Tokyo said: 'The pass-through effects of the stronger yen have significantly lowered input costs and improved terms of trade for many industries.' The effects were likely to continue in coming quarters, putting downward pressure on costs, it added. But yesterday's activity did not centre on fundamentals. Instead, overseas investors bought low-priced laggards, including chemicals and shipping lines, while individuals dabbled in speculative shares. Steels were higher on foreign buying: Nippon Steel rose Y8 to Y361. Navix Line, a shipping company, gained Y20 at Y384 and Kawasaki Kisen rose Y19 to Y381. Showa Denko, a chemicals manufacturer, climbed Y20 to Y360. Takasago International, an aromatic chemicals maker, advanced Y13 to Y825. The company, which also makes fragrance chemicals for cigarettes and tobacco, was sought by investors looking for beneficiaries of Japan Tobacco's listing this autumn. East Japan Railway, which fell on profit-taking on Wednesday, appreciated Y2,000 to Y527,000. In Osaka, the OSE average put on 18.08 at 23,011.26 in volume of 132.5m shares. Trading volume rose on selling and buying back of shares by companies looking to realise profits on their holdings without changing their portfolios. Roundup A positive tone was evident throughout much of the region. KUALA LUMPUR posted its highest close for more than five months as early profit-taking gave way to blue-chip buying by foreign funds. The composite index added 7.74 at 1,086.80. The market's rise has come against a background of robust earnings reports by financial institutions, signs of lower inflation and reduced fears about overseas bourses. Foreign demand for Hicom Holdings pushed the conglomerate up 35 cents to MDollars 7.10. SHANGHAI A shares rose a further 8.1 per cent in record daily turnover as investors withdrew funds from the bond market and switched cash holdings into stocks. The index of shares available for local investors gained 42.99 at 572.78 as the market was given additional encouragement by a report in the China Securities newspaper saying thatthe authorities were examining plans to supply loans to brokerages in their efforts to boost investment. Turnover was Yn10.5bn compared with a previous all-time high of Yn5.32bn in March this year. Shanghai's B shares ended down on profit-taking after five successive trading days of gains. The index lost 1.22, or 1.7 per cent, at 72.61. In Shenzhen, the A index climbed 3.72, or 2.5 per cent, to 150.13; the B index rose 3.18 points, or 3.1 per cent, to 104.49. HONG KONG was pulled higher by finance and property issues after a cautious session which saw both profit-taking and bargain hunting. The Hang Seng index rose 56.96 to 9,642.85 in HKDollars 4.5bn turnover. Japanese institutions sold blue chips early in the day and foreign funds and some local investors picked up bargains in their wake. HSBC put on 75 cents at HKDollars 95.75 ahead of results on August 15, while Wing Lung Bank led the gains, rising HKDollars 1.25, or 2.2 per cent, to HKDollars 59. Swire Pacific 'A' added HKDollars 1, or 1.55 per cent, at HKDollars 65.50. SEOUL saw renewed demand for some blue chips and shares with low price/earnings ratios but trading remained thin. The composite index firmed 4.02 to 927.49, with selling pressure by investment trusts continuing to restrain the market. Posco advanced Won800 to Won75,300 and Sasmung Electronics added Won1,500 at Won90,500. But Hyundai Motor lost Won200 at Won44,900 on selling by investment trusts, which have been heavy sellers because they are due to pay back a total of Won850bn of soft loans from the central bank by August 12. SINGAPORE rebounded late in the session after earlier profit-taking, and brokers were divided on whether the market was still on track for a full-scale rally. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 4.04 up at 2,271.17. Creative Technology continued to fall sharply, closing SDollars 2.70 lower at SDollars 31.20: a number of brokers have issued sell recommendations. Keppel jumped 40 cents to SDollars 10.90 ahead of results. SYDNEY recovered from a dull start as foreign buying picked up during the afternoon. News Corp advanced 17 cents to a seven-week high of ADollars 8.98, but Advance Bank shed 67 cents to a three-week low of ADollars 9.27. The All Ordinaries index closed 11.2 up at 2,083.5, after an early low of 2,064.3. MANILA continued to attract foreign demand, which pushed prices higher before some profits were taken late in the session. Good corporate second-quarter results added to the market's momentum. The composite index rose 13.34 to 2,897.62 in turnover of 1.7bn pesos. TAIPEI was driven by late buying in electronics which took the weighted index up 66.01 to 6,789.57. However, turnover dropped to TDollars 85.3bn from Wednesday's TDollars 129.7bn. Electronics led the market, with ASE and United Microelectronics both up by the daily 7 per cent limit, to TDollars 107 and TDollars 146 respectively. Financial and cement stocks eased. WELLINGTON featured Telecom, which shrugged off an indifferent opening to close solidly ahead after reporting first-quarter profits at the higher end of expectations. Telecom gained 9 cents at NZDollars 4.99, having initially slipped to NZDollars 4.86, and the NZSE-40 capital index rose 19.68 to 2,101.88 in turnover of NZDollars 71m. BOMBAY recovered its composure after the finance minister's denial of rumours that he planned to resign prompted renewed domestic buying. However, further selling by foreign investors restrained the advance and the BSE 30-share index ended 19.35 ahead at 4,300.99 after reaching 4,331.</p>

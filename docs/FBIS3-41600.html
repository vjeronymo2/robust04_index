This is not a scene from  wartime. I chanced upon it quite recently in a corner of the  harbor of Baltiysk, the Baltic Fleet's main base. As local  officers explained to me, some bigwig here in Brezhnev's time  got it into his head that ships that were written off could not  be left afloat while waiting to be cut into sections and melted  down. So old cruisers and destroyers were sunk in a secluded  corner of the bay. But the years go by and no one is in any  hurry to process them. How many more graveyards like this are  there across Russia?    I also recently visited an air defense unit stationed in a  forest outside Moscow. In the unit itself everything gleams  with cleanliness; armed with cloths, the soldiers polish and  shine the missile launchers' various brass mechanisms. But the  landscape around the unit looks as if it has been hit by a  nuclear apocalypse. Carpenter should make his movies here. No  props are needed. Tonnes of stomach-churning garbage are piled  in sandpits. Its army origins are betrayed by the presence of  oil, petroleum residue, old boots, gas masks, and broken, bent  parts of military equipment.    Complaints against the former Soviet Army for defiling  nature  have now grown to enormous proportions. Many millions of  dollars in compensation for environmental damage are being  demanded by the Baltic peoples, Hungarians, Poles, Czechs, and  Germans. International conferences and seminars were even held  recently in Berlin and Budapest to discuss measures to overcome  the environmental damage done in Eastern Europe by the Soviet  Army. Exhausted by endless economic and political crisis, Russia  and the other CIS countries are keeping quiet at present. But a  huge scandal is inevitable. In an attempt to forestall it, the  Russian Defense Ministry has proposed that the Russian  Federation Armed Forces set up an environmental service and  eliminate any ``imperfections.''    It is clear even from the information doled out by Colonel  General V. Toporov, Russian deputy defense minister and member  of the Security Council's Interdepartmental Commission for  Environmental Safety, that the crisis has come to a head.  According to him, 9 million hectares of Russian land are  polluted simply as a result of operating space rocket complexes  (fuel components and metallic fragments of detachable rocket  stages). Because of the complex environmental situation, the  administrations of Altay Republic, Omsk Oblast, Tomsk Oblast,  and Arkhangelsk Oblast have banned the launch of space vehicles  and rockets until environmental certification of regions where  detachable rocket stages have landed is complete.    The serious radioactivity situation in the seas and on the  territory of a number of garrisons (units) is the result of  activity by the Navy and Defense Ministry test sites and  institutions. Because of the poor technical state and low level  of maintenance of fuel depots at military airfields built in the  fifties and sixties (Engels, Mozdok, Yeysk, and other cities),  soil and groundwater pollution occurs on a significant scale.  In virtually every garrison, as much as 45 percent of sewage is  untreated.    According to Deputy Minister V. Toporov, fines imposed on  military units for pollution of the environment in 1992 amounted  to 43.5 million rubles [R] at today's prices. This year,  however, one air garrison in the city of Engels alone has been  fined more than R24 billion!    Moreover, the recycling and destruction of nuclear,  chemical,  and conventional weapons are leading to even greater ecological  pressures on the environment. And if you consider the sinking  of nuclear-powered vessels' nuclear reactors and containers of  radioactive materials, the dumping of toxic waste, and so  forth!...    The Defense Ministry feels that the main reasons for the  serious environmental situation in the Army and the Navy are the  lack among the troops of a developed system of environmental  organs, forces, and material and financial resources. It cites  the example of NATO armies, which try to protect nature.    It is proposed to set up an environmental service in the  Russian Federation Armed Forces. The Russian president has  already prepared the relevant draft edict. The Finance Ministry  is told to allocate considerable resources for this purpose.    But there is one vital shortcoming in this good venture: The  environmental service will be a subordinate body whose financing  and promotion of officers will depend on the defense minister  and lower-ranking military officials. Will this not lead to the  covering up of accidents and to a situation where the extent of  the damage caused by Army sites is ``glossed over?'' Perhaps  the most acceptable option would be for the Russian Federation  Armed Forces environmental service to become an independent,  economically accountable body financed from the national budget  and led not only by the Russian Defense Ministry, but also by  the Ministry for Protection of the Environment and the Security  Council under the president's personal control?</p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris stands out in eventful day's trading Trading was eventful on the continent yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS was boosted to its highest close since June 1990 by options-related buying. The CAC-40 index closed just off the day's high at 2,036.72, up 30.10, in heavy turnover of FFr3.8bn. Paribas added another FFr10 to FFr429; after the close it announced the sale of a 54.7 per cent stake in Ciments Francais to Italcementi for FFr3bn. Axa, which owns less than 10 per cent of Paribas, jumped FFr43 to FFr1,017 with a large 152,690 shares traded. Analysts said the stock was rising on hopes that Equitable Life in the US would be able to proceed with its demutualisation plans and on rumours that it was preparing for an ADR issue. Eurotunnel bounced back FFr2.45 or 6.9 per cent to FFr37.90 in 1.6m shares in the wake of its recent underperformance. Schneider, which announced plans to buy in Merlin Gerin after the close on Tuesday, eased FFr6 to FFr709. FRANKFURT concentrated on the chemical and car sectors. There was some satisfaction with the lower inflation figures for the state Hesse. The data for western Germany are due today or Monday. The DAX index shed 0.4 to 1,735.91 while the FAZ index fell 3.24 at 703.09. Turnover rose to DM6bn from DM5.4bn. Bayer and Basf reported first quarter figures. Bayer rose DM6.20 or 2.2 per cent to DM294.50 after announcing a 7 per cent fall in the first three months. Basf added DM1 to DM249.30 after news of a 25 per cent decline in the same period. Hoechst, ex-dividend, rose a net 90 pfg to DM246.20. Daimler gained DM3.50 to DM785 after announcing that it was to increase its dividend by DM1 to DM13, but it did not confirm a report of a 1991 EPS of DM55, 10 per cent above previous forecasts. Linotype-Hell closed DM4 higher at DM420 after rumours that Siemens was to increase its 33 per cent stake. MILAN was led lower by telecoms and banks. The Comit index fell 4.92 to 503.66 in turnover estimated at L80bn after Tuesday's L104.9bn. Olivetti bucked the easier trend, adding L31 to L2,819, while pleasing 1991 results pushed Eridania up by L85 to L7,185. Telecommunications continued to drop, though analysts were unable to give a reason for the sector's recent decline. Stet eased L34 to L2,021. The banking sector was depressed by news that Banca Commerciale might need a capital increase next year. It fell L50 or 1.4 per cent to L3,420. The suspension of Italmobiliare and Italcementi fanned speculation, confirmed after the close, that the group was poised to buy all or part of Paribas's stake in Ciments Francais. Analysts welcomed the deal, in spite of Italcementi needing a capital increase to finance the deal, since it elevated Italcementi to the world's second largest cement producer after Holderbank of Switzerland. ZURICH was lifted by Nestle after it announced a 10-for-one share split and plans to convert its non-voting participation certificates into registered shares next year. The SMI index rose 14.7 to 1,874.2. Nestle bearers gained SFr180 or 1.8 per cent to SFr9,770, its registered shares put on SFr160 to SFr9,740 and its certificates rose SFr60 to SFr1,910. STOCKHOLM firmed as late buying helped to reverse an early fall. The Affarsvarlden general index added 1.3 to 980.9, in moderate turnover of SKr430m after SKr496m. Volvo, the session's most active stock, fell on fears of changes in the proposed merger with Procordia. Volvo B shares fell SKr7 to SKr438 the A share shed SKr10 to SKr435. But Procordia B jumped SKr5 to SKr193. AMSTERDAM was firmer with the CBS Tendency index up 0.5 at 128.6. Akzo gained Fl 4.90 or 3 per cent to Fl 161 after reporting a 7 per cent increase in first quarter net profit. Philips, which launched its new interactive CD player in the UK on Tuesday, put on 70 cents to Fl 37.90. OSLO was boosted by first quarter results from Norsk Hydro and Elkem. The all-share index rose 5.80 to 430.83 in turnover of NKr451m. HELSINKI weakened in spite of news that stamp duty of 1 per cent on share transactions would be removed from May 1. The HEX index fell 1.36 to 817.39. ISTANBUL recovered slightly after closing at a seven-week low on Tuesday. The index rose 11.86 to 3,691.81.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - APR 29  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm      close 1173.30  1173.63  1172.34  1173.21  1174.76  1175.00  1175.31   1174.59  -----------------------------------------------------------------------             Day's High  1175.99    Day's Low  1172.16  -----------------------------------------------------------------------     Apr 28    Apr 27    Apr 24    Apr 23    Apr 22     1169.61   1169.59   1167.02   1169.11   1171.34  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

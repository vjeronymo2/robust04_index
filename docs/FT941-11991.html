			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: IBM upgrades AS/400 system International Business Machines has announced a higher performance version of its widely-used AS/400 minicomputer. The aim is to stem declining revenues in one of its most critical business segments. Last week, IBM acknowledged that AS/400 revenue fell in the fourth quarter of 1993, mainly because of sluggish European demand. It added that a 3.8 per cent drop in software revenues was 'largely due to a decline in sales of AS/400 software'. More than 250,000 AS/400 systems are installed worldwide, running more than 20,000 software applications. The AS/400 'mid-range' product line is IBM's principal offering for large companies that are reducing the size of their computer systems or switching to departmental networked 'client-server' computing systems, and for smaller companies upgrading from personal computer networks. However, IBM faces intense competition from Hewlett-Packard and other companies offering lower-priced, mid-range systems based on reduced instruction set computing (Risc) technology. The new IBM model, called the 9406 Model F97, will support 4,800 workstations, twice as many as the current top-of-the-line Model F95. Priced at about Dollars 1.2m, it provides 20 per cent more power and can support up to 30 per cent more disk storage. Next year, IBM is expected to announce another significant upgrade of the AS/400 family based on the PowerPC chip - a new Risc microprocessor co-developed with Motorola and Apple Computer.</p>

Stamps carry a picture of President Kim Il-song looking with  a bright smile on his face over fields of golden ears of rice  ripe under the rays of the theses and a picture of the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il walking through crop fields with  farmers.    Some stamps depict agricultural working people who are  riding  Chollima under the banner of the three revolutions, ideological,  technical and cultural, and picture socialist cooperative fields  where irrigation and electrification have been completed and  mechanisation and extensive use of chemicals are being promoted  powerfully.    There are stamps portraying agricultural working people who  are being trained into agronomists and assistant agronomists and  many other stamps showing the successful promotion of the  ideological, technical and cultural revolutions in the  countryside.    Postcards and envelopes reflect the validity and vitality of  the socialist rural theses.</p>

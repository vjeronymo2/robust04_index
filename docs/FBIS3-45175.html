			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Xiao Rui (5135 3843)] </F>   [Text] Beijing 7 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Based on its  monitoring of the Chinese economy in 1993, an authoritative  department in charge of economic affairs predicts that in the  first few months of 1994, China's economy will rebound rapidly,  therefore, it is necessary to implement a slightly tighter  monetary policy to avoid more stringent policies, which will be  needed if the economy becomes "overheated" once again.    At present, there are many destabilizing factors within  China's economy; in particular, the investment momentum is  great, and many localities are waiting for the central  leadership to delegate more power to them so they can launch  projects. Meanwhile, the reason for poor economic efficiency  among enterprises is partly because of a shortage of funds due  to a cut in the total, but mainly because they have internal  structural problems. If the current monetary policy, which is  already loose, continues to become loose, then the whole economy  will rebound rapidly and will quickly reach the level of July  1993, leading to a tense macroeconomic situation.    The year 1994 will be a year of reforms in China. Reforms in  the areas of taxation, finance, investment, foreign exchange,  housing, and prices will be thoroughly launched, and these  reforms are unprecedented in terms of pace, the number of  measures, and the areas to be solved when compared with those of  the past 10 years or so. In the new round of reforms,  destabilizing factors will also arise, therefore, the duty for  macroeconomic regulation and control in 1994 will be very  arduous.    The authoritative department pointed out that macroeconomic  regulation and control in 1994 should pay special attention to  maintaining price stability and a moderate growth rate.    Price increases are a very important factor affecting social  stability. At present, the price level is already high,  especially in the domain of residents' daily necessities. In  the fourth quarter of last year, a loose monetary policy was  implemented, and this led to greater inflationary pressure.  Recently, some people have started panic buying of grain, gold  ornaments, and household electric appliances, and this shows  that people have already become very sensitive to prices. In  1994, after implementing reform of the revenue system and reform  of wages in government, party, and business units, a close watch  must be kept on the price trend, and the people's sensitivity  and fears relating to prices should not be ignored. Other  reforms must consider prudent timing to avoid creating an  unfavorable impact on markets and residents.    The smooth process of reform needs moderate growth. What is  moderate? No more than 10 percent is moderate. In the area of  macroeconomic regulation and control, the policy of control over  a more appropriate total quantity should be upheld, and the good  economic situation should never justify a "great leap forward"  in the economy.    To conclude, in 1994, regulation and control over total  quantity should continue to use the method of routine, timely,  and moderate "slight adjustments" to remove destabilizing  factors promptly.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Six Arab residents were injured by the Israel  Defense Forces gunfire in the territories today. Our  correspondent Moti Amir reports that four residents sustained  slight injuries when soldiers fired at stone throwers in  Nabulus. Another incident occurred in Rafah, where two  residents were slightly injured when soldiers fired at stone  throwers. [passage omitted]    Hisham 'Abd-al-Raziq, member of the Fatah supreme committee  in the Gaza Strip, says the announcement by several Strip Fatah  Hawks members of their intention to resume armed struggle is a  spontaneous reaction to the killing of Salim Mu'affi, rather  that a decision made by the organization. In a talk with our  correspondent, 'Abd-al-Raziq said the continuing manhunt for  Fatah Hawks by the security forces undermines the local  population's confidence in the peace process.</p>

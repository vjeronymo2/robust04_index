			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Bulgaria Keeps Neither Its Own Nor Somebody Else's </F> Chemical Weapons, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Says" -- BTA  headline]    [Text] Sofia, April 25 (BTA) -- "Bulgaria keeps neither  its own nor somebody else's chemical weapons. We are absolutely  clean in this respect," Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav  Daskalov today told Mr. Ian Kenyon, Executive Secretary of the  Steering Committee for the setting up of an organization seeking  a ban on chemical weapons, who is now visiting Bulgaria. BTA  learned this from a Foreign Ministry spokesman.    Mr. Daskalov reportedly briefed the guest on an April 11  cabinet decisions providing for the introduction at parliament  of a bill on the ratification of the chemical weapons  convention. The convention was signed by the foreign ministers  of 126 countries, Bulgaria including, at a 1992 Paris meeting,  to introduce a ban on the development, production, piling and  use of chemical weapons and provide for their destruction.    Foreign Minister Daskalov stressed that the forthcoming  ratification of this convention is consistent with Bulgaria's  interests. Joining the European structures, which is this  country's major aspiration, entails accession to all  international accords pertaining to the arms control and  particularly the control on mass annihilations arms, Mr.  Daskalov also said.    The talks stressed that Bulgaria has an advanced chemical  industry and is therefore a potential producer of chemical  weapons, this Foreign Ministry spokesman also said. For this  reason, and under the clauses of the effective international  agreements, this country is liable to international control.  The committee will undertake the training of Bulgarian experts  in this sphere.    Asked whether the talks touched upon the possible use of  chemical weapons by any of the sides involved in the  Yugoconflict, this spokesman answered in the negative. However,  Mr. Daskalov reportedly expressed Bulgaria's stance, that "being  situated in a highly neuralgic area, it is interested in finding  a complex solution to the problem pertaining to the ban and  destruction of mass annihilation arms".</p>

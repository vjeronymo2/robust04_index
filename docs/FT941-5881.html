			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / BT looks abroad for video trials British Telecommunications announced yesterday that its video-on-demand trials will use technology developed by north American and French companies. Two trials are planned for this year. The first, covering 70 BT employees in Kesgrave near Ipswich, will be a technical trial. It will be followed later this year by a commercial trial involving 2,500 residents in a place yet to be decided. The trials will pilot two technologies: the use of ADSL electronics to upgrade copper wire to carry video pictures; and the more ambitious option of extending fibre-optics into the home. Northern Telecom, the Canadian telecoms manufacturer, has won the contract for the ADSL equipment. Alcatel, the French supplier, will provide the fibre technology. Three US companies - Oracle, nCube and Apple Computer - will supply software and hardware. Oracle will provide software and systems-integration services, nCube will provide multimedia server hardware and Apple Computer will supply 'set top boxes' to decode the digital multimedia signals. The technical trial will be limited to programming, using material supplied by broadcasters including the BBC, Carlton Communications, London Weekend Television and Granada. The commercial trial may extend to information services. On the basis of the experiments, BT will decide whether to proceed with a heavy investment - about Pounds 15bn - to upgrade its network to provide broadband services. Until recently, BT insisted that the government's refusal to allow it to provide entertainment services until at least 2001 made it uneconomic to extend fibre down to the local network. But, with US phone companies announcing ambitious network modernisation plans, senior BT executives are anxious not to be left behind. Participants in the initial trial will be able to call up more than 250 hours of programming through video remote-control devices. The material is transmitted from a central database over the upgraded telephone network to the television.</p>

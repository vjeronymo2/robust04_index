The CCC&hyph;ICC&hyph;OCC program would involve the cross-margining of positions in specified commodity futures, commodity options, and securities options (``eligible contracts'') carried for, among others, certain market professional customers. These market professionals would include New York Cotton Exchange (``NYCE'') or FINEX members and firms owning NYCE or FINEX memberships, members of exchanges cleared by ICC, and market makers, specialists, and registered traders on securities options markets whose accounts would not be proprietary within the meaning of Commission Regulation 1.3(y), 17 CFR 1.3(y), (``participating market professionals'') and whose positions are carried by participating futures commission merchants (``FCMs'') that also are participating broker-dealers (``B/Ds'') or by participating FCMs and their affiliated participating B/Ds which may also be FCMs (together ``participating clearing firms''). Section 5a(a)(12)(A) of the Act provides that the Commission shall approve contract market rules only if such rules ``are determined by the Commission not to be in violation of [the] Act or the regulations of the Commission.'' Commingling of futures and non-futures funds of customers currently is not permitted under the Commission's regulations. Section 4d(2) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6d(2), however, authorizes the Commission to issue an order prescribing the terms and conditions under which ``money, securities, and property [received by an FCM to margin, guarantee or secure the commodity futures trades or contracts of a customer] may be commingled *&blank;*&blank;* with any other money, securities, and property received by such [FCM] and required by the Commission to be separately accounted for and treated and dealt with as belonging to the customers of such [FCM].'' Accordingly, any proposal which would permit such commingling would require Commission action pursuant to section 4d(2) of the Act, as well as section 5a(a)(12)(A).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Whereas, the CCC&hyph;ICC&hyph;OCC non-proprietary cross-margining proposal provides for calculation by the participating clearing organizations of a single margin requirement to support the positions of participating market professionals in eligible contracts carried by participating clearing firms;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Whereas, the Commission has reviewed the CCC&hyph;ICC&hyph;OCC cross-margining proposal; the proposed agreement among the participating clearing organizations; the proposed agreements among the participating clearing firms and the participating clearing organizations; and the proposed agreements among the participating market professionals and participating clearing firms submitted by letters dated April 7 through November 16, 1993; the representations of the participating clearing organizations as to the operation of the program; the representations of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (``SIPC'') and the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC''); and such other documents as constitute the complete record in this matter (``Record'');  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Whereas, the agreements among participating market professionals, participating clearing firms, and participating clearing organizations require that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Each participating market professional acknowledge in writing that any money, securities, or property, including securities option positions, held on his behalf in a non-proprietary cross-margining account (``cross-margining property'') will be treated in a manner consistent with the terms of this Order and any other applicable order issued by the Commission;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Each participating market professional acknowledge and agree in writing that any cross-margining property held on his behalf by a participating FCM or a participating B/D affiliated with a participating FCM will be customer property deemed to be received by the participating FCM to be accounted for, treated, and dealt with by such FCM as belonging to such market professional in a manner consistent with section 4d of the Act;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Each participating market professional agree in writing that, in the event of the bankruptcy, liquidation, or receivership of or other proceeding involving the distribution of funds held by a participating clearing firm against which such market professional has a customer net equity claim in respect of the cross-margining property, such claim shall be subordinated to the customer net equity claims of ``public customers,'' as that term is defined in Commission Regulation 190.01(hh), 17 CFR 190.01(hh), of such clearing firm that do not relate to money, securities, or property in any cross-margining account; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Each participating market professional acknowledge and agree in writing that cross-margining property held for or on his behalf will not be customer property under the Federal securities laws to the extent necessary to effect this Order and will not be customer property under subchapter III of chapter 7 of title 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. 741&hyph;752 or the Securities Investor Protection Act (``SIPA''), 15 U.S.C. 78aaa  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and will not be claimed as such, and will be customer property under the Act, subchapter IV of chapter 7 of title 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. 761&hyph;766, and part 190 of the Commission's regulations, 17 CFR part 190;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Whereas, each participating market professional which signs such a participant agreement will be a customer of a participating FCM;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Whereas, each participating clearing firm will treat money, securities, and property received in respect of all accounts other than cross-margining accounts in a manner consistent with the requirements of the Commission and the SEC appropriate thereto;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Perspectives: Of saints and sinners - Jimmy Burns went to see the work of Mother Teresa's order Christopher Hitchens may have surprised and shocked many Roman Catholics with his attack on Mother Teresa in this week's Without Walls programme on Channel Four, but it has not exactly come as a bolt from the blue. In an article entitled 'Ghoul of Calcutta', published in the US's leading left-wing magazine The Nation in April 1992, he referred to Mother Teresa as a 'dangerous, sinister person who properly belongs in the caboose of the Pat Buchanan baggage train'. Hitchens' thesis then, as repeated this week, was that Mother Teresa's work among India's poor, barely distinguishable from her public attacks on contraception and abortion, was an exercise in Vatican-style Catholic and right-wing propaganda masquerading as charity work. In attacking Mother Teresa, Hitchens is not alone. As a former voluntary worker in Calcutta wrote to the Guardian newspaper this week, there are people who go to India and become disillusioned with the tea-and-sympathy philosophy of Mother Teresa. Last month I visited one of Mother Teresa's homes for abandoned children in Delhi. One of the Sisters of Mercy explained why the majority of the children there were either girls or handicapped boys. Within the traditional Hindu family culture, a healthy boy is all that is really longed for - a guarantor of support as well as inheritance. The boy earns a wage and later lights the funeral pyre of his father. A girl is a financial burden - for her dowry has to be paid by her parent. Those that are born handicapped are regarded as a curse, spiritual outcasts, best abandoned in the hope that better things may emerge from reincarnation. I spent an afternoon playing with Michael, a mentally handicapped four-year-old who drew chaotic lines across my note book before crunching up the pages. He hardly smiled but as the afternoon wore on he gradually abandoned his destruction and tried to draw me a flower instead. I saw about 100 children there being cared for with extraordinary love by the Sisters of Charity, a process that would continue until the day each and everyone of them was adopted. When I asked one of the nuns what guarantee there was that any of these children would ever enjoy family life, one of the youngest among them woke as if from a trance and said unflinchingly: 'Thank God there are more people who want babies in the world than who do not want them.' She added: 'We never ask for anything, and yet somehow we never lack anything. Providence ensures that the most unexpected person turns up with a most unexpected gift.' I gave her some children's books and an envelope filled with money. Then I left, thinking of my own two adopted daughters, seeking comfort in the thought of them and yet, troubled by a sense of guilt at having to say goodbye to Michael, pledged that my best contribution would be to write about him. Of course, I reflected afterwards, the young nun was in celestial cloud-cuckoo land. One needs only to encounter the beggar children on the streets of any urban centre in India to realise the consequences of population growth. And yet those same beggar children are testimony not so much to the impact of Mother Teresa's proselytising but to the extent to which a combination of political inertia - not to mention corrupt bureaucracy - and deep-rooted cultural habits conspire against decent family life. Mother Teresa's tasks result not from some hidden agenda within the Roman Catholic church but from India's own failings as a nation. Until the day that India has decent hospitals and redistributes wealth among the 40 per cent of her population living beneath the poverty line, I find it difficult to accept that Mother Teresa is a negative force rather than a liberating one. I recall the reaction of some medical staff to the plague which broke out while I was in India. In Surat, the region where the outbreak began, a doctor ran away to her village instead of attending to the first patients that came to her for help. In Delhi, a surgeon in one of the country's main general hospitals chased a black rat from his operating theatre, caught it and put it in a plastic bag. He took it to another hospital where a special emergency unit had been set up to analyse blood samples of suspected plague carriers. When he got there he was told to take the rat back to where he had taken it from because he had acted without authorisation. Neither the doctors nor Michael and the girls in Delhi featured in Hitchens' programme. Maybe they should have done, if only to underline the fact that the identification of saints and sinners cannot be two-dimensional. Volunteers such as Mother Teresa work for the living in a land where too many people are allowed to die.</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANUFACTURERS HANOVER'S CUTS MAY IDLE 1,000;  </P> <P> BANKING: THE HUGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION ALSO DISCLOSED A ONE-TIME CHARGE, BUT  WOULDN'T SAY HOW MUCH.  </P> <P> Manufacturers Hanover Corp. said Thursday that it will take an unspecified  one-time charge in the second quarter related to a restructuring that analysts  say may result in the loss of more than 1,000 jobs.  </P> <P> The charge, which did not surprise analysts, stems from efforts to reduce  expenses, according to a preliminary prospectus covering an offering of  Manufacturers Hanover preferred stock.  </P> <P> Bank spokesman John Meyers had no comment on whether there would be layoffs.  </P> <P> Several analysts estimate that Manufacturers Hanover, the nation's  eighth-largest banking concern, is attempting to slash $100 million in annual  expenses. To do so, they say, more than 1,000 jobs may have to be eliminated.  </P> <P> Manufacturers Hanover would not specify how large its charge might be, but the  prospectus said it expects it to be less than operating earnings for the  quarter.  </P> <P> In the regulatory filing, the bank said only that operating earnings for the  quarter ending Saturday would be below the $96 million in operating earnings  reported first quarter.  </P> <P> Manufacturers Hanover traditionally releases its second-quarter earnings report  in late July, in conjunction with a regularly scheduled board of directors  meeting. But full details of the restructuring plan might not be outlined until  fall, industry watchers say.  </P> <P> Manufacturers Hanover in May announced a realignment that split its wholesale  bank business into four groups, eliminating a layer of management. The move is  expected to generate "significant annual savings," the bank said.  </P> <P> Separately, the bank said it expects non-performing assets to increase by 15%  "in the near future, principally as a result of problems being experienced by  Donald J. Trump, one of the corporation's major real estate customers."  </P> <P> Trump missed a $30 million-interest payment due Manufacturers Hanover earlier  this month.  </P> <P> Manufacturers Hanover and Trump's other major banks -- Citicorp, Chase  Manhattan Corp. and Bankers Trust Co. -- recently negotiated a $65-million,  five-year bailout and debt-restructuring deal. It includes delayed payments on  some debt.  </P></p>

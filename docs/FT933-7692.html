			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Setback for Taiwan president TAIWAN'S President Lee Teng-hui yesterday suffered a setback in his efforts to replace conservatives on the ruling Kuomintang or National party central committee with more progressive politicians, writes Dennis Engbarth from Taipei. Of the president's 210 nominees for the central committee, 58 lost in the elections at the party's 14th congress. Mr Hsieh Shen-shan, deputy secretary general of the party, said that, 'facing a new situation and fierce competition', the fact that 72.3 per cent of nominees were elected 'was a success'. But conservative delegates critical of Mr Lee gained between 35 and 40 seats on the central committee. This showing should be sufficient to secure several seats on the central standing committee, the Kuomintang's top policy-making body, which the central committee will elect next Monday.</p>

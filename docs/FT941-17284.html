			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Observer: Happy families Television wars are rather like soap operas. So it's nice to see two old flames in the ITV franchise wars setting up shop together. Janice Hughes, head of the European media practice of consultants Booz Allen Hamilton, batted successfully for Michael Green's Carlton Television which has just completed its first year as London's weekday commercial TV station. Kip Meep, head of the media unit at consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, acted for Thames Television - the losers to Carlton. They have buried the hatchet and opened their own multi-media consultancy - Spectrum Strategy - thus avoiding any unnecessary bickering about whose name should appear first in the title.</p>

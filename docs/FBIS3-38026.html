This decision is not connected  with the State Duma's resolution on amnesty for participants in  the August 1991 events, adopted on Wednesday, CRIME PRESS  learned from the military collegium of the Russian Supreme  Court. The hearing was put off because of the continued illness  of the wife of defendant Vasiliy Starodubtsev. She is in an  intensive care unit of a hospital after a stroke.</p>

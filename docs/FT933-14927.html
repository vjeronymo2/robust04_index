			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Field calls for pensions switch LABOUR MP Mr Frank Field says the government should abandon the basic state pension and instead make employers contribute 6 per cent of gross earnings to private schemes on their employees' behalf. Mr Field, chairman of the Commons social services committee, presents his views in a Fabian Society pamphlet published today, in which he suggests that in turn, employees would have a duty to make contributions of 4 per cent of gross salary. Mr Field described the paper as 'an attempt to break out of the Beveridge mould which has controlled the left's debate on welfare reform for the entire post-war period'. The paper proposes that pension administration and fund management would be taken over by the companies which now provide personal pensions, such as life assurance companies, as well as banks, building societies and friendly societ-ies. Government involvement would be limited to making contributions to the private pensions of four groups receiving little or no income - full-time and part-time carers, parents caring for their young children, the disabled and the unemployed. These contributions would be linked to average earnings. The private providers would undertake to give a 'guaranteed minimum pension', 20 per cent above the current level. This could be clawed back from wealthier pensioners, according to a sliding scale, if their additional contributions enabled them to add significantly to the guaranteed minimum. Significant tax changes would be made, with both employers' and employees' national insurance contributions reduced. Pension lump sums, currently tax-free, would be taxed to bring them in line with income paid to pensioners while in the long term, pension funds would lose their tax privileges (including grossed-up premiums) to create a 'level playing field' with other long-term savings products such as unit and investment trust saving schemes. Mr Field would also strengthen regulation of the pensions industry by requiring companies to produce a standard card showing how much customers would pay in fees each year, and by moving to a fixed-fee system for brokers.

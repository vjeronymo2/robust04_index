			<p>BFN     [Text] Retired Army Chief General Hector Rios Erenu said he  was skeptical about the elimination of compulsory military  service for "economic reasons." He said: "If we do not have the  money, we cannot implement it. I think it is practically  impossible," the former military chief added. Rios Erenu was  the Army commander during the first "painted faces" revolt in  April 1987.    General Carlos Quevedo, 3d Army Corps commander, did not  want  to commit himself to either one or the other system. Asked to  compare the compulsory and voluntary services, he said: The two  systems "have comparative advantages."  <H5>  Coincidences </H5>   Quevedo said that some requirements must be met for the  implementation of the voluntary system. "It all depends on  certain conditions," he added. Rios Erenu and Quevedo agreed on  some of those conditions.    "We are going through a very difficult economic moment in  Argentina. National defense is not a priority," said Erenu, who  was military commander during the Raul Alfonsin administration.  He warned about an Army budget, "loss of potential, and  insufficiency," adding that the 240 million pesos approved by  the Economy Ministry "will not be enough" to eliminate the  compulsory military service.  <H5>  Creation of Reserves </H5>   The retired military officer said the alternative system  proposed by the government "is viable" only if "a series of  changes" are introduced into the 1901 Recheri law, such as the  creation of an Army reserve.    Rios Erenu said "it is not appropriate" to incorporate "a  mass of voluntary workers" unless we can equip them. He said  that the salaries of Army troops, as well those of the rest of  the Armed Forces and Border Police personnel, "are terribly  outdated," adding that this specifically influences the forces'  performance.</p>

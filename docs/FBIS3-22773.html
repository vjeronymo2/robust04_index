			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Habibur Rahman: "U.S. Spy Planes' Flights Over </F> Pakistan's Sensitive Regions?"; from the "Islamabad Diary"  Column]    [Excerpt] A team comprising five U.S. experts is currently  visiting Islamabad. These experts are the representatives of  the U.S. agency which oversees arms control and nuclear  nonproliferation matters. Their duties include, among other  things, providing necessary information and advice to the U.S.  secretary of state. During its talks with the Pakistani  authorities, the U.S. team will discuss when and how the next  step for rolling back Pakistan's nuclear program will be taken  and what method needs to be adopted to verify Pakistan's  compliance with the commitment it will make in this context.  Pakistan's former caretaker Prime Minister Dr. Moin Qureshi  announced on 24 September 1993 that Islamabad had frozen its  nuclear program. After this announcement, the U.S. State  Department issued a statement, saying that Washington is  strongly opposed to the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and  the governments of the South Asian countries have been asked to  halt their nuclear programs forthwith and eventually destroy all  their weapons of mass annihilation. The U.S. Government also  wants to settle all stages of rolling back Pakistan's nuclear  program in a manner which could ensure the continued  verification of the fact that Islamabad is winding up its  nuclear program. The aforementioned U.S. experts, currently in  Islamabad, would probably also like to know and see how far  Washington's instructions have been complied with, when and how  the next steps will be taken, and in what ways Washington can  feel assured in this regard.    A U.S. aircraft has remained parked at the Chaklala airport  in Rawalpindi since 5 January 1994. This is the plane that  brought to Pakistan a troop of 150 U.S. military commandos who  have apparently been sent to conduct joint exercises with the  Pakistani Army commandos. Most of these exercises have been  held in the Cherat region, where the headquarters of the  Pakistani Army commandos is located. Recently, a letter was  published in a Pakistani daily, in which the writer stated that  the geographical features of Cherat region are largely similar  to those of the Kahuta area, where Pakistan's nuclear laboratory  is located, and which the U.S. has been eyeing. The writer of  that letter had asked whether the U.S. commandos' exercise in  the Cherat region is not a prelude to preparations for action  against the Kahuta laboratory. The U.S. plane now standing at  the Chaklala airport is called MC130-H in air force jargon and  is equipped with very sensitive equipment for photography. This  equipment includes the capability of carrying out the most  sophisticated spying work. With the help of this equipment, the  aircraft can prepare any maps that are desired and freeze a  radar system. Even total darkness cannot hamper its work.  According to a published report, this U.S. reconnaissance plane  has flown several times over Pakistan's northern areas,  especially over Chitral, Swat, Chilas, Gilgit, Skardu, and  Deosai, since 5 January 1994. The U.S. possesses only four  planes of this type. The cost of each of these aircraft is  stated to be $96 million. During the rule of late President  Field Marshal Ayub Khan, the United States was allowed to  establish a base at (Badaber) near Peshawar to carry out aerial  espionage against the former Soviet Union. The U.S. U-2 spy  planes used to fly from this Pakistani base into the Soviet  airspace. The Russians shot down one of these U-2 spy planes.  After his arrest, the U.S. pilot of that spy plane confirmed the  presence of a U.S. espionage base on Pakistani soil. Durrani, a  managing director of the Pakistan International Airlines [PIA],  was accused of cooperating with the United States in installing  spying equipment on a PIA plane that used to fly over the  People's Republic of China. That incident took place during the  rule of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. During the regime of President  General Mohammad Ziaul Haq, the U.S.' CIA was given the facility  to set up a base in Pakistan's northern areas to fight with the  Soviet Union in Afghanistan and in that way Pakistan was turned  into the biggest CIA base. Now, the presence of the  aforementioned U.S. spy plane at Chaklala airport in Rawalpindi  and its activities tend to indicate that the U.S. has been given  a free hand to use Pakistani soil to carry out spying on  Pakistan itself, and the valiant United States has been making  full use of this freedom.

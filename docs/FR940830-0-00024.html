			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (g) If a plan of combination provides for a resulting Federal mutual savings association's name or location to be changed, its charter shall be amended accordingly. If the resulting institution is a Federal mutual savings association, the effective date of the combination shall be the date specified in the approval; if the resulting institution is not a Federal savings association, the effective date shall be that prescribed under applicable law. Approval of a merger automatically cancels the Federal charter of a Federal association that is a disappearing institution as of the effective date of merger, and the association shall, on that date, surrender its charter to the Office.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6.

All rights and obligations of the disappearing institutions shall remain unimpaired, and the resulting institution shall, on the effective date of the merger or consolidation, succeed to all those rights and obligations, subject to the Home Owners' Loan Act and other applicable statutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7.

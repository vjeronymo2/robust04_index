			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Japan ready to open markets a little - But not as much as Washington wants / The US deadline draws nearer Japan is putting to the US new proposals aimed at opening its markets further to foreign companies, but officials in Tokyo indicated yesterday that these would fall short of the Clinton administration's demands that it agree standards by which improvements could be measured. The US has set Sunday night as the deadline for agreement on changes in Japan's procurement regime governing telecommunications and medical equipment. If no agreement is reached, the US will then cite Japan as having a closed market and start the clock running for 60 days of talks and consultations during which Japan would have to make suitable concessions or face sanctions. That period would end on September 30, the same day the US must announce the world's most unfair trading practices under the revised Super 301 law which allows US action against countries discriminating against US exports. Mr Sadayuki Hayashi, Japan's deputy foreign minister, was due to arrive in Washington last night for talks with Ms Charlene Barshefsky, the deputy US trade representative. These talks follow the failure of last weekend's negotiating session on liberalising any of the three key sectors in which the US says Japan must show progress: insurance, government procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment, and vehicles. Moves on the latter two fronts were being suggested in Tokyo yesterday. The Japan Eximbank said it was considering overtures from the big three Detroit car makers for concessional loans which they would use to boost production of right-hand drive vehicles for the Japanese market. Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry said a 'viable compromise' could be reached on procurement policies for government departments and other big state purchasing authorities which would benefit foreign telecoms and medical equipment suppliers. Under an existing agreement to come into force next April, each contract worth more than SDR800,000 (Dollars 1.1m) will be put out to international tender. Miti officials suggested that lowering this threshold progressively was the 'only reasonable solution' to US complaints that its companies would still be shut out of lucrative deals. They said potential foreign bidders would be canvassed for their views on technical specifications and price. But they made clear that the current plan would increase tenfold the workload in ministerial procurement departments where Japan's economic downturn had squeezed funding. Mr Hayashi is said to be unlikely to countenance a reduction to anywhere below SDR400,000, and will probably hold out for a higher trigger point and another two years or more before that would take effect. But Miti acknowledges that these are points of detail in meeting the wider US demand for measurable criteria which would commit the Japanese government to delivering progress in the private sector as well as on its own behalf. The Liberal Democratic party, which under Mr Kiichi Miyazawa reached the framework agreement with President Bill Clinton last July, may be back in office after a year's absence during which Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, his reformist successor, refused to submit to US strictures during trade talks in February. No Japanese party appears prepared, however, to stomach an accord echoing the 1991 semiconductor pact which committed Japan to allowing foreign producers a 20 per cent share of its domestic market. Even if they are not expressed in cold numerical terms, Japan sees such targets as handing Washington a stick with which it could be given a beating at any politically convenient moment. But as one US official in Tokyo put it yesterday, 'How then do we declare success? Even if it's backward-looking, how are we to know what's good or bad unless we can decide in advance' what the goals should be?</p>

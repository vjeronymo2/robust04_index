			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Businesses show rise in confidence BUSINESS confidence recovered sharply between October and December but a further cut in interest rates is needed to pull the economy out of recession, according to the Institute of Directors. The institute's latest two-monthly survey found that the proportion of business leaders who were more optimistic about the economy compared with six months ago increased to 38 per cent last month from 10 per cent in October. There was an especially strong rise of confidence in the Midlands, where half of directors were more optimistic. The proportion of directors who were less confident fell from 67 per cent to 36 per cent, making a positive balance of those more optimistic over those less optimistic for the first time since June. The institute polled 327 directors, more than half of whom were managing directors or chairmen, between November 26 and December 11. It found that all industrial sectors showed increased optimism about the economy compared with six months before. Directors were also more upbeat about profits. Although employment prospects remain gloomy, directors from all sizes of company appeared to believe that the worst of the job losses are over. The proportion of directors who were more optimistic about the prospects for their own companies compared with six months ago was 48 per cent against 37 per cent in October. The proportion of directors who were less optimistic about their own companies fell to 24 per cent from 36 per cent. In the Midlands 53 per cent said they were more hopeful about their own company's prospects. These upbeat assessments were reflected in improved business volumes. In December 39 per cent said their business volume - turnover minus all bought-in goods and services excluding labour - had risen in the previous six months compared with the same period of 1991 while 35 per cent reported a fall. In October the proportions were reversed with 34 per cent reporting a rise and 39 per cent a decline. Mr Peter Morgan, the institute's director-general, warned that business confidence, although improved, was only back at the level of a year ago. 'While the foundations for recovery are in place, we do not yet have the economic conditions to pull out of recession,' he said. 'To build on those foundations, the chancellor should announce a further cut in interest rates and continue the steady and sustained downward movement in steps which would avoid destabilisation of the currency.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 29 May (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina said pressure and force are not the mechanisms  to use to leave the country, referring to the more than 100  Cuban nationals who forced their way into the residence of the  Belgian ambassador in this capital.    Moments before his departure for Cairo, Egypt, Robaina said  the island's government is holding talks with the Belgian  Government to find a solution to Saturday's incident but said  Cuba's position will be the same one it has always maintained.    In this regard, Robaina said they must leave the residence,  because forcing one's way into diplomatic missions "is not the  way to leave the country, and, therefore, it is up to the  Belgian authorities, who are aware of the positions we have  maintained in this regard, to take the proper steps."    [Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish at 0101 GMT on 29 May  transmits an 80-word report, datelined Havana, citing Belgian  Ambassador Paul Vermeirsch, who today told PRENSA LATINA that  "he has no comment whatsoever on the forcible entry into his  residence by a group of people whose objectives had not been  announced." Vermeirsh added that "any report on today's  incident in that diplomatic mission would be conveyed by the his  country's Foreign Ministry in Brussels, the Belgian capital."]</p>

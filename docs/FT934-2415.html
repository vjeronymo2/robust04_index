			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / PO chief warns of increase in charges Post Office investment plans and profitability are being put at risk because of uncertainty over the government's review, the corporation said yesterday. In an outspoken attack on ministers for failing to make up their minds, Mr Mike Heron, chairman, threatened an increase in postal charges if the government did not change the present regime. He said: 'The long uncertainty is highly damaging, especially when coupled to the trebling this year of the cash we have to pay the Treasury. I do not believe the status quo can continue.' The Post Office's external finance limit target - the amount it has to pay the government - has risen to Pounds 230m next year, and is set at Pounds 210m for the following year. In the short term, Mr Bill Cockburn, chief executive, said it could meet the targets only at the expense of capital expenditure and investment. In the long term, it would mean higher stamp prices and might even threaten the corporation's 15-year history of profitability. The Department of Trade and Industry, which initiated the review 18 months ago, is understood to have ruled out full-scale privatisation, but is known to be sympathetic to its call for greater commercial freedom. It said yesterday its review, which is not expected to be published until early next year, was 'complex and difficult'. It added that pressure on public finances meant that everyone, including the Post Office, had to make a contribution to the PSBR. However, Mr Edward Leigh, who was responsible for the Post Office until dismissed as trade and industry minister last summer, accused the government of a 'political funk' for not privatising the corporation. Mr Robin Cook, Labour's shadow trade and industry secretary, said: 'The strong language which Mike Heron uses to complain about the government is unprecedented for a chairman of a public corporation.'

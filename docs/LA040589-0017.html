			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ROAD-TAX PROPONENTS CIRCULATE PETITIONS IN SANTA CLARITA VALLEY  </P> <P> Santa Clarita Valley business leaders have begun circulating petitions seeking  public support for a proposed bond measure that would add from $75 to $200 to  property-tax bills to build and improve valley roads.  </P> <P> Lou Garasi, president of the Santa Clarita Valley Chamber of Commerce, said  Tuesday that proponents hope the petitions will persuade the Los Angeles County  Board of Supervisors to join the Santa Clarita City Council in placing the  measure on the Nov. 7 ballot.  </P> <P> Garasi said the Canyon Country and Santa Clarita Valley chambers of commerce  launched the petition drive in unincorporated sections of the valley at the  request of Supervisor Mike Antonovich. Although Antonovich has shown interest  in the bond proposal, Garasi said, he has not said he will support placing it  before voters.  </P> <P> The Santa Clarita City Council last week approved an agreement drafted by city  and county staffs to create a joint-powers authority to administer taxes  collected to pay off the 25-year bonds. The agreement must be approved by the  supervisors because the tax would be levied on property in unincorporated areas  of the valley.  </P> <P> It will cost about $110,000 in administrative and legal fees to prepare the  bond measure for the November election. If the measure passes, the bonds will  pay off those fees. If the measure loses, Santa Clarita and the county will  have to split the costs.  </P> <P> The chambers did not have time to launch a house-by-house petition drive.  Instead they have mailed 2,000 petitions to registered voters in neighborhoods  suffering from chronic traffic congestion, said Connie Worden, a city planning  commissioner and bond measure proponent.  </P> <P> Each petition has room for just four signatures. Worden said organizers hope  that residents will sign the petition and perhaps gather signatures from a few  neighbors and mail them to the Santa Clarita Valley Transportation Committee,  an offshoot of the two chambers of commerce.  </P> <P> Garasi and Worden said they are hoping for at least 200 signatures.  </P> <P> Garasi and Worden admitted that collecting signatures through the mail is  unorthodox and politically risky because it asks residents to not only sign but  mail their petitions. If the response is poor, supervisors may decide the issue  would not pass in November.  </P> <P> It would be much easier to gather signatures in public places, such as shopping  centers, but time is short and the petition drive must target registered voters  in the unincorporated valley, Garasi said. There are no major shopping centers  outside the city limits.  </P> <P> Garasi predicted that growing frustration over traffic will encourage people to  mail in their petitions. "If they are upset with traffic congestion, they'll be  willing to spend 25 cents," he said.  </P></p>

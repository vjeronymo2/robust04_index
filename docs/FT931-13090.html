			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Israel may lift privatisation with bond conversions ISRAEL is considering making some government securities sold overseas convertible into equity under the state's industrial privatisation plans, the head of the Israel Bonds organisation said yesterday. Last year was a record for sales of Israel bonds, a longstanding source of borrowing for the state, mainly from the Jewish diaspora in the US. More than Dollars 1.16bn was raised, compared with Dollars 990m in 1991. But the high price paid, as long-term interest rates lagged declines in short-term rates, and the prospective easing of Israel's external borrowing costs due to the granting of US loan guarantees has led the government to scale down its target for the sale of bonds through the organisation in 1993 to Dollars 1bn. Meanwhile, Israel is keen to press ahead with its first borrowing under the Dollars 10bn loan guarantees programme provided by the US government, according to the accountant-general's office. Thirteen US banks are competing for the mandate to arrange the issue in the US bond market. Morgan Stanley is acting as an adviser on the programme and so is excluded from the bidding process. The offering could total up to Dollars 2bn, which would cover a projected Dollars 2bn current account deficit. The structure of the deal has not yet been decided, but the bonds could have a life of up to 30 years, the maximum length of the US government guarantee. However, the positive yield curve could discourage the government from tapping the long end of the market, where rates are higher. Mr Meir Rosenne, president of the Development Corporation for Israel, the Israel Bonds organisation, said in Jerusalem that the finance ministry was discussing a scheme under which bonds could be exchanged for shares in government companies being privatised as a new way of channelling the investments being made in bonds. He also said he was shifting the emphasis in bonds marketing towards cheaper 15-year current income bonds. These carry a 4 per cent annual interest payment and are considered the classic 'soft' instrument for attracting investment from Jewish communities. Last year, they accounted for only 8 per cent of all sales. Half the total - Dollars 584m - was raised via a variable rate bond carrying interest of 7.5 per cent until it was withdrawn in July. Mr Rosenne said he wanted to increase sales of the lower interest bonds to 20 per cent of the total. 'That would put us in much better shape,' he said. The government originally set a target of Dollars 1.5bn for 1992, believing a flood of immigration from the former Soviet Union would lead to balance of payments problems. But a slowdown in immigration rates and the granting of the US loan guarantees quickly changed the picture, making the bonds programme appear excessively expensive.</p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Low interest rates buoy home starts HOUSING starts in the US rose 7.8 per cent between July and August, indicating that the lowest mortgage interest rates for 20 years are providing a powerful stimulus, writes Michael Prowse in Washington. The increase was larger than analysts expected and took the level of starts to an annual rate of 1.32m, the highest in more than three years. The figures, published yesterday by the Commerce Department, came as Federal Reserve governors and regional presidents met in Washington to review monetary policy. The central bank is not expected to signal an early change in short-term rates, which have stood at 3 per cent (zero after allowing for inflation) for more than a year. Housing starts rose in all regions except the north-east. The strongest sector of the market was starts of single-family homes, which rose 11 per cent nationally to an annual rate of 1.18m, the highest in six years.</p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / The family firm fights back: In the first of a series, the strengths of Sweden's Wallenberg dynasty For Sweden's phalanx of big international companies, the recession is emphatically over. In contrast to the atmosphere of crisis over the financial deficit in the country's public sector, companies such as Volvo, Electrolux, Ericsson and Saab-Scania have over the past two weeks reported a gush of half-year profits after three of the toughest years Swedish industry has endured since the 1930s. As industry pulls out of recession, one striking feature has become clear. In spite of dire predictions to the contrary from the markets, the industrial dominion controlled by the Wallenberg family has not only survived. Mr Peter Wallenberg, doyen of its fourth generation, has extended its dominance of Swedish industry to unprecedented levels and entrenched the family as Europe's most powerful industrial dynasty. The core companies in the Wallenberg 'sphere' (the family, which rarely has majority control of a company, prefers to call it an association of companies rather than an empire) had a combined annual turnover last year approaching SKr550bn (Pounds 46.6bn). Together, these companies make up about 40 per cent of the market capitalisation of the Stockholm stock exchange. How have the Wallenbergs so strengthened their position? And as they approach a handover from one generation to the next - with Peter Wallenberg now 68 and his son Jacob and nephew Marcus being groomed to succeed him - can they maintain their pre-eminence? Between 1990 and 1993, the chief question was whether the empire could hold together under the pressure of recession. Mr Peter Wallenberg, who has the world-weary look of an old campaigner, admits it was a rough period. 'All in all, it put the organisation to a very tough test,' he said in an interview with the FT. As recently as in early 1993, the outlook was still grim. Investor, the holding company chaired by Peter Wallenberg which groups most of the main family shareholdings, remained burdened with debt of more than Dollars 1bn. Core companies such as Stora, Europe's largest forestry group, and SKF, the company which invented ball-bearings, had reported losses in 1992 of SKr1.42bn and SKr1.77bn respectively. Saab-Scania, the vehicle and airplane maker bought out by Investor in 1991 as an anticipated source of cash flow, had seen profits slump, as had other stalwarts such as Electrolux, the world's leading household equipment maker. Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, historically the family's financial flagship, founded in 1856, was almost swamped by bad loans that sank it deep into operating losses of SKr5.4bn in 1992. Sceptics saw cracks in the Wallenberg edifice. Speculation was rife that a pattern of marginal disposals and portfolio reshuffles would fail to satisfy the empire's capital needs. A strategic disposal was keenly anticipated by the markets. The subsequent transformation owed much to the change in Sweden's economic fortunes following the 25 per cent devaluation of the Swedish krona after its flotation in November 1992. But the Wallenberg companies helped by cracking down on costs, slashing as much as 20 per cent of their workforces. By the end of last year, the crisis was over with most of the companies back on a healthy profits path. The balance sheet of Investor, the key holding company, has been transformed. Piecemeal selling of shares in a number of companies, rather than the disposal of a single large stake, drove down debt from SKr8.4bn at the end of 1992 to SKr4.8bn a year later. This year the group has bolstered its position further with a SKr3.45bn bid for its Export-Invest stablemate, essentially a giant share issue. Further strengthening is likely as dividend flows into the group's coffers pick up. Bo Berggren, Investor vice-chairman and a Wallenberg lieutenant, considers 'the Investor balance sheet today is probably as strong as it has ever been.' It was not just market conditions and restructuring that helped the family pull through. The family was able to exploit Swedish 'dual-share' rules to raise money from disposals without any loss of control in the target company. Swedish rules allow equity to be split between A and B shares with voting power heavily weighted to the former. This system has long enabled the Wallenbergs to control companies often with very little capital commitment. Much the most significant factor in underscoring the dominance of the Wallenberg family occurred, however, at Volvo where for 20 years, Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar had striven to create a industrial empire to rival the Wallenbergs. Mr Gyllenhammar was deposed in December 1993 by a shareholder and management revolt against his plan to merge Volvo car and trucks with France's Renault. His strategy was then quickly abandoned by Volvo's new board, chaired by Bert-Olof Svanholm of ABB and including Bjorn Svedberg of S-E Banken, both from the Wallenberg 'sphere'. Instead, Volvo decided to sell off SKr40bn of non-core investments. The Wallenbergs, back on the offensive after the recession, moved swiftly. Within a week of Volvo announcing its strategic U-turn in the spring, Incentive bought out Volvo's controlling shareholding in Cardo, an investment group which included Gambro, a medical equipment supplier that matched the Wallenbergs' evolving focus on technology-based growth industries for future investment. 'The Wallenbergs manoeuvred marvellously over Volvo after the Renault deal collapsed,' says the chief executive of one of Sweden's top non-Wallenberg companies. 'They got Volvo where they wanted it without paying a penny and now they are carving it up.' Mr Peter Wallenberg rejects any suggestion that he deliberately sought to exploit the Gyllenhammar debacle. But it is unarguable that events since have enhanced the Wallenberg dominance. A principal strength of the Wallenbergs has been their record in choosing skilled managers, who in turn have benefited from having dedicated owners who understand international markets and invest for the long term. Another factor that is often underestimated is the determination of Peter Wallenberg himself, who succeeded his formidable father Marcus in 1982 despite the latter's dim view of his ability to become a leader with 'ice in his belly'. Mr Wallenberg still talks bitterly of the way he was written off in his early days in charge, when now-forgotten 1980s whizz-kids were circling his vulnerable empire. 'I am surprised when people say 'this is the beginning of the end',' he says. 'Do you think we are just sitting here looking at things going wrong?' He clearly feels his job is still not complete. Asked what challenges remain, he says: 'To prove that we are not as vulnerable as some people seem to believe. I think that is very important.' The first task now may well be to conduct some internal reorganisation. The group's structure, concentrated round Investor and Incentive, an industrial operating group, looks cumbersome. For example, profits from Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering giant half-owned by Asea, must first swill through Asea and Incentive before they reach Investor. Saab-Scania, which is 100 per cent owned by Investor, may also be re-shaped. Few would be surprised if the company was either re-listed or if some of its defence and vehicle operations ended up in joint venture partnerships mirrored on the collaboration with General Motors at Saab Automobile. But there are other challenges on the horizon which will test the next generation - Jacob and Marcus, working respectively in senior posts in S-E Banken and Investor. Most obvious, perhaps, is the financial markets' perception that the Wallenberg portfolio of companies is over-dependent on low-growth cyclical industries. Even under the dual-share structure, which acts as a built-in defence against an outside takeover, the empire could yet prove vulnerable to foreign predators - especially given the deregulation of the Swedish share market in recent years. To counter any impression of vulnerability, the Wallenbergs stress they are again on the offensive, looking for opportunities in growth industries and casting their gaze more outside Sweden. Senior family members talk of an 'evolution' in the sphere in which their traditional willingness to take a long-term view is preserved. But there are signs that financial deregulation is putting pressure on the companies to concentrate more on maximising investors' short-term returns. One dramatic step has already been taken, in Incentive's Dollars 1bn bid in May to gain control of Gambro, the medical equipment specialist. Incentive then sold its controlling share in Esab, the world's biggest welding equipment supplier, to Charter of the UK. The swap tilted Incentive decisively away from a traditional cyclical industry to a fast-growing technology sector. The trend will continue, says Mikael Lilius, Incentive's chief executive. The Wallenbergs have also in recent months talked of looking abroad for new investments as part of the evolution. Sweden is chronically short of 'growth' companies, and the family is also conscious of the political sensitivities that attach to their dominance of the corporate sector. Peter Wallenberg says: 'This is a rather small country and industrially we represent a rather sizeable share. I think we must be observant of the world around us.' Investor has said it envisages building up its foreign portfolio to 10 per cent of the group's total investments. A start was made through the Export-Invest takeover, which brought Investor holdings in Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, and Alcatel Alsthom of France. The group is also paying closer attention to South-East Asia and the Far East in its trawl for investment opportunities. This is bound to intensify questions about the underlying industrial logic of the Wallenberg sphere. The loose-knit nature of the empire makes the individual companies stronger, family members insist. 'I don't even know whether Saab or Scania is buying SKF ball-bearings for their cars and trucks,' says Peter Wallenberg, 'The basic situation between these industries is arms' length. No deals or favours for one another.' Outsiders conclude that the driving force of the empire is more the family's determination to keep control than about creating value. 'The thing they care most about is protecting their heritage,' says one Swedish corporate financier. The Investor investment record suggests there is something to this view. Its share portfolio has done better than the Stockholm stock exchange in six of the last 10 years and its annual total yield (defined as dividends plus share price appreciation) has averaged 17.2 per cent, compared with 15.0 per cent for the stock exchange. But the outperformance is entirely due to Astra, the high-flying pharmaceuticals group. Elsewhere, the Wallenbergs have often been prepared to pay a high price to retain control, as when Investor paid a hefty premium to buy out Sven Olof Jahansson, a financier who had built up a 22 per cent stake in Saab-Scania and demanded a seat on the board. There are also doubts as to whether they are prepared to take the hard-headed decisions needed to re-shape the empire significantly away from its dependence on low-growth industries. The empire did sell its entire stake in packaging company Alfa Laval to rival Tetra Pak in 1991. But as one ex-Wallenberg director says: 'You can't see Peter Wallenberg selling out of Atlas Copco (the engineering group) where he worked for 25 years.' With an average of 25 per cent of the capital of Wallenberg companies now in foreign hands, the empire is far more susceptible to this kind of assessment than in the past. The perception that a company is not delivering maximum returns could lead to greater share price volatility  - perhaps even takeover bids, although they face the barrier of the weighted share structure. The tension between such pressures and the Wallenberg's traditional style is among the many challenges facing Jacob and Marcus Wallenberg as they prepare for the day when Peter steps down. A second article will be published tomorrow.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- SWEDEN'S INDUSTRIAL POWER CENTRES (WHERE ACTING AS MAJOR OR CONTROLLING SHAREHOLDER)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Wallenberg family                              State  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total assets (SKrbn)                           Total assets (SKrbn) S E Banken      418                            Norbanken       391  ----------------------------------------------------------------------    Net worth (SKrbn) Investor         38  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1993 turnover (SKrbn)                          1993 turnover (SKrbn) Asea-ABB*        210                           ASG                8 Astra             23                           Assi Doman        15 Atlas Copco       19                           Celsius           12 Electolux        100                           LKAB               4 Ericsson*         63                           Pharmacia         27 Gambro             9                           Telia             35 Incentive         12                           Vattenfall        24 Saab-Scania       28                           Retriva***        10 SKF               29                           Securum***        10 Stora             50  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total            543                           Total            135  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Volvo                                          Svenska                                                Handelsbanken  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                Total assets (SKrbn)                                                Handelsbanken   444  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1993 turnover (SKrbn)                          1993 turnover (SKrbn) Volvo            107                           AGA               11 BCP               22                           Ericsson**        63                                                Frigoscandia       5                                                SCA               33  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total            129                           Total            112  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *   Area is half-owner of Asea Brown Boveri **  Ericsson is jointly controlled by Investor &amp; Handelsbanken *** Retriva &amp; Securum administer assets taken out of Nordbanken &amp;     Gotabank  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

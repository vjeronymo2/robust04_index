			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN JOSE;  </P> <P> NEWSPAPER FILES SUIT AGAINST UNION CHIEF  </P> <P> The San Jose Mercury News has filed a lawsuit against the former chief of the  San Jose hotel workers union, claiming his 1983 libel lawsuit against the  newspaper was an attempt to intimidate it and a violation of free press rights.  The newspaper claimed the lawsuit filed by Frank Marolda damaged its reputation  and is asking for $1 million in damages and recovery of "a significant amount"  for legal fees, according to Mercury News attorney Edward Davis.  </P> <P> "It's a combination of abuse of the process and malicious prosecution," Davis  said. "The union's lawsuit was designed to send out a message to everyone else  that if you write a negative story about the union, you're going to be in  trouble." In late 1987, a Santa Clara County Superior Court judge threw out  Marolda's lawsuit against the paper and two reporters. Marolda, then president  of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees and Bartenders Union, Local 19, in San  Jose, and the union objected to an article that appeared Oct. 24, 1982. The  story described Marolda's administration of the union and his problems  connected to a U.S. Senate investigation of labor corruption.  </P></p>

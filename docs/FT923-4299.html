			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Premier league sponsorship row SEVEN MEMBERS of the Premier League, the top English football division, walked out of a meeting of the clubs yesterday after a Pounds 13m sponsorship deal with Bass, the brewer, had been blocked. Eight of the league's 22 clubs had voted against accepting the deal because they felt it might conflict with their own sponsorships by brewers. The seven clubs which walked out argued that the action by the eight was against the interests of the Premier League as a whole. Fourteen clubs voted to accept the deal - one fewer than the number needed to carry the motion.</p>

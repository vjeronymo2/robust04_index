			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOOTBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SALISBURY GETS A PASSING GRADE  </P> <P> Antelope Valley Coach Brent Carder summed up Brett Salisbury in one sentence.  </P> <P> "He's everything everybody said he was," Carder said.  </P> <P> Salisbury, the nation's leading community college passer, played only the first  half before leaving with a sprained ankle, but threw for 379 yards and four  touchdowns to lead Palomar to a 28-24 victory over Antelope Valley Saturday in  the Hall of Fame Bowl at Balboa Stadium in San Diego.  </P> <P> Salisbury, who transferred to Palomar from Brigham Young because Ty Detmer was  the Cougars' starting quarterback, passed for 3,328 yards and 33 touchdowns and  set a national junior college record with 273 completions, completed 15 of his  24 attempts.  </P> <P> Moorpark 69, Santa Monica 34 -- Winless in three previous bowl appearances, the  Raiders made up for years of frustration by routing the Corsairs in the Western  State Bowl at Moorpark.  </P> <P> Moorpark's Freddie Bradley rushed for 183 yards in 23 carries and scored on  runs of four, 34 and eight yards. For the season, he rushed for 2,129 yards and  scored 32 touchdowns.  </P> <P> Glendale 23, Citrus 16 -- The Vaqueros took a run at the state's top-ranked  defense. Literally. Keeping the ball on the ground for 58 of its 70 offensive  plays -- including all nine on the winning drive -- Glendale ground out a  victory over the Owls in the Southern California Bowl at Citrus.  </P> <P> Glendale gained 437 yards, including 306 rushing. But the last 59 were the most  important.  </P> <P> Glendale started its winning drive on the Citrus 41 with 6:33 left. Fullback  Rafik Thorossian keyed the march, carrying four times for 30 yards. Bobby  Webster capped the drive, going over from the three with 1:11 left.  </P> <P> Pasadena 29, Riverside 28 -- Ostell Miles gained 50 of his 164 yards on the  winning drive, including a one-yard touchdown run with 3:03 left, and James  Marlborough passed to Wolfe Barber for the two-point conversion as the Lancers  won the first game of the Orange County Bowl doubleheader at Orange Coast  College.  </P> <P> Riverside's Jeff McDaniel missed a 32-yard field goal attempt with 27 seconds  left. The Tigers had taken a 28-21 lead with 5:32 left on a one-yard run on  fourth down by quarterback Jack Manu.  </P> <P> El Camino 23, Orange Coast 20 -- The Warriors rallied for two touchdowns in the  final 6 minutes and 52 seconds to win the second game of the doubleheader.  </P> <P> Anthony Daigle, who rushed for a game-high 163 yards, leaped one yard for the  decisive touchdown with 2:29 left. Bryan Reeves caught a 10-yard touchdown pass  from Rod Harvey with 6:52 left as El Camino cut the lead to 20-16.  </P></p>

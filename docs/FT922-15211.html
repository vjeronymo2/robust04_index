			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Unpaid government bills stall Civil Service headhunters THE GOVERNMENT appeared to have egg on its face yesterday after the Cabinet Office admitted that late payment of bills by government departments had caused cash flow problems at a hived-off agency which selects high fliers for the Civil Service. About 30 business people and public figures who help in the selection process have been told that payment of their fees has been delayed. A letter to them from the Civil Service commissioner blames cash flow problems at Recruitment and Assessment Services (RAS), which recruits under contract to government departments and agencies. 'It appears that the Cabinet Office is informing a cross-section of the establishment that the much-vaunted Civil Service financial and accounting reforms don't work as well as they are supposed to,' said one recipient of the letter. The Cabinet Office said last night that all outstanding fees would be paid by Friday. Some of the payments are for work done at the end of January. The delays will be embarrassing for ministers who have condemned the late payment of small businesses by large companies. In his Budget speech last month, Mr Norman Lamont described the practice of boosting cash flow by delaying payments as 'wholly deplorable'. Government departments, he said, had a good record for paying their own bills on time and the government hoped their example would be followed by private sector companies. The delays reveal increasing financial problems at one of the government's executive agencies, on the day that 15 new ones were launched. RAS looks set to make an Pounds 800,000 loss in its first year, against the government's target of recovering all its costs in full. Income at RAS has been depressed by reduced recruitment to the Civil Service. RAS has also lost business from departments which have taken advantage of rules introduced in April 1991 allowing them to do their own recruitment.</p>

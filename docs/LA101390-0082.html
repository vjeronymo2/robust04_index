			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEY KOHL AIDE SHOT AT RALLY; SUSPECT HELD  </P> <P> A gunman opened fire on Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble at a campaign  rally Friday, seriously wounding one of Germany's most prominent political  figures, police said.  </P> <P> Schaeuble, key negotiator of the treaty reunifying East and West Germany and  one of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's closest associates, was shot in the head and  throat before police overpowered the assailant. A bodyguard also was wounded.  </P> <P> No motive has been determined for the attack against the 48-year-old Cabinet  member, but "it does not appear to have any terrorist links," said Werner  Fischer, spokesman for district police in Freiburg, Germany. The Interior  Ministry also ruled out terrorism.  </P> <P> It was the third assassination attempt against a prominent German politician in  six months.  </P> <P> Fischer said the gunman pulled out a revolver and fired three or four shots as  Schaeuble was leaving the hall in Oppenau, in southern Germany, shortly after  10 p.m. A 37-year-old man was arrested at the rally. His name was not released,  but he was described as a local resident. German media reported the suspect had  ties to the drug scene.  </P> <P> The Interior Ministry kept a tight lid on details about the attack but  confirmed that there appeared to be only one assailant.  </P> <P> "It's not clear yet how far away the gunman was standing from Schaeuble, and we  don't know whether he said anything before he started shooting," Fischer said.  He said he was unaware of any threats against Schaeuble's life before the  rally.  </P> <P> Schaeuble, the country's top law enforcement official, was the third German  politician to survive an assassination attempt since April, when chancellor  candidate Oskar Lafontaine was stabbed in the throat by a deranged woman who  hid a butcher knife in a bouquet at a campaign rally.  </P> <P> Schaeuble's own top anti-terrorism expert, Hans Neusel, escaped a bomb planted  in his car by leftist Red Army Faction guerrillas in July. Neusel suffered only  a cut hand.  </P> <P> Married and the father of four children, Schaeuble had been viewed as a highly  competent but somewhat anonymous political figure until his move to the  Interior Ministry last year catapulted him into the spotlight of European  politics.  </P> <P> Within just months of taking office in April, 1989, Schaeuble found himself the  key figure in negotiating the German unification treaty.  </P> <P> Repeatedly he steered the delicate, emotionally charged talks away from  potential danger as Kohl and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher  concentrated on the international negotiations that would give Germany back its  sovereignty.  </P> <P> When East Germans balked at losing their own liberal abortion laws to West  Germany's highly restrictive ones, Schaeuble helped fashion the compromise that  allowed both pieces of legislation to remain in force until a new law can be  agreed upon for the united Germany.  </P> <P> Schaeuble, not Kohl, represented West Germany when the treaty between the two  states was signed in August.  </P> <P> And when the treaty threatened to unravel before it was ratified, Schaeuble  again coolly stepped in and worked out a compromise over the controversial  issue of who would get control of the massive files compiled by East Germany's  hated secret police.  </P> <P> The files remain in the eastern part of the country, a concession to protesters  who feared West German security officials might try to use the information they  contained.  </P> <P> Personable and outgoing, Schaeuble's performance in recent months has made  political analysts here consider him a potential star of the next generation of  German leadership, possibly one day succeeding Kohl as chancellor.  </P> <P> Kohl is considered a shoo-in for reelection when the newly united country votes  Dec. 2. Schaeuble was stumping for their party in Oppenau, in Baden  Wurttemberg, when he was shot.  </P> <P> The British news agency Reuters reported that Hans-Peter Junker, a journalist  who witnessed the shooting, told German television that Schaeuble had just  given a talk to a group of about 300 on German unity and was leaving to  enthusiastic applause when the shots rang out.  </P> <P> "Just before the door, a man jumped up from a table on the left, jumped past  the security men and fired at him," Junker said. Bystanders overpowered the  attacker, while security men went to Schaeuble's aid.  </P> <P> "Schaeuble was bleeding very heavily, but he remained conscious and spoke,"  Junker said.  </P> <P> The minister's daughter witnessed the shooting. "His daughter couldn't grasp  what was happening; she screamed and began to cry," Junker said.  </P> <P> "Schaeuble was Kohl's right-hand man before he came to the Interior Ministry,  but it was a kind of gray eminence," commented one Western diplomat who has  followed Schaeuble's career closely.  </P> <P> "But no one was surprised that he rose to the challenge as he has done," he  added. "He's had enormous responsibility during the unity process, but he's  proved to be an extremely capable figure."  </P> <P> Ironically, one of the lone incidents in the unity process that drew criticism  of Schaeuble was a dramatic security lapse in Berlin on unification day, Oct.  3.  </P> <P> Somehow, an emotionally disturbed man managed to slip through security checks  at the Berlin Philharmonic, where Kohl, German President Richard von  Weizsaecker and other dignitaries were sitting. The man casually strolled to  the podium and spoke for three minutes before security officials seized him and  took him away.  </P> <P> Political opponents demanded Schaeuble's resignation after the incident, but  there was no indication that Kohl considered asking the interior minister to  step down.  </P> <P> Schaeuble entered Parliament in 1972 and was a chancellery minister from 1984  to 1989.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 22 (KCNA) -- A meeting denouncing  Japan's interference with Korea was held in the Philippines on  June 15, according to a foreign press report.    Present at the meeting were Philippine women who had been  forced to sexual slavery for the Japanese Army during World War  II and people from all walks of life.    They strongly demanded that Japan immediately stop  interfering in the internal affairs of Korea, and criticized the  Japanese Government for trying feverishly again to realise its  militarist ambition on the Asia-Pacific region.    They also denounced Japan for instigating the International  Atomic Energy Agency and the United Nations to take "sanctions"  against North Korea.</p>

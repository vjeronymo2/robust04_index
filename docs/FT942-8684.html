			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Bass After all that effort Mr Ian Prosser of Bass must be crying into his beer. Despite his determination to gain market share, beer volume was down slightly at the interim stage and the company's share of the overall market went up by only 0.3 percentage points. The cost was a drop in brewing profits of nearly 7 per cent. Despite a series of one-off factors, there is no mistaking the remorseless pressure on margins. The company's response has been to continue cutting costs and to reduce in relative terms the resources allocated to brewing. Free-trade loans are being scaled back and brewing is receiving less capital expenditure. But given the company's position in the market it seems condemned to see out the beer price war. While Allied-Lyons shares rose 1 per cent yesterday on the growing conviction that beer need not form part of its long-term strategy, those of Bass fell nearly 2 per cent on the realisation that as market leader, it cannot afford to pull out. That move may be overdone simply on the basis that Bass had already fallen nearly 5 per cent against the sector so far this month. At least hotels are doing better, though the extent of the franchise operation limits their gearing to recovery. Government competition rules give Bass some scope to expand its pub estate and any sale of the Britvic soft drinks business could provide the resources further to improve its quality. Brewing looks set to remain a drag for some time, though. With earnings and dividend growth both in single figures, there is no reason why its shares should out-perform.</p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Eurotunnel set to make Pounds 850m cash call after loan delays Eurotunnel is likely to seek about Pounds 850m in its forthcoming rights issue, 20 per cent more than the stock market expected and far greater than any of its four previous equity-raising exercises. The disclosure of the sharp rise in the Channel tunnel operator's refinancing requirements came as it faced continuing difficulties in raising Pounds 700m of new senior bank loans. Yesterday's official deadline passed with Eurotunnel still Pounds 150m short, largely because Japanese banks have yet to make their contribution. Eurotunnel confirmed, meanwhile, that it does not expect to pay a dividend to shareholders until 2003. It also published forecasts of future revenues and operating costs. These show that over the next decade it will only just be able to service its total debt - including loans from public sector banks - of almost Pounds 8bn, if the latest refinancing is concluded. Even as late as 2003, net revenue is expected to be Pounds 1.3bn, from which Pounds 376m of operating costs has to be deducted and more than Pounds 600m of estimated interest costs - leaving a margin of just Pounds 300m, from which to repay principal on the debt and pay the promised dividend. Because of the slim margin of forecast revenues over debt costs, bankers said the company's directors have been given little autonomy over financial decisions in the lending agreements. 'We have the company where it hurts,' said a principal bank creditor. The rights issue cannot take place until bankers have provided the new senior debt. 'Missing the deadline (for raising the bank loans) is not yet a cause for panic,' a banker said. 'I remain hopeful that we will raise the money by the end of the week.' Japanese bankers, who have provided 23 per cent of the company's commercial bank debt, said they had not yet decided on new finance. But one said: 'We feel that it's a European project and that European banks should play a proper role.' European bankers said they continued to hope the new loans would be provided by existing members of the 200-bank syndicate, who have provided Pounds 6.8bn of finance to date. Eurotunnel said yesterday it was continuing to assess how much debt and equity it needed to raise to provide an 'appropriate margin' over its 'central case projection of funding needs'. Bankers said this was a coded statement implying that the board had decided it needed to raise significantly more equity than originally planned. Eurotunnel, which yesterday received safety clearance to run freight trains through the tunnel, is to run limited freight shuttle services from Thursday.

			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH CAROLINA'S OLD GEORGETOWN HARBORS SOME INTERESTING SECRETS  </P> <P> As much as any town can today, the historic colonial port of Georgetown has the  look of the Old South, and like much of the South it is rife with ghosts. I  think I may have a crush on one of them. That's really how I happened to find  Georgetown in the first place.  </P> <P> Scattered down the East Coast are several charming old towns that thrived  briefly as cosmopolitan centers, and then faded into the pages of history.  </P> <P> I think of the shipping port of Salem in Massachusetts, which eventually  declined as Boston grew, and nearby Annapolis, the Maryland capital that slept  while Baltimore prospered.  </P> <P> By chance, I stumbled this spring across yet another one, Georgetown.  </P> <P> Once reputedly the world's rice-exporting capital, it now is a quiet but  appealing backwater that was long ago overshadowed by Charleston to the south.  </P> <P> Like Salem and Annapolis, however, it has preserved many of the gorgeous old  homes built by wealthy families in the town's heyday before the Civil War.  </P> <P> Georgetown is about midway on the 100-mile drive down the South Carolina coast  from Myrtle Beach to Charleston.  </P> <P> I had never heard of the town before my Carolina trip this spring, and I  remained unaware of its colonial significance until I got there. I might have  hurried right through, except for Aaron Burr's daughter.  </P> <P> I have read a couple of fairly recent biographies of Burr, the urbane but  notorious U.S. vice president who fatally wounded Alexander Hamilton in a  famous duel.  </P> <P> One of the saddest periods in Burr's always-dramatic life was the tragic death  of his intelligent and beautiful daughter Theodosia, wife of the governor of  South Carolina, Joseph Alston.  </P> <P> Planning to visit her father in New York City, Theodosia boarded a ship leaving  South Carolina on Dec. 31, 1812. The ship vanished without a trace, an unsolved  mystery. Perhaps pirates attacked -- one of the legends surrounding Theodosia  -- or it was sunk by a fierce gale known to have hit the coast.  </P> <P> For some unexplainable reason, Theodosia and the story of her untimely death  intrigued me. I am usually forgetful of names, but I retain hers. Can I have  formed a romantic crush across the centuries? Perhaps.  </P> <P> She was one of the most admired women of her day. So it was with astonishment  and great delight that I read her name on a historical marker a few miles  outside Georgetown.  </P> <P> I am a sucker for these roadside snippets from the past, and more often than  not I'm rewarded with an interesting historic anecdote.  </P> <P> The sign informed me that Theodosia and her husband had lived in the Georgetown  area. Their home site is now a part of Brookgreen Gardens, a large sculpture  garden, just north of town, that's filled with an inviting mix of classically  heroic and charmingly whimsical pieces.  </P> <P> Indeed, Georgetown is the port from which Theodosia departed to meet her death.  A huge 18th-Century mansion, the Man-Doyle House, still stands on Front Street,  where she is said to have danced the night before the fatal trip.  </P> <P> I decided I had to stop here for a while, drawn by my odd fascination with  Theodosia. It is by such unexpected paths that travel discoveries are made.  </P> <P> I gave myself an hour's time, but my visit stretched for another as  Georgetown's attractions revealed themselves. A weekend would have been more  satisfying.  </P> <P> Several bed and breakfast inns offer lodgings in or near the impressive  Georgetown Historic District, which covers several blocks.  </P> <P> Shaded by a canopy of moss-draped oaks, Georgetown sits at the confluence of  four rivers forming Winyah Bay. It might have been America's oldest European  community, but the Spanish who settled in 1526 were quickly driven out by  Indians and disease. The heritage, instead, is British, dating from 1729.  </P> <P> More than 50 homes, buildings and sites from the 1700s still remain in the  historic district. Information about escorted or self-directed walking tours is  available at the local chamber of commerce.  </P> <P> The Harold Kaminski House, built about 1760, is a museum filled with antiques  reflecting Georgetown's link to the sea.  </P> <P> Rice is no longer a commercial crop in South Carolina's coastal low country,  but Georgetown today boasts a large and active shrimp-fishing fleet, which adds  a definite bustle to its attractive waterfront setting.  </P> <P> The town's colorful history is full of ghostly legends -- actually, Georgetown  County enjoys some fame as the most haunted place in the South -- and the  shrimping fleet has its own bag of superstitions.  </P> <P> About 20 shrimp trawlers operate from the Georgetown wharf, all of them  sporting tall masts. The top of each mast, I noticed, is painted white.  </P> <P> A curious coincidence? I wondered. Not a coincidence at all, but rather  something of a safety feature, I was told by Bill Oberst, a young history buff  in the Georgetown Chamber of Commerce. His family dates back to the town's  colonial origins.  </P> <P> The local lore maintains, according to Oberst, that if a shrimping vessel  starts to sink, the white mast provides an appropriately clean spot "where the  hand of God can grab hold and pull the boat back up to safety."  </P> <P> This city's local legends are brought to life in an annual summer theater  production called "Ghosts of the Coast."  </P> <P> In my short stay, I strolled along Harbor Walk, a boardwalk that stretches for  a couple of blocks along the waterfront, where you can dine pleasantly on fresh  shrimp.  </P> <P> And I stepped inside the small but very interesting Rice Museum on Front  Street, which tells the story of Georgetown's once-flourishing rice culture.  </P> <P> Before the Civil War, the region supported more than 150 plantations, including  one owned by Theodosia and her husband. But the end of slavery made cultivation  impractical.  </P> <P> Machines were developed that might have replaced slave labor, but they sank  deep in the swampy soil of the low country.  </P> <P> Just outside Georgetown, a number of the old rice plantations have been  restored as private homes.  </P> <P> Although these fine old mansions are not open to the public, daily river boat  tours sail past them on the same murky river ways that served the plantations  as commercial highways two centuries ago. Watch for alligators on one narrow  stretch of the route called "Alligator Alley."  </P> <P> My two hours passed too quickly, as I sniffed the sea air and walked along  elegant old streets exploring another chapter in America's rich history.  </P> <P> Oberst said he can stand under an old oak tree and feel things from the town's  long past. I don't doubt him at all.  </P> <P> Standing on Front Street before the Man-Doyle House, I easily imagined that I  saw fair Theodosia in the second-floor ballroom enjoying a final dance before  her fateful voyage.  </P> <P> For more information on travel to Georgetown, contact the Georgetown County  Chamber of Commerce, P.O.

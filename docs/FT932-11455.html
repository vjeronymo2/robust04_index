			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / International Company News: Kleinwort looks outside for new chief executive KLEINWORT Benson, the merchant banking group, is to look outside for a new chief executive to replace Mr Jonathan Agnew. Mr Agnew is leaving this summer by agreement with Kleinwort's new chairman, Lord Rockley. The company yesterday declined to comment on Mr Agnew's departure. However, it is thought to have been agreed with Lord Rockley following his dec-ision that the group needs a fresh strategy to take it forward. Mr Agnew has been chief executive of Kleinwort Benson for the past five years, and has overseen its attempt to build securities operations on top of its traditional banking business following the Big Bang City deregulation. Lord Rockley is thought to have decided to look outside the group for a chief executive, although the deputy chairman, Mr Simon Robertson, is expected to be given a strong role in establishing a long-term strategy for the group. No announcement of the change has yet been made to the group's staff, although they are expected to be informed officially of Mr Agnew's departure today. The group is keen to dispel any suggestion of him being forced out. Mr David Peake, its former chairman, retired at the group's annual meeting last week, and handed responsibility to Lord Rockley. He said at the group's preliminary results that he had been thinking about retiring 'for some months'. Kleinwort's pre-tax profits recovered last year, after a drop in bad debt provisions from Pounds 39m to Pounds 7m, by 66 per cent to Pounds 46.3m. Attributable profits rose by 10 per cent to Pounds 21.3m. Although the group has developed under Mr Agnew, it now lags well behind SG Warburg in market value. Lord Rockley is thought to want to find ways of integrating the various operations more effectively in future. The group, which made a loss in 1990, is 6.6 per cent owned by American International Group, the US insurance company, while Banque Nationale de Paris holds 4.7 per cent.</p>

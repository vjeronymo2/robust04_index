			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Henri Paillard: "UDF Group Threatened with </F> Division"]    [Excerpt] The UDF [French Democratic Union] caucus in the  National Assembly is probably on the point of collapsing. The  27 deputies from the PR [Republican Party] who, on the morning  of Tuesday, 14 June, announced the creation of an independent  parliamentary group and who had postponed the implementation of  their decision after being "bawled out" by [Industry Minister]  Gerard Longuet, stand by their intentions. Following the PR  National Council meeting scheduled for 26 June, a good 60 could  well split off. They would thus break up a group of 213  deputies laboriously set up just after the parliamentary  elections.    In this affair, individual interests, personal ambitions,  animosity, lies, and threats form a framework in which it is  sometimes difficult to see clearly...especially because the  tactics and strategy are highly "microcosmic" and escape the  understanding of the so-called grass-roots voter.    While PR President Gerard Longuet, who is also one of Mr.  Balladur's ministers, is urging his friends to stay in the  existing single group, [Defense Minister] Francois Leotard, the  same party's honorary president and a member of the same  Balladur government, says he wants an independent PR group.

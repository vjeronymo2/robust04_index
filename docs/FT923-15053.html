			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Observer: Gnomes' homes The Insider pub just off Zurich's Paradeplatz is about to see its last gathering of gnomes. This weekend the city's Bourse, Switzerland's pre-eminent stock exchange, is moving to new premises a few hundred yards away from the building it has occupied since 1930, which has the pub on its ground floor. But the gnomes' joy at escaping their cramped old quarters will be mixed with bitterness about the long battle they've had to achieve the move. The exchange's first application for a new-building permit was sent to the city authority the whole of 14 years ago. Worse, with change to electronic trading due within a year or so, the spacious new trading floor will soon be redundant. And, to top it off, the cantonal government that owns the building forbids tenants to fit air conditioning in their offices. Enter the summer of the steaming gnomes.</p>

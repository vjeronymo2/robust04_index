			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Leading Article: Last days of the Raj THE END of the Raj in India is now at hand. That day did not come with independence in 1947, which was more of a coup d'etat than a revolution. The departure of the British simply allowed the new Indian elite to assume the powers and perquisites of the empire. The Nehru dynasty ruled where once the British viceroy held sway. But the empire is tottering. The principal question in the forthcoming elections is not who will be in and who out among the cast of politicians. It is rather whether the replacement for the Raj is to be a decentralised and economically liberal India or a politically fragmented and impoverished one. The British bequeathed to their successors not merely the machinery of a strong state - a professional army, an independent judiciary and an uncorrupt bureaucracy - but a panoply of western ideas. The Congress party - secular, socialist and democratic - seized upon the powers it inherited to put its acquired ideas into practice. The term elective dictatorship could never be more appropriately applied than to Nehru's India. It was his intention to weld Soviet planning on to the administrative fabric of the British Raj. Periodic plebiscites could not remedy the evils of excessive centralisation of political, administrative and economic power, however much they may have ameliorated its effects. Economic centralisation choked India's economic development; all-Indian nationalism suffocated the local nationalisms of a heterogeneous sub-continent containing almost as many people as Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America combined; and the ambitions of her rulers, notably those of Mrs Indira Gandhi, strangled the autonomy of India's inherited institutions. Over-centralised state An over-centralised secular state has now produced its antithesis: regional separatism, Hindu revivalism, political fragmentation and economic disarray. With its principal institutions - the bureaucracy and the judiciary - demoralised and corrupted, its ingrained reflexes towards fiscal prudence and monetary caution enfeebled and its legitimacy corroded, the Raj is now nearing collapse. Two of the principal protagonists in the election offer a part of the solution: Mr Rajiv Gandhi, by his commitment to economic liberalisation, and Mr Chandra Shekhar, by his commitment to political decentralisation. Unfortunately, the former is too much the scion of Nehru's centralism and the latter too much the heir of Nehru's socialism. Neither will provide all of what is needed. Job reservation Meanwhile, Mr V P Singh's commitment to job reservation for the so-called poor and backward castes, irrespective of individual merit, is a recipe for administrative disorder and civil strife. Similarly, Hindu revivalism cannot be the basis of a peaceful state that contains millions of non-Hindus. The sterility of its politicians is India's tragedy. If they continue to view politics as about little more than carving up the spoils, they may soon have no spoils left to carve. A foreign empire could be relatively centralised. To increase that centralisation still further, as Mr Nehru then proceeded to do, was a grave error. To remain democratic, a country as vast as India must become a loose federation. Economic liberalism is equally important. This is not merely because the economy would then work better (though it would); nor because the incentive to corrupt the bureaucracy would decline (though it would). Economic liberalism is itself a form of decentralisation. But it is also one that would allow the combination of economic integration with local political autonomy. The alternative to decentralisation and liberalisation will not be the preservation of India as it is today. It is more likely to be India's disintegration. That is precisely what is happening to the Soviet Union, where - as in India - an inherited empire is falling apart. But as a democracy, India has the institutional framework for peaceful change. The challenge to India's politicians is to use that advantage before they lose it.</p>

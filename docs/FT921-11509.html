			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Emap to launch French magazine EMAP, the publishing and exhibitions group, is planning to launch its first wholly owned magazine in the French market in March. Responses Photo, a monthly photographic magazine with a planned print run of 150,000, will be the French equivalent of Photo Answers, Emap's successful UK magazine. The launch could be the first of several in France aimed at the specialist, youth and music sectors of the market. Mr Robin Miller, Emap chief executive, believes there is considerable potential for specialist magazines in France. Emap has expanded on the back of a range of specialist magazines encompassing fishing to motor cycle enthusiasts. Until now Emap's moves into France have been through joint ventures with French publishers. In 1990 the company took over Le Chasseur Francais, the French countryside and hunting magazine, in a joint venture with Bayard Press. The British company also publishes Consule Plus, a French computer games magazine with Les Editions Mondiale. Meanwhile, Emap is one of the publishers bidding for the business magazine and exhibitions divisions of the collapsed Maxwell empire. In the six months to September, Emap's pre-tax profits fell 28 per cent to Pounds 9.86m. However, operating profits of its consumer magazines increased.</p>

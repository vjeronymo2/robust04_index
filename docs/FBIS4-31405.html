			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 9 Jun--The Sejm today adopted a resolution  urging the government to restrict the so-called negative list,  concerning the export of weapons and military equipment, to  countries covered by the UN embargo. The issue was discussed at  the previous Sejm session, but no decision was made then due to  the lack of a quorum.    The negative list is secret and includes countries to which  the sale of weapons by the Polish arms industry has been banned.</p>

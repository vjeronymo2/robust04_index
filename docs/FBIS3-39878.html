			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The European Investment Bank (EIB), the long-term  financing institution of the European Union, yesterday signed  the documents in Athens for its first Greek Drachma bond issue  for 10 billion drachmas (about $40 million).    EIB announced yesterday that the drachma issue is "timed to  coincide with the move of the Greek capital market toward full  liberalisation."    This is the first ever Greek-drachma denominated bond issued  by a non-resident issuer, as well as the first-term debt drachma  security carrying a fixed interest rate. The bond, underwritten  by some 20 Greek and foreign banks, is co-financed by Hellenic  Industrial Development Bank (ETVA). Underwriting banks include  ABN-AMRO, Paribas, Barclays, Bayerische, BNP, Citibank,  Dresdner, Natwest, and Midland.    The issue is for a five-year term, due on 8 March 1999, and  carries a coupon of 17.5 percent. Bonds will be issued in  bearer form in denominations of one million, five million, 10  million and 50 million drachmas. Applications will be made to  list the titles on the Athens and Luxembourg stock exchanges.    Luxembourg-based EIB notes that it will henceforth "be  better  placed to continue developing its lending in Greece, by matching  closer the funding needs of Greek project promoters."</p>

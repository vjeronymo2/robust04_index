			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Comparison of local taxation plans shows rich areas losing VOTERS IN Bath, where Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, will defend a slim 1,412 majority at the general election, would be among the biggest losers under the government's proposed council tax. According to the most detailed independent survey so far of the three parties' local-taxation plans - published today  - if the council tax were introduced this year adults in Bath would pay an extra Pounds 86. That would be the biggest increase in England. The study of the council tax, Labour's fair rates and the Liberal Democrats' local income tax finds that each system results in wide variations in average local tax bills for each adult at both regional and local-authority levels. Under the council tax, to be introduced next year if the Conservatives retain power, the areas with high property values would tend to lose while those with low values would gain. But the size of the swings would not be as great as that under Labour's fair rates or a local income tax. By far the biggest losers under the proposals from the opposition parties would be relatively wealthy areas. The northern region of England, for example, would be the biggest winner from Labour's plans, with each adult paying on average Pounds 82 less than under the poll tax. Adults in Barrow-in-Furness would have to pay Pounds 183 less. These gains would be made at the expense of Greater London and the south-east where average bills would rise by Pounds 60 and Pounds 54 respectively. Each adult in south Buckinghamshire, for example, would have to pay Pounds 178 more. The local income tax proposed by the Liberal Democrats would produce the lowest bills of the three options in metropolitan districts and inner London boroughs, but would add most to bills in the south-east. The study, produced for the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants, is the first to estimate local tax levels for each adult in England under the various options, and it includes the Pounds 140 universal cut in bills announced in March last year. It is based on published proposals for local taxation by the three main parties, this year's grant allocation and government estimates of the distribution of houses according to eight tax bands. Mr Peter Smith of the University of York, the author of the report, says that the contrast between the systems highlights the difficulty of balancing equity against efficiency in local-government finance. 'There is in principle no reason why the two objectives . . . cannot be addressed in such a system of local-government finance,' he says. 'However, none of the systems currently proposed satisfactorily reconciles the dichotomy.' The report urges the setting up of a Royal Commission. In Place of the Poll Tax.

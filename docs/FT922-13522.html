			<p>920411 FT  11 APR 92 / Refugees flee under fire from Bosnian town MOSLEM and Serb refugees streamed across the River Drina into Serbia yesterday from the embattled frontier town of Zvornik in northeast Bosnia, as it again came under Serb mortar and artillery fire. Serb irregular forces moved to wipe out pockets of Moslem resistance in the town, after earlier Serbian reports that Zvornik had been 'liberated'.

Among the refugees hurrying from Zvornik across the bridge into the Serbian town of Mali Zvornik, was Amela, a Moslem with two children in tow, who clutched the few possessions she could carry. 'Serb fighters took our car,' she said. 'My uncle was killed while peering out the window. If we can ever return, who knows what will be left after the looting and destruction.' There were reports in Belgrade, the Serbian and federal capital, of people being called up for military service, signalling that the army might intervene. It warned on Thursday night that it would take action. General Bozidar Stevanovic, federal air force chief, told Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem president of Bosnia: 'We will take full combat measures against objects and formations. . . if stolen military equipment is not returned and armed attacks on units and facilities do not cease.'</p>

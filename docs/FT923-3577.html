			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Arts: While The Sun Shines THERE is no recession in Birmingham, or at least not if you judge by the splendidly refurbished Old Rep Theatre. True, Wednesday was a gala evening, yet here was an occasion where one felt embarrassed not to be in a dinner jacket. Ladies wore diamonds, officers wore uniform. By contrast, London looks drab. The play was appropriate, too: a revival of Terence Rattigan's While The Sun Shines. The piece ran for over 1,000 performances in the West End starting on Christmas Eve 1943, and starring such names as Michael Wilding, Ronald Squire and Brenda Bruce. It has not been much seen since. Rattigan called it a light comedy, which is what it is, bordering on farce. It lacks the pathos and excitement of another of his wartime plays, Flare Path, which was revived at the King's Head in Islington a couple of years ago. It now seems over-long and a trifle slight, but it is wonderful to have the chance to catch up with it. Practically all the characters are titled, whether by hereditary peerage, military rank or both, for this is the war where the aristocracy does its bit but is not always promoted. The Earl of Harpenden cannot rise above the rank of a lowly naval rating because he cannot satisfy the Admiralty that he knows how many tuppenny- ha'penny stamps can be bought for half-a-crown. Still, he lives in the Albany off Piccadilly, where his family has had chambers for over a century, and has a man-servant loosely modelled on Jeeves. There is an American airman and a French lieutenant, both of whom fall for the same girl, daughter of the Duke of Ayr and Stirling, who is already betrothed to Harpenden. Then there is Mabel Crum, the woman who is universally generous with her favours and remains a thoroughly good sort throughout. The mood is nostalgic. 'Run Rabbit Run' and 'It's a Long Way to Tipperary' are played on the piano before the start and the audience wants to sing along. The theatre is dotted with ARP wardens warning what to do if there is an air raid. Wartime posters are spread around the foyer. In the play itself, the main action is the competition for the girl, Lady Elizabeth Randall, by the American and the Frenchman. Harpenden, as a true reserved Englishman, does not fight as hard as he might. Anyway, there is always Mabel Crum in the background to fall back on. Those were the days when Pounds 2m, Harpenden's income from his London properties, translated into Dollars 8m. On his country estates, of course, he always made a loss. The humour is pretty straightforward: jokes about the American being astonished to meet an English earl and the socialist Frenchman believing the English aristocracy is doomed. Harpenden curiously takes The New Statesman and expects to lose his wealth to 'Mr Chancellor' when the war is over. It is all very good-natured. As the title suggests, there might be worse things to happen to English life than war. The pleasure of such an innocent play is in the performances and the craftmanship. Neal Foster, who has founded the new Birmingham Stage Company, plays Harpenden with much more versatility than one has any right to expect from a straight male lead. Lucy Scott as Lady Elizabeth looks as attractive as she possibly can be in military uniform. Tastes change. In 1992 I think it might have been funnier if the Duke of Ayr and Stirling (Ernest Clark) had not spoken French in such a parody of an English accent and if the French lieutenant (Michael Goron) had been allowed more natural Gallic charm and looked less like a frog. Yet the Birmingham audience loved it just the way it was. Direction is by Granville Saxton and the new company will play at the Old Rep for 20 weeks a year. If the city can support it, this is a marvellous development. At the Old Rep, Birmingham, (021) 236 2392, until October 3</p>

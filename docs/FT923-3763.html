			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Burnfield in the black with Pounds 1.1m Burnfield, the industrial controls and measurement equipment group, turned in a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.1m for the first half of 1992. That compared with a loss of Pounds 281,000 after exceptional charges of Pounds 795,000 in 1991. Despite the continuing recession, directors expected an increasing level of profitability in the second half. That was partly the result of normal seasonal patterns and partly benefit from reorganisation at Budenberg, a maker of pressure gauges and calibration equipment. There would also be a first-time contribution from Malvern Instruments, a manufacturer of laser-based particle characterisation equipment which was purchased after the half year. Turnover in the first half rose to Pounds 11.4m (Pounds 8.16m). Earnings per share were 3.9p (losses 1.3p) and the interim dividend is again 1.65p, but on increased capital.</p>

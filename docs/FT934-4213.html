			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: Old to pay more - Private medical insurance / The Budget and You Private medical insurance will become more expensive for the elderly. Private medical insurance premiums will be subject to the new 3 per cent levy from October 1 1994 and tax relief will be limited to 25 per cent from April 6 1994. The over-60s enjoy tax relief at their highest marginal rate as a way of making private medical insurance more affordable for those leaving a company's private scheme because of retirement. Martin Werth at Munich Re, the reinsurance company, said he expected tax relief to fall to 15 per cent eventually, in line with other tax relief cuts, such as mortgage interest relief. But the government is simplifying rules for insurers so that a PMI contract will no longer have to be certified by the Inland Revenue before becoming eligible for tax relief. Some married couples will benefit from one change. Under current rules, relief can be given where a contract covers a married couple, so long as one partner is aged 60 or over. But if one partner dies and the other is younger than 60, he or she does not receive relief for further premium payments into the contract. The new rules will allow the surviving spouse to obtain relief for the remainder of the contract and will apply to payments on or after April 6 1994. The chancellor has made a change which will affect adversely those with permanent health insurance - the type designed to provide a replacement income when someone becomes too ill to work for an extended period. Someone taking benefits from a PHI scheme can find that they are able to claim income tax relief on the benefits for up to two years depending on the date they first received the benefits. If, for example, they took benefits near the beginning of a tax year they would enjoy the income tax exemption for the rest of that year and the next year. However, the exemption is limited to 12 months. The change will take effect from April 6 1994.</p>

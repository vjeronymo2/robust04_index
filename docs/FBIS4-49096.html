			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Yeung] </F>   [Text] A government report has warned that the central  authorities may have to use drastic measures to curb runaway  inflation if economic overheating is not stopped.    The report, on the economic outlook for the rest of the  year,  warned if strong retrenchment measures were adopted, the  country's momentum of growth would be thrown into chaos, leading  to an economic "hard landing".    The Spring Quarterly Report was jointly compiled by  economists at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the  State Statistics Bureau.    Under one scenario, it predicted some economic  contradictions  would remain unresolved. It said the Government would have to  relax macrocontrol in the face of growing opposition from  regions and enterprises. This would lead to a "hasty rebound"  of the economy and the revival of inflation, it said. "Based on  the situation in the past few months, the danger remains," the  report said.    It stressed the need to seek a balance between economic  growth and inflation. "We have to accept that a considerable  level of price rises is inevitable in the course of full-fledged  reform. It is the price we have to pay. But on the other hand,  we have to be on constant alert to keep the level of price  increases to one that the public can bear. This will be  conducive to creating conditions for reform and a relatively  rapid pace of economic growth," the report said.    It said "opportunity and risk" would co-exist for the rest  of  1994, stressing that failure to control investment and  money-supply would be damaging.    The report said the fiscal system would remain stable if the  issue of new currency was controlled within 160 billion yuan  (HK$142 billion [Hong Kong dollars]) and new loans did not  exceed 550 billion yuan.    Fixed-asset investments would not get out of control if  money  supply targets were met.    "Even if we were able to have one or two more percentage  points of economic growth, there would be negative impact if  inflation surges to 20 percent. Ultimately, the economy will  drop into a nadir. The process of economic reform will be  severely jeopardised," it said.    China's economy would stay on a "positive cycle" if annual  economic growth reached 10 percent, investment growth dropped to  20 percent and inflation was contained about 10 percent.</p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PLUMBER STARTS RECORD LABEL TO SHAKE THINGS UP;  </P> <P> MUSIC: A CHULA VISTA MAN HAS FOUND A LABOR OF LOVE -- PRODUCING SONGS BY  ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT GROUPS.  </P> <P> Bob Barley is probably the only plumber in the world who also happens to run  his own record company.  </P> <P> In the past three years, Barley's Vinyl Communications label, with headquarters  in Chula Vista, has released 15 records by eight so-called alternative bands  from San Diego, San Francisco, New York, Florida and Hawaii.  </P> <P> Despite international distribution and airplay, Vinyl Communications is hardly  in the same league as CBS or Warner Bros. It's a labor of love, Barley said --  which is why he's still fixing leaky toilets and plugged-up sinks for a living.  </P> <P> "There's no money in it. We're part of a real underground network that's got  nothing to do with the real business end of the music industry; these are all  fans and people who like a different style of music than the commercial  mainstream."  </P> <P> Indeed. Vinyl Communications focuses on cacophonous punk-metal bands with  socially conscious, decidedly anti-Establishment lyrics.  </P> <P> "You won't hear any sappy love songs on this label," said Barley, 25. "It's a  reflection of my personal tastes, my personal thoughts about what music should  be.  </P> <P> "Music is a very powerful medium, and you can either put people to sleep or  shake them up a little bit. Pop music, and pop culture in general, is geared  very much toward people sitting back and consuming and not taking part in  anything.  </P> <P> "What our bands are trying to do, on the other hand, is get people to think,  get them to interact, and expand their minds beyond what they learn in  state-run schools, which are basically training grounds for people to get  low-paying jobs and make somebody else rich."  </P> <P> Vinyl Communications was founded in October, 1986, when Barley decided to take  his own band, Neighborhood Watch, into the studio to cut a three-song,  seven-inch extended-play (EP) record.  </P> <P> "We thought we had something to say, and rather than trying to play the  music-industry game, which we wouldn't have fit into anyway, we just went ahead  and released it ourselves."  </P> <P> The EP was distributed to local record stores and marketed, worldwide, through  mail-order ads in underground fanzines. The initial press run of 1,600 quickly  sold out, and Barley began toying with the idea of releasing records by other  bands as well.  </P> <P> The first was A.P.P.L.E., from New York.  </P> <P> "I read an interview with them in a magazine called Maximum Rock 'n' Roll, and  I really liked what they had to say," Barley said. "They were very political  and very up front about it.  </P> <P> "I wrote to them and sent them one of our records, and they wrote me back,  saying they were very interested in doing vinyl, but couldn't afford it.  </P> <P> "I told them that if our record sold well enough so that we got our money back,  we'd consider putting out their record also."  </P> <P> In April, 1987, A.P.P.L.E. made its recording debut on Vinyl Communications  with "A Sensitive Fascist Is Very Rare," a four-song EP with a picture of  Ronald Reagan on the cover.  </P> <P> "The record sold more than 4,000 copies, primarily through mail-order, and  that's what got the whole setup going," Barley said.  </P> <P> "At that point, we realized, 'Hey, we can do this,' so we decided to turn Vinyl  Communications into a full-fledged label. Our plans were to get music out that  the mainstream labels or even the bigger independents wouldn't touch, just  because of its political content or its lack of musical accessibility."  </P> <P> Since then, Vinyl Communications has grown, slowly but surely.  </P> <P> The label has subsequently released a dozen more records, including EPs by  Amenity, from Chula Vista, and Cringer, from Hawaii, and full-length albums by  Neighborhood Watch, A.P.P.L.E., and San Francisco's Brain Rust.  </P> <P> Master tapes are either submitted by the bands or produced in-house at Vinyl  Communications' Chula Vista recording studio. Records are pressed by Bill Smith  Custom Records in El Segundo and marketed internationally via mail-order ads in  fanzines and a growing network of independent record distributors.  </P> <P> "We usually press between 1,000 and 2,000 copies of each release," Barley said.  "And we generally sell out, particularly since we signed a new distribution  deal four months ago with Mordam Records of San Francisco.  </P> <P> "They deal directly with about 100 record stores all over the world, and they  also service something like 70 other distributors. They're currently getting,  and selling, the lion's share of our records."  </P> <P> Barley said the demand for Vinyl Communications product is growing primarily  because of regular airplay on alternative and college radio stations throughout  the United States as well as on Britain's BBC, France's Radio Gironde,  Germany's Radio Berlin (with an estimated 4 million listeners), Canada's CITR  and CJIV, and Mexico's Estereo Frontero.  </P> <P> "The label has built up a fair reputation for having quality releases," Barley  said. "Our records have gotten favorable reviews in magazines and fanzines all  over the world; I just saw one from a fanzine in Switzerland in which the  reviewer called our label one of the best in the U.S.  </P> <P> "That's how we get airplay, and that's how we sell records."  </P> <P> Still, it's a constant financial struggle. The primary reason Barley rejects  most of the five to 10 demonstration tapes he receives each month, he said,  isn't because he doesn't like them, but because he's temporarily low on funds.  </P> <P> "We recently got a great tape from a band from Finland," he said, "but  financial difficulties prevented us from releasing it, and they ended up  putting it out themselves.  </P> <P> "I'd love to put out more stuff, but it's hard coming up with the money. At  best, it's a break-even situation, and whatever money we make goes right back  into the business.  </P> <P> "Eventually, I'd like to see us generate enough income to become  self-sustaining, continue to grow and release more product, and maybe start  paying the bands and some of the people who work with the label.  </P> <P> "After all, you can't eat good reviews."  </P></p>

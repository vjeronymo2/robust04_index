			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow 7 May TASS -- A statement of the Russian  Foreign Ministry on the Tajik-Afghan border situation was  circulated here today.    The statement runs as follows:    "The Russian Federation together with Commonwealth  member-states is taking political steps to stabilize the  situation on the Tajik-Afghan border and throughout Tajikistan,  including the assistance to the inter-Tajik dialogue held under  the U.N. aegis.    "At the same time, some forces are not interested in  peaceful  settlement of Tajik problems. Heads of several irreconcilable  opposition groups from the Tajik Islamic Revival Movement are  getting ready to launch the so-called spring-summer `offensive'  to begin with armed provocations on the Tajik-Afghan border in  the immediate future.    "Bearing this in mind, the Russian Foreign Ministry  considers  it necessary to state that the planned armed provocations are  described by the Russian leadership as a threat to security of  both Tajikistan and Russia, as well as all member-states of the  Commonwealth.    "The Russian Foreign Ministry warns the Afghan authorities  and leaders of Tajik opposition groups against armed  provocations from Afghan territory that threaten security of  Tajikistan and collective security of Commonwealth member-states.    "The Russian Foreign Ministry states that the Russian  Federation together with other Commonwealth member-states will  do their best to prevent further aggravation of the Tajik-Afghan  border situation and take adequate measures in case of armed  provocations."</p>

			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Food's fine, fuel's unfortunate Sir, Gillian Tett's article on the developments in the Russian aviation industry (Business Travel, December 13) was both educational and humorous, particularly her descriptions of herb omelettes, champagne and roses. I think her readers will be less amused, though, to learn that the 161 new regional carriers in Russia use petrol to power their aircraft. My information is that kerosine (Jet-A1) is the most likely choice of fuel for safe and timely arrivals. M A Grazier, 158 Dora Road, Wimbledon, London SW19 7HJ</p>

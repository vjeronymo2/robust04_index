			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Santer backs EU expansion to east The next president of the European Commission, Mr Jacques Santer, said yesterday he hoped to see the emerging democracies of eastern Europe joining the European Union around the turn of the century, Reuter reports from Bonn and Brussels. He did not set a specific date for Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania to join the EU, but stressed in an interview with German radio that Europe must strive to expand eastward as fast as reasonably possible. His optimism about widening the EU eastwards contrasted sharply, however, with gloom about the Union's future at the Commission following the decision by the outgoing president, Mr Jacques Delors, not to run as the Socialist candidate in next year's presidential election in France. EU officials and diplomats reacted with surprise, regret and some anxiety on Monday to Mr Delors' decision. 'His decision could undo all he has done here,' said one EU official, referring to Mr Delors' 10-year effort as head of the Commission to further the cause of European integration. But Mr Santer insisted in Bonn: 'We will do everything to be able to lead these countries up to the European Community around the end of this century. Whether they can become full members by this date depends on developments. We must first get our house in order from an institutional perspective,' he added, referring to reforms the EU will consider at a conference in 1996. Mr Santer, current prime minister of Luxembourg, will succeed Mr Delors as head of the Commission next month. EU leaders meeting in Essen at the weekend backed plans to prepare the so-called associate countries for eventual membership, but without setting a timetable. A Commission official said Mr Delors' legacy stood the greatest risk of erosion if the Gaullist leader, Mr Jacques Chirac, became president in May on a nationalist platform, but even prime minister Edouard Balladur was unclear in his intentions on Europe. 'If anyone could have changed the political landscape of France, it was Delors,' said the same source. Mr Delors, it was believed, had underestimated the power he could wield in the Elysee palace. The source said a centre-right French government might not be that far from Mr Delors' views on Economic and Monetary Union (Emu) or defence co-operation. Mr Delors' achievements in creating the EU single market and building Emu would not unravel. But he added that Mr Delors' absence would be a handicap for those forces pushing for an overhaul of the Maastricht treaty's cumbersome inter-governmental rules in foreign, justice and home affairs policy-making. Unanimity is the rule for decisions in these areas, but France without Mr Delors may remain just as attached as Britain to preserving national sovereignty in these areas at the EU's 1996 inter-governmental conference.</p>

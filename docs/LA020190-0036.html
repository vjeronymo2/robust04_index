			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MICROWAVE: MOIST AND CREAMY OMELETS IN A FRACTION OF THE NORMAL COOKING TIME  </P> <P> Moist, creamy omelets can be made in the microwave. The best are those made  with two eggs (one serving) or four eggs (two servings). Larger omelets are  difficult to handle and won't cook evenly.  </P> <P> Here are a few other points to bear in mind if you're to succeed when  microwaving omelets:  </P> <P>  -- Don't salt plain omelets before you cook them because you'll toughen the  eggs. Salt is beaten into the whites for puffy omelets because it helps to  stabilize them and keep them from collapsing.  </P> <P>  -- For plain omelets, use glass ovenware or glass ceramic skillet of the exact  size called for.  </P> <P> To hide the microwave omelet's pale exterior, top with a colorful sauce.  Omelets don't brown in the microwave and browning dishes aren't practical for  the omelets because, among other reasons, they take too long to heat.  </P> <P> PLAIN, OR FRENCH, OMELET  </P> <P> 2 eggs, at room temperature  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon butter or margarine  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon salt, about  </P> <P> Dash white pepper  </P> <P> Beat eggs briskly with fork until frothy. Melt butter in wax-paper-covered,  microwave-safe 5 1/2-inch glass ovenware or glass ceramic skillet by  microwaving on HIGH (100% power) 25 to 30 seconds. Tilt skillet to coat bottom  evenly.  </P> <P> Pour beaten eggs into skillet and microwave, uncovered, on HIGH (100% power) 1  minute. With rubber spatula, draw partially set edges toward center and tilt  skillet so uncooked portions flow underneath.  </P> <P> Microwave on HIGH (100% power) 25 to 30 seconds until omelet is just set and  top is creamy. Season with salt and white pepper, loosen omelet with spatula,  fold over on itself and turn out onto warm plate. Makes 1 serving.  </P> <P> Note: Top with favorite cheese, tomato or mushroom sauce. To fill omelet, spoon  1/3 cup room-temperature minced cooked meat or sausage, boned and flaked fish  or shellfish, or sauteed mushrooms, onions or sweet peppers onto omelet just  before folding and turning out.  </P> <P> Variations:  </P> <P> Omelet For Two: Prepare as directed, using 4 eggs and 1 tablespoon butter in  8-inch skillet. Microwave 2 1/2 to 3 minutes as recipe directs, drawing edges  toward center every minute. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper  before filling and folding. Turntable will help this large omelet cook more  evenly. Makes 2 servings.  </P> <P> Fines Herbes Omelet: Add 1/2 teaspoon minced fresh chives, 1/4 teaspoon minced  fresh chervil and 1/8 teaspoon minced fresh tarragon (or dash of each dried  herb) to melted butter before adding 2 beaten eggs. Microwave as directed. For  4-egg omelet, double quantity of herbs.  </P> <P> Cheese Omelet: Prepare 4-egg omelet as directed. Fifteen seconds before cooking  is completed, sprinkle with 1/3 cup coarsely shredded sharp Cheddar or Gruyere  cheese and finish microwaving. Other cheese choices: 2 to 3 ounces soft ripened  cheese such as Boursin, Brie, chevre, mascarpone or semisoft cheese such as  crumbled feta, shredded Muenster or mozzarella.  </P> <P> The following fluffy five-minute miracle won't collapse when you cut into it. A  turntable will make the omelet rise more evenly.  </P> <P> SOUFFLE OMELET  </P> <P> 4 eggs, separated, at room temperature  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons cold water  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1/8 teaspoon white pepper  </P> <P> 1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon butter or margarine  </P> <P> Briskly beat egg yolks and water with fork and set aside. In separate bowl,  beat whites until frothy. Add salt, white pepper and cream of tartar and beat  to soft peaks. Fold gently into yolk mixture.  </P> <P> Melt butter in wax-paper covered, microwave-safe 1 1/2-quart-round casserole  (about 2 inches deep) by microwaving on HIGH (100% power) 25 to 30 seconds.  Tilt casserole to coat sides with butter.  </P> <P> Pour egg mixture into casserole, smooth top lightly and microwave, uncovered,  on MEDIUM (50% power) 4 to 4 1/2 minutes until puffed and just set, rotating  omelet 180 degrees at half time if not using turntable. Loosen omelet with  spatula, divide in half, using 2 forks, and ease onto warmed plates. Makes 2  servings.  </P> <P> Note: To fill omelet, before turning out, crease center of omelet with spatula,  top half with 1/3 cup room-temperature minced cooked meat or sausage, boned and  flaked fish or shellfish, or sauteed mushrooms, onions or sweet peppers. Fold,  lift from casserole and divide in 2. Because folded puffy omelets do not hold  much filling, alternate method is to spread turned-out omelet with filling,  then halve.  </P> <P> Note: In ovens of less than 600 watts, increase cooking times about 15%.  </P></p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: New York buyers lead coffee prices to fresh peaks New York traders took the lead in the coffee market yesterday, pushing the London Commodity Exchange September delivery position to a new 8 1/2 -year peak of Dollars 4,085 a tonne. But the more subdued London tone dominated towards the market close and in last minute trading the price dipped just below the Dollars 4,000 a tonne mark. By the end of trading the September contract was quoted at Dollars 3,990 a tonne - a rise of Dollars 92 - while all other positions up to next May remained above Dollars 4,000. New York prices were continuing firm in midday trading with the September arabica futures contract showing a rise of 18 cents to Dollars 2.65 a pound. Reports of large cash purchases by coffee roasting companies eager for stocks of beans drove the market yesterday. 'This market has reached the point of panic for most roasters and they have to be extremely aggressive about buying,' said Mr Bill O'Neill, soft commodities analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York. At the same time, traders were concerned about the timing of Brazil's coffee sales, which it has signalled to alleviate supply tightness. Brasilia suspended exports while it assesses the damage to next year's crop of frosts earlier this week and traders are uncertain when the release of stocks will be resumed. Mr O'Neill said the market might try to test the next resistance level at Dollars 2.76 a pound, which was last breached in 1986. 'After that it's into uncharted water with the 1976 high of Dollars 3.75 a pound to go for,' he said.</p>

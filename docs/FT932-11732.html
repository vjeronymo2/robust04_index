			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Surveyors chart the damage to offices THE BRUNT of the disruption from the Bishopsgate bomb was borne by overseas financial institutions, which occupied half the damaged office space, an assessment by chartered surveyors shows. The bomb damaged 1.6m sq ft of offices, three quarters of which were occupied by banks and financial advisers, the Herring Baker Harris report says. Professional services and insurance companies were also badly affected, accounting for 14 per cent and 8 per cent of damaged offices respectively. The explosion will reduce the vacancy rate in the City from 18.8 per cent to 17 per cent - it had reached unprecedented levels after surges in construction. The glut of empty City offices will be cut by up to 1m sq ft as a result of demand from displaced tenants and the withdrawal from the market of vacant space that was damaged. A third of the damaged offices were vacant. Another third is expected to be habitable within a month. More than a quarter of the buildings damaged by last year's IRA bomb were caught up in the latest blast, especially those around Camomile Street. Much of the affected area was re-developed in the late 1980s. A quarter of the damaged buildings are less than 12 years old.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   CITY AND THE BOMB: FT/MORI SURVEY OF SENIOR DIRECTORS AND PARTNERS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Before last week did  your organisation have a formal contingency plan for dealing with crises such as a terrorist bomb?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes                                          74 No                                           24  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Approximately what percentage of your workforce directly affected by the bombing was able to work?  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Monday  Tuesday  Wednesday  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 0 per cent                 13       15        15 1 per cent to    under 100 per cent      14        6         2 100 per cent               73       79        83  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- To overseas banks: How likely is your organisation to reduce the scales of its operations in London, because of the risk of further bombs?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Very likely                                      0 Fairly likely                                    0 Not very likely                                 17 Not at all likely                               83  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Which of the following security measures have your key City offices implemented/will now consider introducing?  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                   Will                                                         Have  consider  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Greater control of entry to building                     78        7 Installation of external security cameras                50       24 Install toughened glass                                  48       13 Redesign of office accommodation, such as    curtain/rubber window surrounds                       44       15 Secure the area immediately around your building         39        8 Moving key functions permanently to less    vulnerable locations                                  21       19 None of the above                                         9       46  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- How satisfied are you with the performance of the government in dealing with the problems caused by the IRA?

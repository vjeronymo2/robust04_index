			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Mitterrand promises to solve row on Europol The prospects for a pan-European police intelligence agency improved considerably at the weekend after France promised to resolve differences over Europol's scope and role during the next six months. President Francois Mitterrand stepped in to heal the rift by signing a commitment to reach agreement on setting up Europol by the next summit in Cannes in June. Mr Jacques Delors, the president of the European commission, said the French commitment was one of the most important advances of the weekend. Justice and home affairs ministers will have to find a 'balanced solution' for the structure of the system, blocked until now not only by France but also by Spain and the UK. France has insisted that national police officers attached to Europol must have standardised data pooled in the agency, and also more sensitive intelligence. Germany, backed by the other member states, wants to restrict access to sensitive data except where Europol and national liaison officers attached to it are directly involved. But Mr Charles Pasqua, the hardline French interior minister, is determined that Europol should remain firmly under national government control and has insisted that police force co-ordination should be a matter for inter-governmental co-operation rather than joint EU action. Mr Mitterrand's commitment delighted Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who believes Europol will help stem the rising toll of crime in Germany, in particular car theft, and will assuage anxieties about the smuggling of nuclear material from Russia. Mr Kohl left no room for doubt that the agency - to fight organised crime within the EU single market - was of the utmost importance. 'We want it now,' he said, banging the table at the summit's final press conference. 'It is absolutely urgent that we get the convention in place.' The summiteers agreed to include terrorism within Europol's scope, a move which will please Spain. The UK, which has opposed giving the European court jurisdiction to hear complaints about Europol conduct, hinted yesterday that its differences could be resolved by June.</p>

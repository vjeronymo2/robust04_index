			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: High-Point falls to Pounds 93,000 Pre-tax profits of High-Point, the specialist consultancy and project promotion company, fell from Pounds 166,000 to Pounds 93,000 in the six months to November 30. The outcome was achieved on turnover down from Pounds 26.1m to Pounds 22.6m, however, last year's figure included almost Pounds 5m from discontinued opera-tions. The interest charge was almost halved, from Pounds 1.03m to Pounds 589,000, principally, the directors said, because of the lower level of borrowings. Earnings per share emerged at 0.8p (3.1p). UK operations were still suffering the effects of what is, hopefully, the tail end of the recession, the company said, while the US had a dis-appointing half year, mainly due to lack of activity in certain of its east coast operations. Asia and the Pacific Rim was, however, achieving expectations regarding both growth and profitability, it added.</p>

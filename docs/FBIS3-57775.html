			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Netherlands Company Finances </F> Zhirinovskiy's Party"]    [Excerpt] Moscow/Amsterdam -- The Netherlands company  Global Money Management (GMM) is one of the largest financial  backers of the Russian neo-fascist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy.    The Amsterdam-based company is owned by the Muscovite A.V.  Nenachov (age 27) and has at least "paid a considerable part of  the campaign costs for the Russian parliamentary elections."  This was reported in the SEGODNYA [TODAY] newspaper.    The paper said that the "sub-criminal GMM," which launders  illegally earned money for Russians in the West, also bought a  place on the electoral list for Aleksej Soejev, Nenachov's  23-year-old adviser.    The journalist Michail Leontjev did not dare reveal his  sources out of fear of legal action, "or worse." For the same  reasons he did not want to dwell excessively on the evidence  which he says he has.  <H5>  One and One-Half Million </H5>   Zhirinovskyi's campaign cost approximately 1.5 million  guilders. The Russian media has speculated for months about who  paid the money. The Iraqi leader Saddam Husayn and the  ultraright German millionaire Gerhard Frey are also said to be  sponsors of the popular Russian nationalist. Other rumors tell  of the information services and the army.    Zhirinovskiy was the big winner in the elections. In the  run-up to the vote he bought a huge amount of broadcast time on  television to present his extreme views. He seeks the expansion  of the "Russian Empire" and wants to revive the KGB secret  service. Zhirinovskiy maintains that his campaign was paid for  by thousands of individual supporters.    In Moscow an answer machine explains in Russian and English  that the GMM company is closed. The Amsterdam office was closed  "for Christmas" so that it was not possible to obtain any  comments on the claims.    Previously the company has said that it has been active  since  1969, but the registration with the Amsterdam Chamber of  Commerce dates from 29 January of this year. The share capital  of the limited company, which is based in offices on the  Herengracht canal, stands at 200,000 guilders. Director  Nenachov is the only shareholder.  <H5>  `Zhirinovsky's Party Gives Criminals a Chance of Power' </H5>   Amsterdam/Moscow -- Nearly every day Global Money Management  (GMM) presents itself on Russian television as an international  investment company.    Director Nenachov says that his company -- which has placed  and paid up share capital of 42,000 guilders -- has invested  nearly 20 million guilders in Russia and that GMM has not taken  one cent out of Russia.    GMM's Netherlands head office is not registered with the STE  [Share Dealing Monitoring Foundation]. The STE's spokeswoman  said that the company probably does not operate on the  Netherlands market. "GMM cannot provide any security-related  services in the Netherlands, because it does not have a license  to do so," the spokeswoman said.  <H5>  Warning </H5>   However, the Dutch central bank (DNB)is acquainted with GMM.  In a recent letter to the company, the central bank referred it  to the rule that nonbanks are prohibited from taking savings  from the public. "GMM is not a bank or a financial institution  and therefore is not under the supervision of the central bank.  But as a Netherlands limited company they are obliged to  respect Netherlands law." The central bank said that at present  there was no question of GMM having committed an economic crime,  but the letter should be seen as a warning.    Financial circles revealed that ABN AMRO [General  Netherlands  Bank -- Amsterdam/Rotterdam Bank] in Amsterdam had been GMM's  company bank. The bank would only reveal that ABN AMRO has no  (further) relationship with GMM. It is not known which  financial institution is now GMM's company bank. [passage  omitted].</p>

The new batch surfaced in Camden, north London, and is twice  as strong as most heroin bought on the streets. Its discovery  comes amid growing concern about a rise in the quantity and  purity of heroin being sold around the country.    Last week, eight people died in Glasgow after using  unusually  pure forms of the drug. Nine have been killed in Bristol during  the past six months in similar circumstances, and seven died  last year in King's Cross, close to where the latest batch of  heroin was found.    The discovery was reported by Release, the drug advice  agency, which has been told by local counsellors that it is 64  percent pure--street heroin is usually 35-40 percent pure. "The  users have not got the tolerance for such high strength, and we  see the tragic consequences," said Simon Kirkham, group  spokesman.    Powerful drugs interfere with the part of the brain that  controls breathing. Death arises from congestion in the lungs.    Police are trying to trace the source of the London batch,  and said they were taking the threat it poses very seriously. It  was found only three days after the latest death in Glasgow.    Police in Glasgow have offered an amnesty to people active  in  the drug world in an attempt to find the rest of the lethal  batch, which they believe to be as much as 74 percent pure.    But drug counsellors and relatives of those who died in  Glasgow dispute the official view that high-grade heroin is to  blame. They insist that drug cocktails and overdoses may have  killed many of the addicts. Two years ago Glasgow was the scene  of 20 unexplained deaths which were blamed on high-quality  heroin.    The National Criminal Intelligence Unit believes danger  arises when inept or inexperienced drug dealers fail to mix  heroin properly. "Some young dealers may not be used to handling  the drug, which can be highly dangerous," a spokesman said.    In Bristol, laboratory tests last week showed that heroin  believed to have caused at least four of the nine abuser deaths  was 63 percent pure. Police fear the purity of the drug reflects  the large amount of heroin in the British market.    Inspector Peter Wills, of Avon police, said drug dealers  normally mixed the drug with similar looking substances such as  baking powder, talcum or dried baby milk to maximise profits.  "Whereas a street dealer would mix the drug with other  substances if there is a drought--thus increasing his own  profit--when there is a lot of heroin on the streets, they do  not need to," he said.    Heroin seizures have increased dramatically throughout the  country in the past year, particularly in Avon, Manchester,  London and inner-city areas. In Gloucestershire there was a 400  percent increase, while seizures went up by 600 percent in  Northumbria and 1,000 percent in Nottinghamshire.</p>

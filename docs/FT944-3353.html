			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Thai confidence vote averted Thailand's agriculture minister resigned yesterday, averting a no-confidence motion that could have shaken the government days after defection of the New Aspiration party in the ruling coalition. The opposition had planned to call a no-confidence motion today against the minister, Mr Niphon Promphan, and his former deputy, Mr Suthep Thueksuban, because of allegations that Mr Suthep had manipulated a land reform programme to favour rich landowners. Mr Niphon submitted his resignation to Mr Chuan Leekpai, prime minister, to take responsibility for the scandal threatening to taint the government and Mr Chuan's Democrat party. Mr Niphon and Mr Suthep, members of the Democrat party, insist they are innocent. Mr Suthep resigned as deputy agriculture minister last week, saying it would allow him to defend his actions without being accused of trying to cling to his position.</p>

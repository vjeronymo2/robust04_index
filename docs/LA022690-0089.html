			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STREET SMART: CAR TROUBLE ON THE FREEWAY? STAY OUT OF THE MEDIAN  </P> <P> Dear Street Smart:  </P> <P> I was wondering why there are no call boxes in the median of the freeways. I  see an awful lot of people stuck there.  </P> <P> Rita Williams  </P> <P> Rancho Santa Margarita  </P> <P> Aside from certain spots in East Beirut, the median strip on a Southern  California freeway is the most dangerous spot to be with a broken-down car. On  most Orange County freeways, there's hardly room for a bicycle to park, let  alone an automobile.  </P> <P> With that in mind, the California Department of Transportation has avoided  putting call boxes along the median strip, where they would be magnets for  motorists in trouble, said Albert Miranda, a Caltrans spokesman.  </P> <P> Miranda said officials encourage motorists with flat tires, engine problems or  other malfunctions to pull off to the nearest freeway exit or over to the  shoulder, where they generally have a better chance of staying out of harm's  way.  </P> <P> That's not always possible, of course. If the freeway is jam-packed when your  Buick starts belching black smoke, you may have no choice but to stop in the  median.  </P> <P> The first thing to do is avoid heart failure. Tell life to go pass in front of  someone else's eyes, then take steps to save your own hide. Miranda recommends  taking a tip from Caltrans road crews: Get to the front of the car so you can  use the vehicle as a shield from oncoming traffic; keep your eyes fixed on the  cars barreling toward you.  </P> <P> Those tactics are also recommended for folks forced to stop on a freeway  shoulder. Most of our local freeways, unlike members of the Los Angeles Rams,  don't have broad shoulders. In fact, some aren't much wider than a median  strip. The pressure to handle heavy traffic flow has resulted in crowding more  lanes onto a freeway right-of-way that rarely gets bigger.  </P> <P> Dear Street Smart:  </P> <P> In the Feb. 5 edition, you had a letter from a woman who had a battered license  plate that she wanted to have replaced but who had been told by the Department  of Motor Vehicles that new plates for existing numbers are not issued. All she  could do, they said, was get a new license number.  </P> <P> But she has another option -- getting the plate restored. She could try  Darryl's Plates, 4505 8th Ave. South, No. A-10, St. Petersburg, Fla., 33711. He  does a masterful job of restoring a plate for less than $25, including return  shipping.  </P> <P> I just had one of those old black and gold California plates done by him, and  it came back better than new.  </P> <P> As for the state requirement that plates be on both front and rear bumpers: A  front license plate is ugly on a nice car. It's a waste of taxpayers' money  besides.  </P> <P> Police will stop you if you have no front plate. I know. (I think they actually  want to see one's car close up if it is at all antique, modified or otherwise  out of the ordinary.)  </P> <P> Jerry Bernheimer  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P> <P> An interesting tip. There's a whole cottage industry of folks who specialize in  license plate repair and resale. Some people have made a business of salvaging  the old black California plates from junkyards, then restoring and reselling  them.  </P> <P> Using such restored plates is legal, according to Gina McGuiness, a spokeswoman  for the state Department of Motor Vehicles in Sacramento. The job must be done  properly, though. The plate cannot be cut down in size, and the original colors  must be used.  </P> <P> Dear Street Smart:  </P> <P> I'm a police officer with the UC Irvine police department. In your article  about minors in pickup truck beds (Feb. 19), you said that people under age 18  could not ride in a pickup bed.  </P> <P> I thought you might like to know that actually that's not quite correct. The  California Vehicle Code states that no one shall transport a minor under the  age of 12 in the back of a truck unless it is enclosed to a height of 46  inches. The code also says that if the children are secured so as to prevent  their being thrown, that makes it OK.  </P> <P> Scott Roberts  </P> <P> Irvine  </P> <P> Thanks for straightening that out. Street Smart's answers are only as good as  the information we get from officials with the California Highway Patrol, local  police departments, Caltrans and other agencies. In this case, a lieutenant at  the Highway Patrol's Santa Ana office supplied incorrect information about the  age limit for riders in pickup beds. Perhaps he'll start doing a better job of  reading his vehicle code handbook. And so will we.  </P></p>

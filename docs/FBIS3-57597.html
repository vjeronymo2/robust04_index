Although some experts here do not absolve Yegor Gaydar from  personal blame for the reformists' failure at the parliamentary  elections, both Gaydar and Fedorov have become to a large extent  symbolic figures for the West. Even their simple replacement by  reformists of the same views but with different names would  cause alarm to politicians and financiers.    Until the national economy demonstrates to international  financial organizations its capacity to get through inflation to  stability and prosperity Western countries will continue to hold  back from experiments in search of a "special route" in the  economy and, most importantly, will continue to hold on to their  money.    The series of mutual recriminations which began immediately  after the elections with the charge against Boris Yeltsin that  he did not throw his authority behind the attacking ranks of  Russia's Choice was continued by Jeffrey Sachs' attack on the  World Bank and the IMF and a series of reports from Moscow  talking about the indignation felt by Boris Fedorov and his  colleagues at statements made by Strobe Talbott, the chief  coordinator of the current administration's Russian policy.    The nub of the charges leveled by Sachs, until recently an  adviser to the Russian Government, is that the World Bank and  the IMF approached the needs of the former USSR in a stereotyped  way. The entire current leadership must be changed, Sachs  states, but the main blame lies with Western politicians, who  will shortly spend on defense far more than Russia has required  to find its place in the world.    Strobe Talbott's statement about "less shock, more therapy  for Russians," which, as he has subsequently explained more than  once, merely signified the need for greater attention to be paid  to social problems but was in no way an appeal to slow down the  pace of economic transformations in Russia, was described by  Minister Fedorov as a "stab in the back."    For the time being the administration prefers to say  nothing.  For the time being Clinton is in no hurry to draw conclusions.  And not because it is dangerous to hurry in politics. Since  his visit Russia has clearly clearly fallen from the top of the  president's agenda. It is perfectly likely that deep down  Clinton is pleased with the turn of events, the changes in  Moscow having afforded him the possibility, as it were, not to  take resolute actions.    But one can definitely say that if some officials in the new  Russian Government have tried to create an unfavorable  impression of themselves in the American administration, they  have entirely succeeded. A reporter who accompanied Treasury  Secretary Bentsen on his trip to Moscow cites comments by  Russian Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko indicating the  latter's rejection of simple market truths.    To the American president's satisfaction, the situation in  Russia has little impact on the overall level of his popularity.    Six months ago Bill Clinton set a record: His popularity  during the first year since his election was the lowest for all  American presidents since the country began conducting public  opinion polls systematically in the thirties.    Now, on the eve of his first State of the Union address to  Congress, the White House incumbent can be completely satisfied:  54 percent of poll respondents approve of his administration.    The president still has one problem actually, but this is  not  seen as too substantial by the electorate: This concerns the  Whitewater Development Corporation, where the Clintons' role has  not yet been completely clarified. However, when polled,  Americans are in no hurry to form a negative image of the  president on the basis of hints and vague exposes in the mass  media.    Six months ago Clinton sufferd setback after setback. After  the failure of his job-creation proposals, two abortive attempts  to appoint an attorney general, the military's opposition to the  administration's intention to allow homosexuals to perform  military service, and the sorry $200-haircut incident at Los  Angeles aiport the president seemed flat on his back.    But the end of the year brought a series of successful  international events, particularly those connected with the  creation of free trade zones. The rising American economy and  the successful European tour have all brought a triumphant  conclusion to the young president's first year.</p>

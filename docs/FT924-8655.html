			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: UK public spending The idea that the government could use proceeds from council house sales to cover higher infrastructure spending next year is beguiling. In practice, however, it is easier said than done. Doubling to 50 per cent, as some have suggested, the proportion of proceeds from new sales which councils can spend would only release around Pounds 750m. The real prize is the backlog of unspent proceeds, possibly amounting to as much as Pounds 8bn. This money, which is supposed to be used to pay down local authority debts, cannot easily be freed without adding to the public sector borrowing requirement. True, the release could count as self-financed local authority spending under the government's complex definitions. So it would come outside the crucial Pounds 244.5bn planning total for public spending. But, it would still count as general government expenditure which counts towards the PSBR. Moreover there would be a net rise in public debt outstanding despite local government's large cash balances. Local authorities would have less cash with which to pay down debt. None of this would appeal to a gilts market already fretting that next year's PSBR will easily exceed Pounds 40bn. Worse still for Mr Lamont, the new spending would remain largely in the gift of local authorities rather than Whitehall. If he wants resources for the infrastructure, the chancellor might be better advised to dip into the contingency reserves or find new privatisation receipts. Even then he may have only a limited amount extra to spend - at least if he really wants to keep fiscal policy tight enough to allow further substantial interest rate cuts.</p>

"They had better  understand in Belgrade that this time the international  community is determined," said Andreatta, who acknowledged that  Draskovic did not see eye to eye with Italy on the threatened  air strikes, but that the meeting had been useful.    Draskovic leads the strongest opposition party in Belgrade's  parliament, called the Party of Serbian Renewal. He told ANSA  today that a NATO military strike would be a "very serious  mistake, and could signal the beginning of a disaster for the  Balkans, and perhaps for all of Europe. I have never spared my  criticisms of Radovan Karadzic and the other Bosnian Serb  extremists," Draskovic said, "but if NATO planes bombard them, I  would have to take their side."    But he warned the Bosnians Serbs that "there is no choice,"  Sarajevo "must be unblocked." He said he hoped "they are aware  of the necessity to withdraw from their positions," if they  "don't want to be held responsible for further massacres."    He also said he did not think the Serb ultranationalists  would carry through on their threats to take reprisals against  Italy in the event of an air strike.    (In another context tonight, Italian Prime Minister Carlo  Azeglio Ciampi, at a press conference with foreign journalists,  said that "while Italy is exposed geographically to reprisals,  we don't believe this danger is real."    He said he felt Italy was protected not only by the NATO  European defense network, but also by the fact "that we don't  think there will be any reprisals coming from the other side of  the Adriatic.")    Andreatta, speaking after today's meeting with Draskovic,  said he thought that the European Union would take up the  problem of the air strike in a scheduled meeting at the  beginning of next week (and not in an emergency meeting before  the Sunday deadline, as had been rumored.) "By now the question  is in the hands of the UN, not the EU," Andreatta said.    Italy's diplomatic chief said he told his Serbian  interlocutor that "once this initiative has been put in motion,  it can only be stopped when the Bosnian Serbs have the good  sense to withdraw their artillery or give it over to the UN."    "It's not even a question of saving face, it's just a  question of guaranteeing that the people of Sarajevo no longer  get blown up by these weapons," Andreatta said.    Although he and Draskovic did not see eye to eye on the  ultimatum, Andreatta said he "admired" the Serb opposition  figure's "judgment" and his desire "to bring Serbia back to its  place among the European nations."    The Serb opposition leader said he believed the moment was  exceptionally good for a negotiated settlement, because "people  in all three camps are weary of fighting" and their chiefs "are  incapable of rallying the forces needed for their respective  armies."    But a NATO strike would call everything into question, he  said, allowing "the Albanians of the Kosovo to feel encouraged  about proclaiming their own state while the Turks might decide  to join the fray alongside the Muslims," the Serbian MP said.  "And the Russians? Who can rule out their intervening?" he  added.    Draskovic said he didn't think the stalemate would continue  until NATO actually dropped bombs. The Bosnian Serbs would  withdraw their heavy weapons to 20km from the capital, he  believes, "especially if they have UN and NATO guarantees that  the Muslims won't take advantage of their withdrawal to move in  their militias."</p>

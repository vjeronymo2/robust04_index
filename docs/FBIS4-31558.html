			<p>BFN     [Text] Zagreb ROMPRES, 6/6/1994 -- The Romanian-Croatian  relations can be "special," Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae  Vacaroiu said at the first round of official talks with his  Croatian counterpart, Nikica Valentic, because there are no  divergent opinions between the sides. We have complementary  industries, which can cooperate for third market projects, the  Romanian premier said.    The talks revealed the interest of the present Romanian  executive in boosting the economic relations with Croatia. He  suggested, for the purpose, the establishment of joint ventures,  an idea received with interest by the Croatian side.    Premier Valentic showed that the road and rail links between  his country and Romania were extremely important and requested  that "Romania uses its influence" to have them channeled through  Serbia.    Although no reference was made to the conflict in the former  Yugoslav space, the idea of a peaceful settlement of it underlay  the top level Romanian-Croatian meeting, the resumption of  normal economic relations being a sign that the situation in the  zone is stabilizing.    In the afternoon Premier Nicolae Vacaroiu had meetings with  the speaker of the Croatian Parliament, Nedjeljko Mihanovic, and  the mayor of Zagreb, Branko Miksa.</p>

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / UK Company News: BET guarded about rights acceptances Investors in BET were kept on tenterhooks yesterday after the closing date of acceptances for the business services company's Pounds 200m rights issue. The shares ended at 110p, equal to the rights price and some 19p below the price prevailing before the rights issue was announced on July 14. BET was guarded last night about the level of acceptances. Some indications would suggest that while the rights cannot be considered a success it may not have been the disaster that some commentators have suggested. The 1-for-4 issue has been underwritten by Baring Brothers. The proceeds will be used to redeem auction market preferred stock, the hybrid form of debt and equity.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 23 (KCNA) -- An international  organization affiliated with the U.N. Economic and Social  Council and the Human Rights Information Centre under it in  Moscow issued an information on the human rights situation in  South Korea on April 7.    The information said despite the adoption of the agreement  on  reconciliation, nonaggression, cooperation and exchange between  the North and the South, activities for national reunification  are not only an entity of an acute political struggle but also a  sphere of suppression of dissidents in South Korea.    Restrictive measures against national peace and  reconciliation, free travel and contact between people with  different ideologies must be revoked, said the information.</p>

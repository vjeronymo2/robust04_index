			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Travel: Dancing in the footsteps of Columbus - Nick Haslam fails to master either the merengue or the mosquitoes in the fast-changing Dominican Republic 'WELCOME TO the capital of merengue,' said the American Airlines pilot as we taxied to a halt. We had arrived in Santa Domingo, capital of the Dominican Republic and famed in the Caribbean for merengue, a sensual hip-swaying dance that drove 19th-century missionaries to apoplexy. Merengue and missionaries are still much in evidence in the Dominican Republic. Clubs blare out the brassy rhythms until dawn and Hari Krishna, Baptists and short-sleeved Mormons harangue passers-by in Santa Domingo every day. I had spent a week in the capital, and despite great efforts had failed to master the subtleties of merengue. Determined to escape the gruelling nightlife, I decided to visit La Isabella, Columbus's first settlement on the island's Atlantic coast. My merengue coach, a young Dominican doctor called Christina Gonzales, offered to be my guide. Dominican doctors had been on strike for more than two months over their sub-subsistence pay of Dollars 200 (Pounds 110.40) a month, and she welcomed a break from picketing the state hospitals, now manned by army doctors. Columbus first landed on the island in 1492, and was so charmed by its rolling hills and pastures that he called it Hispaniola. The country is now bracing itself for the 500th anniversary of his arrival. An immense British-designed monument to the Discoverer of the New World has been built on the outskirts of the capital, causing chaos and anger among slum-dwellers whose houses were razed to make way for it. Numerous hotels are springing up on some of the most beautiful beaches, and Dominicans have been exhorted in radio broadcasts to be kind to visitors and not harm the goose that lays the golden egg. We left the capital early one morning on a guagua, the shared transport that everyone uses to get around on the island. I wanted to see the mountains of the centre and we were travelling to the Atlantic via Constansa, the highest town on the island. The guagua, an old Toyota bus, climbed slowly up a muddy track that snaked along ridges and dipped into steep valleys. In villages above the cloud line, ragged children played in the dirt. We crested a last ridge and arrived in Constansa. The air was cool, and pine forests came down to the road. It took an effort of will to believe that we were really in the Caribbean and not the Alps. The people were different, too, with blonde, blue-eyed peasants working in the fields by the road. We stayed for lunch in the town and were amazed to meet a Japanese farmer. He spoke the strongly-accented Spanish of the island: his family had been there for three generations. His grandfather, a farmer whose family was starving in post-war Japan, had responded to an advertisement in 1946. Trujillo, the notorious Dominican dictator, determined to ginger-up his own peasants by injecting new blood, offered free land to Europeans and Asians. Initially, Hungarians and Poles had worked alongside Japanese in the mountains. But they drank and fought too much and soon went on to California. The Japanese had prospered and introduced rice and vegetable-growing techniques that trebled crop yields. 'We now have our own schools with teachers from Japan. Some of us have married Dominican girls, but we mostly marry among ourselves,' the farmer told us, bowing formally when we left the restaurant. Our next guagua was an ordinary Datsun saloon. Eight passengers were crammed inside with the driver perched on the lap of a front-seat passenger. Merengue blared from the loudspeakers and a venerable matron squeezed next to me sang the chorus with gusto. We arrived in La IsabelIa as dusk fell. We had travelled the last ten kilometres on an ancient Honda 50 which gave up the ghost when its driver attempted to ford a river, so we walked and waded the remaining two kilometres into the village. As the sun set, we could see why Columbus had chosen this site. Connected to the mainland by a narrow neck of land, it offered natural defence against Indian attack while a shelving beach provided an easy landing site for the Spanish. Columbus had landed there late in 1493 after a three-month voyage. The 1,400 settlers, many of whom were escaping the privations of life in medieval Spain, wearily disembarked and gave thanks for their safe arrival. But their relief was short-lived. A nearby marsh supplied enough mosquitoes to spread yellow fever and malaria through the new arrivals, who died in scores. Water had to be brought by donkey from the same river we had crossed two kilometres away. After five years, the site was abandoned and the settlers moved inland to higher and healthier ground. But it was still the first European settlement built in the New World. We found the only bar in the simple village of one-roomed shacks and hired two beds in the hut that served as the hotel. A chicken was killed and cooked for us. The servant girl, named Soledad, who looked as if she had gypsy blood, sat with us and watched as we ate in the light of an oil lamp. She was fascinated by our conversation, and would repeat snatches of it to other spectators invisible beyond the pool of light. That night we slept fitfully, bitten by descendants of the same mosquitoes that had played havoc with the first settlers. We had been told in the capital that the site was being excavated by a well-known Venezuelan archaeologist, and next morning found Dr Cruxent (El Profe) wearing a stained singlet and sifting through pottery fragments on the site. A Catalan, he had left Spain as a refugee in the civil war and had been excavating and teaching in south and central America ever since. We breakfasted with the professor on the site of Columbus's settlement, now fenced off from the village. The area was flat, and lines of whitewashed stone marked the position of the wooden stockade of the old fort. Cruxent, in his eighties, laughed when I expressed surprise that the site was so bare. He explained that in the 1950s a government minister had overheard Trujillo complaining about the untidy nature of the site at La Isabella. To curry favour, he dispatched two bulldozers to the village, flattened the site and had the entire area concreted over and two flagstaffs erected, one for Trujillo and one for the Dominican Republic. As he told the story, Cruxent's face grew longer. 'That top layer is the most valuable in a site of this age. All I can do now is attempt to reconstruct the site from the few remaining artefacts we can find.' We spent the day with the professor, visiting the excavations that extended throughout the village. Many of the villagers worked on the grid of trenches that would provide information about the lay-out of the old town. The graveyard had recently been discovered, and a skeleton lay exposed. 'We know he is Christian because his hands are crossed on his chest - he was probably among the first ever to land here,' said Cruxent. The blackened skeleton grinned up at the tropical sun. 'The trouble is we have no money to protect this site from the weather. Another hurricane like David back in '79 and all of this will be lost.' That night we went to bed early and caught the only guagua to the capital that passed through before dawn. As we bumped past the professor's hut, we saw him standing at the door with an oil lamp. He gave us a letter to post in the capital and said: 'Come back for the celebrations in '92, and try to raise some funds to protect this place as well.' I promised to return, and saw him waving goodbye as the driver turned up the merengue and we rolled off into the dawn. Nick Haslam travelled to the Dominican Republic c/o American Airlines (res: 0800-010-151; 081-572-5555) which flies daily to Santa Domingo from Heathrow via Miami or New York. Transport to La Isabella can be arranged from any of the main hotels in the nearest large town, Puerto Plata. Car hire costs about Dollars 80 a day, minimum two days, insurance included.</p>

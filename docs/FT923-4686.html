			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family: Safety is the best policy  / A look at the solvency of the big insurers HOW SAFE is your insurance policy? A small insurance trade association this week alleged that a number of insurers were potentially insolvent, fuelling controversy about the financial strength of the industry and the security of insurance policies. The financial strength of UK insurers has certainly been seriously weakened by two years of record losses, and falls in the value of the properties and shares in which they invested heavily in the 1980s. By the end of last year the net assets of the five biggest composite companies has been cut from Pounds 10.8bn at the end of 1989, to around around Pounds 6bn, its lowest level since 1984. Much of the recent concern has centred on the solvency margin - one of the main tools used by regulators and analysts to measure the financial strength of the insurance companies. The margin (or ratio) measures a company's ability to pay claims by comparing its net assets (its capital and free reserves) with the amount of premium income received in a given year. In very simple terms, the stronger a company's capital base the less risk there is of it being unable to pay insurance claims, the more risks it can take on to its books and the more policies it can sell. Companies must maintain a statutory minimum solvency ratio of between 16 and 18 per cent, although brokers, who are effectively professional insurance buyers, generally insist that the ratio should be no less than 30 per cent, nearly double the legal minimum. Solvency ratios have certainly fallen. The UK's biggest company, Sun Alliance, fell from over 124 per cent in 1989 to 56 per cent at the end of June this year. The other large composite companies - so-called because they underwrite a combination of general and life insurance - all have lower margins, although they remain comfortably above the legal minimum. However, a low solvency ratio need not necessarily give grounds for concern. The level and adequacy of claims reserves - which companies are legally obliged to maintain - is not reflected in the solvency ratio. In the UK, the DTI has sophisticated systems to monitor the adequacy of these reserves as well as the riskiness of the assets - investments in shares, gilts or property - into which these monies are invested. So a good deal of qualitative as well as quantitative analysis goes on in assessing company security. According to Charles Longhurst of the Association of British Insurers 'it is no secret that the solvency margin has fallen but the companies are still trading and able to meet claims. They have been living off the fat for the last couple of years but they haven't reached the bone yet.' Roy Randall, of Royal Insurance, says 'a battery of factors are involved' in assessing solvency. 'The solvency margin is not the be all and end all.' Nor is a high solvency margin necessarily a guide to financial health. Trinity Insurance, which became insolvent earlier this year, had relatively high solvency margins, indicating that the ratio does not always help the watchdogs spot weaknesses. Even so in today's very difficult economic environment the possibility that your insurance company will go under cannot be entirely precluded. Even if it does, however, policyholders enjoy some automatic protection. The Policyholders Protection Board - funded by the insurance industry as a whole - would assume most of a company's obligations. The PPB will pay 100 per cent of claims incurred on insurance policies which it is compulsory to buy, such as third party motor insurance and 90 per cent of all other claims. Jane Vass, of the Consumers' Association, says: 'Nobody wants to go though the awkwardness of claiming from such a body but it is a safety net.'</p>

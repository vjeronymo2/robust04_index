			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Demand for trucks lifts vehicle sales Registrations of new commercial vehicles - an important barometer of economic activity - rose by 14.9 per cent year-on-year in May as the recovery accelerated in the sector. According to new figures, sales are being driven by rising demand for trucks, particularly from the construction sector, where registrations jumped by 33.4 per cent year-on-year in May to 3,426. Registrations of three and four-axle rigid trucks, which are chiefly used by the building industry, jumped by 81 per cent year-on-year in May, reflecting the recent sharp rise in construction orders. In the first five months of 1994, truck registrations in this sector were 59 per cent higher than a year ago, and some truckmakers are struggling to cope with the rapid rise in demand. Overall, sales of new commercial vehicles increased last month to 17,598 from 15,311 in the same month a year ago, according to the figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Sales in the first five months of the year rose by 12.9 per cent to 93,083, from 82,482 a year ago. In the first five months of the year truck sales rose by 23 per cent on the same period last year, to 16,103. The upturn in truck demand last year was led by rising sales of articulated trucks, as long-distance hauliers began to renew their fleets, but the recovery is now spreading rapidly to urban distribution and construction. Registrations of light trucks (7.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight), which are chiefly used in urban distribution, have risen by 26 per cent in the first five months of the year and jumped by 40 per cent year-on-year in May. Overall sales of heavy trucks (above 15 tonnes gross vehicle weight) rose by 30 per cent in the first five months of the year to 9,294 and by 36 per cent year-on-year in May. Truck sales in the UK more than halved during the recession from 69,234 in 1989 to only 31,398 in 1992. Sales last year were 36,358. Activity in the van sector, where the recovery has lagged trucks, is also rising, albeit at a slower rate, as small-business confidence grows. Registrations of medium-duty vans, which are dominated by the Ford Transit, increased by 10.4 per cent in May and 11.1 per cent in the first five months. Imported vehicles are gaining a growing share of the recovering market, with 42 per cent of the overall commercial vehicle market in May compared with 38 per cent a year ago.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK COMMERCIAL VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS JANUARY-MAY 1994  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                Volume    Volume    Share (%)   Share (%)                               (Units)  Change (%) Jan-May 94  Jan-May 93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Market*                 93,083     +12.9      100.0       100.0 Imports                       39,898     +21.2       42.9        39.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Small vans (up to 1.8 tonnes) Total                         30,190     +13.2      100.0       100.0 Imports                       11,794     +27.9       39.1        34.6 Ford                          13,367      +6.0       44.3        47.3 Vauxhall (General Motors)      8,705      +1.8       28.8        32.1 Renault                        1,933     +46.9        6.4         4.9 PSA Peugeot Citroen            1,752     +17.6        5.8         5.6 Rover (BMW)                    1,504     +23.1        5.0         4.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Medium vans &amp; pick-ups (1.81 - 3.5 tonnes) Total                         39,716     +11.1      100.0       100.0 Imports                       15,312     +10.4       38.6        38.8 Ford                          18,669      +1.5       47.0        51.5 LDV                            4,373     +33.5       11.0         9.2 Mercedes-Benz (Daimler-Benz)   3,283    +104.8        8.3         4.5 Volkswagen                     3,014     +14.4        7.6         7.4 Renault                        2,326     +18.0        5.9         5.5 Nissan                         1,809     +51.3        4.6         3.3 Vauxhall (GM)                  1,797      +9.6        4.5         4.6 Toyota                         1,494      -6.9        3.8         4.5 PSA Peugeot Citroen            1,490     -24.8        3.8         5.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Trucks (over 3.5 tonnes) Total                         16,103     +22.7      100.0       100.0 Imports                        9,337     +52.8       58.0        46.6 Iveco group** (Fiat)           3,784     +14.2       23.5        25.2 Mercedes-Benz (Daimler-Benz)   2,992     +23.0       18.6        18.5 Leyland DAF (DAF Trucks)       2,733     +14.9       17.0        18.1 Volvo                          1,992     +25.4       12.4        12.1 Scania (Investor)              1,331     +35.3        8.3         7.5 MAN                            1,072     +51.2        6.7         5.4 ERF                              937     +42.8        5.8         5.0 Renault                          657     +36.3        4.1         3.7 Of which Heavy Trucks (over 15 tonnes) Total                          9,294     +30.3      100.0       100.0 Volvo                          1,800     +28.1       19.4        19.7 Leyland Daf (Daf Trucks)       1,392     +43.5       15.0        13.6 Scania (Investor)              1,331     +35.3       14.3        13.8 Iveco group** (Fiat)           1,291     +20.4       13.9        15.0 Mercedes-Benz (Daimler-Benz)   1,085     +12.1       11.7        13.6 ERF                              937     +42.8       10.1         9.2 MAN                              601     +44.1        6.5         5.9 Renault                          381    +114.0        4.1         2.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- (names in brackets indicate ownership) *includes buses and light four wheel drive utility vehicles. **includes Iveco Ford and Seddon Atkinson.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and industry estimates.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Chevron to cut N Sea exploring CHEVRON, one of the leading US operators in the North Sea, will cut its exploration budget by 30 per cent over the rest of this year because of the effects of proposed changes to the petroleum revenue tax. Mr Charles Smith, managing director of Chevron UK, yesterday said the company's annual budget for North Sea exploration was between Pounds 50m and Pounds 100m. 'We'll have to slow it down to meet our cash flow targets,' he said. The changes to the tax, proposed in the March Budget, give oil companies greater incentives to invest in existing fields, but they reduce tax allowances for exploration. Chevron also said yesterday that it would shortly be entering final negotiations to sell gas from its new Britannia field, the largest of its kind in the North Sea. The likely purchasers are either British Gas or Wintershall of Germany. Delivery will start in October 1997.</p>

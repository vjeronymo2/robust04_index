			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / GM's revolution devours its creator: Martin Dickson analyses the future for the world's biggest industrial company Revolutions throughout history have had a habit of devouring their own. Yesterday the revolution shaking up General Motors swallowed up and spat out its chairman, Mr Robert Stempel, the man who set in motion the current upheaval just 10 months ago. Mr Stempel, 59, whose booming voice and tall frame disguised a gradualist, consensus approach to decision-making, resigned after irresistible pressure to quit from the GM board. Over the past month its non-executive directors had come to believe that the moderate chairman was not addressing the company's problems with sufficient urgency, nor communicating the sheer scale of the battle facing GM to his troops. The result was a campaign of discreet Stempel-must-go lobbying and far-from-discreet leaks to the press, creating confusion inside and outside GM as to who was running the world's largest industrial company. Mr Stempel's resignation statement yesterday spoke bitterly of 'the chaos of the past several weeks'. The United Auto Workers' union sharply attacked the board's 'tactics of management by rumour, newsleak and innuendo'. The chairman's departure raises two questions: who will succeed him? And will the changes at the top help or hinder GM's race against time as it tries to return its loss-making North American car operations to the black? Later this week GM is expected to report third-quarter losses of up to Dollars 850m (Pounds 521m) because of its problems in North America, where the company has been losing market share for more than a decade yet has failed to cut either manufacturing capacity or bureaucracy. Mr Stempel, who took over as chairman in August 1990, finally grasped the nettle in December last year when he announced the first stage of a plan to remake GM North America - the closure of 21 plants and elimination of 74,000 jobs by the mid-1990s. However, the slow progress of the revamp led non-executive directors last April to stage a coup. They replaced Mr Stempel as chairman of the board's executive committee with Mr John Smale, the leader of the outside directors. They also ousted Mr Lloyd Reuss, group president and head of North America, replacing him with Mr Jack Smith, who was formerly in charge of international operations and turned round GM Europe in the 1980s. Mr Smith has speeded up the pace of change, but board members evidently felt that the 'shock effect' of the April coup was in danger of wearing off, without a tougher example from the chairman. Over the past two months, in particular, there has been some counter-revolutionary muscle-flexing from the UAW, which has staged three local strikes over threatened job cuts, while outside parts manufacturers have been resisting attempts by GM to cut costs of its components. Whatever else it may do, Mr Stempel's resignation will certainly produce a shock. He is, after all, the first chief executive of this complacent, insular and bureaucratic business to be ousted since Mr William Crapo Durant, the founder of the company, was forced out in 1920. The new chairman is expected to be Mr Smale, 65, the leader of April's non-executive coup, though he may wish only to serve on an interim basis until a successor is found. Mr Smale, a long-time GM non-executive director, is a former chief executive of consumer products group Procter &amp; Gamble, and made a name as a marketing man in the 1950s when he got the American Dental Association to support the company's fluoride toothpaste. A quiet, methodical man, who in a rare interview three years ago described himself as a 'dull fellow,' Mr Smale has a reputation for preparing his strategy in immense detail and then following it through fearlessly, irrespective of unpopularity. He brings to GM one vital quality which Mr Stempel and Mr Reuss clearly lacked: the status of an outsider, though one with a reasonable understanding of the company's business, untainted by ties with the status quo and willing to crack heads hard to achieve his goals. Mr Smith, by virtue of having risen on GM's international side, is also something of an outsider. The two are expected to announce a shake-up over the next few weeks. It is also likely to unveil a more generous employee job buy-out programme, designed to reduce tensions with the UAW, and name the last of the 21 plants due for closure. And, in spite of denials, rumours also persist that one of GM's marques, Oldsmobile, may also be eliminated. A sharp rise in GM's share price since the start of the Stempel resignation rumours shows that Wall Street approves of the company's tougher, more urgent tone. Yet the hurdles ahead remain formidable. GM's US car market share is still slipping, and will not be easily or quickly turned around. Mr Smale, if he indeed becomes chairman, faces extremely delicate negotiations with the UAW over job cuts and health benefits, and his P&amp;G experience has not prepared him for dealing with a tough, determined union. And morale within the company is low, especially after the rumours of the past few weeks. Denying suggestions of Oldsmobile's demise last week, the marque's general manager summed up the mood: 'Right now you're looking at one pissed-off cowboy'.</p>

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / People: In the wake of Andrew Crockett Pen Kent, associate director of the Bank of England since 1988, is to replace Andrew Crockett as a director of the Bank from the end of this month. But Kent, 56, will not take over as director of the international division, a post to be abolished in the new year. As part of the Bank's efforts to untangle its convoluted allocation of responsibilities - the first such effort since 1980 - the international director's post will be abolished in January. This will leave senior staff members in London to represent the Bank at whichever international forums are most relevant to their duties in London. Former international directors  -many of whom are now in the City - include Anthony Loehnis, Sir Kit MacMahon and Sir Jeremy Morse. The International Division, likely to be rechristened, will continue in a more modest form, with the rejigging of responsibilities designed to bring its work more into the mainstream of Bank politics. Kent (left) will retain his existing responsibilities as the director for finance and industry and for the Bank's printing works. Ian Plenderleith, currently responsible for the Bank's monetary policy operations, will add the work of Anthony Coleby to his brief when Coleby retires at the end of February. It has already been announced in Basle that Crockett is to take over as general manager of the Bank for International Settlements from the beginning of next year.</p>

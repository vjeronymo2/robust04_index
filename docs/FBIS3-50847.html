			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Engineer Franck Pierre of the Capois Lamort  Organization pointed out in an interview with Signal FM that the  fuel must be distributed throughout the entire Haitian territory  in order to solve the fuel shortage problem. The Capois Lamort  Organization threatens -- if the international community fails  to comply with this request -- to repeat the events of 11  October, the date on which USS Harlan County departed the  Port-au-Prince harbor because of the presence of armed  demonstrators.    [Begin Pierre recording, in Creole] We say to Ambassador  General [title as heard] Lawrence Pezzullo that the fuel must be  entrusted to the distributing companies that are supposed to  deliver it to all gas stations so that all sons of the land can  get the fuel they wish, because the embargo is a general embargo  that hits all Haitians and all social strata in the country. We  in the Capois Lamort Organization are [words indistinct] and  clear about Haiti's crisis situation: The fuel must be widely  distributed through Shell, Texaco, and Esso so that it is  available in all gas stations and so that all Haitians can  participate in the fuel.

			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OTHERLIVES: BIOGRAPHY, AUTOBIOGRAPHY, MEMOIRS;  </P> <P> FERLINGHETTI THE ARTIST IN HIS TIME BY BARRY SILESKY (WARNER BOOKS: $24.95; 294  PP.)  </P> <P> Lawrence Ferlinghetti is one of those well-known people whom few people know  well. To some extent that's because Ferlinghetti -- poet, publisher,  bookseller, novelist -- is a private man; although he cooperated with Barry  Silesky, himself a poet, on this volume, he clearly dislikes having his beliefs  and motivations looked into.  </P> <P> More significant is the fact that Ferlinghetti's poetry has never received much  critical attention; it tends toward the transparent, the everyday, seeing much  but revealing little. It's a surprise, consequently, to learn that his most  noted collection, "A Coney Island of the Mind" (New Directions, 1958), has more  than a million copies in print worldwide -- more than any book by any other  living poet, and almost twice as many as Allen Ginsberg's "Howl" -- which  Ferlinghetti published two years earlier through his own press, City Lights.  </P> <P> Silesky provides a mild, workmanlike account of Ferlinghetti's life to date,  and though drawing few conclusions, makes it easy to guess at the origins of  Ferlinghetti's sensibility. Dropped off at an orphanage at age 6 because his  mother was hospitalized for emotional problems and his great aunt couldn't  afford to rear him, Ferlinghetti ended up the ward of a wealthy, elderly couple  in a New York suburb.  </P> <P> The Dickensian echoes don't end there; in his teens, he was arrested for  shoplifting the same month he made Eagle Scout, and, after college, went to sea  -- joining the Navy, where he captained an escort boat during the D-day  invasion of France. Ferlinghetti would return there in 1948, enrolling as a  graduate student in the Sorbonne and intending to be a writer of some kind . .  . a writer, one projects after reading this book, who took transience for  granted, who found the notion of authorial "depth" a luxury.  </P> <P> Silesky doesn't attempt such amateur psychologizing, which is just as well,  considering the dearth of clues that Ferlinghetti gives in his work. One  reason, no doubt, that Ferlinghetti was much more popular in the 1960s than he  is today -- and currently is more respected abroad than at home -- is that he  writes for readers, not critics, dispensing with subtext and deliberately  aiming to be accessible. Another reason is that his poetry -- what there is of  it, Ferlinghetti now devoting most of his time to painting -- is overtly  political. Ferlinghetti described himself in "Open Eye, Open Heart" (1973) as a  wind-up toy:  </P> <P>  someone had dropped wound-up  </P> <P>  into a world already  </P> <P>  running down....  </P> <P> The verse nicely captures the open, almost sweet dissent of his best poetry.  Silesky's book is above all a tribute to a similarly minded poet, interesting  if not particularly enlightening.  </P></p>

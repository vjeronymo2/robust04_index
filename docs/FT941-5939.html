			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Russia starts cutting off gas to Ukraine over Dollars 900m unpaid bill Russia has started cutting gas supplies to Ukraine, threatening an energy blockade to add to the woes of the country's crumbling economy. The action came as tension grew in relations with other former Soviet states. Russia, energy supplier to much of the former Soviet Union, has been moving towards world prices in its gas and oil supplies - putting pressure on the economies of energy-dependent states like Ukraine, where reforms have hardly begun and where inflation and financial crises are chronic. About 95 per cent of Russian gas exports to western Europe pass through Ukraine. Western customers maintain emergency reserves of gas in case of disruptions, and some supplies could be shifted through the European gas grid to compensate for shortfalls in individual countries. In addition demand for gas is likely to fall as winter ends. Any prolonged cut-off of Russian exports through Ukraine is likely to be felt most in central Europe, which has few links to the western grid. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia could be hardest hit, as they are almost entirely dependent on Russian gas. The Russian action, made as Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, flew to the US to meet President Bill Clinton, comes two weeks after Turkmenistan, Ukraine's other major gas supplier, cut off supplies. Russia has accused Ukraine of taking extra gas from the pipeline which carries 500m cu metres a day both for Ukraine and to customers in Germany, France Italy and central Europe in order to compensate for the Turkmen cuts. Gasprom, the Russian monopoly gas company, says it is owed Rbs1,500bn (Dollars 900m) by Ukraine - though Ukraine claims it owes only Rbs300bn. A Ukrainian offer to pay Dollars 20m on account by tomorrow has been refused by Gasprom, saying it is not enough. Yesterday's gas reduction comes only two weeks after Russia and Ukraine had apparently struck a 10-year deal to supply Ukraine with 50-70bn cubic metres of gas a year. Some 90 per cent of Russia's gas exports to western Europe cross the Ukraine but officials in Kiev deny this gas would be siphoned off to replace Russian supplies to the Ukraine. However, officials in Kiev remained sceptical even yesterday that Russia could effectively cut gas supplies to Ukraine alone, precisely because it is so easy for Ukraine to syphon. Three other former Soviet republics - Belarus, Latvia and Moldova - also face action from Gasprom. Belarus owes Rbs400bn (Dollars 240m) which it says it cannot pay, and is already suffering cuts; Latvia owes Dollars 23m, and talks begin in Riga today in an attempt to settle the issue; while Moldova, which owes Rbs53bn (Dollars 390m), has just agreed to barter the debt against consumer goods and foodstuffs.</p>

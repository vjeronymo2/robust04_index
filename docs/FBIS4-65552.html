			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Paris, May 18 (AFP) -- Eleven French aid workers  detained for over a month by Bosnian Serbs for alleged arms  trafficking were freed and flown out of Sarajevo Wednesday after  payment of $44,000. [passage omitted]    The organisation's field coordinator, Jacques Ladyson, told  AFP that "until a visit by French ambassador Henry Jacolin, the  conditions of our comrades were very difficult.    "They were poorly fed, moved here and there, and were given  mock executions."    "One evening, they were made to walk around in their  underpants, with their eyes blindfold, for no apparent reason."    The 11 -- 10 men and one woman -- had been held by Bosnian  Serbs since April 8, the day after being stopped at the last  Serb checkpoint before entering Sarajevo and forced to travel to  the Serb-held suburb of Ilidza for a full search.    The Serbs refused to allow the team to remain overnight in  their vehicles.    The next morning, when they returned to their convoy, they  found Bosnian Serbs filming ammunition crates, removed from the  trucks. The aid workers were immediately detained and accused of  gun-running to the Moslems, which the 11 strenuously denied.    Their Serb captors initially offered to exchange the group  for 11 Serb prisoners held by the Bosnian army, but Premiere  Urgence refused.    On May 7, the Serbs said that a trial of the aid workers had  been put off until early June. A day later they extended their  month-long detention for another month. [passage omitted]    The 11 were due at Paris's Villacoublay military airport  around 11:00 p.m. where they were to be met by Defense Minister  Francois Leotard and Foreign Minister Alain Juppe.    French President Francois Mitterrand expressed "joy" at the  release and praised the courage of all aid workers in Bosnia-  Herzegovina. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEATING AGREES TO OBEY FINANCIAL CURBS  </P> <P> The Justice Department announced Wednesday that Charles H. Keating Jr., a key  figure in the savings and loan crisis, had agreed to live by limitations a  federal judge had temporarily imposed on his finances.  </P> <P> Under the agreement, Keating has to give the federal Office of Thrift  Supervision 48 hours notice of any transactions exceeding $5,000 and is barred  from transferring any assets out of the United States.  </P> <P> Those terms, plus a financial disclosure to the OTS that he has already  provided, had previously been imposed on Keating by a temporary restraining  order issued by a federal judge in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The Justice Department reached the agreement, which was filed in the Los  Angeles court, on behalf of the OTS, an agency of the Treasury Department.  </P> <P> The OTS had previously ordered Keating to prove his assertion that he is broke.  The thrift agency partially froze his assets in connection with its efforts to  recover $41 million from Keating and five associates.  </P> <P> The Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Keating on behalf of OTS on Aug.  17. Judge Stephen V. Wilson issued a temporary restraining order on Aug. 22  requiring Keating to abide by OTS' financial restrictions for 10 days.  </P> <P> The government's enforcement efforts stem from the collapse of Lincoln Savings  &amp; Loan Assn. of Irvine, which Keating controlled and has been accused of  looting. Regulators estimate the failure may cost taxpayers $2 billion, ranking  with Miami's CenTrust Bank as the costliest S&amp;L failures.  </P> <P> Keating earned huge salaries, lived lavishly and contributed heavily to  politicians while he headed American Continental Corp., a development company  based in Phoenix that owned Lincoln.  </P> <P> His case has attracted particular attention because of his $1.3 million in  contributions to the campaigns of five senators.  </P></p>

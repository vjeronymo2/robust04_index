			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Insurance proceeds help lift S Lyles to Pounds 1.1m S LYLES, the yarn spinner and dyer, marginally improved its profit in the year ended June 30, but taking in a Pounds 260,000 exceptional credit the increase was 40 per cent. Including the credit, which represented insurance proceeds arising on the death of a director, the pre-tax balance rose from Pounds 813,000 to Pounds 1.14m. Turnover slipped from Pounds 17.1m to Pounds 16.7m reflecting a decrease both in home and export sales. Earnings per share came to 10.66p (7.42p) and the final dividend is 3.35p for a total of 4.9p (4.45p). Mr John Lyles, chairman, said trading conditions were difficult and the 'whiff of the optimism detected this spring in the home market fast disappeared. We have so far had a disappointing start to our year'.</p>

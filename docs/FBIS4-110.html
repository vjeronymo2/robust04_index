			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Continuing his tour of African countries,  Foreign Minister Velayati arrived in Windhoek, the capital of  Namibia, today. He met and held talks with President Sam Nujoma.  At that meeting, Nujoma expressed his pleasure at the presence  of the Iranian delegation in Namibia and described his country  as the second home of Iranians. He expressed his interest in  expanding cooperation in all fields with the Islamic Republic of  Iran.    Velayati, for his part, congratulated Nujoma on the return  of  Walvis Bay to that country and delivered a message from the  president of the Islamic Republic of Iran on the fourth  anniversary of Namibia's independence.    At that meeting, the two sides discussed international  political issues and expressed their concern at the continuing  violence by South African racists against the opposition. The  two sides also underlined the need to expand economic and  commercial relations based on the agreement reached between the  presidents of Namibia and the Islamic Republic of Iran within  the framework of South-South cooperation. Other topics  discussed between Velayati and Nujoma were the formation of a  joint commission between the two countries and cooperation in  the fields of fishing, oil, and mines. [passage omitted]    Continuing his visit to Namibia, Velayati met and held  negotiations with the foreign minister of that country. At that  meeting, the Namibian foreign minister described stopping the  sale of oil by the Islamic Republic of Iran to South Africa and  occupied Palestine as a major factor in damaging the interests  of those two countries and said: Iran has struck the biggest  blow to racism in the world.    Velayati, for his part, underlined Iran's continuing support  for the struggle of the people of Namibia against racism under  the leadership of Nujoma.</p>

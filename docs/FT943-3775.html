			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Maltese resist plans for VAT Malta's plan to introduce value added tax in 1995, part of its bid to join the European Union, has met opposition from the island's business community, trade unions and opposition Labour party. The introduction of VAT is part of the centre-right Nationalist government's programme of market liberalisation which includes cutting state subsidies, removing tariffs and ending state monopolies. The prime minister, Mr Eddie Fenech Adami, has pledged this by 1996 with two objectives: first, to help develop the island as a financial centre to make up for the decline in traditional industries and manufacturing; and secondly, more controversially, to strengthen the country's bid for full membership of the EU. The EU issued an encouraging avis last October which recognised Malta's desire to join the club but warned that reforms would be needed, including the restructuring of the island's tax system. Spearheading the campaign against the introduction of these reforms are the island's unions and the opposition Labour party, which opposes the EU bid. The unions fear VAT will mean high prices, and they accuse the government of rushing blindly to meet Brussels' demands for economic convergence. State revenues have been heavily dependent on duties on imported goods, which are sometimes rated at more than 100 per cent. The rate of VAT will be 15 per cent on a wide range of goods and services, but excluding food and medical services. The government insists there will be no cost-of-living rises. Inflation, fuelled by a devaluation two years ago, is about 5 per cent. The General Workers Union, which has 43,000 members (or more than 30 per cent of the country's workforce) has already carried out industrial action in protest at the VAT plans. The General Retailers and Traders Union, which has 5,000 card-carrying members but boasts the support of 35,000, has also threatened disruptions unless the rate of tax is brought down. While it is unlikely parliament's ruling on VAT will be overturned, more sensitive issues lurk round the corner. The reform of Maltese industry, which has enjoyed a high degree of protection, will be especially painful. Small companies involved in construction and furniture making, which account for 70 per cent of industrial employment, hide behind stringent tariff and non-tariff barriers, and the shipbuilding sector, which provides 5 per cent of employment, is heavily subsidised. Other pending reforms include a new banking law which will abolish off-shore accounts to create the sameconditions for locals and foreigners alike, and a privatisation programme. Both are likely to provoke opposition. Along with looking for a role in Europe, the reforms are aimed at developing Malta as a financial and trading centre. It is hoped financial services could account for 10 to 15 per cent of GDP within five years if the reform programme is allowed to go ahead. Ironically, however, the main threat to Malta's EU membership bid comes not from domestic opposition to the reforms but from the EU itself. EU members are resisting extending the current principle of the veto in voting to such small entities - Malta's GNP is 0.03 per cent that of the EU. No progress is likely until 1996, when the EU will discuss the issue of enlargement.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A candidate list with 18 names has been drawn up to  contest the Natal regional elections under the banner of the  Freedom Front. This follows last week's decision by nine of the  11 Conservative Party [CP] management members to support  participation in the elections.

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Changes in German recovery plan urged MR Jurgen Mollemann, German economics minister, yesterday proposed a radical overhaul of the state-funded Aufschwung Ost economic recovery programme for the country's five new states. He called for changes in the law to break the log-jam of claims to land and property from people dispossessed following the setting up of the former GDR in 1949, and demanded an extra DM2bn (Pounds 600m) immediately for investment incentives to encourage entrepreneurs. He proposed that the duration of state-aided job creation schemes should be cut from a year to six months, and called for improved export credit guarantees for companies hit by the collapse of their traditional markets in east Europe. He also suggested the two-year DM24bn Aufschwung Ost project - mainly devoted to rebuilding town centres, hospitals, schools and roads, and due to end in December - should be extended for 12 months and boosted with a further DM12bn government grant. Mr Mollemann, who plans to present his scheme to the cabinet soon, came under attack immediately from Mr Norbert Blum, labour minister, and Mr Manfred Carstens, state secretary in the Finance Ministry. German industrial production rose 1.2 per cent in November, due mainly to a 1.5 per cent increase in the manufacturing sector and rises of 4 to 5 per cent in output from the gas and electricity industries. However, underlying difficulties showed up in continued weaknesses in plant and engineering companies' order books.</p>

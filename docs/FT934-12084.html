			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Book Review: Out of the cold war into a cool calm THE COLD WAR AND THE MAKING OF THE MODERN WORLD By Martin Walker Fourth Estate Pounds 18.99, 404pp It's over, and so am I,' says spymaster George Smiley at the end of John Le Carre's last cold war novel, The Secret Pilgrim. 'Absolutely over. Time you rang down the curtain on yesterday's cold warrior.' And in a weary valediction, he preaches of the shifts in economic power that had brought the conflict between east and west to an end; the need now for partnership with Russia and, above all, for adjustment in the west. 'It's not only our minds we're going to have to reconstruct,' he concludes. 'It's the over-mighty modern state we've built for ourselves as a bastion against something that isn't there any more.' There is a similar valedictory feel to Martin Walker's new history of the cold war. For more than four decades, confrontation between America and its allies on the one hand and the Soviet empire and its proxies on the other was the central fact around which the world organised its life - politically, militarily, economically, socially. Now its removal has left the countries of what used to be called 'the free world' - as much as those liberated from communism - floundering, exhausted, groping for a sense of collective purpose. It may seem rather an obvious point, but it is still worth making. Four years after the Berlin Wall came down, the cold war seems both too recent to place in perspective and too remote to treat as anything other than a distant memory. With this book, Walker - Washington bureau chief of the Guardian, former Moscow correspondent and child of the cold war generation - bravely steps into the breach. Relying on extensive reading (though not, disappointingly, on much original research), he escorts the reader from Yalta and the US policy of 'containing' the Soviet threat, through the balance of terror between US and Soviet nuclear arsenals, the proxy wars in the third world and detente in Europe, to the crumbling of communism and 'victory' of the west in the late 1980s. The cold war was more of a global conflict than either of this century's two world wars, and more than a confrontation between states or even empires: in Walker's words it was a 'total war between economic and social systems, an industrial test to destruction'. By adopting this broad approach, he reminds us of a fact it is easy to forget after such a seismic change in the world's affairs: there were many occasions from the late 1940s when victory seemed far from assured, and that lent the efforts of post-war western leaders a peculiar urgency. Whether in rebuilding western Europe and Japan after the war, in competing with the apparent success of the Soviet economy in the 1950s, in combating the spread of Soviet influence in the developing world in the 1960s or simply in meeting the military threat of an unpredictable nuclear superpower, every government in the west was united by the same compulsion. But there was another factor that lent the years of confrontation a comforting sense of predictability. By the 1960s, the cold war had become something of an institution with its own warped logic, codes of etiquette - and, in a curious way, stability. Walker writes well of the 'subtle gamesmanship' that developed between Washington and Moscow as a result of the nuclear standoff - their sporadic skirmishing through third parties in every arena of the world except the most central one of Europe; the 'curious empathy' that evolved between them, turning a shared need to avoid mutual destruction into a protracted pas de deux over arms control. Ultimately though, the cold war was fought and won on the economic battlefield more than the political or military ones. Walker does not underestimate the role played in ending the confrontation by remarkable men such as Mikhail Gorbachev and, he has sneakingly to admit, Ronald Reagan. Nor does he ignore the influence of the breezes in Europe, east and west, that brought about greater communication and political transparency across the Iron Curtain. But in the last analysis, he argues, it was the weaknesses of the Soviet economy - masked for a time by rising oil revenues in the Brezhnev years, exposed when Moscow struggled to meet Washington's deficit spending splurge in the 1980s - that brought the Soviet empire to its knees. Equally, from the Marshall Plan in western Europe and the Korean war boom in Asia, it was the superior ability of market economies - and social democratic variants thereon - to provide guns for the state and butter for its citizens that kept communism at bay. The irony is that this very effort - especially during the sinew-straining 1980s - has left the west, as well as the east, facing the need for economic and political adjustment. At times Walker, whose writing is fluent but frequently glib, takes the east-west analogies irritatingly far. Is it really fair to say, for example, that America's difficulties over Vietnam in the late 1960s meant that 'the two main political systems had rarely looked more alike, or less savoury'? Or that: 'In the aftermath of the cold war, in the final months of the Bush presidency, the US seemed to be stumbling painfully through its own Brezhnev era'? His conclusions, however, are undoubtedly right: that the west is now struggling to adapt to an age when the global economic forces unleashed in the battle against communism are challenging the traditional nation state. With economic power now more evenly spread between the US, western Europe and Japan - and with the Chinese juggernaut, too, advancing rapidly towards the market - the next challenge is to maintain and extend that process of integration, whether by working harder to bring Russia into the fold of market economies or, more generally, by preventing the trade barriers from going up again.</p>

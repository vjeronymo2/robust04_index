			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Main points of the welfare plan Welfare recipients born after 1971 will be limited to two years of cash benefits in their lifetime, writes George Graham. After two years, they would be required to enrol in a one-year work programme sponsored by the government. They could re-enrol in work programmes so long as they continued to look for work. Anyone who turned down a job or did not make adequate efforts to look for work could have his or her benefits stopped. Over the next five years, the plan is expected to cost a total of Dollars 10.8bn (Pounds 7.2bn), including: Dollars 2.8bn for education, training and job placement. Dollars 1.2bn for work programmes for those who reach the two-year limit. Dollars 4.2bn for childcare for those in training and work programmes, as well as for other workers with low incomes. Dollars 900m for measures to improve the system of collecting child support payments from parents and for teenage pregnancy prevention. A reduction in the number of people in the welfare system is expected to save Dollars 1.5bn over the same five-year period. The remaining Dollars 9.3bn of costs would be made up by measures such as: Tightening restrictions on foreigners receiving benefits such as aid to families with dependent children (AFDC), social security pensions or food stamps, to save Dollars 3.7bn. Putting a ceiling on each state's spending in the AFDC emergency homelessness programme, to save Dollars 1.6bn. Limiting social security disability payments to drug and alcohol addicts so as to save Dollars 800m. Ending agricultural subsidies to farmers with more than Dollars 100,000 a year in non-farm income so as to save Dollars 500m. Shifting Dollars 1.6bn of savings from the superfund for cleaning up toxic waste dumps.</p>

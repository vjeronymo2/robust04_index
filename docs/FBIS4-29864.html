			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  on Wednesday [22 June] kicked off two days of subcabinet-level  "framework" trade talks on government procurement in what a  Japanese official termed "a good and constructive atmosphere."    Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi and Deputy U.S.  Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky discussed various  topics in the government procurement category, including the  sensitive issue of using "quantitative criteria" to gauge the  openness of Japan's market, a Foreign Ministry official told  reporters.    The official did not go into detail, except to say, "mutual  understanding has been deepened."    Wednesday's meeting was largely devoted to reviewing lower  working-level talks that ended Tuesday, the official said.    Japan understands the spirit of a U.S. agreement to restart  the long-suspended framework talks is "still alive." The U.S.  pledged in the May agreement to refrain from seeking "numerical  targets" to assess the Japanese market.    The government procurement talks comprise medical equipment  and telecommunications equipment.</p>

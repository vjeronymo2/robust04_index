			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Santiago EL MERCURIO in Spanish, in its  11 February issue, carries on page C3 a 900-word unattributed  article about alleged links between Chilean Ambassador to  Switzerland Alejandro Montesino and former Italian Prime  Minister Bettino Craxi in a bribery scandal in Italy.    According to Peruvian congressman Fernando Olivera -- who  was  interviewed in Lima by EL MERCURIO correspondent Anibal Alvarado  -- Montesino lived in Italy from 1974 to 1988 after the 1973  military coup in Chile. There he worked for the Italian  Socialist Party and became "Craxi's man of trust" for  international cooperation programs with Latin America. Olivera  accuses Montesino of being involved in the bribes charged by  several former Italian government officials to construction  companies that carried out works in Latin America through the  international cooperation program. "Olivera maintains that  Montesino allegedly attended a meeting between Craxi and former  Peruvian President Alan Garcia in September 1989 in the  Excelsior Hotel." According to some former Peruvian government  officials, Olivera said, "Montesino `had authority delegated  directly from Craxi.'"    The article also reports that Montesino, who is currently in  Santiago recovering from a car accident while on vacation in  southern Chile, categorically denied to EL MERCURIO the  statements made by Olivera about his alleged involvement in the  Italian bribery scandal on account of his relation with Craxi.  Olivera made the accusation for publicity so "`I deny his  charges categorically,'" Montesino says in the article.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Nanning Prefecture has taken flexible methods to  enliven border trade. In 1993 the prefecture registered a total  trade volume of 1.285 billion yuan, an increase of 20 percent  over the previous year. Last year Nanning Prefecture's border  trade declined for a period of time. For this reason, the  prefectural party committee conducted market surveys, formulated  a preferential policy, and coordinated relations between  different departments, thus developing border trade to a new  height.    Now this prefecture has taken new measures to bring about  further development in border trade.</p>

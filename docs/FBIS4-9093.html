			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Labor Minister Leszek Miller, leader of the </F> Democratic Left Alliance, by Robert Krasowski and Igor Zalewski  on 20 April; place not given: "Coalition Gains Strength With  Every Day"]    [Text] [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Did one really have to use a  constitutional weapon against the president? Could one not have  come to an agreement without pointing a gun at the president's  head?    [Miller] First, we should ask a question regarding the  president's real goals. Is he ready to "live together," or  will he fight the coalition with every possible means at his  disposal? And we should keep in mind that he has quite a few  such means: He is empowered to veto laws and to cause a  decisionmaking paralysis, and he can join all those who think  that "the worse it is, the better it is." So we could be facing  deadlocks for months to come, which will be disastrous for  Poland, but perhaps they will enable the president to gain the  most right-wing and the most populist electorate that would  constitute the basis for his support in the coming elections.  If those are the president's goals, this war is unavoidable.  We will then be dealing with such diverging interests that it  will be hard to find any compromise.    But if, on the other hand, the president is of the view that  such "living together" is possible, one should avoid making  decisions that would make both sides' positions rigid, and one  should look for compromise solutions.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Which scenario is more likely?    [Miller] Sometimes I have a feeling that the first scenario  is more likely, and at other times I have a feeling that the  second one is. At this particular time, I would be willing to  admit that Lech Walesa is willing to cooperate. But I cannot be  sure because the president is not consistent with regard to his  views and feelings. He changes them rapidly, and then he sends  conflicting messages to the public at large.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Suppose the Belweder grants certain  concessions--would you be in favor of withdrawing the draft of  amendments to the Small Constitution?    [Miller] If the president were willing to come to a  compromise solution and to live together, then, yes, I would be  in favor of that. But that issue is of no major importance  after today's [20 April] meeting between Walesa and the  Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] because we gave up on the idea of  amending the Small Constitution.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] What kind of proof of a compromise position  would you expect from President Walesa?    [Miller] First of all, a resolution of the issue of deputy  prime minister for economic affairs. After all, there is a  vacancy at one of the most important state posts, and that is  not a normal situation. I view the president's reservations  regarding our candidate as not very convincing.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] So are you saying President Walesa should  accept Rosati?    [Miller] That is exactly what should be the topic of  conversation. And either the president comes up with more  serious reservations regarding Rosati's candidacy, if he can  think of any, or he simply decides that Rosati is a good  candidate and approves of him.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] All that looks like a dispute concerning  prestige.    [Miller] If we want to achieve any personnel success in the  future, we cannot lightheartedly abandon anyone we recommended  because no one else will agree to be a candidate afterwards.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] But everybody knows that, if there is  anyone stubborn in Poland, it is Lech Walesa. Because he said  that Rosati will not join the government, then, even if he  agrees now, he will try to have it his way next time.    [Miller] Lech Walesa often changes his mind.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Are such joint stands by the entire  coalition against the president a cementing factor for the  coalition?    [Miller] Definitely. After all, they prove the falsity of  all those speculations that Prime Minister Pawlak is allegedly  staging a theatrical performance of some sort with the  president, with an amazed public watching it. Right now, more  and more people can see that is just not true and that we are  dealing with a genuine difference of views.    Anyway, I think the prime minister must have recalled the  fates of all of the president's loves, beginning with the first  triumphant picture with Jozwiak and Malinowski [not further  specified] and ending with recent events. Being an intelligent  man, the prime minister can draw his own conclusions.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] So that means it used to be different  before.    [Miller] I think that both Pawlak and the Polish Peasant  Party [PSL] could have a feeling that the SLD is yearning for a  different type of coalition arrangement. Some statements--like,  for instance, that the SLD feels closer to the Democratic  Union--could have aroused such a suspicion. And it is possible  that the prime minister was looking for some kind of an  alternative just in case it turns out that he has to build a  coalition with somebody else. That is exactly what could have  been the reason for the kind attitude taken toward the Belweder,  which could be seen in particular at the beginning of the  government's term.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Did you have a feeling during the crisis  over Kawalec and then Borowski that the prime minister  cooperates with the Belweder against the SLD?    [Miller] The rush with which all that happened, especially  on the part of the president, may lead to such a conclusion.  But I really do not think this was a message on Pawlak's part  that he was acting against the SLD's interests, but, instead, it  was a message that he intends to be the prime minister and the  Cabinet's chief.    At any rate, I will be blunt about this: The previous  finance minister acted inconsiderately.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] It can be concluded from what you are  saying that both sides are to blame for the flaws in cooperation  between the coalition partners.    [Miller] It all began with the prime minister. After all,  the first scandal we went through, even before the formal  establishment of the government, had to do with presenting the  president with a different government composition than what had  been agreed upon with us. But one can say that both sides  provided a lot of reasons for the decrease in mutual confidence.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] But, if a compromise with the Belweder  turns out to be impossible, are you not afraid that the PSL will  take the Belweder's side in the end?    [Miller] The coalition gains strength with each passing day.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Does Pawlak have to be afraid that, being  only with the SLD and with no support from the Belweder, he will  eventually be dominated by the SLD?    [Miller] No. Pawlak is this government's prime minister.  Besides, I have a feeling that the PSL will win the  self-governmental elections and that that will strengthen  Pawlak's position.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Do you agree with the views expressed by  some right-wing politicians that the president's moves are  purely destructive and disastrous to the country?    [Miller] That would be an overstatement. Walesa has acted  very responsibly at a few historical times. But I have a  feeling that the closer we get to the elections, the more the  president wants to approach Poland mainly from the standpoint of  the elections.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] But a preelection fever is also visible in  the SLD. We have been getting messages concerning friction  between Kwasniewski and Oleksy. We hear that a competition is  beginning about who is to be the candidate.    [Miller] There are such differences, and they will be there  in the future. You, gentlemen, are familiar with the SLD's  leadership so you know that it comprises ambitious people who  have their own views that they do not give up easily. There was  a time when Kwasniewski and I were perceived to be opponents. I  can see that a need is emerging for another antagonism-based  duo. The election campaign will be conducive to a rise in  temperature also within the SLD.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] In an article of yours published in  TRYBUNA, you wrote that "there is a need for a coalition  agreement in the presidential elections." Is that supposed to  mean that the PSL and the SLD should come up with a joint  candidate?    [Miller] If one could do that, it would be the best  solution. But if we do not accomplish that, then what we should  agree upon, at the least, is that we, for instance, will not  interfere with each other in the first round of the elections,  and that we support a joint candidate in the second round.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] But it could happen that candidates for  both the PSL and the SLD will enter the second round.    [Miller] In that case, that would be much harder to  accomplish.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Is it conceivable to you that Pawlak should  be the SLD's candidate in the elections?    [Miller] I refuse to answer the question. Or maybe not.  During the previous presidential elections, I submitted  Aleksander Kwasniewski's candidacy for president of the Polish  Republic at a session of the Chief Council of Social Democracy  of the Polish Republic. I will gladly do the same thing again.    [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Is the cooperation between the coalition  partners up to now--within Pawlak's government--good grounds to  believe that an agreement like that is possible?    [Miller] I think it is. We still have a few months ahead of  us during which more events may unfold that will strengthen the  coalition. Right now, I sometimes have a feeling that our  electorates are closer to each other than the leaders, while the  process of rapprochement between the electorates will continue.  That pressure will also be of some importance.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Nabors, a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1978, is principally engaged in the business of contract drilling and other oilfield services. It has one class of stock, voting common stock, which is traded on the American Stock Exchange (the ``AMEX''). As of October 31, 1993, approximately 18% of Nabors' stock was held by the Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Martin J. Whitman is Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of the Fund. As of October 31, 1993, he owned approximately 7.8% of the outstanding stock of the Fund. Mr. Whitman serves as a director of Nabors and has a financial interest in Nabors other than through the Fund by virtue of his direct and indirect ownership interests in various private partnerships that hold Nabors stock. (As of October 31, 1993, these partnerships owned in the aggregate approximately 3% of the outstanding stock of Nabors.) Mr. Whitman also controls 100% of the outstanding common stock of EQSF, the Fund's investment adviser. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Applicants seek relief on behalf of themselves and any individuals (other than Mr. Whitman) who require relief from section 17(a) and rule 17d&hyph;1 (collectively, ``Affected Persons''). ``Affected Persons'' are officers, directors, or employees of Nabors, the Fund, and EQSF who own shares of the Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the ``Reorganization Agreement''), the Fund proposes to transfer to Nabors all of its assets, other than cash and cash equivalents equal to $1 million, but none of its liabilities. The $1 million retained by the Fund shall be placed in a ``Reserve Fund'' for payment of any contingent liabilities and obligations of the Fund. In exchange for the Fund's assets, Nabors will transfer to the Fund shares of Nabors stock, as described more fully in the next paragraph. The exchange of Fund assets for Nabors stock will occur on the ``Closing Date.'' As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, the Fund will liquidate and dsitribute pro rata to its stockholders of record the shares of Nabors stock received by the Fund pursuant to the Reoganization Agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Immediately prior to the reorganization, the Fund's assets will consist entirely of Nabors stock, cash, and cash equivalents. For purposes of the reoganization, shares of Nabors stock will be valued at the average of the closing prices of Nabors stock for the five trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date (the ``Market Price of Nabors Stock''). <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  Cash and cash equivalents held by the Fund will be valued in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The number of shares of Nabors stock to be issued to the Fund in the reorganization will be determined by dividing the aggregate value of the assets transferred from the Fund to Nabors by the Market Price of Nabors Stock. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Boards of the Fund and Nabors believe that using a five-day average, rather than a single day's price, would decrease the possibility of manipulation of Nabors stock by third party market participants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 7. The Reserve Fund is designed to satisfy any currently unknown contingent liabilities that may become actual after liquidation of the Fund. Potential contingent liabilities include the possibility that the IRS or a state tax authority would assert that the Fund has made inadequate provision for taxes on past transactions, or that the Fund's net asset value had been erroneously computed. Although the Fund currently is unaware of any such liabilities, the Reserve Fund will be established to protect Fund officers and directors, who otherwise would be personally liable for such liabilities. The Reserve Fund shall be administered by one or more of the Fund's disinterested directors. Any amounts remaining in the Reserve Fund upon its termination (which, under applicable Maryland law shall occur no earlier than three years from its inception) shall be distributed  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> to the Fund's stockholders of record as of the Closing Date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. The Fund will bear all of the expenses associated with the reorganization, except that Nabors will bear all legal fees incurred by it related to the negotiation of the Reorganization Agreement. Applicants expect the total cost of the Reorganization to range from $400,000 to $450,000, of which the Fund will pay all but approximately $100,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. The Reorganization Agreement has been approved by the Board of Directors of the Fund, including the disinterested directors thereof, and by the Board of Directors of Nabors, including the nonmanagement directors thereof. (The two boards have one common member, Mr. Whitman.) Consumation of the reorganization is subject to the Commission's issuance of the order requested by applicants and to the approval of Fund stockholders. The Reorganization Agreement will be submitted to the stockholders of the Fund for approval at a special meeting. Fund stockholders will receive a proxy statement/prospectus containing information about Nabors and describing the proposed reorganization and the reasons therefor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. In approving the Reorganization Agreement, the Fund Board considered a number of factors. First, and most important, the reorganization is tax-free. The Fund received an IRS ruling on May 20, 1993, to the effect that, for federal income tax purposes, the reorganization will be tax-free to the Fund, the Fund's stockholders, and Nabors. Alternatives to the reorganization, including a simple liquidation of the Fund, would result in a taxable event to both the Fund and its stockholders. In this regard, applicants note that alternatives to the reorganization would require the Fund to pay tax, estimated to be about $30.3 million (approximately 35% of the Fund's net asset value), on the capital gains attributable to the appreciation of Nabors stock held by the Fund. In addition, the Fund Board considered that (i) the reorganization will eliminate the management fee currently paid by Fund stockholders, because such individuals will own Nabors stock directly, rather than indirectly through the Fund; (ii) Fund shareholders will receive readily marketable securities, since Nabors stock is traded on the AMEX; and (iii) the costs to the Fund of engaging in the reorganization will not be significant in relation to the benefits conferred. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

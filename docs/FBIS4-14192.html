			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Tahir al-Masri, speaker of the House of  Representatives, has received at Parliament Wang Zhaoguo, vice  chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], and members of the  accompanying delegation.    The Chinese delegation had previously held a series of  contacts and meetings that are summed up in the following report  by our correspondent:    During his meeting with CPPCC Vice Chairman Wang Zhaoguo and  members of the accompanying delegation, House of Representatives  Speaker Tahir al-Masri said that Jordan, under the leadership of  His Majesty King Husayn, believes that real peace should be  founded on bases that secure its continuation and  comprehensiveness and recognize the legitimate rights of the  Palestinians and of all the peoples in the region.    Al-Masri stressed that Israel has not shown real interest in  the peace process nor has it demonstrated a commitment to the  resolutions of international legitimacy and a willingness to  save the region from the whirlpool of conflict by ending the  causes of this conflict.    Al-Masri said that the House of Representatives decided to  send parliamentary delegations to a number of countries,  including China, to explain the dimensions of the siege imposed  on the Port of al-'Aqabah and the harm it is causing to the  Jordanian people.    For his part, Zhaoguo said that the Chinese people highly  appreciate Jordan's accomplishments under the leadership of His  Majesty King Husayn in all fields, especially in terms of  entrenching a democratic regime inspired from Jordan's own  characteristics and genuine Jordanian traditions.    Zhaoguo explained that the Middle East problem is one of the  oldest and most complex international conflicts. He noted that  China believes that this problem can only be solved through  peaceful negotiations in order to reach a solution that secures  the national rights of the Palestinian people--a peace based on  the principles and related resolutions of international  legitimacy.    Zhaoguo said he will convey to the Chinese Parliament and  Government the suffering of the Jordanian people as a result of  al-'Aqabah siege. He stressed that the Chinese people deeply  sympathize with the Jordanian people, hoping that this problem  will be solved soon. [passage omitted]</p>

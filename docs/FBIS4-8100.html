			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Havel by Czech Radio </F> editor Robert Tamchyna at Havel's private residence at Hradecek;  date not given: from the "Conversations at Lany" program --  recorded]    [Excerpts] [Tamchyna] Are you really remote from political  activities here at Hradecek? I saw a helicopter with Rudolf  Scharping, chairman of the German Social Democratic Party, land  close to your cottage. It occurred to me that the subject of  your talks was probably urgent when you received your guest at  the time of your convalescence, and, on top of it, your meeting  was longer than originally expected.    [Havel] I am very grateful to Mr. Scharping that, in spite  of  his very full program, he came all the way here. I admit that I  quite like to talk about certain things with certain politicians  in this type of total privacy. It contributes to the talks  being more confidential, more open-minded, and also more  sincere. The talks made a very good impression on me. Rudolf  Scharping is a man belonging to a younger generation. He is 11  years younger than I, and he seems to be a dynamic politician.  Of course, we talked about general matters related to Europe,  to the European security arrangements, Russia, the European  Union, and so on. However, great attention was also paid to  bilateral questions, especially to the two rather sensitive  subjects--the Sudeten German question and the matter of  compensation.    To inform him, I summarized all the developments around all  the negotiations that have taken place up until now. I do not  want to be specific. It would be premature. However, I can  definitely say that I found in Rudolf Scharping a very sensitive  partner in these matters, a very understanding partner, and we  understood each other very well. [passage omitted]    [Tamchyna] A very interesting and important meeting of six  European presidents is awaiting you at Litomysl next week [15-16  April]. Among other things, you are expected unofficially to  thank German President Richard von Weizsacker. Is it only my  impression that you have been very close to each other also  outside the scope of politics?    [Havel] I hold President Weizsacker in very high esteem. I  think we are bound by good friendship. I had some contact with  him long before I became president and before the fall of  communism. It was understandably only written contact. We often  talked about a great variety of things, and I am also thankful  for his help because, in the early stages of my presidency, he  managed to give me good advice in some difficult moments. I  think he is a great politician who has substantially contributed  to Germany's trustworthiness precisely in the crucial period of  the fall of communism, of the beginnings of German unification,  when fears started to appear about great Germany. We know well  enough that many people and many politicians--secretly and even  openly, by public statements--did not really wish for  unification of Germany. They feared that Germany would be too  great, too powerful, and too dominant on the European scene.  Although as president, Weizsacker's power is limited, he has  proved a lot by his words, by the stature of his pronouncements  and deeds. He has really done a lot for Germany's credibility  precisely in this crucial period. I think he really deserves a  thank you from the presidents of the neighboring countries for  everything he has done for the good relations between Germany  and its neighbors.    [Tamchyna] What are you going to take to Litomysl? It was  announced that substantial political talks were not expected.  Is it possible to move on at a summit of this kind?    [Havel] It depends on our understanding of substantial  political talks. None of us thinks that this meeting is going  to be a founding meeting of some new international group, nor do  we expect that some international initiative or declaration will  be issued or treaties and pacts signed. Nothing of the sort.  The intention is to discuss some matters of principle but to  discuss them within the context of unofficial presidential  debate. I said in Salzburg that it was the duty of governments  and executives to debate all everyday, specific political  matters related to interstate relations, but the duty of  presidents, which stems also from their constitutional position,  is something different.

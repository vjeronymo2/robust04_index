			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: Havas chief sees 'real opportunity' for growth Havas, the French media and leisure group, yesterday confirmed that it was on course for profits growth this year and announced plans to reinforce its links with France Telecom, the state-controlled telecommunications group. Mr Pierre Dauzier, chairman, told Havas's annual general meeting in Paris that it had 'a real opportunity for profits recovery' in 1994. Havas, which was hit last year by economic recession, saw net profits fall to FFr708m (Dollars 129m) from FFr823m in 1992. The group has already experienced an increase in sales this year with turnover growth of 6.1 per cent for the first quarter continuing through April and May. It should also benefit from exceptional profits on various transactions against a FFr60m exceptional debit last year. Havas said it expected to make an exceptional profit of FFr55m on a deal completed yesterday whereby it has taken full control of Office d'Annonces (ODA), the advertising arm of France Telecom's directories. The deal leaves France Telecom as a significant minority shareholder in Havas with a 5.5 per cent stake following the issue of 2.7m new Havas shares. Mr Dauzier yesterday stressed that the ODA transaction was intended to be a catalyst for future co-operation between the two French groups. 'This deal cements our relationship,' he said. The relationship between Havas and France Telecom has already attracted controversy following the recent row over the resignation of Mr Andre Rousselet as chairman of the Canal Plus media group. Mr Rousselet's resignation followed moves against him by Havas and other shareholders. Mr Rousselet claimed the moves were part of France Telecom's long-running efforts to win influence over Canal Plus.</p>

			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> DETECTIVE TESTIFIES MARTIN, NOT FRIEND, WAS AT WHEEL IN CRASH  </P> <P> A private investigator testified today that former major-league Manager Billy  Martin was driving when his pickup truck went out of control last Christmas Day  and smashed into a culvert.  </P> <P> Martin's companion that night, Detroit bar owner William Reedy, is on trial for  driving while intoxicated, but he has maintained that Martin was behind the  wheel.  </P> <P> William Fischer, a private investigator from Endicott, N.Y., and Ft.  Lauderdale, Fla., said his examination of the truck the morning after the  accident showed several signs that Martin, and not Reedy, was driving.  </P> <P> Fischer said the fabric on the left knee of the pants Reedy was wearing when  the crash occurred was imprinted on the dashboard of the pickup truck just to  the right of the steering wheel. That indicated that Reedy slid across from the  passenger side of the vehicle on impact, Fischer said.  </P> <P> In addition, the private detective said that a footprint in the foot well on  the passenger side of the truck matched a shoe Reedy had on and that an imprint  on Reedy's jacket that night appeared to have been made by the radio panel of  the truck.  </P></p>

			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / A mini-scare on the economy Was robust US economic growth at the end of last year a statistical illusion  -the temporary fruits of increasingly desperate attempts by the Bush administration to secure a convincing recovery ahead of last November's election? A school of bearish economists has always harboured doubts. Mr Jay Levy, senior pessimist at the Jerome Levy Economics Institute, claims that last year's upturn was largely induced by a relaxation of fiscal policy, following the cut in tax withholding rates last spring and efforts to accelerate federal spending. Between July and early September, the Federal Reserve did its bit by cutting the already low federal funds rate by three quarters of a point. Sceptics are having a field day. On Tuesday the Conference Board announced gloomy figures suggesting that most of the post-election surge in consumer confidence had evaporated by March, when its index fell to the miserably low level of 62.6, far below normal recovery levels. On Thursday, the Purchasing Managers' Index - a reliable barometer of conditions in manufacturing - was reported well down for the second month running. On Friday, markets were zapped by official figures showing a fall in payroll employment of 22,000 last month, against projections of an increase of 100,000-150,000. Rattled by the prospect of a price war in the tobacco industry, shares went into a tailspin, pulling the Dow Jones index down nearly 70 points by the end of trading. Cabinet officials jumped on the figures. 'We're sure not coming out of this recession,' said treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who is annoyed that Senate republicans are still blocking the administration's Dollars 16bn fiscal stimulus package. Mr Robert Reich, the labour secretary (who would spend much of the cash on a summer jobs programme), gloomily reiterated earlier warnings that the economy was still too weak to generate 'full-time permanent jobs'. Nobody doubts that the economy has slowed from the unsustainable 4.7 per cent annual rate of growth registered in the fourth quarter. At issue is the precise rate of growth at which it is now settling. If it were to prove less than 3 per cent, unemployment might not fall below the current level of 7 per cent, which would cause consternation at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. Pressure for a more expansionary fiscal and monetary policy could build up rapidly, casting doubt on medium-term efforts to reduce the budget deficit, which are anyway far less ambitious than most pundits realise. Fortunately, growth appears more robust than the chronically volatile monthly figures might suggest. The drop in employment last month was partly a reflection of severe winter storms and partly a correction following the outsized 367,000 leap in payrolls in February. Taking the first quarter as a whole, employment grew at an average monthly rate of 125,000, against 85,000 in the fourth quarter of last year and 38,000 in the preceding three quarters. This is respectable given slower growth of the labour force than in previous recoveries. The Conference Board probably overstated the fall in consumer confidence: the rival University of Michigan index points to an improvement in consumer sentiment at the end of last month. Actual spending, meanwhile, has held up quite well: data for January and February point to real growth of consumer spending at an annual rate of 3.5 per cent in the first quarter. Factory orders are running nearly 11 per cent higher than this time last year; industrial production, while losing a little momentum, is still up more than 4 per cent on an annual comparison. Fears that the recovery is fading are hard to square with tentative signs of rising inflationary pressures, which have squelched the bond market's impressive rally (long yields have edged back above 7 per cent). For bond traders the most unnerving aspect of Friday's jobs report was the 0.5 per cent rise in average hourly earnings last month. This follows a pick up in both consumer and wholesale price inflation since the start of the year: excluding food and energy (which tend to be volatile) consumer and producer prices are growing at an annual rate of 4.5 per cent and 3.4 per cent, compared with 3.2 per cent and 0.7 per cent respectively in the second half of last year. Some, but not all, commodity price indices have also risen sharply since Christmas. The price figures are causing much head-scratching, not least at the Fed, which in February was predicting further falls in consumer price inflation, to perhaps 2.5 per cent against 3.0 per cent last year. Unless the wave of restructuring in US industry has caused a mismatch between worker skills and employment opportunities, thus raising the 'natural' rate of unemployment (the rate consistent with stable inflation), it is hard to see why inflationary pressures should be emerging this soon; yet the range of indicators pointing to a stirring of inflation seems too broad to be readily dismissed as a fluke. The pessimists are wrong to fear a sudden collapse in growth. The more insidious danger is that the Fed, eager to remain friends with the White House, will delay tightening monetary policy for too long, in the process squandering its opportunity to lock in very low inflation.</p>

The indefinite decision also applies to his relatives  and officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross  [ICRC]. Baharuddin Lopa, director general for corrections of  the Justice Department, told reporters in Jakarta this afternoon  that the decision was made because Xanana had discredited  Indonesia's reputation in the international community by sending  a letter to the Portuguese Government and the International  Commission of Justice.    Baharuddin Lopa said the Indonesian Government was generous  enough to allow Xanana's family and ICRC officials to see him  without the presence of any Indonesian official. Xanana,  however, had abused the generosity by smuggling out the letter.    According to Baharuddin Lopa, an agreement will  automatically  become null and void if either party violates it under  international law. In the wake of the incident, the director  general for corrections has instructed his subordinates to  closely guard Xanana in case the rebel leader is again allowed  to receive visitors.</p>

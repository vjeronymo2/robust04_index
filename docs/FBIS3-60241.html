			<p>Language: <F P=105> Burmese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Release" issued by the Foreign Ministry of the Union </F> of Myanmar [Burma] -- dated 30 December 1993]    [Text] The Government of the Union of Myanmar [Burma] has  become a party to the following convention and protocol by  accession and acceptance on 24 November 1992:    The Vienna Convention for the protection of the ozone layer  completed in Vienna on 22 March 1985; Montreal Protocol on  Substances that Deplete Ozone Layer completed at Montreal on 16  September 1987; and Amendments to the Montreal Protocol on  Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer adjusted at the second  meeting of the parties on 29 June 1990.    The Vienna Convention provides a framework containing an  agreement in principle to cooperate in protection of the ozone  layer and the Montreal Protocol classifies actions to phase out  the ozone depleting substances, such as chlorofluorocarbons,  CFC, by the end of this century.    As a party to the protocol, Myanmar will be spared from the  trade restrictions imposed by the protocol and will be allowed  to import controlled substances within a 10-year grace period  for limited domestic use for refrigeration and air conditioning.    Additionally, the protocol will provide Myanmar assistance  to  obtain ozone friendly technology and financial assistance to  affect the necessary readjustment. Furthermore, Myanmar's  accession to these important instruments underlines its  commitment and responsibility to protect the global environment.    Since the establishment of the National Commission for  Environmental Affairs in February 1990, the Union of Myanmar  signed in June 1992 the United Nations Framework Convention on  Climate Change and the Convention on Biological Diversity.</p>

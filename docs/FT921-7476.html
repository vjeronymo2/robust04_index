			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Brussels faces united German opposition on budget increase THE European Commission is facing the danger of a united German political establishment opposed to its demands for a substantial increase in funding for the European Community budget. Outright opposition from Germany, which is the effective paymaster of the EC as by far its largest net contributor, would be likely to undermine the entire budget strategy of Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, who is looking for large-scale new funds to help the poorer member states join the eventual European economic and monetary union (Emu). The opposition Social Democrats (SPD) yesterday called on the German government to reject any move to raise the ceiling on EC budget spending above the present level of 1.2 per cent of gross national product. They said any such move was unacceptable above all in Germany, which had already reached 'financial breaking point.' Within hours, the move brought a response from Mr Helmut Kohl's own Christian Democrats (CDU), saying the opposition was pushing on an open door. Mr Hans Peter Schmidtz, a deputy leader of the CDU group in the German parliament, said it was 'self-evident that the burden on Germany should not increase.' It now looks inevitable that the budget debate for the EC will become inextricably linked with the difficult debate in Germany over the ratification of the Maastricht treaties on political as well as economic union, presenting the Kohl government with an acute EC headache both with its supporters and the opposition. The SPD case against a budget increase was presented yesterday by Mrs Ingrid Mattaus-Maier, a deputy parliamentary leader and finance spokesman. She attacked above all the European Commission's proposal to increase the absolute level of spending on agriculture, in spite of its hopes to reform the policy and cut production of food mountains. She said that according to the Commission forecasts, Germany's payments to the EC budget would increase by 50 per cent, from DM40bn to more than DM60bn by 1997, a period in which the German government budget was limited to an increase of just 13 per cent. She said that the SPD had no intention of linking the budget issue to ratification of the Maastricht treaties, for which SPD support is needed for a two-thirds majority in the parliament. But government officials fear that is exactly what will happen. The Maastricht treaty process is already complicated by the demands of the 16 German federal states to play a much greater role in EC decision-making wherever their interests are involved. Ratification in Germany is likely to take all year. On top of that, the government itself is divided on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, with half urging more radical moves to enable a deal in the world trade liberalisation talks, and half seeking to protect Germany's small farmers.</p>

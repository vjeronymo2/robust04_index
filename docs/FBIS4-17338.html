			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 22 Apr -- Boris Yeltsin has backed the State  Duma's decision on granting live broadcast time to the various  political forces for discussion of the treaty on the attainment  of civic accord in Russia. He announced this in the Kremlin  today at a working conference of those participating in the  agreement on the attainment of civic accord in Russia.    "Russia has an alternative to confrontation," Boris Yeltsin  declared. According to him, the document on civic accord that  has been prepared "is an agreement of which all the social and  political forces are the authors."    The president noted that "each side will commit itself to  implementing the treaty; everyone will have to give up  something." "Calm in Russia is the main thing; for the sake of  that, one must impose limitations on oneself and find a salutary  compromise."    Boris Yeltsin is certain that "the country is badly in need  of a new political culture." In his opinion, a permanently  operating mechanism for accord must be devised. Analysing the  draft agreement that was achieved, Boris Yeltsin noted that all  political and social forces needed to prove in practice that  "extremism is ineffective in politics."</p>

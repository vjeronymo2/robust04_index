			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Arts: The Bjork saga Bjork is the biggest thing to come out of Iceland since Eric the Red. First as front singer for cutesy band the Sugarcubes, and now very much her own invention, she has done even more for her home land than the cod. With a smash album, Debut, riding the charts, and a brace of Brit awards in her anorak, the lady was in sparky form at the Royalty on Thursday night. Bjork rhymes with squawk, and she likes to interpret her songs through screeches, little chirrups, and sudden croaks. Anyone bored with waiting for Kate Bush would be happy with Bjork. Apart from her unsettling vocal attack she also has Kate Bushed in her stage mannerisms. She scampers on like a bird in white satin, swooping with outstretched arms before settling at the mike. There are plenty of jumps and skips during the performance as well as geisha like bobbing gestures. Of course it is outrageously contrived, but fun. The songs, mainly about love among the glaciers, are excellent, plaintive and pure, especially the genuine frustrations in 'There's more to life than this' and the credibly innocent 'Violently Happy'. It took the audience time to adjust to this doll-like creature with the corkscrew curls overdosing on whimsy, but eventually they were on their feet swaying to music with a clever dance rhythm behind its innocence. Then it was 'thank you vewy, vewy, vewy, much' and off for the next stage in the saga. The band was noisy, but what's new. This odd little talent will go mega.</p>

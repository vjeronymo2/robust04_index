			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Malay rubber imports up Malaysia, until the late 1980s the world's biggest natural rubber exporter, has had to import record amounts of the commodity this year to fuel its own processing industry. Natural rubber imports increased by 96 per cent in the first five months of this year to 94,400 tonnes, the Malaysian statistics department said. In 1988 Malaysia produced 1.8m tonnes of natural rubber, but this year's production is forecast to be about 1m tonnes. Natural rubber exports in the first five months of the year were down 6 per cent at 365,000 tonnes. Labour shortages, sharp increases in land values and a period of low natural rubber prices which lasted until earlier this year have forced many growers to turn to more lucrative commodities like palm oil or sell their land for development. The country's processing factories have had to make up for a shortfall in local supply through increased imports, mainly from Thailand and Burma. Malaysia's processing industry uses about 300,000 tonnes of natural rubber each year.</p>

More than 25 million people went to the polls, with the  highest voter turnout recorded in Lvov, Ternopol,  Ivano-Frankovsk, Donetsk, Lugansk, Poltava, Khmelnitsky and  Kharkov regions. The turnout of voters in the Republic of  Crimea was 71 per cent. In Kiev, slightly more than a half of  the electorate cast their votes.    Only 49 out of the prospective 450-member parliament were  elected in the first round of polling (25 had been nominated by  parties and 24 are nonparty people).    Run-offs are to be held in 401 districts before 10 April.  However, Central Electoral Commission Chief Ivan Yemets believes  that in the majority of districts run-offs may be held this  coming weekend, with only two candidates in each district to  contest seats in parliament.</p>

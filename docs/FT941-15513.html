			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: TSB's tough task The leap from Pounds 5m to Pounds 301m in TSB's annual profits is gratifying. But it reflects more the fading impact of past mistakes than any vindication of current strategy. Strip away the impact of lower provisions and profits grew only 11 per cent. Factor the exceptional Pounds 70m restructuring charge back into staff costs and operating profits would have been flat. There is not much sign of the bancassurance concept putting revenue on an inexorably upward track. By keeping deposit rates high, TSB is sacrificing banking income to attract customers into its branches so that it can sell them insurance. Lending margins will come under pressure this year as the mortgage market becomes more competitive. Flat operating profit is a common problem for banks thanks to the impact of low base rates and the failure of economic recovery to restore loan demand. That may explain the industry's renewed emphasis on shedding jobs. At least TSB can console itself with the fact that return on capital in its retail bank is already 20 per cent. Barring any serious upsets over pension refunds, which have been flagged but not publicly quantified as a possible problem, group return should rise steadily to the target 15 per cent as problem loans wind down. That still begs the question of what TSB should do with its surplus capital. Yesterday's statement seemed designed to steer expectations away from a special dividend, but the tier one capital ratio is already 8.7 per cent and rising. Sooner or later TSB may have to choose between a share buy-back or another risky acquisition.</p>

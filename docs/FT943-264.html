			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Eurocopter to develop new civil aircraft in Russia Eurocopter, the Franco-German maker of helicopters, has created a joint venture with Mil, the Russian aircraft design bureau, to study the development of a large civil helicopter capable of carrying 30 passengers. The deal is a significant advance in co-operation between western aerospace companies and manufacturers in the former Soviet Union and breaks ground in technical co-operation between old adversaries. Mil, which also produces military helicopters, designed the heavily armed Red Army gunships which would have fought Nato in a European war. Similarly, Eurocopter is designing the Tiger anti-tank attack helicopter which should be deployed with Nato forces by the year 2000. Initially the venture will produce a relatively inexpensive feasibility study but investment of up to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) could be required if the helicopter is put into design and production. Under the terms of the agreement, Eurocopter would provide the avionics, cockpit and cabin layout with Mil controlling the overall design. The engines for the heavy-lift helicopter will be produced by the Kazan-based Klimov company. If it is built, the 14-tonne helicopter could challenge the Anglo-Italian EH101 in the large passenger transport sector of the market in 10 years. Sikorsky of the US is also considering production of a large transport helicopter. Most helicopters of this type are produced for military purposes, and the civilian market has been limited to specialist applications such as transporting oil workers offshore. Eurocopter, itself a joint company between Aerospatiale of France and Deutsche Aerospace, was aware of Mil's intention to build a heavy passenger helicopter, and realised it could have a market in the west, with the advantage of low costs. Eurocopter will be responsible for all sales outside Russia.</p>

			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Charities seek relief from VAT THE Pounds 250m annual burden of value added tax on charities is a disincentive to voluntary activity, the Charities' Tax Reform Group has told the government. Many charities lose the equivalent of 10 per cent or more of their donations in unrecoverable VAT. This, says the group, discourages volunteers and may explain the fall in financial support. The group is proposing a system of VAT rebates similar to relief for councils and health authorities. Under the proposal, charities would pay VAT like commercial organisations but be able to recover an equivalent amount annually.</p>

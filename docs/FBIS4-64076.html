			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian presidential press-secretary Vyacheslav  Kostikov criticized on behalf of Boris Yeltsin the steps taken  by the State Duma for the creation of its own TV and Radio  service with a compulsory system of daily broadcasting on state  television channels.    In a statement released on Thursday the press secretary  noted  that "the president is concerned that the resumption of  information dictate may lead to the fall of the State Duma's  prestige, and this in turn would damage the process of  strengthening civil accord."    The practice of infringement by the former Supreme Council  on  the prerogatives of a free media being reanimated in the new  parliament has already been resolutely rejected by Russian  public opinion, the statement says.    Kostikov pointed out that neither the president, nor the  government, nor the Federation Council have their own  broadcasting service. The State Duma's attempts to in essence  create information privileges for itself can be described as an  aspiration of one of the power branches to violate the division  of powers already fixed in the Constitution, the statement  points out. "The pernicious consequences of such tactics are  well known."    "The president urges deputies of the State Duma to show  wisdom, political tact, and to take into account lessons of  history," Kostikov noted.</p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / How to Spend It: The pick of the (artificial) bunch IF YOU thought artificial flowers were the sort of naffery that went with flying ducks, garden gnomes and dear little knick-knacks all over the place, then you should hurry along to Pulbrook &amp; Gould where there are silk flowers to make you think again. Pulbrook &amp; Gould is that most establishment, most revered of florists, and when it decides to do something it does it properly - nothing but the best silk and tender hand-painting for them. Roses, hydrangeas, daffodils, tulips, polyanthus . . . almost everything the garden has, Pulbrook &amp; Gould now offers in silk. Some prefer silk flowers to look as real as possible, and P&amp;G has these in splendidly realistic ready-made arrangements. Personally, I think they look best when used as a witty conceit, when their artificiality is all part of the fun. The tulips planted in strict little rows, like the ones in the picture above, work, to my mind, better than the large mixed bunches pretending to be real. But each to his own taste - Pulbrook &amp; Gould will sell the flowers singly (medium tulips Pounds 10.50, large Pounds 12.50) or make up arrangements in customers' containers or to suit customers' own colour schemes. Pulbrook &amp; Gould is at Liscartan Houses, 127 Sloane Street, London SW1X 9AS.</p>

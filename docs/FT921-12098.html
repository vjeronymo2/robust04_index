			<p>920129 FT  29 JAN 92 / Italian politicians scent wind of change: The referendum is emerging as the country's best reform tool PACKED into 230 boxes, papers containing 1.37m signatures calling for referendums on electoral reform of the senate and Italy's municipalities have just been despatched to the supreme court. The signatures will now go through a lengthy process of scrutiny before being passed to the constitutional court which will pronounce on the legitimacy of the referendums demanded. 'This is a crucial stage because the constitutional court could well decide to reject them,' says Mr Mario Segni, a Christian Democrat member of parliament who is one of the leading sponsors of these referendums. The Italian constitution only permits the principle of an abrogative referendum. He knows this from bitter experience. In January last year the court rejected referendums on electoral reform of the senate and the municipalities similar to what is now being proposed, on the grounds that they were propositive. Only one was admitted, abolishing the multi-preference system of voting for the chamber of deputies, because it was abrogative. This latter referendum was held in June and despite the hostility of the main political parties, which regarded it as a deliberate attempt to limit their traditional hold over the choice of candidates, 27m Italians gave an overwhelming endorsement. 'This vote changed the face of Italian politics. It was an enormous demonstration that the Italian electorate wants to change the present political structure,' says Mr Segni. He is not alone in such a view. A sizeable proportion of politicians across the party spectrum sensed the wind of change and put their individual names behind Mr Segni's new referendum campaign, which began in October and whose first stage has just concluded with the collection of signatures. Indeed, the referendum has come to be seen as the most effective tool of trying to force change on the ossified Italian political system. No fewer than nine different referendums are being canvassed by a varied assortment of politicians and pressure groups. Starting with the 1974 referendum on divorce, this device has been traditionally exploited on very specific issues such as abortion, hunting and shooting, nuclear power (a 1987 referendum discarded nuclear power as an energy source). Never before has there been such a quantity of referendums promoted simultaneously with such overtly political aims. The three canvassed by Mr Segni and his supporters are the broadest in scope. Two concern reform of the senate, discarding the existing system of proportional representation and introducing a hybrid - 268 of the 315 seats would be elected by a British-style first-past-the-post rule, while the remaining 77 would be elected on a proportional basis. The third Segni referendum proposes that in municipal elections the list with the most votes obtains three-quarters of the seats, and mayors should be directly elected. If approved, electoral reform of the senate would tend to break up the existing multi-party structure and force the formation of larger political groupings. It would also oblige the parties to field competent candidates who could attract votes. In the case of local elections it would create greater local autonomy and accountability. Significantly, these reforms have been backed by Confindustria, the industrialists' association, and the church. Another three referendums, proposed by a committee headed by Prof Massimo Giannini, an expert on administrative law and a former minister, are narrower in scope. But in all three cases the effect would be to limit the dead hand of government favours and interference. One calls for abrogation of part of the law permitting government aid to the south so as to ensure future assistance only goes to productive investments; a second seeks to abolish the Ministry of State Shareholdings (currently controlled directly by Mr Giulio Andreotti, the prime minister, but liable to disappear as privatisation gathers pace), and the third wants to end the government's right to name the boards of savings banks by transfering the responsibility to their own boards. The Radical party is sponsoring two more referendums. One is intended to abolish the 1974 law concerning the public financing of political parties.( This law, incidentally, was subjected to a referendum in 1978 and won 57 per cent of the vote, but has never been respected). The Radicals in alliance with green groups are also seeking to legalise the personal use of drugs via referendum. The ninth referendum, promoted by environmentalist groups, aims to remove environmental controls from the ambit of the health service. Mr Segni says that with the exception of the legalisation of drug use, where there is a lot of resistance within the country, all the others stand a good chance of being approved. In order to prosper, a referendum proposal has to obtain more than 500,000 signatures within three months. 'We have had a tremendous response up and down the country,' he says. The campaigns have relied on mainly stands set up in big city thoroughfares manned by volunteers, with financing coming from private contributions to local committees. Only Mr Segni's Rome office has had a temporary staff of 15 with a L50m (Dollars 41,900) budget. Critics of the campaign argue it risks producing limited reform of bits of the political system which will make it more complex to operate. However, the referendum proposals will almost certainly push the issue of political reform to the forefront of the debate in the general elections, due in April. They may also force the next parliament to pass legislation which heads off the referendums.</p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei powers 7.8% ahead after reform agreement Share prices soared on the passage of the political reform bills through parliament over the weekend, and the Nikkei average jumped 7.8 per cent, rising above 20,000 for the first time in three months, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei rose 1,471.24, the third largest gain on record, to finish at the day's peak of 20,229.12. The index opened at the day's low of 18,790.78, with many shares failing to trade until the afternoon session because of a flood of buying orders from overseas and domestic investors. The Topix index of all first section stocks advanced 101.40 to 1,629.22, its fifth biggest single day's rise. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index moved ahead 18.08 to 1,373.12 as strategists said that this year's rally had much further to go. Investors were cheered by prospects of the imminent announcement of an economic stimulus package and an income tax cut now that the government has political reform out of the way. The announcement of a package of tax cuts and fiscal stimulus, estimated at around Y13,000bn is expected on Thursday. Volume was 800m shares, against 237m, with foreign and domestic individual investors actively buying shares. Almost all listed issues posted gains, with 1,109 advances, three declines and seven unchanged. A sharp fall in the bond market also supported sentiment, raising hopes that it would cause a shift in funds to equities. The yield on the No 157 10-year benchmark rose 5 basis points to 3.54 per cent, the highest since last November. Some domestic and foreign brokers believe that yesterday was a turning point for the market and the country's economy, but others have doubts. Many investors are still wary of corporate profit-taking ahead of the March book closing, and point out that buying by foreigners, who have been the main driving force for the market since the start of the year, has started to slow down. 'Economic fundamentals have not drastically changed,' said Mr Jason James, strategist at James Capel, adding that he had not revised his year-end target of 22,000 for the Nikkei. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gained by its day's limit of Y100,000 to Y978,000, while East Japan Railway climbed Y38,000 to Y516,000. Brokers were also supported, with Nomura adding Y250 at Y2,320. In Osaka, the OSE average surged 1,255.67 to 21,864.83 in volume of 41.8m shares. Roundup The region did not emulate Tokyo, but its equity markets were mostly on the upgrade. AUSTRALIA set a record high, helped mainly by overseas news. The All Ordinaries index rose 50.9, or 2.25 per cent, to 2,310.8 in ADollars 1.0bn turnover. One dealer said the March share price index futures contract contributed to the surge, with the contract jumping 44 to 2,328.0 after an intraday high of 2,346.0. Coles Myer appreciated 12 cents to ADollars 5.47 after announcing a 2.9 per cent rise in half-year sales to ADollars 8.16bn. HONG KONG overcame some midsession selling, prompted by worries about tougher mortgage policies, to finish almost 1 per cent higher. The Hang Seng index added 109.19 at 11,487.02 in prelim-inary turnover down from HKDollars 8.57bn to HKDollars 6.28bn. Hongkong and Shanghai Banking and Hang Seng Bank said late on Friday that they would lower the amount of financing available for mortgages and increase the lending rate for flats worth more than HKDollars 5m. HSBC advanced HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 115 and its Hang Seng unit climbed HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 75.50 amid expectations of positive corporate results in the banking sector. SINGAPORE continued to recover from the sharp losses experienced in the second week of January, on selective domestic and European institutional demand. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 39.03, or 1.7 per cent, to 2,339.10. KUALA LUMPUR closed higher, led by further institutional buying of selected blue chips. The composite index gained 16.93, or 1.6 per cent, at 1,106.99, but trading was subdued ahead of a market holiday today. MANILA ended lower as investors sold heavily to cut losses, although the fall was cushioned by renewed interest in Manila Electric and its affiliates, which are expected to benefit from a fuel and electricity price rise. The composite index fell 54.94, or 1.9 per cent, to 2,874.56. Manila Electric 'B' put on 15 pesos at 445 pesos. KARACHI resumed its uptrend after a three-day correction, on support from local institutions and renewed jobbers' interest. The KSE 100 index rose 18.78 to 2,244.78. SHANGHAI's 'B' share index drifted back on a disappointing debut by Shanghai Shangling Electric Appliances, the first 'B' share not to show a gain on its issue price on the first day of trading. The 'B' index fell 4.21 to 81.07 in volume of 15m shares. Shanghai Shangling opened at 78 US cents, but closed at its issue price of 75 US cents. NEW ZEALAND advanced 2.5 per cent, led by a 6.5 per cent gain in Telecom, up 30 cents at NZDollars 4.90. The NZSE-40 index rose 59.64 to 2,397.92 in turnover of NZDollars 78m.</p>

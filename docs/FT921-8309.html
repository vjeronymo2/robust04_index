			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Industrial action threat at BP plants SHOP STEWARDS at BP Chemicals' three main UK plants threatened industrial action yesterday over the company's decision to withdraw collective bargaining rights at the Baglan Bay plant in south Wales. But union representatives at Baglan Bay, Hull and Grangemouth, near Falkirk, decided to advise Baglan Bay members to accede to the company's request to sign personal contracts. Mr Fred Higgs, national secretary of the TGWU general union, said the advice to sign was intended to stop divisions among workers as some union members had already signed under threat of redundancy. 'The shop stewards decided that members at the three sites would be urged to take industrial action if the company does not remove the personal contracts and if its executives refuse to meet national officials over the issue.' BP Chemicals told the TGWU and the AEU engineering workers' union last week that it was giving 90 days notice of the end of collective pay agreements at Baglan Bay.</p>

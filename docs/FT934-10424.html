			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Welcome move on discrimination damages Sir, The hurt and the damage inflicted by racial discrimination have for too long been trivialised by the low level of damages industrial tribunals have been allowed to award. We therefore welcome ministers' announcements in recent days that the upper limit on compensation in discrimination cases is to be abolished. In the last year for which we have statistics the average award by tribunals was Pounds 3,165 and the average settlement Pounds 3,981. These sorts of amounts do not act as a proper deterrent and they do not encourage victims to take up cases. We have been pressing government for many years to make this change so that tribunal decisions can play a full part in the process of securing an end to discrimination in employment. The Marshall judgment in the European Court appears to have cut the Gordian knot for ministers and encouraged some clear action. It will fit well with the growing understanding in management practice that the provision of equality of opportunity is good for business, whereas discrimination is bad. The problem is that, while such arguments have been given wider currency in management theory, we still see discrimination playing an all too substantial part in the life of many ethnic minority employees. Meaningful and serious awards at tribunals will, we hope, help to clarify management minds on this. We also hope the government does not leave this proposal on the shelf so far as racial discrimination is concerned. A quick amendment bill this coming session would send the signal we have long wanted discriminators to get. Herman Ouseley, chair, Commission for Racial Equality, Elliot House, 10/12 Allington Street, London SW1E 5EH</p>

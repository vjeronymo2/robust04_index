BRIEFING;  </P> <P> EARNINGS;  </P> <P> DELTA SAYS FUEL WILL CUT PROFIT  </P> <P> Delta Air Lines said today that its earnings for the first quarter of its  fiscal year will be down sharply because of increased fuel prices that followed  the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.  </P> <P> Thomas J. Roeck Jr., Delta's senior vice president of finance, said earnings  for the quarter that will end Sunday would be "significantly worse" than those  for the same quarter last year, when the airline posted record profits.  </P> <P> Roeck said the airline is now paying 64% more for jet fuel than it was before  the Aug. 2 invasion. Delta has twice raised domestic air fares to help offset  the fuel price increases.  </P> <P> In the quarter ending last Sept. 30, net earnings were $133.1 million, or $2.38  per share, on revenue of $2.17 billion.  </P></p>

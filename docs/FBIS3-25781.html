			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] Taipei will not cut tariffs on more than 200  agricultural and industrial products, including automobiles, as  demanded by Washington D.C., Director of the Board of Foreign  Trade Huang Yen-chao stated. The some 200 items among 699  products were listed late last year by Washington for an  immediate 50 percent customs duty reduction. After discussions  and evaluation with concerned authorities, about 200 items have  no room for tariff cuts, Huang said. The government can reduce  import tax on about 70 of the 699 items, while the remaining  ones need to go through long resistance at the legislature  before duty reductions are possible, he added. Huang stated  tariff reduction rates and reasons behind the selective  reduction policy will be forwarded to Washington for explanation  within a week. The tariff reductions are expected to go into  effect within two months [words indistinct].    Taipei had intended to hold discussion with the U.S. on the  tariff reductions during bilateral assessment talks on Taiwan's  entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT]  slated for next month, but Washington, a key supporter of  Taipei's GATT membership, refused and demanded a consultation.</p>

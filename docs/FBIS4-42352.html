			<p>BFN     [Text] The Netherlands says it might contribute troops to  the United Nations force in Rwanda. Dutch Foreign Minister  Pieter Kooijmans and Development Cooperation Minister Jan Pronk  have told parliament that if the security situation in Rwanda  improves, they might be prepared to send troops after all. The  Hague has so far been reluctant to send troops because it fears  that Rwandans might think the troops come from Belgium.</p>

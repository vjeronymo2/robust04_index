			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CORONADO GANG  </P> <P> I am writing in response to an article titled "Coronado Question: Does It Have  a Gang Problem?" (Oct. 19) I find the so-called Coronado White Boys a revolting  and ill-humored joke. Any form of respect (or humor, for that matter) cannot be  dug up for these kids who make a feeble attempt at imitating those serious  gangs on the mainland. Just calling themselves a "gang" already has invited a  lot of dispute. Inevitably, so will it invite the serious gangs of San Diego.  </P> <P> Such easy prey as a group of Coronado White Boys would be a pleasure for those  gangs that dispute violently over colors and territory. Besides, any gang could  just hop in a car with two or more members, and drive over the bay for free.  The Coronado Bay Bridge begins in the Barrio Logan area of San Diego, a prime  hangout for local gangs. It would only be a five- to 10-minute commute over to  the island.  </P> <P> I suggest that these white boys be exposed to what gangs really are all about.  I suggest that they be taken away from their secure and untouched homes in  Coronado and placed in the middle of a gang-infested neighborhood. I'd like to  see their shocked faces as an innocent 10-year-old boy gets hit by gang  cross-fire at a public park. I'd like them to attend a high school where they  couldn't wear a certain color for fear of being terrorized by a gang. Would  these teens still mock and imitate a gang with humorous intent after seeing the  corruption and evil of a typical San Diego gang? Would they still have the  nerve to form a gang in their community after seeing the fear gangs create in  communities?  </P> <P> And the answer to the Coronado question? Yes, Coronado has a gang problem. If  these teens succeeded in forming a gang, with innocent intentions or not, then  Coronado should be shuddering with fear of the possibility that it too can be  infected with the widespread disease of gangs.  </P> <P> ERNESTO ANDRADE  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

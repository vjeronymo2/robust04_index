			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava June 7 (CTK) -- Cabinet has approved the  preliminary list of businesses to be privatised in the second  wave of coupon privatisation, announced Milan Janicina, the  privatisation minister. The list contains businesses with  property valued at 35 billion crowns.    In an IMF economic policy memorandum, the Slovak Government  has undertaken to privatise 500 state enterprises with a book  value of 220 billion crowns. The memorandum states that 88  billion crowns worth of property will be privatised through the  form of coupon privatisation. The preliminary list contains 40  percent of this amount.    Janicina said that of the 53 billion shortfall, the  government hopes to place 17 billion crowns of property from  energy and gas companies into coupon privatisation, a further 15  to 20 billion crowns of shares from the first wave held by the  National Property Fund, and another ten billion is still being  discussed by the appropriate ministries. Janicina said that a  number of businesses that would be privatised through standard  methods had been excluded from the list.    Privatisation of health facilities will be clarified by July  30. If these facilities do not find specific parties interested  in their purchase they will also be included in coupon  privatisation. The definitive list of businesses for the second  wave will be completed by August 15.</p>

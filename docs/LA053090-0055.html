			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JC BASEBALL;  </P> <P> HARBOR BEATS CHABOT FOR THIRD STATE TITLE  </P> <P> Harbor College won its third state title Tuesday by defeating Chabot, 5-2, at  the California Community College Baseball Championships. The Seahawks went  undefeated in the four-team, double-elimination tournament at UC Irvine.  </P> <P> "We put a lot of pressure on ourselves from Day 1," said Harbor Coach Jim  O'Brien, who has led the Seahawks to the state tournament eight times in 15  years.  </P> <P> "We had one goal in mind, to win state, and we would not have been happy with  anything less."  </P> <P> Harbor left-hander John Ingram (8-0) went the distance, giving up eight hits  and one earned run.  </P> <P> Harbor (51-5) scored two runs in the fifth inning, on a sacrifice fly by Mike  Berry and shortstop Aaron Ledesma's throwing error. Ledesma, an All-American  freshman, made three of the Gladiators' six errors.  </P> <P> Ledesma's error in the seventh inning allowed Berry to get on base and  eventually score on an error by catcher Corey Quinn. Harbor scored its last two  runs against reliever John Harris in the eighth inning.  </P> <P> Chabot's Norm Montoya (7-1) pitched seven innings, giving up five hits and one  earned run. Chabot finished at 43-12-1.  </P></p>

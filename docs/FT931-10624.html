			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / The Week Ahead RESULTS DUE THE RESULTS season springs to life on Thursday with a handful of the UK's largest companies reporting. British Petroleum's figures should show it has begun to recover from its recent nadir. Having halved the 4.2p quarterly dividend at the half-way stage, a further 2.1p is expected for the final quarter, making 10.5p (16.8p) for the year. With historical cost profits of Pounds 100m forecast for the final quarter, losses for the year are expected to be Pounds 487m (profits Pounds 1.2bn). Last year, BP heavily restructured management and operations while chemical markets remained poor, refining was mediocore and upstream operations went well thanks to the dollar and increased output. After several quarters of negative cashflow, it is expected to have been cash neutral in the final quarter. Lloyds Bank, which has been most profitable of the clearing banks in recent years, announces its full-year results for 1992 on Friday. It is the first big clearing bank to report after bringing forward its announcement by two weeks. Analysts anticipate pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 650m after last year's Pounds 645m, but one estimate is of Pounds 745m. Provisions for possible bad and doubtful debts are estimated at between Pounds 650m and Pounds 870m, against Pounds 918m in 1991. Reuters, the international news and information group, is expected tomorrow to reveal an increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 340m to Pounds 380m for the year to December. Given that Reuters is sitting on a cash pile of Pounds 700m, there has been some speculation that there will be a substantial hike in the dividend - or even a special payment. However, most interest will centre on the group's view of the trading outlook: a cautious statement at the interim stage gave the highly-rated shares a knock. BT unveils its third quarter results on Thursday against intense speculation that it intends to advance its ambitions in global communications services by spending up to Dollars 5bn for a stake in Electronic Data Systems, the computing services arm of General Motors. Excitement over rumours of the deal, on which neither company will comment, is likely to overshadow the trading figures which are expected to indicate BT's resilience in tough trading conditions. Pre-tax profits are expected to be Pounds 720m-Pounds 750m (Pounds 759m a year earlier). Analysts will be watching call volume closely as an indicator of the way the economy is moving.

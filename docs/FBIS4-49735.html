			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Stanley Cheung and Lilian Wu] </F>   [Text] Hangzhou, May 10 (CNA) -- A Straits Exchange  Foundation (SEF) delegation, and officials from its mainland  counterpart Association For Relations Across the Taiwan Strait  (ARATS) traveled from Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province to Qiandao  Lake Tuesday [10 May] morning.    The SEF delegation will stay near Qiandao Lake for two days  [words indistinct] to Hangzhou Thursday. During their stay,  they will inspect the boat on which 24 Taiwan tourists and eight  mainlanders were robbed and murdered while on a lake cruise.    SEF Deputy Secretary-General Hsu Hui-yu, in summing up the  talks on the first day Monday, said only that he had to see  relevant exhibits before he could continue to discuss the matter  with ARATS authorities. He said that at the present stage, SEF  could only say it was trying to learn more about the incident.    SEF and ARATS are non-official conduits set up to conduct  cross- strait relations in the absence of official ties.    During the first day of talks on the crime, the mainland  maintained that only three suspects took part in the robbery and  murder and no members of the mainland military were involved.  The three attempted to blow up the ship after the killings, but  failed, the mainland said.    Ji Shaoyan, a Hangzhou coroner, insisted that no bullet or  other wounds were found on any one of the victims. He said that  all the victims suffocated from carbon monoxide poisoning when  explosives were thrown into a tiny 17-square-meter space on the  lower deck of the boat into which all the victims were herded at  guns' point earlier.    He said that some of the bodies were so badly burned that  the  heads fell off the bodies when the victims were removed from the  ship.    The SEF delegation, comprised of SEF officials,  criminologists, and representatives of the victims, posed more  than 200 questions surrounding the incident during the first day.    ARATS used a briefing, videotape, slides and question and  answer sessions to explain the incident.    Representatives of the victims were dismayed after hearing  the briefing and the videotape on the aftermath of Qiandao Lake  incident.    SEF Deputy Secretary-General Hsu also said that SEF was  disappointed after not being allowed to meet with witnesses and  suspects in the case.</p>

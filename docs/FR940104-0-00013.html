			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The court questioned standard (f)'s applicability to information generated by the pipeline ``from public sources, or other sources entirely unrelated to a pipeline's transportation service.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The court also questioned the Commission's assertion ``that the sales and marketing information pipelines use today is a result of their  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> `past  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> monopoly power over transportation.''' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Noting that the marketing of gas depended on current_not past_information, the court found the Commission's position ``counter-intuitive.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The court stated: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  at 1200.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission appears to believe that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> any  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> advantage a pipeline gives its marketing affiliate is improper *&blank;*&blank;* . But advantages a pipeline gives its affiliate are improper only to the extent that they flow from the pipeline's anti-competitive market power. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  at 1201.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Examined in this light, the Commission now believes that standard (f) should be narrowed to affect only the disclosure of information related to the transportation of gas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Historically, the pipeline collected and maintained extensive data on natural gas supply and markets. As the primary_if not exclusive_buyer and seller of natural gas, pipelines had all of the data on production, consumption and markets for the areas they served. However, pipelines today are not the dominant sellers of natural gas they were a decade ago. About 80 percent of the natural gas pipelines deliver today is shipper-owned gas. Indeed, after the Order No. 636-mandated restructuring process is complete, nearly 100 percent of natural gas deliveries will be shipper-owned gas. Also, other structural changes in the industry further weaken the pipeline's knowledge base. Increasingly, contract pricing relies on nationwide competitive and financial market determinations, such as the NYMEX futures market, and published spot prices. Also, Order No. 636 establishes a short-term capacity release program for transactions less than 30 days in duration where even the EBB bidding requirements are waived. Pipelines will be afforded substantially less information about these types of transactions than traditionally required. For these transactions pipelines know where the gas is entering their system, and where it is redelivered, but may know nothing about the extent of reserves, the producers' or consumers' circumstances, or the commercial terms of the sale itself. Often the pipeline does not even know the identity of the ultimate consumer. Indeed the theory underlying Order No. 636 is that shippers would have more access to producers and marketers to make their decisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> But just as important is the fact that other shippers and producers will know where gas is entering and being redelivered throughout the system. Order No. 636 requires that this type of information be provided during the restructuring process, and through the EBB posting requirement required during the right-of-first-refusal, and capacity release programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To the extent that a pipeline collects sales and marketing information from public sources, or from sources outside its transportation role, release of this information to its marketing affiliate generally does not in any way relate to the pipeline's monopoly power over transportation. Unnecessary interference with communications between a pipeline and its marketing affiliates would actually reduce competition, by inhibiting one segment of the industry from vigorously competing with other natural gas sellers. To do otherwise would create an unlevel playing field tilted against pipeline merchant service units or marketing affiliates and towards producers, nonaffiliated marketers, local distribution companies (LDCs), and others. Rather than a balanced approach, this tilted playing field would give an unfair advantage to non-pipeline merchants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The pipeline obtains sales and marketing information from the public domain, its bundled merchant function or its transportation activities. The public domain information should not trigger standard (f), following the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Tenneco <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  court's reasoning. The bundled merchant information is outdated and does not meet the current information standard mentioned by the court. And finally, the transportation-generated sales and marketing information cannot be shared with the affiliate in the first instance given the standard (e) prohibition. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The only sales and marketing information which could result from a pipeline abusing its monopoly transportation position by sharing with a marketing affiliate would come from nonaffiliated shippers or potential shippers. Since standard (e) prohibits the pipeline from sharing any information derived from those sources with its marketing affiliate, the act of sharing such sales and marketing information both violates standard (e) and triggers the requirement to comply with standard (f).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Standards (f) and (e) are compatible with respect to transportation information_pipelines could generate and communicate transportation information to their marketing affiliates without violating standard (e). For example, as a result of its own engineering flow analysis, a pipeline could develop information concerning capacity availability. If that information is shared with a marketing affiliate, standard (f) is triggered. But since the information was not obtained by the pipeline from a nonaffiliated shipper or potential shipper, standard (e) is not violated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

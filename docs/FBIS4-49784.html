			<p>BFN     [Text] Canberra, May 11 (XINHUA) -- Tian Jiyun, vice  chairman of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC), left  Brisbane this morning for home after winding up his week-long  visit to Australia.    Australia was the last leg of Tian's four-nation tour in the  South Pacific, which had taken him to New Zealand, Western Samoa  and Papua New Guinea.    During his week-long stay in Australia, Tian and his  entourage visited Canberra, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane.    In Canberra, he had meetings with Governor-General Bill  Hayden, Prime Minister Paul Keating and other senior government  officials on increasing relations between the two countries as  well as issues of common interest.    He also had extensive contacts with Aussie parliamentarians  with a view to enhancing links between the two parliaments and  exchanged views with local businessmen on expanding economic and  trade cooperation.    Tian, who started his four-nation South Pacific trip on  April  18, described it as "the successful, satisfactory and fruitful  one."    He said that his visit to the four nations has achieved  goals  of "increasing understanding, getting acquainted with friends  and promoting cooperation."    Tian's South Pacific nation trip was seen as China's  attaching to the importance of parliamentary diplomacy, which  Tian said "can play a major role in increasing friendship and  cooperation between China and the countries in the world."</p>

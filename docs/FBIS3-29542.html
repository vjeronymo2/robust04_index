			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>   [Text] With its acceptance of full-scope [chonmyon]  inspections of seven declared facilities, North Korea is likely  to determine the timing for the arrival of the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection team by linking it with  the result of North Korean-U.S. contacts in New York.    A high-level IAEA official expressed concerned that  inspections may not be carried out as scheduled as North Korea's  issuing of visas has been delayed even though an IAEA inspection  team is waiting to begin inspections from next week when the  IAEA Board of Governors' Meeting is slated to be opened.    The official, however, revealed that he expects North Korea  to issue visas for inspectors soon so that inspections can be  carried out early next week, now that North Korea has accepted  full-scope [chonmyon] inspections.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (7)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Examples. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The following examples illustrate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of this section. In each example, X is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxpayer, Agency is the state housing credit agency, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carryover allocations meet the requirements of &sect;1.42&hyph;6 and are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise valid.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (i) In August 1993, X and Agency enter into an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement that Agency will allocate $100,000 of housing credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dollar amount for the low-income housing building X is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constructing. The agreement is binding and meets all the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement is a reservation of credit, not an allocation, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, has no effect on the state housing credit ceiling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On or before September 5, 1993, X signs and has notarized a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written election statement that meets the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The applicable percentage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the building is the appropriate percentage for the month  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of August 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Agency makes a carryover allocation of $100,000 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing credit dollar amount for the building on October 2,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993. The carryover allocation reduces Agency's state housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credit ceiling for 1993. Due to unexpectedly high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction costs, when X places the building in service in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> July 1994, the product of the building's qualified basis and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the applicable percentage for the building (the appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentage for the month of August 1993) is $150,000, rather  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than $100,000. Notwithstanding that only $100,000 of credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was allocated for the building in 1993, Agency may allocate an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional $50,000 of housing credit dollar amount for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> building from its state housing credit ceiling for 1994. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate percentage for the month of August 1993 is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable percentage for the building for the entire $150,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of credit allocated for the building, even though separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocations were made in 1993 and 1994. Because allocations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were made for the building in two separate calendar years,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency must issue two Forms 8609 to X. One Form 8609 must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflect the $100,000 allocation made in 1993, and the other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Form 8609 must reflect the $50,000 allocation made in 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) X gives the original notarized statement to Agency on or before September 5, 1993, and retains a copy of the binding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement, election statement, and carryover allocation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document. X files a copy of the binding agreement, election  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement, and carryover allocation document with X's Form  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8609 for the first taxable year in which X claims credit for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the building.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Agency files the original of the binding agreement,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> election statement, and 1993 carryover allocation document  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with its 1993 Form 8610. Agency retains a copy of the binding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement, election statement, and carryover allocation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document. After the building is placed in service in 1994,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency issues to X a copy of the Form 8609 reflecting the 1993  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carryover allocation of $100,000 and files the original of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that form with its 1994 Form 8610. Agency also files the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original of the 1994 Form 8609 reflecting the $50,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocation with its 1994 Form 8610 and issues to X a copy of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 1994 Form 8609. Agency retains copies of the Forms 8609  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are issued to X.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (i) In September 1993, X and Agency enter into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an agreement that Agency will allocate $70,000 of housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credit dollar amount for rehabilitation expenditures that X is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incurring and that X will treat as a new low-income housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> building under section 42(e)(1). The agreement is binding and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meets all the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section. The agreement is a reservation of credit, not an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocation, and therefore, has no effect on Agency's state  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing credit ceiling. On or before October 5, 1993, X signs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and has notarized a written election statement that meets the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable percentage for the building is the appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentage for the month of September 1993. Agency makes a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carryover allocation of $70,000 of housing credit dollar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount for the building on November 15, 1993. The carryover  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocation reduces by $70,000 Agency's state housing credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ceiling for 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) In October 1994, X and Agency enter into another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> binding agreement meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this section. Under the agreement, Agency will allocate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $50,000 of housing credit dollar amount for additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rehabilitation expenditures by X that qualify as a second  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate new building under section 42(e)(1). On or before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November 5, 1994, X signs and has notarized a written election  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section. On December 1, 1994, X receives a carryover  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocation under section 42(h)(1)(E) for $50,000. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carryover allocation reduces by $50,000 Agency's state housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credit ceiling for 1994. The applicable percentage for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rehabilitation expenditures treated as the second separate new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> building is the appropriate percentage for the month of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> October 1994, not September 1993. The appropriate percentage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the month of September 1993 still applies to the allocation of $70,000 for the rehabilitation expenditures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treated as the first separate new building. Because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocations were made for the building in two separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calendar years, Agency must issue two Forms 8609 to X. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Form 8609 must reflect the $70,000 allocation made in 1993,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the other Form 8609 must reflect the $50,000 allocation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made in 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) X gives the first original notarized statement to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency on or before October 5, 1993, and retains a copy of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first binding agreement, election statement, and carryover  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocation document issued in 1993. X gives the second  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original notarized statement to Agency on or before November  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5, 1994, and retains a copy of the second binding agreement,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> election statement, and carryover allocation document issued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in 1994. X files a copy of the binding agreements, election  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statements, and carryover allocation documents with X's Forms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8609 for the first taxable year in which X claims credit for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the buildings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Agency retains a copy of the binding agreements,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> election statements, and carryover allocation documents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency files the original of the first binding agreement,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> election statement, and 1993 carryover allocation document  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with its 1993 Form 8610. Agency files the original of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> second binding agreement, election statement, and 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carryover allocation document with its 1994 Form 8610. After  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> X notifies Agency of the date each building is placed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service, the Agency will issue copies of the respective Forms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8609 to X, and file the originals of those forms with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency's Form 8610 that reflects the year each form is issued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency also retains copies of the Forms 8609.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

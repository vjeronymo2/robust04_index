			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / International Company News: Saurer ahead despite 5.6% drop in sales Saurer, the Swiss textile machinery and motor components group, said its net profit last year was higher than the SFr21.4m (Dollars 14.4m) earned in 1992 when operating profit was flat at SFr54.5m. In a preliminary statement, the group described the result, on sales off 5.6 per cent to SFr1.7bn, as satisfactory in a very recessionary economic situation marked by severe price competition. Sales of the dominant spinning and embroidery systems division were down 3 per cent to SFr1.4bn. The components division, concentrated in Italy, maintained sales in local currency terms thanks to the devaluation of the lira and made an operating profit.</p>

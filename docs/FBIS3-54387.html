			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hocine Ait Ahmed, secretary general of the </F> Socialist Forces Front, by unidentifed correspondent in Paris --  live or recorded]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Civil peace is still a dream in  Algeria. The national conference which opened in Algiers today  is national in name only. The major parties are boycotting it.  Our guest, Hocine Ait Ahmed will tell us why. [passage omitted]    Hocine Ait Ahmed, you are in Paris, and not in Algiers. Why  are you boycotting the conference? I recall that you are the  secretary general of the Socialist Forces Front.    [Ait Ahmed] Listen, we started to take part in the dialogue  aimed at organizing this conference. It appeared that there was  no dialogue, neither on the form nor on the substance; it was a  monologue. Those who were in charge of conducting this dialogue  did not want to make concessions. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Why don't you take the opportunity of this  conference to say it openly and publicly in front of all the  media?    [Ait Ahmed] We said a long time ago that missing the  opportunity offered by this conference was an enormous political  mistake. It was we, if you remember, who called for a national  conference two years ago. The way we perceived the conference  was that it should be composed of the army, which is the real  power with the power of decision, and the representative  parties. It was up to the conference to establish the new  structure and the presidential body. As soon as we were certain  that all the transition structures and the form that the  presidency would take were already decided upon behind the  scenes, and that we would be there for the sole purpose of being  a rubber stamp...    [Announcer, interrupting] What you say means that dialogue  is impossible. So does this mean that you are giving a free  hand to extremists of all kinds?    [Ait Ahmed] Listen, the jokes...[pauses] It is the regime  that is giving ammunition to the extremists. They have showed  the most stunning disdain of the people in staging a farce in  the name of a national conference.    [Correspondent] Is Algeria in a civil war?    [Ait Ahmed] Algeria is not in a civil war but it is running  the risk of getting there. It is not in a civil war because the  Algerian people do not wish to embark on such a path. One side  of the Algerian population is not taking arms against another,  whatever the effort of the regime to involve the population.    [Correspondent] Still, could it happen?    [Ait Ahmed] Well, all the ingredients are there, above all  the high cost of living and a social situation whose extent one  cannot imagine.    [Correspondent] You are asking for democratic elections.    [Ait Ahmed] Yes.    [Correspondent] What if these democratic elections result in  favor of the enemies of democracy, that is, the fundamentalist  militants?    [Ait Ahmed] The whole problem lies there. This is the  pretext the regime used to justify the coup d'etat, to say there  will not be civilian peace without us. Well, not only have they  failed to establish civil peace but they also indefinitely  postponed the return to the democratic process. Now it is clear  that after a two-year transition resulting from the democratic  process, they want to extend it to another three-year  transition. This is proof that they do not want any democracy;  therefore the country is running a higher risk of total collapse.    [Correspondent] What do you expect from France and Europe?    [Ait Ahmed] Listen, we expect Europe to apply the law. The  principle of respect for human rights and the democratic  principles are for everyone. We have seen big movements of  solidarity with the people of eastern Europe in the West. As  far as Algeria is concerned, it is as if its people do not  deserve any attention. It is true that the Algerian problem  should be solved by the Algerians, by all sides. We notice that  the regime has not ceased asking for financial and economic aid.  It cannot ask for favorable treatment for itself and at the  same time for a discriminatory one for the people. Human rights  and democracy should triumph in the country.    [Correspondent] In one word, Mr. Ait Ahmed: Are you  pessimistic?    [Ait Ahmed] I am pessimistic if the international community  continues to be fooled by the regime. But I am completely  optimistic if the means to establish democracy are given to us.  There are democratic forces in Algerian society. All they need  is the means to express and freely organize themselves. I am  ready to commit myself.    [Correspondent] Thank you Mr. Ait Ahmed for the interview.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulaanbaatar, May 31 KYODO -- A document circulated  among inner government circles in China warns that a United  States- backed Pan-Mongolian movement could lead to the  partitioning of China, it was learned Tuesday [31 May].    Relations between China and Mongolia are on the surface  good,  following a visit to Mongolia in April by Chinese Premier Li  Peng to sign a new Sino-Mongolian friendship pact.    But the document warns that China should move to head off  the  development of a Pan-Mongolian ideology because it could  threaten China's territorial integrity.    The document was published in October by a public research  institute specializing in Northeast Asian affairs in China's  Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region.    Mongolia is home to some 2.1 million Mongols, but the  autonomous region has 4.8 million, while a further 300,000 are  in Russia.    The document cites as symptomatic of the problem the first  world conference of Mongolian peoples, held in the Mongolian  capital of Ulaanbaatar in September last year.    It says the conference strengthened Pan-Mongolianism and  says  that "this fundamental problem which is related to the  partitioning of China cannot be ignored."    Noting that organizers of the conference visited the U.S.  prior to the forum, the document said "the U.S. is extending  its evil influence into the Mongolian plateau and is trying in  the background to stab China with a sword it calls democracy."    The document also says Mongolian unification has supporters  in Japan.    It suggests that China should prepare for a lengthy struggle  and warns of the growth of ethnic movements in the former Soviet  Union.</p>

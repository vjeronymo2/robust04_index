			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 12m pollution alleviation development MILLER CIVIL ENGINEERING has won the Pounds 12m contract from North West Water Engineering, to construct the structures of the third phase of the Sefton Mepas (Mersey Estuary Pollution Alleviation Scheme) project. The scheme includes the construction of underground chambers, shafts and interconnecting tunnels to divert flows from existing outfall sewers into a new interceptor sewer and provision of storm sewage storage facilities within the structures. Mechanical and electrical control systems which will regulate flows into the interceptor, and prevent ingress of tidal waters into the system, will be installed. Control buildings at each of four outfalls to house mechanical and electrical plant will also be built. The work, due for completion in mid-1995 includes shafts up to 10.5 metres in diameter and 30 metres deep in rock, 500 metres of tunnel up to 1.83 metres in diameter through varied ground of rock and made ground, and a number of large reinforced structures. A target cost contract, the type which proved successful to both client and contractor during phase one, will be used.</p>

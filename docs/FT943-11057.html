			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Canada and US draw up wheat peace plan The US and Canada yesterday announced a preliminary agreement to avert a damaging trade war over Canadian wheat exports, with Canada agreeing to curb its wheat sales into the US market for a year. The pact still must be approved by the Canadian and US cabinets, which are to take it up today. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said the details would not be announced until final agreement was reached. 'The agreement addresses the immediate problem of a surge in imports of Canadian grain, while also establishing a process and a reasonable time frame for addressing on a longer-term basis problems in the grains sector,' he said. The pact comes two weeks after a finding by the International Trade Commission that Canada's 5m tonnes of US wheat sales had done some damage to the US farm programme. The six commissioners differed widely on the extent of the damage, with three saying the harm had been minimal and probably transitory. Under US law, President Bill Clinton can impose tariffs or quotas on products found to damage the price support programme. He also has the option of doing nothing. But politics has been driving the issue, in the form of three key Democratic senators from wheat-growing states on the powerful finance committee insisting Canada unfairly subsidises its wheat. US farmers themselves receive billions of dollars in grain subsidies. One of the senators - Mr Max Baucus, chairman of the international trade subcommittee - said the pact would sharply limit exports from current levels both on durum wheat and other wheat and would 'go a long way toward stabilising prices'. The preliminary agreement has three parts. First, the US one-year import curb officially began yesterday. Mr Kantor said it would result in 'a substantial reduction in wheat imports'. That would have happened in any case, since the 5m tonnes imported in 1993-94 was spurred by unusual weather-related problems in both the US and Canada which are absent this year. The two sides also have agreed to a 12-month 'peace clause' on grains trade to ensure against 'additional restrictions or countermeasures', with both countries committed not to take action inconsistent with the North American Free Trade Area pact or the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. They also agreed to create a joint commission on grains, composed of 6-10 private sector representatives, to study each country's marketing and farm support systems over the next year. It will seek a longer-term solution to the grains trade dispute. Its recommendations will not be binding.</p>

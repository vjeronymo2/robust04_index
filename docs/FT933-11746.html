			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Survey of Resource Management - Buying-in Services (12): New service contract PICTURED above are customers at a financial centre of the Bristol &amp; West Building Society using 'touch-screen' technology to view house mortgage and property services. Bristol &amp; West, which has a network of 180 building society branches, plus the Hamptons Estates Agency, Bristol &amp; West Property Services, and a growing number of high street financial centres, now has a 'fixed-time' service contract with Unisys, the computer and information solutions company, for the maintenance of its communications network. In the event of a computer breakdown, the society can directly access the Unisys engineering network, which logs calls to field engineers. The contract specifies that Unisys would pay a penalty to Bristol &amp; West if it fails to meet specified service levels - a feature that few other service companies were prepared to offer when tenders were submitted last year. High priority calls are guaranteed 'a fix in six hours,' says Unisys. Service performance is reviewed at monthly meetings between Bristol &amp; West and Unisys.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Following preliminary artillery [fire], 500-strong  Armenian divisions, backed by armored vehicles, invaded  Azerbaijan's Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic last Monday.    The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry told INTERFAX that the  Armenians launched an attack on the village of Gyuinnet in  Nakhichevan's Sadarak region, killing four Azerbaijani  servicemen, wounding two and taking three hostage.    Baku says that Armenian formations advanced about 5  kilometers into Nakhichevan, consolidating their positions on  the occupied heights.    INTERFAX has not yet obtained any information from the  Armenian Defense Ministry.</p>

			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Personal View: Opportunity knocks for the Japanese The government that has just taken power in Japan has a lot on its collective mind - mainly, no doubt, how to hang on to it. It will be hard to hold the coalition together, let alone to shake up the cosy world of Japan's money politics and to give a fair deal to consumers. But that is what it was elected to do. The elections do not ensure that the relationship between government and business will be transformed. Many of today's reformers, such as Tsutomu Hata and Ichiro Ozawa, were yesterday's loyal Liberal Democratic party Diet-men, which does not augur well for a clean break. But if business as usual prevails, Japan will have missed a historic opportunity. Systematic reform offers tangible benefits to Japanese consumers. It would enable Japan's political system to respond to concerns beyond those of entrenched interests. And America and Europe would also profit. Reform must be rooted in the recognition that political and economic liberalisation go hand in hand. Regulation has increased the value for businessmen of investing in politicians, and the cost of not doing so. Japan's recent spending spree was designed partly to provide kickbacks from public-works contracts. Political reform requires a decline in the market value of politicians: the rewards of economic activity must stay higher than those of political activity. That in turn requires that politicians stop trying to manage the economy. For clean politics, Japan must deregulate. Japan's allies often cite its regulations as impediments to trade. Fair or not, the complaints provide another reason to deregulate: reform could avert the dangers of either a trade war or politically managed trade, both of which would decrease the wealth of the entire world but would devastate an island nation in particular. Japan should therefore become the world's foremost free trader. Were politicians in the US and Europe more responsible, Japan would not have to assume this role. As it is, some economic power must act decisively if the industrialised world is not to be split into three hostile trading blocs. Dismantling corporatism would also improve Japan's economy. The privatisation of its expensive national railway has halted massive losses. Airline privatisations are forcing producers to serve consumers rather than the reverse. Deregulation of the retail distribution system would yield more benefits. Zoning restrictions protect inefficient small shopkeepers. This policy also irritates foreign businesses trying to distribute their products in Japan. Eliminating trade and zoning protection for agriculture would further free the market in land. Protecting agriculture diverts much land and labour to unproductive uses. This policy, together with the high tax on the sale of houses, exacerbates urban crowding. Kenichi Ohmae, chairman of the Japanese arm of management consultant McKinsey, estimates that changing these policies could quadruple the land available for development within 30 miles of Tokyo. That in turn would shorten workers' average daily commuting time of three hours. If politicians want to put the welfare of the people first, agriculture protection must go. Agricultural protection also raises land prices; and these high prices impede foreign investment in Japan. The US Republican party's Wednesday Group believes this factor contributes greatly to Japan's trade surplus with America. It is a pity so much attention has focused on this bilateral trade balance. The pursuit of a 'solution' to the imbalance leads to counterproductive ideas, such as artificially reducing Japan's savings rate. Removing barriers to investment in Japan, however, would be good in itself, and could shrink the imbalance as a happy side-effect. Japan should resist putting bureaucrats back in charge to 'manage' trade to meet foreign demands. The bureaux will be tempted, as this would give them a new lease of life. So will some companies: export restraints have transferred wealth from foreign consumers to Japanese exporters. But cart-elisation cannot benefit the public. During the election campaign, Japan's reformers stuck to generalities, such as ending corruption. But they also called for less government, denouncing the high prices and inefficiency resulting from intervention. They must now make good that promise. They should do it because deregulation will destroy the structural base of much political corruption; liberalisation will please Japan's allies; and, most important, the Japanese public deserves a better deal.

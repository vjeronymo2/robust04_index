			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICRO D AGREES TO BE ACQUIRED BY INGRAM INDUSTRIES  </P> <P> Micro D Inc., the nation's largest wholesaler of personal computer products,  agreed Thursday to be acquired by its majority shareholder, Ingram Industries  of Nashville, Tenn., in a $43.9-million deal.  </P> <P> The agreement came after Ingram boosted its cash tender offer for the 41% of  Micro D it doesn't already own from $12.50 a share, or $37 million, to $14.75  per share.  </P> <P> Ingram first proposed a buyout to Micro D management on Dec. 14, but Micro D  rejected the $12.50-a-share offer as inadequate. Ingram responded by taking the  same offer directly to shareholders last week.  </P> <P> At that time, Ingram Industries' president, E. Bronson Ingram, said the company  would not increase its offer because its financial review indicated that Micro  D was unlikely to achieve its projected sales growth for 1989. Company  officials could not be reached for comment Thursday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Headquarters in Santa Ana  </P> <P> Ingram said last week that it intends to merge Micro D with Ingram Computers,  its computer products distribution subsidiary based in Buffalo, N.Y. Micro D  Chief Financial Officer Godfred P. Otuteye said the merged company would have  its headquarters in Santa Ana, where Micro D already is based.  </P> <P> He also said Ingram "has expressed its desire to keep the current management in  place" but that no final decision has been made.  </P> <P> Micro D sales are expected to top $525 million in 1988.  </P></p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / This Week: Television Superlatives flow like Bollinger in the world of high-fashion women's magazines, and the gush rate is Niagara-like in Cutting Edge (Monday, 9.00-10.00pm, C4), which looks at Britain's fastest-growing glossy, Marie Claire. The result is compelling, largely because of the editor, Glenda Bailey, whom we see at the New York collections screaming: 'I want it, I want it, I want it.' She wasn't so keen on the documentary, though. She walked out of the press screening a couple of weeks ago. However, she's not one to miss a promotional opportunity: The December issue of Marie Claire is emblazoned with 'As Seen On TV'.                         *      *      * Seeing a famous photograph suddenly become animated is as odd as seeing the Venus de Milo move. That is the feeling one gets from Omnibus (Tuesday, 10.20-11.15pm, BBC1), which delivers the first big TV profile of Henri Cartier-Bresson. Using cine footage, it shows us what happened next in Cartier-Bresson's photograph of the impromptu trial of a Vichy collaborator. In the past, Cartier-Bresson has restricted cameras to shots of the back of his head and a glimpse of his profile, because he doesn't want to be 'trapped by fame'. At 86, he has relented and given a frank interview and a full-frontal view of his face with fascinating results.                         *      *      * Hedonism can be hard work, as we see in Great Journeys (Wednesday 9.25-10.30pm, BBC2), when Tony Robinson, aka Baldrick from Blackadder, goes to the Caribbean to loosen his strait-laced Englishness. We see him get high on mushroom tea, get massaged by two teenage girls, get rum poured down his throat, get mud smeared over his body and get nauseous at a cock-fight. Most hilarious of all, though, is the sight of him in a skimpy costume cavorting at Carnival.                         *      *      * Dispatches (Wednesday, 9.00-9.45pm, C4) will be examining evidence it claims to have uncovered that Britain's security services attempted to discredit the National Union Of Mineworkers and that Roger Windsor, its former chief executive, was allegedly an MI5 agent. The programme-makers will be interviewing former MI5 and GCHQ personnel who claim that the surveillance was so well-placed that key decisions were known in advance and smear tactics could be employed.</p>

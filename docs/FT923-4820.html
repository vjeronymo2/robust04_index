			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Currency games YESTERDAY THE markets were not entirely unimpressed by the British government's decision to up the stakes in the currency game. The 0.73 pfennig rise in sterling on the day, to DM2.7975, was at least in the direction the government wanted following its announced intention to borrow Ecu10bn (Pounds 7.3bn) in foreign currencies. The question is whether first thoughts are likely to be overtaken by second ones. The proceeds of the foreign currency borrowing announced yesterday - half to be in D-Marks and half in a mixture of currencies - will be used to support sterling over the rest of the financial year. Since the reserves were Dollars 44.5bn at the end of August, the government is now in a strong position to punish those prepared to sell the pound short, even though it is already near its floor in the ERM. These borrowings will also count as part of the finance of the public sector's borrowing requirement. Ecu10bn is a substantial amount, although still less than a quarter of the total borrowings needed in this financial year. Nevertheless, the fact of borrowing in foreign currencies does emphasise the government's commitment to its policy. If the government were really as confident as it pretends, it would be doing as much of its borrowing as possible either in index-linked gilts  - a bargain for a government expecting zero inflation - or in D-Marks. Does this mean the chancellor can claim that 'these arrangements demonstrate once again the government's clear determination and ability to maintain sterling's position in the ERM at the existing central rate regardless of the outcome of the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty'? Only up to a point. By failing to raise interest rates as sterling declined, the government has not, in fact, shown its determination to maintain sterling's position at the existing central rate. The decision to borrow rather than raise interest rates, might come to be judged by the markets as a - potentially costly - sign of weakness. More fundamentally, no government wheeze, however skilful, no action, however brave, can remove all doubts. The credibility of the parity will be determined by its consequences for economic performance. On that the jury remains out.</p>

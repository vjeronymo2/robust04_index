			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Zvornik-Bratunac, 22 Apr (TANJUG) -- This morning  Muslims launched artillery and infantry attacks on Serbian  territory and defense lines of the Bosnian Serb republic army,  whose final aim is to capture the Serbian part of Sarajevo. The  attacks have not stopped this evening, TANJUG's correspondent  has learned from Serbian military circles.    It is specified that, after several days of preparations and  constant attacks, Moslem units launched attacks from the area of  Olovo, Cemerka and Mountain Zvezda [all north of Sarajevo], and  from the Breza and Visoko areas [northwest of Sarajevo]. They  are using all available weapons.    The main targets of the Moslem offensive activity are  Serbian  villages and defense positions of the republic of Srpska army in  the area of Ilijas [northwest of Sarajevo, toward Visoko],  Srednje and in the Nisici plateau [both north of Sarajevo]. The  attacks were accompanied by strong artillery support and mortar  fire.    Republic of Srpska army units are responding to all attacks  and successfully thwarting Moslem attempts at an infantry  breakthrough of Serbian defense lines. Circles in the republic  of Srpska army point out that the Moslems' intention is to cut  the Ilijas-Srednje-Nisici communication link and take control of  the Nisici plateau. They would then direct their actions toward  Sarajevo, aiming at severing Serbian territory and occupying the  Serbian part of Sarajevo. [passage omitted]</p>

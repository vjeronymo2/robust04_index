			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Eurofighter hits bad weather: Bernard Gray examines the conflicts surrounding Europe's biggest industrial project The Farnborough air show opens today with all the glitz that an international aerospace bazaar can muster. Centrepiece of the show will be the four-nation, Pounds 32bn Eurofighter 2000, with a stand which includes a simulator demonstrating the thrills combat pilots can expect. Unfortunately for the assembled buyers, sellers, observers and enthusiasts, the real Eurofighter will not fly. Preparing an aircraft to perform at Farnborough would take too much time out of a development schedule already two years adrift. Another of the problems which have dogged the project will surface tomorrow when Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, gives evidence to a parliamentary defence committee in Bonn. Up for discussion is a report from the German national audit office which heavily criticises the cost of Eurofighter, and suggests buying Russian Mig-29 fighters instead. These are just two examples of the turbulent ride the Eurofighter is likely to get in the next few months as several of the conflicts surrounding Europe's largest industrial project reignite. Those taking part are the UK (primarily British Aerospace and GEC), Germany (DASA), Italy (Alenia) and Spain (Casa). The German report on Eurofighter's costs, widely dismissed as inaccurate, is bound to produce rhetoric from the project's opponents who object that the Eurofighter is over-engineered and over-priced. While a change of government in Germany is not expected, the run-up to next month's federal elections has created some uncertainty and could conceivably produce a new administration which is not as committed to the project as Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats. The opposition Social Democrats are opposed in principle, though the party is split with one faction supporting the project because it will secure a large number of engineering jobs. An alliance government of the Greens and the SPD, while unlikely, might pull Germany out of the production phase of the aircraft. Then there is the thorny issue of how many aircraft each country is going to buy. That number, to be decided next year, determines the amount of work each country gets in the Eurofighter manufacturing run. Germany has suggested that it may reduce its order from 250 to 140. Britain, meanwhile, is thinking of increasing its order from 250 to more than 300 Eurofighters in order to replace some of its Tornado strike aircraft. With disparity arising between the British and German orders, arguments are likely to become more intense over which work should go where. Assuming, as most observers do, that Germany remains with the Eurofighter, strong political and industrial turf wars will be fought over the Pounds 20bn of production work. Resentment of what some German opponents call 'the English aeroplane' is likely to be exacerbated if the change in size of both countries' orders mean that Britain's manufacturers take work from Germany. Of the problems, the cost over-runs discussed in the German auditors' report have attracted the most publicity. One UK expert estimates Britain's share of development costs has now overshot by Pounds 1bn since 1988. The total development bill is likely to be around Pounds 10bn, up from the Pounds 6.5bn estimate when the project first started. In part, that reflects the uncertainty inherent in such leading-edge technology. Many of the elements needed for Eurofighter had to be developed from scratch and their cost could only be guesstimated. But as one insider said: 'These open-ended remits have also meant cosy risk-free development deals to fund them. With regular cheques arriving every month, companies have had little incentive to keep costs down.' Nevertheless, the main reason for collaboration is to spread the one-off development costs among several partners. But as the programme is analysed it is becoming increasingly clear that much of the potential gains have been lost because of duplicated overheads and poor co-ordination. Officials will not say how much of the Pounds 10bn development cost has been frittered away, but one expert says 'estimates are very difficult, but I would think between 30 and 50 per cent of the money has been wasted'. That money has probably gone for good, but some of the errors are steadily being corrected. More of the development risks will be carried by the manufacturers rather than defence ministries, and work is being put on to a fixed-price footing. Confused management structures are being rationalised. The cost arguments, however embarrassing, are unlikely to kill the project unless another serious hiccup occurs, and that is getting less likely as the project becomes better defined. Nor would a German exit from the programme ground the Eurofighter. Indeed, in some ways a German exit would suit the other partners, since Germany may, in any case, be obliged to pay its share of development costs, and the other countries would then be able to put the aircraft into production themselves. With much of the development money spent, and strong British backing for the Eurofighter, outright cancellation of the project is hard to envisage. Besides, the military case for replacing European fighter fleets remains strong. The last generation of aircraft developed in Europe, the Tornado, was manufactured during the 1980s. It is essentially a bomber and air-to-ground strike aircraft, not a fighter. In the Gulf war, Britain's Tornados often had to be escorted by US aircraft because the UK had no fighters equal to the task. There is little desire in the Royal Air Force to repeat the humiliating experience. Even the sceptical Germans recognise the need for new aircraft, and the view that Germany only needs a light fighter to defend its own airspace may lose ground following Germany's decision to lift its ban on military deployment outside the Nato area. While they are primarily interested in the high-technology skills and jobs which will flow from Eurofighter, Italy and Spain will also need new fighters in the next decade, and are not overly concerned with the exact specification of the project, provided costs are contained. The need for new fighters could be easily met by buying off-the-shelf US F/A-18s of F-15s, but these would not guarantee air superiority into the next century. In more advanced designs the alternatives to Eurofighter are thin on the ground. Russian Mig-29 or SU-27 planes are theoretically a cheap possibility. However, becoming dependent on Russia for spares would raise eyebrows in west European defence ministries. Since the ructions look unlikely to kill Eurofighter, and other alternatives are unattractive, the challenge now is for companies and governments to organise the production phase of the Eurofighter to keep costs at a bare minimum. If the workshare arguments produce a shake-up of what manufacturing goes where, production may be put on a more rational basis. Though Spain and Italy will want to keep their full quota of work, there is no economic need for the two countries to have final assembly lines, as currently planned. Completing the last stages of the aircraft's construction at the two established lines at Warton in Lancashire and Manching in Bavaria would cut costs. Greater specialisation would also help. Currently one wing is being made in Italy, with the other split between the UK and Spain. 'The companies probably now have a firm enough grip on the project that provided they tender sensible prices the Eurofighter's future is secure,' said one aerospace expert, 'and those governments moaning about prices could do a lot to help cut costs themselves if they weren't so nationalistic about workshares.'</p>

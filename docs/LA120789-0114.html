			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLIND 14-YEAR-OLD GOES TO MAT WITH HANDICAP;  </P> <P> WRESTLING: SINCE LOSING HIS EYESIGHT, JOEL RAMOS HAS BEEN BATTLING THE ODDS AS  HE TRIES  </P> <P> Joel Ramos, who at 14 has had to adjust suddenly to being blind, is preoccupied  almost completely with wrestling. It makes his world seem not so dark.  </P> <P> "That's when I feel the best, when I'm wrestling," said Ramos, a student at  John Glenn High School in Norwalk who fell and suffered a detached retina in  his left eye 20 months ago. That eye detects only shadows and light. His right  eye, injured permanently when he was a child, detects nothing.  </P> <P> The freshman's goal, now that he has come out from a period of seclusion, is to  be a Suburban League junior varsity champion.  </P> <P> But first, Coach Ralph Valle keeps telling him, he has to make the JV team.  </P> <P> Each afternoon, the 155-pound Ramos takes high hopes and courage into the  school's stuffy wrestling room, which is furnished with only a red mat, a radio  and a scale. There he is treated the way he wants to be -- like everyone else.  </P> <P> He appeared stunned after getting dumped last week by 240-pound Steve Rosales,  on whom he had been attempting an inside half-cradle.  </P> <P> "What's the matter, Joel?" asked Valle, who has a crew cut and a build that  attests to the fact that he once was a wrestler.  </P> <P> Ramos did not answer, so the coach asked Rosales: "Did you hurt my baby?"  </P> <P> "He hurts me more than I hurt him," Rosales said.  </P> <P> As Ramos wrestled, assistant coach Fo Dominguez told him where his opponent's  arms were. "Joel has good potential," Dominguez said. "He has a sense of  feeling where the other guy is. Wrestling's all in the heart and mind, and what  you feel."  </P> <P> Practice was grueling. Ramos, his face sweaty, ran laps around the room,  holding onto a teammate's shoulder. Skipping came next; Ramos tried, but the  other wrestlers yelled, "Come on, Joel, do it right."  </P> <P> When displeased with his team, Valle orders push-ups. Ramos cannot always keep  up with the pace.  </P> <P> "What are you waiting for, Joel?" Valle said. "Want me to ask you personally?  Please do a push-up, Joel."  </P> <P> The coach rides the other wrestlers in much the same way, which makes Ramos  feel that he is one of them. But there are melancholy moments, too.  </P> <P> "Can you see this?" Valle asked the team while demonstrating a move. While his  teammates gathered around Valle, all Ramos could do was recline on his elbows  alone at the edge of the mat.  </P> <P> While Ramos wants to be on the JV team, Valle said, "I don't know how realistic  that is. We're loaded." The Eagles won the league varsity and JV titles last  year, and almost all of those wrestlers have returned. If Ramos does not make  the JV team, he can still compete in tournaments.  </P> <P> Valle does not sugarcoat his evaluation of Ramos: "He's a pretty tough kid when  he stops feeling sorry for himself. He's got talent. He's naturally strong and  is stubborn as hell -- that's a good thing to be when you're wrestling because  you don't want to quit. He still lacks the confidence to be successful in a  match, but he's a freshman. He tends to be lazy sometimes. He will have to work  hard."  </P> <P> Ramos, who had poor vision since birth, lost the sight in his right eye when he  fell and struck it on a table when he was 5. He is not sure what caused the  detachment in his left eye, but believes it happened when he fell on his head  while playing football in the street.  </P> <P> Shortly afterward he began to see spots. "I ignored it at first, then I started  losing vision and I told my parents about it," Ramos said. "Then the doctor  told me and I got scared."  </P> <P> The retina was too badly torn to be repaired, although three operations were  attempted. "He had hereditary retinal degeneration," said Edgar Thomas, an  ophthalmologist with Retina Vitreous Associates in Los Angeles. "Trauma may or  may not have caused (the detachment)."  </P> <P> Atop the living-room TV in the Ramos home near Norwalk Boulevard is a photo of  Joel taken two years ago. In it he wears glasses as thick as the ones his  father, Jose Jesus Ramos, now wears. Jose Ramos, a former truck driver, is  blind in one eye and even with his glasses must use a magnifying glass to read  out of the other one.  </P> <P> Jose sat on a couch on a recent afternoon while his wife, Leticia, lay on a  matching one, nursing a head bump she suffered when her car hit a fence while  she was learning to drive.  </P> <P> "Hard times? You can say that again," Jose said. "We just look ahead."  </P> <P> Jose Ramos said Joel suffered a lot when he first lost his sight. "He didn't  want to see nobody, just wanted to stay in his room," he said. "Now everything  is a challenge. He's learning Braille. He's been more social with us and his  friends."  </P> <P> The Ramoses worry about their son's wrestling, although Thomas said the worst  the wrestler could suffer would be a sore eye.  </P> <P> "I try not to encourage it," Jose Ramos said. "He always liked football. We  were afraid of his playing in the street so we converted a small place to play  basketball."  </P> <P> He walked out to the back yard and looked at the hoop.  </P> <P> "He and his friends would play," he said, "but now, no more."  </P> <P> At the recent wrestling practice, Ramos said he still feels sorry for himself.  "I think about it and get depressed," he said. "I miss a lot of things."  </P> <P> Among them are reading the Sunday comics and looking at girls.  </P> <P> "Do they have Playboy in Braille?" Ramos was asked by Rosales, his mat partner.  </P> <P> "Yeah," Ramos said.  </P> <P> "The pictures and everything?"  </P> <P> "I don't know," Ramos said, laughing.  </P> <P> Earlier this fall, Ramos ran on the Glenn cross-country team. Holding onto a  teammate, he did fine, although the downhill courses were scary and often  caused him to fall. Jerry Stein, the cross-country coach, said that Ramos first  ran three miles in 45 minutes but later improved to 36 minutes.  </P> <P> Ramos said that it was boredom rather than a sudden emboldenment that made him  decide to come out of his room. He chose wrestling, he said, because it is the  only thing he doesn't need help with, and it is satisfying. "I can be having  the worst day, but if I pin somebody it makes me feel good," he said.  </P> <P> But he has found that there are other things that must be mastered besides  cradles, takedowns and half-nelsons.  </P> <P> Three times a week he is driven to a residential neighborhood in Norwalk, where  Suzanne Hassall, an orientation and mobility specialist, and student teacher  Gina Anderson teach him how to cross a street.  </P> <P> "At first he wouldn't walk outdoors or when other kids are around," Hassall  said as she watched Ramos walk down a sidewalk with his cane. "He's doing real  well this year. He has terrific orientation, he can always tell you where he  is."  </P> <P> At 8 on a recent morning Ramos was in Pola Lawson's special education  classroom, practicing on a machine that types in Braille. He sat in the corner  of a room, facing students in wheelchairs.  </P> <P> "He's an intelligent young man," Lawson said. "We're trying to get him in the  mainstream."  </P></p>

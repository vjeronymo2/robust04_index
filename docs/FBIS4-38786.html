			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Appeal by the session of the Lvov Oblast Council of </F> People's Deputies to the president of Ukraine and the Ukrainian  Supreme Council"; date not given]    [Text] Esteemed Mr. President and Mr. Chairman, esteemed  deputies!    The session of the Lvov Oblast Council of people's deputies  is alarmed by the fact that the current political situation in  Ukraine poses a serious threat to the processes of developing  the state.    The June elections of the president of Ukraine and of local  bodies of power, which are to be held under the constitutional  crisis, were further exacerbated by the absence of an  appropriate legal basis and society's distinct stance with  regard to the state structure and the bodies of power.  Presuming that the people of Ukraine are the sole and superior  representatives of power on Ukraine's territory, the elections  should be held only after all citizens-electors and candidates  to the elected bodies fully comprehend both the functions and  powers of the newly elected administration. Otherwise, such  elections will not guarantee the full scope of civil rights,  while the electors will become the victims of political fraud  and manipulations and guinea pigs for endless exhausting  political experiments.    Attempts to introduce the federative-oblast territorial  structure of the state during the June elections, while no  appropriate constitutional basis yet exists, may initiate a  broad expansion of separatist processes, a dismembering of  Ukraine, and antistate activities, which have recently been  vividly demonstrated in Crimea.    We, the deputies of the Lvov Oblast Council of People's  Deputies, demand that both the elections of the president and of  local bodies of power be postponed by the period necessary for  the Supreme Council to adopt the law on the structure and powers  of administration.</p>

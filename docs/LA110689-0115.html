			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MACK GRANTED PROBATION AFTER SERVING MONTH  </P> <P> Cleveland Browns running back Kevin Mack was granted probation today,  permitting his release after serving one month of a six-month prison term for  using cocaine.  </P> <P> Judge Richard J. McMonagle of Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court granted Mack  two-year probation, effective immediately, along with several requirements,  including regular urine testing for drug abuse.  </P> <P> "There's something I want you to know. You have one dirty urine, and I'll send  you back to prison," McMonagle said.  </P> <P> Mack, wearing orange overalls and running shoes, told the judge: "Your Honor, I  feel I learned a valuable lesson from the mistake I made -- being involved with  drugs.  </P> <P> "While I was in the institution I've just been around people that I've never  seen before, and never really confronted before. It really scared me.  </P> <P> "And I just feel that, given another chance, I can turn my life around with the  help of God and the friends I have and the program I'm trying to work with."  </P> <P> Mack, 27, was arrested June 28 after police investigating drug activity checked  a car Mack had been driving.  </P></p>

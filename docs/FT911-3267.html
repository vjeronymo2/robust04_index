			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Japanese police raid offices of Itoman JAPANESE police and public prosecutors investigating dubious art and property deals at Itoman, a large but debt-ridden trading company, yesterday raided 48 homes and offices across the country. Officials carried away boxes of documents as part of the investigation into the suspect transactions. The investigation followed legal complaints made by Itoman, a trading company based in Osaka, which alleged that paintings were sold to it at prices well above the market price, a spokesman for the Osaka police and the Osaka District Prosecutor's Office said. The Itoman affair has gripped popular imagination in Japan because - to the disgust of many ordinary Japanese - the company was at the forefront of speculating in the property boom of the late 1980s. When it emerged last year that Itoman was in financial trouble servicing a Y1,300bn (Pounds 5.5bn) debt, Mr Yoshihiko Kawamura, the company president, resigned, as did the chairman of Sumitomo Bank, Itoman's main bank. The prosecutor's office is concentrating its investigation on the purchase for Y55.7bn of valuable paintings, including a Renoir and a Chagall, which Itoman says were sold to it at two or three times the market price.</p>

			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CENTRAL AMERICANS TURN TO COURIERS TO SEND MONEY HOME  </P> <P> Being separated from her children is painful, but Maria del Carmen Chang draws  some solace by sending a little money home each month so her son and three  daughters can buy themselves a small toy, school supplies or a dress.  </P> <P> The 41-year-old housekeeper earns a modest $100 a week but still manages to  make regular visits to the offices of an express courier service in the  Westlake area that sends money orders and small packages to Guatemala City  almost overnight.  </P> <P> Chang said she felt guilty because she could scrape together "only $75" to send  to her children, the youngest of whom is 3 years old. "I've been here for more  than a year, and I haven't seen them," she said in Spanish in a tone of deep  resignation. "You come here to work, and that's the way life is."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 500 Central Americans a Day  </P> <P> Others filtered into the office during a recent Sunday morning, including a few  more housekeepers, a Salvadoran construction worker and a welder who said he  was sending half of his most recent paycheck to Guatemala as a Mother's Day  gift.  </P> <P> In all, about 500 Guatemalan and Salvadoran immigrants come each day to the 10  offices of Garza Express, one of half a dozen courier express chains that have  become a fixture in Los Angeles' Central American community.  </P> <P> According to university researchers, the courier agencies are among the fastest  growing businesses in the city. But they are themselves only the most visible  sign of the ever-growing flow of money and consumer goods sent home by Latino  immigrant workers, many of them here illegally.  </P> <P> Added together, the immigrants' money orders of $75, $100 or $200 are not  exactly small change. Economists estimate that "remittances" by immigrants in  the United States to El Salvador alone total from $500 million to $1 billion  each year, a greater source of foreign exchange than coffee, the country's  leading cash crop.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Remedy for Suffering  </P> <P> With El Salvador suffering from a harsh civil war for almost a decade, and  Guatemala going through one of its worst economic crises of the century, the  payments and packages have taken on an added importance. A money order for a  few hundred dollars can help a family make a rent payment and a package of  clothes can keep children warm in the winter.  </P> <P> "In most cases they send the money back home and the money is used for  immediate needs," said Norma Chinchilla, a professor of sociology at Cal State  Long Beach. "It's phenomenal the amount they squeeze out of their meager  earnings to support their relatives."  </P> <P> Getting that money home, however, has always presented something of a problem,  because the postal services in Central America are notoriously inefficient.  </P> <P> Immigrant entrepreneurs have stepped into this void in the last few years by  creating courier services. Nora Hamilton, a political science professor at USC  who recently completed a study of local Central American businesses with  Chinchilla, said the courier chains have at least 30 offices in and around Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Business was brisk at Garza Express in Westlake, where customers dressed in  their Sunday best stood at the counter and quickly wrote letters to send along  with their money orders. Typically, the charge is about $10.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Money to Mother  </P> <P> "This week, I'm sending money to my mother," said Victor Morales, a welder  whose letter home to Guatemala included a money order for $130 -- to help his  family "cover costs" -- and some snapshots of a reunion with his brother in  Monterey Park. "Next week, it's my wife's turn."  </P> <P> Blanca Lucho, a 24-year-old housekeeper, sent home a package that included a  money order for $150 and a few gifts for her mother, whom she has not seen  since coming here in 1984. Inside the small "CARE package" was a pair of dress  shoes, a change purse, a pincushion in the shape of a heart, and two small jars  of cold cream and B-12 vitamins.  </P> <P> Because the housekeeper's package was headed for Guatemala City, chances were  it would reach its destination quickly, said Garza Express office manager  Franklyn Marquez. But the same cannot be said for packages and letters sent to  the remote jungle and mountain areas of Guatemala, or to the countryside in El  Salvador.  </P> <P> "We deliver anywhere in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. That's what makes  us unique." Marquez said. "Unfortunately, there are places where our couriers  can't get through."  </P> <P> To prove his point, Marquez produced a small stack of returned envelopes,  covered with the scrawled messages of frustrated couriers: "Couldn't deliver --  war zone," and "the guerrillas wouldn't let me pass."  </P> <P> Another chain, Pipil Express, has solved the problem of delivery to El  Salvador's war zones by announcing the arrival of the money orders and packages  on local radio stations so that the recipients can pick them up in the relative  safety of a regional post office, said manager Mauricio Saravia.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Friends the Best Couriers  </P> <P> Although more and more Central American immigrants seem to be using the courier  services, many say the preferred way to send money and packages home is with a  friend returning to the home country.  </P> <P> Invariably, flights from Los Angeles International Airport to Central America  are filled with passengers carrying television sets, blenders, skateboards and  every other type of small appliance or toy that can fit into a box or suitcase.  </P> <P> Among those waiting for TACA Airlines Flight 511 to depart on one recent  evening for San Salvador and Guatemala City was Antonio Hernandez, a  38-year-old Salvadoran construction worker.  </P> <P> Hernandez was not a passenger on the flight, but his friend Jose Pablo  Villatoro was. Hernandez explained that Villatoro was doing him the favor of  taking a stereo to his relatives.  </P> <P> "When someone travels, you take advantage of the opportunity," Hernandez said.  "It's the cheapest way to send things home."  </P> <P> Villatoro was traveling alone to San Salvador with six large boxes and two  suitcases. They were packed, he said, with clothes and more stereo equipment  for his own family. "When you have a chance to buy things, you have to share  with people there who don't have that chance," he said.  </P> <P> Some passengers packed their suitcases and boxes over the weight limit and were  told by airline officials they would have to rearrange their luggage into  smaller, lighter boxes that wouldn't strain the backs of the luggage handlers.  </P> <P> "We have to take out 20 pounds, we have to take out more," said Edwin Torres as  he helped his friend, Teresa Henriquez, unload clothes from an overstuffed box.  </P> <P> "Let's take out the microwave," he said finally, lifting the brand-new  appliance from underneath several layers of dresses, pants and blouses.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Last Obstacle  </P> <P> Once they arrived in Central America with their booty, the passengers of Flight  511 would face one last obstacle -- local customs officials. Stiff customs  duties are designed to protect the local economy from foreign competition. But  most of the passengers on Flight 511 said they could easily avoid any duties by  bribing an official.  </P> <P> Nor are the Central American governments likely to try and stop the flow of  dollars into their countries.  </P> <P> "It's good for the families but the money helps the economy, too," said  Hamilton of USC. "The money has to be changed to the domestic currency and the  government eventually gets the dollars."  </P> <P> Helping the economy, however, seemed to be far from the minds of most of the  immigrants who came to Pipil Express on Vermont Avenue last week.  </P> <P> "The situation is very difficult over there," said Jose Fernando Castaneda, 33,  a native of Usulutan in eastern El Salvador. His money order would help his  parents buy food and plant crops on their farm, he said. "At least with what I  send home, life is better for them."  </P></p>

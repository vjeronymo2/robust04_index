			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iii) Paying RN's wages at a rate higher than currently being paid to RN's similarly employed in the geographic area;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Providing adequate support services to free RN's from administrative and other non-nursing duties;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Providing reasonable opportunities for meaningful salary advancement by RN's.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8 U.S.C. 1182(m)(2)(B) (i) through (v); see 8 U.S.C. 1182(m)(2)(A)(iv)(I).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Items (i) through (v) above are not an exclusive list of the significant steps that may be taken to meet the requirements of the fourth attestations element, and a facility is not required to take more than one step if the facility can demonstrate than taking a second step is not reasonable. 8 U.S.C. 1182(m)(2)(B).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Special rules apply to cases where an alien nurse, for whom an employer has filed an attestation, is performing services at a worksite other than the employer's worksite or other than a worksite controlled by the employer. In cases of temporary, emergency circumstances, with respect to information not within the knowledge of the attestor, or for other good cause, the Secretary may waive such requirements for the attestation for the worksite as the Secretary may determine are appropriate, in order to avoid duplicative attestations. 8 U.S.C. 1182(m)(2)(A) (as amended by section 162(f)(2)(B)(iii) of IMMACT).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These attestations (and visa petitions supported by them) are available for public examination in the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) National Office in Washington, D.C. 8 U.S.C. 1182(m)(2)(E)(i). The Department also informs the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) which attestations have been accepted. The employer must furnish evidence to INS that the Department has accepted its attestation for filing as a prerequisite for INS approving a petition to bring in foreign RN's under H&hyph;1A visas (which visas are issued by the U.S. Department of State (DOS)). 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In summary, DOL's administrative functions under the INRA include, with certain limited exceptions, receiving and accepting attestations for filing,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> checking that the attestation form is properly completed and that the required explanatory statements are provided. DOL reviews elements of attestations in only four instances: (1) the facility attests to a ``non-standards'' indicator of substantial disruption (Element I); (2) the facility takes as one of its two steps a ``non-standard'' timely and significant step (Element IV); (3) the facility attests that taking a second timely and significant step under Element IV would not be reasonable; and (4) the facility is not an employer of H&hyph;1A nurses and is claiming a bona fide medical emergency as the basis for requesting a waiver of one or more of the attestation elements. The Department also makes the accepted attestations available for public inspection, and notifies INS of those attestations that DOL has on file. These administration functions are delegated, by regulation, to ETA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Complaints, Investigations and Enforcement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department is also authorized to investigate allegations that a facility has failed to meet the conditions attested to or that a facility has misrepresented a material fact in an attestation. 8 U.S.C. 1182(m)(2)(E) (ii) through (v). If violations are found, DOL may impose administrative remedies, including civil money penalties (CMP's); shall notify the Attorney General, who shall not approve H&hyph;1A petitions for a period of at least 1 year for the facility; shall obtain back wages; and may impose other remedies. These activities constitute the Department's enforcement functions under the INRA. Under the regulations, the enforcement functions are delegated to the Department's Employment Standards Administration (ESA), Wage and Hour Division. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Advisory Group <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, pursuant to the INRA, the Secretary appointed an advisory group which includes representatives of DOL, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Attorney General, hospitals, and labor organizations representing RN's. Pub. L. 101&hyph;238 section 3(c)(2), 103 Stat. at 2103. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the INRA, the advisory group advises the Secretary on:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The impact of this legislation on the nursing shortage,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Programs that health care facilities may implement to recruit and retain U.S. RN's,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) State recruitment and retention plans, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The advisability of extending the law beyond the current 5-year duration of this pilot program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The advisory group operates under the auspices of the DOL Office of the Assistant Secretary for Policy. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

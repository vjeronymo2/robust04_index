			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Observer: Smallish war Political crisis time again in Lilliputian Lichtenstein, where partisan patronage dies hard. It has been just a year since Prince Hans Adam, the last monarch in Europe with any real power, threatened to dissolve parliament (with 25 members) because of the resistance of the government (five members) to moving closer to the EC. Now a new parliament has voted out its youngest ever prime minister after only four months, his own party deserting him because he put a member of the opposition in charge of the civil service. The prince, who opined that the 34-year-old Markus Buchel had done no wrong, warned again that he would dissolve parliament if they voted him out. Watch this space.</p>

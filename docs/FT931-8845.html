			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Banana battle looms over EC import curbs LATIN AMERICAN exporting countries have accused the European Community of hypocrisy following its decision to impose import restrictions on their bananas. In Costa Rica president Rafael Calderon declared that 'we will continue to fight if the Europeans are not prepared to do us justice. We will fight within Gatt (the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), though that does not preclude (other) settlements.' A commission of the region's banana producing countries is trying to establish whether the EC's decision actually violates Gatt norms and EC Gatt representatives are being asked to justify the measures Meanwhile Mr Guillermo Endara, the Panamanian president, declared that EC leaders had 'no idea what damage they were causing to our countries'. In Ecuador, the world's largest banana exporter, the foreign minister, Mr Diego Paredes, said, however, that his country was not considering retaliatory measures. Ecuador believed in free trade, he said. The minister announced that a delegation would travel to Europe early next month to seek negotiations and make leaders there more 'sensitive to the problems the import restrictions are causing'. Last Friday the presidents of the region's banana producing countries rallied together in a display of solidarity, pledging to challenge the EC import restrictions. Yet despite a unanimous condemnation of the EC decision, the nine state representatives stopped short of adopting more aggressive measures. The idea of using the Panama Canal to put pressure on some EC countries was rejected by President Endara, who said that international agreements forbade such action. Ecuador has begun to seek alternative markets. Negotiations are under way with Middle and Far East countries and sales have already been clinched in Iran. The import restrictions come at a time when many Latin American countries have recently made considerable investments to increase banana production. Mr Sixto Duran Ballen, president of Ecuador, declared that: 'The developed countries are now showing us that free trade is only a farce. Protectionism is returning, this time hiding behind more powerful economic blocs'.</p>

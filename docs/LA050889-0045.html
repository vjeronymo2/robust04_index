			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Local homeowners and the Sierra Club have joined forces to fight a Squaw Valley  Ski Corp. expansion project. They say the cutting of more than 1,800 trees in  Shirley Canyon and Tram Bowl to make way for new ski lifts would destroy the  valley's last remaining pristine area and damage its watershed. The Sierra Club  has filed suit to block the tree-cutting and the Squaw Valley Homeowners Assn.  supports the action. A Superior Court ruling, expected in about 60 days, could  require a second environmental impact statement or could give the go-ahead for  the cutting. "We're trying to protect Squaw Valley from adverse development,"  said Janice Flannigan, association vice president. The suit contends Placer  County supervisors erred by allowing the cutting since their decision was based  on an incomplete environmental impact study. Ski corporation owner Alex Cushing  defended the supervisors, saying the study was done by qualified experts and  adequately addressed environmental concerns.  </P></p>

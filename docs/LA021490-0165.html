			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> KEY PREP STARS CHOOSE TO PLAY FOR NEBRASKA U.  </P> <P> Calvin Jones, one of the nation's top-rated running backs, signed a national  letter of intent to play football at Nebraska on the first day high school  seniors can commit themselves in writing.  </P> <P> Jones, from Omaha Central High School, was rated as the nation's fourth-best  high school running back by SuperPrep Magazine in California. Jones is 6 feet  tall and weighs 190 pounds.  </P> <P> Among Nebraska's other recruits was another prep All-American, Derek Brown of  Anaheim. He was among the most highly publicized recruits in 1989, but he  failed to meet academic standards.  </P> <P> Others committing to Nebraska today were quarterback Todd Gragnano, 6-1, 185,  of Los Alamitos; Brian Havens, 6-3, 240, also of Los Alamitos, and Brenden  Stai, 6-4, 260, of Anaheim.  </P> <P> Although Notre Dame and Miami are expected to have two of the nation's top  recruiting classes, the top quarterback in the country, Chris Weinke, is  expected to sign today with Florida State.  </P> <P> Florida State had a verbal commitment from Weinke, of St. Paul, Minn. At 6-5  and 205 pounds, Weinke also captained his school's hockey team.  </P> <P> Another highly rated quarterback, Cale Gundy of Midwest City, Okla., announced  his intention of signing with Oklahoma, even though the Sooners are on NCAA  probation.  </P> <P> "I've got a chance to fulfill my dreams," said Gundy, adding that he has wanted  to play for Oklahoma since he was 5.  </P> <P> Gundy, rated the No. 2 quarterback in the nation, isn't expected to sign a  letter of intent until late today. He passed for more than 2,300 yards in his  high school career.  </P> <P> Gundy said baseball was a big factor in his decision.  </P> <P> "I feel really good about attending the University of Oklahoma to play football  and baseball," he said.  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, the Sooners signed Aubrey Beavers of Houston, rated the No.  1 defensive lineman in the country. Beavers bypassed national champion Miami to  sign with the Sooners.  </P> <P> Texas signed the nation's fourth-rated quarterback, Steve Clements of  Huntsville, Tex., whose father is a coach and former Longhorn quarterback.  </P> <P> Clements said he may be asked to redshirt as a freshman. "If I did redshirt, it  probably would be better for me," he said. "I only weigh 180. I need to get  some meat on these bones."  </P> <P> In Tuscaloosa, Alabama announced that it has signed South Miami High School  linebacker Joey Veargis, rated 16th in the nation. Veargis said he also had  offers from Florida State, Miami, Michigan and West Virginia.  </P> <P> "We're looking at signing 23 players," said Gene Stallings, Alabama's new  coach. "There might be a case where we'll sign 24 or 25, but we may hold back  one or two scholarships."  </P></p>

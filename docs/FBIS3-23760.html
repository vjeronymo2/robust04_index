			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vadim Nesvizhskiy, under the heading "Soviets": </F> "All Branches of Government Are Equal, but Some Are More Equal  Than Others: Anatoliy Sobchak Limits Powers of St. Petersburg's  Future Lawmakers"]    [Text] After successfully eliminating the St. Petersburg  City Soviet at year's end and along with it dual government in  the city, now-unchallenged city hall has set about creating a  new alliance of powers in a form understood by Mayor Anatoliy  Sobchak. An amendment to the presidential edict "A Statute on  the System of Organs of State Authority in St. Petersburg"  drafted by city hall in essence means that the future assembly  intended to replace the former soviet will not greatly trouble  the existence of the executive branch.    Elected for a two-year term, it will be comprised of 50  deputies working on a part-time basis. The city parliament's  functions will be limited to approving the budget and  establishing legal standards. The mayor will be head of St.  Petersburg's government and will be granted the right to  independently appoint and fire the heads of the city's organs of  state authority.    The documents do not set forth any procedures for  impeachment  of the head of the city administration, yet they set forth in  detail a statute on dissolution of the city assembly.  Incidentally, the assembly may also dissolve itself -- and all  that requires is a simple majority of deputies, whereas  overturning a mayoral veto will require a vote of at least  two-thirds of the full membership. A two-thirds majority will  also be required to reject an amendment made by the mayor to any  of the deputies' draft legislation -- otherwise the amendment  automatically becomes part of the law.    The assembly may hand down a decision of no confidence in a  public official -- but only in cases of flagrant violation of  the Russian Constitution or Russian law, or violation of  government decrees and the city's own legal acts. As in all  cases pertaining to city hall, decisions in such cases will  require a two-thirds majority vote from the deputies. Even in  better days the St. Petersburg City Soviet could barely bring  together a quorum (50 percent of its full membership), so it  seems quite improbable that the new city assembly will be able  to convene the appropriate number of deputies every time.    After curtailing the powers of the yet-to-be-established  city  parliament, the mayor then enacted a statute on elections to the  St. Petersburg City Assembly, which are slated for 20 March  1994. Assembly elections will take place in a single round of  voting. There will be a five-year term limit on elected  representatives, as well as a ban on participation in municipal  elections by so-called "non-citizens" of the Russian Federation  (of which there are officially approximately 1,000 in St.  Petersburg).    Particularly notable is a passage which states that all  unspent money from campaign funds, associations and candidates  will be turned over to the city budget after the election  campaign is over. Therefore on the eve of the election one  should expect massive attempts by candidates to spend their  campaign money before it leaves their hands -- including the  traditional idea of throwing a big party with the "leftovers."</p>

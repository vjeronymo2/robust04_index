			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MERCHANTS SET SALE IN UNCERTAIN WATERS OF HOLIDAY SEASON;  </P> <P> SHOPPING: EXPECTATIONS ARE LOW, BUT SOME STORE OWNERS IN DOWNTOWN BUSINESS  DISTRICTS ARE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED BY THE TURNOUT.  </P> <P> For many, the words shopping and mall go together like Dasher and Donner. But  as Orange County shoppers rang in the first official day of the Christmas  shopping season Friday, some shunned the hustle-bustle of big malls for the  county's handful of downtown business districts.  </P> <P> And like retailers across the nation, an informal survey of local downtown  merchants on Friday found an uneasy mood about the holiday shopping season amid  concerns about the economy and the turmoil in the Middle East.  </P> <P> Many downtown merchants reported sparse business, and some seemed more resigned  than others to the idea of unspectacular holiday sales.  </P> <P> "I'm one who says, que sera, sera," said Charlene Rogers, manager of Exclusive  Antiques in downtown Orange. "It's slow, but we'll survive with the flow of  traffic we have."  </P> <P> Mark Stevens, manager of the J.E. Dawson men's clothier in Laguna Beach, said,  "It's slow everywhere." He said early seasonal discounting by major department  stores has added to the woes of smaller retailers already hurt by a sluggish  national economy. "The department stores have inundated the public with sale,  sale, sale at the malls, and that has hurt us here locally."  </P> <P> But some shoppers said they were by passing department store discounts for a  more relaxed, small-town type of shopping experience.  </P> <P> Cathy Davalos, a 28-year-old teacher from Cerritos, was inspecting the dolls at  Exclusive Antiques in Orange on Friday afternoon. She said she doesn't like the  crowds at malls.  </P> <P> "I like the quaintness of this area, the old-town feel," she said. "Malls are  so boxed-in, with piped-in music. They're so stale."  </P> <P> Local retailers said they'd been expecting a slow start to the holiday shopping  season because of the economy. Light morning traffic seemed to confirm the  gloomy predictions, but the crowds grew at some major shopping malls as the day  wore on. By early evening, motorists were lined up at the Bristol Street exit  ramp on the San Diego Freeway, near South Coast Plaza.  </P> <P> Westminster Mall reported heavy traffic by the end of the day as well. But  traffic remained moderate at MainPlace mall in Santa Ana and light at Fashion  Island in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> After several months of slow sales, merchants in downtown Orange said Friday's  increased foot traffic was a welcome change.  </P> <P> "Today was a little more than I expected," said Dorothy Casada, owner of  Dorothy &amp; Friends Antiques, as she wrapped a harvest-colored pillow. "But  we're probably not any busier than last year."  </P> <P> It's not for lack of trying. Some merchants in downtown Orange have begun  offering free refreshments to weekend shoppers and plan to keep it up until the  holiday season ends.  </P> <P> Diane Zalay, an owner of Antique Place, said shoppers are buying less and  buying differently. "People are buying fewer frills and knickknacks," Zalay  said.  </P> <P> Along Santa Ana's 4th Street, groups of predominantly Latino shoppers crowded  the sidewalks of the old but renovated shopping district Friday.  </P> <P> Some came to stock up on Christmas presents or gifts to take to their native  Mexico or Central America for the holidays. Others appeared to be more  interested in just watching the active street life.  </P> <P> John Garcia, manager of Perfect Shoes, said sales are off this year because of  the uncertain economy. "We don't expect Christmas to be like last year," Garcia  said. "People are holding back. They seemed to be holding onto their money."  </P> <P> In Laguna Beach's main business district, Chantilly By The Sea seemed to be  attracting the biggest crowds on an unseasonably warm November day. But what  the shop sells -- ice cream -- isn't meant for under the Yuletide tree.  </P> <P> Laguna Beach retailers said sales were slow and the most crowded stores  appeared to be restaurants and snack shops.  </P> <P> "A lot more people are putting things on hold and coming back," said Jane  Huston, a clerk at Hobie Sports, a surf and ski shop. "People are taking more  time to decide what they want to buy."  </P> <P> Those shoppers interviewed walking around town said they were there for the  beach and to browse, not to buy. Some observers said people seemed to be  carrying fewer shopping bags than in years past.  </P> <P> Shoppers "know stuff is going to be on sale after Christmas," said Tori Taylor,  store manager at Hobie Sports.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Gregory Crouch and Chris Woodyard contributed to this  story.  </P></p>

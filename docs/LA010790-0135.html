			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: STILL SEAWORTHY?  </P> <P> "Now, Voyager" -- the 1942 Bette Davis classic in which she utters the famed  closing line, "Don't let's ask for the moon -- we have the stars" -- may be  casting off for a remake.  </P> <P> Jazz harpist/producer Corky Hale and literary agent Shirley Strick have  acquired remake rights to the sudser from Turner Entertainment, and are about  to assign a writer through Magnus Films.  </P> <P> And already, claims Hale, there's been interest from the reps of such actresses  as Kathleen Turner and Jessica Lange.  </P> <P> "All you have to do is say 'Now, Voyager' and there's instant recognition,"  said Hale, who's married to Mike Stoller of the songwriting team of (Jerry)  Leiber &amp; Stoller ("Hound Dog," "Is That All There Is").  </P> <P> Recall the plot: an ugly duckling spinster (with a cold-hearted mother)  transforms herself into a swan, sets sail on an ocean cruise, meets and falls  in love with a married man -- who can't leave his wife. (As Davis' true love,  Paul Henreid proves adept at lighting two cigarettes simultaneously.)  </P> <P> Isn't that storyline a bit creaky for the '90s?  </P> <P> "Oh, come on!" Hale countered. "Ask around and you'll find plenty of women  today who are involved with married men who for one reason or other can't leave  their wives. This story is as timely as ever.  </P> <P> "The domineering mother is also timeless. Right now, we plan to make ours  similar to Leona Helmsley -- she'll be a tyrant who's also a successful  businesswoman." Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Volume in the derivatives market dried up yesterday as the pressure from recent buy programmes shifted to the underlying stock market and pushed it to a new high, writes Peter John. The March Footsie futures contract was marked up some 23 points at the start of official trading, reflecting a sharp squeeze prompted by bear closing in the market. However, the advance was not sustained by heavy activity and at the official close less than 5,000 contracts had changed hands and March was only up another 20 points. It was a day that allowed the futures to breathe more easily after a sustained period of heavy activity, particularly in tailor-made over the counter options which have been expiring recently. Turnover in the traded options area of the Liffe was at 42,045 contracts, down from Wednesday's 49,000 lots, although that volume had been boosted by stock options scheduled to expire in December.</p>

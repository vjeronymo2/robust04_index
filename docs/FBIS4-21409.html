			<p>BFN     [Text] Abuja, 24 March (PANA) -- The Central African  Republic, which attended the just-concluded eighth summit of the  Lake Chad Basin Commission, in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, has  been admitted as the fifth member of the commission.    A communique at the end of the two-day summit on Thursday  [24  March], said the country's admission was based on its "strategic  location as the source of major rivers which flows into Lake  Chad." The statement also said that the summit, attended by Gen.  Sani Abacha (Nigeria), Presidents Idriss Deby of Chad and  Mahamane Ousmane of Niger, as well as Cameroonian Minister of  State Frederick Kodock, agreed to set up a joint security force  to "safeguard life and property" in the lake region. The force,  to be based in Bagakawa, northern Nigeria, is to have "political  and logistic support from member nations of the commission."    The communique said the need for the force became imperative  because of the realisation that the objectives of the  commission's programmes and master-plan "can only be achieved in  a secured environment." "The commission therefore, decided to  have rotational leadership for the joint security force with  defined mode of human and material contributions of  member-states," it added.    The master-plan adopted by the summit would seek to  "successfully stop all forms of ecological degradations of the  lake and its basin."    Launching a campaign to save the Lake Chad in Abuja on  Wednesday as part of the eighth summit, Abacha said that the  master-plan contained "viable and sustainable strategies for the  management and development of the natural resources of the  lake." He disclosed that the lake's water had "reduced from  25,000 square kilometres in the 60's to a meagre area of 20,000  kilometres at present."    The next summit comes up next year in Chad, headquarters of  the commission, set up in 1964 for mutual exploration of the  lake's natural resources and to ensure collective security in  the region.</p>

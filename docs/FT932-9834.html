			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Business and the Environment: Problems of achieving higher standards - Worldwide Water / A look at EC policy IMPROVING the quality of water is one of the most ambitious parts of the European Commission's environmental policy. Yet, nearly two decades after some of the directives were passed, the Community is unable to tell whether countries are complying with the rules. At the same time, water shortages in Mediterranean countries are renewing pressure on standards. The Commission has passed more than 200 'green' directives in the past 20 years but the regulations on bathing and drinking water and on treatment of waste and sewage have attracted more than their share of attention. Surveys have shown them to attract a high level of popular support in many member countries. More rules may be in the pipeline: the Commission needs to decide whether to bring more chemicals under the regulation's scope and whether to incorporate a recent tightening of the World Health Organisation's guidelines on lead in drinking water. Northern countries have, on the whole, complied with more of the rules than southern - or so the incomplete figures available suggest. DGXI, the Commission's environmental directorate, says it accepts that lack of data on implementation of the directives has been a handicap in enforcing them. It is up to national inspectors to sample the water, but the methods and extent of testing vary widely between countries. Consumer surveys grading beaches make up some of the gap, water companies say, but are no substitute for systematic monitoring. What is clear, however, is that the directives are among the most expensive to implement of all the 'green' rules passed by the Commission. The UK's water industry, in the middle of a capital spending programme which could eventually top Pounds 45bn, estimates that half the sum is directly due to the EC directives. Meeting the new WHO lead guidelines - which would mean replacing miles of lead piping - could cost another Pounds 8bn, it says. Ian Byatt, director general of Ofwat, the UK's water regulator, has argued that if the Commission keeps tightening the rules, water costs - and, in the UK, customers' bills - will be trapped on a never-ending upwards 'escalator'. That prospect has led Eureau, the group representing national water companies from all EC countries except Greece, to lobby for a revision to the standards, or at least restraint in setting new ones. Janet Langdon, director of the UK Water Services Association, which represents the 10 large water and sewerage companies of England and Wales, also argues that European countries should have the right to set their own standards on the colour and taste of drinking water where there are no health implications. The Commission's environment directorate plans to hold a seminar in September to discuss these issues. Although Eureau's members believe they had received a sympathetic response earlier in the year, several are no longer as confident. Michael Swallow, director of the UK Water Companies Association which represents the smaller water supply companies, says: 'We will be looking with interest to see whether they have departed from the precautionary principle' - the insistence that every trace of some substances, such as pesticides, should be removed even where a health risk is not proven. He adds: 'The WHO guidelines for 32 pesticides are less stringent than the Commission's - we want to see how far the scientific basis will be recognised.' There are signs, though, that the Commission is taking the problem of enforcement seriously. The UK helped start up meetings of each countries' inspectors to help understand differences in monitoring methods. Devising a workable route to higher standards is not the Community's only headache - water shortages loom, too. The European Commission published a report at the end of last year warming that economic growth in the EC will become constrained by lack of fresh water. The report, by the Birmingham-based consultancy Ecotec, argues that the shortages will be most pronounced in Mediterranean countries, because of increased industrialisation and growing populations. But it also said that contamination of groundwater by industry and agriculture in industrialised and heavily-populated northern countries will add to the costs of growth. The past decade has seen some improvement in pollution control, the Rhine and the Meuse, among the worst-affected rivers, have seen concentrations of lead, zinc, arsenic, copper and mercury fall. However, the environment directorate has conceded that the improvements are 'disappointing' given the effort and money expended. The result of Europe's pollution levels and high water standards, according to the Ecotec report, is that the average cost of water in Europe, Ecu0.66 per cu m, is some two to three times more expensive than in the US or in densely-populated Japan. As EC countries become more alert to the rising cost of water and to the impact on their competitiveness, it may force the Commission's environment directorate to pick its targets more carefully and consider the economic consequences more thoroughly than it has done in the past.

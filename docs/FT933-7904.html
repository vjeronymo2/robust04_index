			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Stock markets spur each other to reach fresh highs STOCK MARKETS in the US, Britain and Germany climbed to fresh highs yesterday on hopes that lower European interest rates will spur economic recovery in Europe and help fuel growth in the US. Share prices in several Far Eastern markets also posted strong gains. The UK and German markets were boosted by heavy overseas buying and reports that institutional investors were shifting funds out of Japanese equities. In the US, investors appeared confident that European economic revival would aid the struggling US economy. Throughout the day, the markets appeared to feed on each others' strength. Just as Tuesday's new high for the Dow Jones Industrial Average spurred early rises in London, so big gains there and in other overseas markets helped lift US stocks at the opening in New York, sending the Dow through 3,600 for the first time. Heavy demand for recently depressed drug stocks, and further declines in domestic bond yields, also contributed to the advance of US equities. By the close, the Dow had reached 3,604.86, up 17.88. In the UK, the FT-SE 100 Index ended at 3,073.6, up 48.6, the biggest daily gain since late-January. The advance was fuelled by foreign demand, in particular from the US, as global investment strategists recommended the London market in anticipation of falling interest rates, a firm currency and growing confidence in the recovery of the economy and corporate earnings. The rise in share prices was backed by near record trading in traded options and stock index futures. German and Spanish stocks also hit highs for the year. Frankfurt's DAX index ended up 25.55 at 1,935.75. Five stock markets in Pacific Rim countries climbed to high points for the year. New Zealand equities rose 3.4 per cent to a three-year peak and Australia shrugged off the impact of the federal budget to close at its best level since 1987. Malaysia reached an all-time high, Hong Kong climbed to its third consecutive peak and Singapore its fourth on overseas demand for blue chips.</p>

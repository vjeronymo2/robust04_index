			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Acatos boosted by sale of loss-makers SHARES IN Acatos &amp; Hutcheson jumped 15p to 170p as the manufacturer and supplier of edible oil products turned in a 13 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.68m to Pounds 7.56m for the year to September 27. The group reaped the full benefits of pulling out of its loss-making Spanish joint venture and selling its unprofitable UK plastics operation in the last year. Although turnover fell to Pounds 200.9m, compared with Pounds 228.5m, net borrowings were slashed from Pounds 16.4m to Pounds 10.1m at the year-end because of sharply improved cashflow. Lower interest rates helped interest charges fall to Pounds 1.37m (Pounds 3.1m). Mr Ian Hutcheson, chairman, said that with results ahead of expectations, the group decided to bring forward capital spending plans. It made an exceptional charge of Pounds 1.5m to cover the depreciation provision for the accelerated replacement of buildings and plant. He said the group had restored foundations for longer-term growth, and would concentrate on improving efficiencies to win back UK market share lost to European competitors in the past few years. Earnings per share advanced from 13.3p to 15.2p. A proposed final dividend of 4p makes a total of 6.5p, compared with 5p last time.</p>

It has set a new target of 2p to be achieved by 1998. Mr Jeffrey said this could be achieved by increasing output from about 16.8 terawatt hours this year to 19TWh by 1998 through improved overall efficiency and a cut in inspections, when plants have to be closed, from every two years to every three. The company said staff numbers were below 1,900, compared with 2,200 two years ago. By the end of the year it expects to employ about 1,750 people.

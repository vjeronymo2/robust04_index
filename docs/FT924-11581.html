			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: British Airways If BA can get away with it, yesterday's purchase of Dan-Air for a nominal Pounds 1 appears to be a shrewd deal. Buying an existing business is generally better than picking up pieces from the receiver. Preserving a few hundred jobs in the current economic climate must be worth a few brownie points. The combination of BA's marketing clout and a proportionately lower Gatwick overhead - existing BA staff there are being offered inducements to accept lower pay - means that Dan-Air's routes could be profitable as early as next year. The cost to BA is admittedly vague - but then the numbers being talked about would not even purchase a jumbo jet. There will be operating losses in the short term and perhaps Pounds 35m of restructuring costs will be charged to shareholders' funds. What remains to be seen, given the soft second-hand market, is whether the sale of some of Dan-Air's surplus 727s will lead to future book losses. At least BA's balance sheet can comfortably absorb the shock for the time being. Mr Branson's Virgin group might have been engaging in a substantially greater risk. There is always a chance the regulators kick up a fuss. The odds, though, must favour BA, given the availability of Gatwick slots and a lack of any other way to ensure even Dan-Air's partial survival. The worry for BA shareholders is that, with the USAir deal looming too, even small deals bring closer the day when they may be asked to subscribe to a rights issue.</p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Wembley chosen for BCCI meeting THE LIQUIDATORS of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International were given High Court approval yesterday to hold a creditors' meeting in London, Richard Donkin writes. Touche Ross, the firm acting as liquidators, expects about 5,000 creditors to attend the meeting at Wembley Arena on May 27. It is being held for creditors of BCCI SA, the Luxembourg-registered arm of the bank which ran all of BCCI's UK branches. Some 140,000 creditors worldwide are potentially eligible to attend. So far Touche Ross has received 29,000 proof-of-debt forms from BCCI SA depositors worldwide. Of those, 5,000 have been returned from UK-based BCCI depositors who had accounts in British branches of the bank.</p>

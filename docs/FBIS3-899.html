The striking workers are accusing the government of trying  to  transfer EPA workers into another department without having made  any prior arrangements. According to the unions, the  authorities' decision stems from a promise made to the World  Bank and the International Monetary Fund to keep salary  commitments at the current level of 42 billion CFA francs.    For two months now, the EPA personnel expenses have  allegedly  been charged to Chapter 21 of the national budget, which is on  subsidies, and not to Chapter 11, which is on salaries. In the  unions' view, this is likely to make the EPA personnel's salary  situation precarious in the long run. The state could gradually  transfer salary costs to the departments which employ them.    For several months now, the authorities have been saying  that  the rearrangement is purely technical. It should be pointed out  that they have decided to increase salaries by 15 percent, 10  percent of which will be paid as of 1 April and 5 percent in  October.    In Bamako, FM transmissions on Radio France International  and  Africa No. 1 were interrupted due to the strike, which has also  affected all the major hospitals in Bamako and its surroundings.</p>

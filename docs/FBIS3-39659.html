			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The European Commission expressed its regret today  over the measures the Greek Government has adopted against  Skopje and sought clarification of this action.    According to an AFP dispatch from Brussels, Commission  President Jacques Delors said these measures are no good either  for building Europe or for the family spirit that should govern  the member states of the European Union.    The European Commission's press spokesman said the  Commission  is awaiting the results of the discussion the European troika  will hold as well as the explanations the Greek side will give  before adopting a position concerning the free movement of trade  between a united Europe and third countries.    In Paris, the Foreign Ministry spokesman said the Greek  Government's decision does not facilitate the dialogue that  France desires and one which would provide a solution and  contribute to the necessary stability in the Balkans. The  spokesman noted that France intends to convey to Greece its  concern at a time when everyone's goal should be to ease the  tension in the Balkans.    The German Government has also expressed its concern over  Greece's measures. The German Foreign Ministry spokesman said  Bonn considers the Balkan region needs more, not less stability.    Denmark criticized Greece's decision to impose economic  sanctions on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and asked  Athens to resolve its disputes with Skopje through negotiations.  Danish Foreign Minister Niel Helveg Petersen asked that the  issue be raised at the European Union's foreign ministers  meeting in Brussels on Monday [21 February].</p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> The Transportation Department gave tentative approval to the sale of the  lucrative Eastern Airlines shuttle to Trump. The price tag for the sale, which  was announced in October by Trump and Texas Air Corp., Eastern's parent  company, is $365 million. The shuttle, Eastern's only profitable operation, has  hourly, non-reservation flights between New York and Washington and New York  and Boston. The Transportation Department said it found Trump's plans for the  carrier sound financially and that his key personnel have the necessary  managerial and technical skills. The Trump Shuttle still must pass a safety  review by the Federal Aviation Administration before the sale can be completed.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday urged people  from all walks of life to join the Government's project to  reafforest over five million rai of land.    The project is in commemoration of the 50th anniversary in  1996 of the reign of His Majesty the King.    The premier made the call at a meeting at Government House  to  unveil the project attended by some 500 provincial governors,  representatives of provincial chambers of commerce, businessmen  and ministerial officials.    Mr. Chuan said Their Majesties the King and Queen have been  devotees of forest conservation and reafforestation.    In 1996 His Majesty the King will have been on the throne  for  50 years, the longest reign in the kingdom and currently in the  world.    The Government will seize this great opportunity. All Thais  will celebrate the event through the reafforestation project in  honour of His Majesty the King, he said.    Apart from the five million rai of denuded forest land,  trees  will be planted at roadsides, temples, schools, government  offices and residential communities.    The project, the biggest of its kind launched by the  Agriculture and Cooperatives Ministry in 30 years of  reafforestation work, has begun in certain areas and will be  accelerated so that it is completed in time for the big  celebrations in 1996.    The Government has informed Their Majesties the King and  Queen about the project.    Their Majesties have expressed their royal wish that the  reafforestation be carried out in uninhabited areas with mixed  species of tree seedlings, especially indigenous species.    The work should be done from the top of the denuded  mountains  to the plains and, in the case of serious erosion, vetiver grass  should be introduced to help hold the topsoil and keep humidity.    Their Majesties also said that fog catchers made from cheap  local materials should be provided at the planted pits to catch  fog or dew drops to feed the seedlings.    The fog catchers would also protect the seedlings from the  sun and provide water for the seedlings at the same time.    The authorities concerned should follow Their Majesties'  suggestions in carrying out the project, Mr. Chuan said.    The Cabinet approved the project last Tuesday and regards it  as a major task for all ministers.    The project calls for the reafforestation of five million  rai  over 1,345 degraded forests across the country beginning on  Coronation Day this year, 5 May, and ending on 5 May 1996.    After reafforestation, the project areas will be conserved  and closed to commercial exploitation, and villagers will not be  allowed to encroach on the land.    Those who joined the reafforestation will not be able to  claim ownership of the forest.    Deputy Agriculture Minister Suthep Thuaksuban, the minister  responsible for the project, said deteriorating conservation  forests in national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and watershed  areas will come under the project.    The Government's target is to reafforest 1.35 million rai of  denuded forest land this year, 1.65 million rai next year and  another two million rai in 1996.    Mr. Suthep said the Forestry Department has prepared 500  million seedlings so far for the reafforestation this year.    He said His Majesty the King pioneered the program with the  reafforestation of the Chai Phatthana and Mae Fa Luang  foundations, 500,000 rai of land, for the Thai people.    Several private sector companies have joined the program by  expressing their intention to grow trees on two million rai of  land nationwide. Oil trading businesses have promised to grow  trees on about one million rai.    Reafforesting one rai will cost about 3,000 baht. The entire  project will require about 20 billion baht.    A new foundation will be set up specifically to handle the  project on behalf of all interested parties.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by J Rees] </F>   [Text] Phuthaditjhaba April 21 SAPA -- Thousands of people  braved icy weather to see African National Congress President  Nelson Mandela at a waterlogged rally in QwaQwa on Thursday [21  April]. The ANC president's light aircraft from Bloemfontein to  Phuthaditjhaba was diverted to Harrismith to avoid the  cloudburst and hailstorm over QwaQwa. Youths at  Phuthaditjhaba's T K Mopeli Stadium tore down a brass bust of  the late Chief Charles N Mopeli -- kicking and stoning it.    Mr Mandela made a powerful appeal for reconciliation and  national unity, telling cheering supporters he would not  tolerate lawlessness after the election. He guaranteed farmers  and business people that they would not be the victims of  violence, looting or dispossession in his lifetime. "I condemn  the lawlessness and anyone who breaks the law will be dealt with  harshly."    At an earlier meeting in Thaba Nchu, the capital of what was  once a fragment of Bophuthatswana, Mr Mandela said it was proper  that the ANC should take the lead in getting people to accept  the spirit of reconciliation and to work for it. He urged  people to support the Police and Army in the former homeland of  Bophuthatswana, saying they were needed to maintain law and  order. "It is your duty to go to every policeman and soldier  and say `Let bygones be bygones. Let us work together to build  our country'."    The ANC leader spent the day mobbed by photographers who  clashed with ANC bodyguards, one of whom threatened to "blow the  head off" an international news photographer.    Mr Mandela urged people to celebrate the ANC's election  victory next week in a manner that would boost confidence in the  organisation. He repeated his call for unity throughout the  day, quoting himself from after his 1963 treason trial: "I have  fought white domination just as I have fought black domination.  After 27 years in jail, 20 grandchildren and three  great-grandchildren, do you think I could come back and allow  any political party to divide our people."    He ordered the crowd not to attack farmers or business  people.    Thursday's weather made Mr Mandela six hours late for a  fundraising lunch in Phuthaditjhaba, but about 200 business  people waited patiently until after dark to hear that the  government gravy train was over. Mr Mandela pledged to take a  cut in salary and to start paying tax if he was elected  president. "How can a president commit himself to the  reconstruction of this country if he doesn't pay tax," he said.</p>

			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRISTIAN SCIENCE  </P> <P> When I read the article "Child Deaths Put Faith on Trial" (Part I, June 27), I  struggled to separate fact from fiction and fear from truth. I was particularly  surprised and disappointed by your use of the deliberately defamatory and  misleading statement of David Dunn, assistant district attorney in Sonoma  County, who apparently believes that Christian Scientists are similar to Jim  Jones' followers.  </P> <P> Whatever one may think about spiritual healing, such opinions are meaningless  in comparison to the Jonestown tragedy. What happened in Jonestown is very  removed from the practice of Christian Science. It is obvious that Mr. Dunn has  yet to discover that Christian Scientists have, for over 100 years, been  successfully healing themselves, their children and others.  </P> <P> This article is a good reminder that once again our civil liberties are in  jeopardy, as having legislatively passed exemptions from health and welfare  codes, etc., are no guarantee against prosecution. Those Christian Science  parents whose children died must now bear a financial burden, in addition to  the loss of their child, of defendingthemselves against what the law guaranteed  to them as Christian Scientists in the first place.  </P> <P> As a nation that prides itself on the spirit of free thinking and living,  surely we must be open-minded enough to accept another legitimate and proven  means of healing.  </P> <P> ELLEN VUKOVICH  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

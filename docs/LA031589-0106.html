			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Fewer Bank Failures: Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William  Seidman said he expects the number of bank failures, which reached a record 221  in 1988, to decline by about 20% this year. At the same time, while the outlook  for banks' profits is good, their earnings are not likely to be as high as the  record $25.2 billion earned in 1988, Seidman told a news conference. The  nation's 14,000 banks earned a record $6.5 billion in the fourth quarter. A  decline in loan-loss expenses helped boost earnings. Seidman said strength in  the economy was an important factor contributing to the record year for banks.  The record number of failures was largely because of the depressed economy in  the Southwest, where lower oil prices and a recession in the real estate  industry resulted in increased bank failures.L.

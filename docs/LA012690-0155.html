			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WEST GERMAN FILM MAKER FOCUSES ON RURAL AMERICA;  </P> <P> MOVIES: DIRECTOR PERCY ADLON WILL APPEAR AT UC IRVINE TONIGHT TO INTRODUCE AND  DISCUSS HIS FILM 'BAGDAD CAFE,' BOTH A CRITICAL AND AN ART HOUSE SUCCESS.  </P> <P> Director Percy Adlon, a West German, set his first English-language film,  "Bagdad Cafe," in a ramshackle motel and roadhouse in a dusty corner of the  Mojave Desert. His newest film is set in Stuttgart -- Stuttgart, Ark., not West  Germany.  </P> <P> Adlon -- who will be at UC Irvine tonight to introduce a screening of "Bagdad  Cafe" and to answer questions -- takes his camera to distinctly American places  that somehow escape the attention of American directors. To Adlon, these small  town places, and the people in them, are America.  </P> <P> "It's only 'out of the way' from a big city point of view. It's 95% of the  country," Adlon said Wednesday, framed by the picture window of his office in a  Westwood high-rise.  </P> <P> "This is what I learned as a documentary film maker: There are no ordinary  people," Adlon said. "I really believe in 'ordinary' situations and people  which I discover, finally, to be very extraordinary."  </P> <P> In "Bagdad Cafe," a hefty Bavarian housewife (played by the delightful Marianne  Sagebrecht) is stranded in the desert after a fight with her husband, and walks  to the tiny town of Bagdad where she slowly develops a friendship with a feisty  cafe owner (played by CCH Pounder).  </P> <P> Sagebrecht returns in the new film, "Rosalie Goes Shopping," as a mother of  seven who manages to pad her husband's salary -- he's a crop-duster pilot,  played by Brad Davis -- through increasingly brazen acts of credit fraud. The  only person who knows what she is doing is the priest (played by Judge  Reinhold), who hears her confession every day.  </P> <P> "If you confess your sins, they're not sins anymore," Adlon said. "He gets more  and more interested. He's actually waiting for her (every day), like people  waiting for a sequel."  </P> <P> The movie, he said, is a satire on a consumer society: "It's not aggressive  against people, because I like people, but aggressive against the system,"  which he called "a prison of spending money."  </P> <P> Adlon first used Sagebrecht, whom he discovered in a small stage production in  Munich, in the film "Sugarbaby." While he refers to her affectionately as "my  big Bavarian beauty queen," he said that this is the last film they will do  together, at least for a while. "For the time being, it's completed now, our  little trilogy," he said.  </P> <P> Adlon, who continues to live primarily in Munich, has been in Los Angeles since  September to arrange distribution of "Rosalie Goes Shopping," which opens in  San Francisco Feb. 9 and in Los Angeles March 3.  </P> <P> "Bagdad Cafe," a critical and art house success, is a warm and hopeful film.  Adlon, who said he does not always want to play the "soft card," turned to the  satire of the new film as a way of keeping a sense of variety.  </P> <P> While he described "Bagdad Cafe" as a film about the "real paradise of  friendship," the new movie, he said, is about the "false paradise of the  shopping mall."  </P> <P>  Percy Adlon will introduce "Bagdad Cafe" at 9 p.m. in the university's  Physical Sciences Lecture Hall. After the screening, Adlon will answer  questions from the audience. Admission: $2 to $4. Information: (714) 856-5588.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Letter: Integration on the buses Sir, Richard Tomkins's article about bus deregulation in Merthyr Tydfil ('Bus competition fails the road test', March 27) is full of omens for deregulation in London. London buses are already suffering from the fragmentation of a once good integrated system. London needs to: integrate buses, tubes, trains and taxis; revert to two-man crews on double-deckers, using updated Routemasters (slightly smaller and more reliable than other buses, and with open access platforms, these would increase average speeds and reduce the congestion caused by the buses themselves); confine one-man operation to small nimble local buses; and review the route structure to bring it in line with modern movement needs. To do this, London needs a single authority with control over the entire infrastructure and with powers to raise the necessary finances. T P F Miller, 9 Bartholomew Villas, London NW5 2LJ</p>

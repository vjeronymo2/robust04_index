			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: The cutting edge We should know a little more about UK economic policy after the chancellor's speech today to the Tory party conference. It is already disconcerting, though, to see how readily the knives are being sharpened to chop the Jubilee Line extension. US experience demonstrates that lower interest rates are not enough to induce recovery from a recession associated with deflated asset prices. Admittedly its economic merits are arguable, but this is an infrastructure project that would add to property values along its route and create employment in a region where confidence is at a particularly low ebb. The government may want to appear tough. The danger is that it will fall into the classic trap of cutting capital spending because that is easier than bearing down on current outlays. Indeed, the scope for savings on wage costs may turn out to be strictly limited, at least in the short term. This is partly because over a third of public sector workers are subject to review body decisions, and partly because of the knock-on effect of some large awards made around the election. The dilemma facing Mr Lamont is that his policy will scarcely have any credibility if next year's PSBR is larger than the Pounds 32bn pencilled in at the time of the Budget. It looks increasingly as though higher taxes will also be needed to meet that target. Here, too, the options are limited. Non-indexation of allowances and over-indexation of excise duties may yield some extra revenue. In theory, it might not be bad for growth if fiscal policy were more relaxed, but there is not just the question of the chancellor's pride. The deficit still has to be financed.</p>

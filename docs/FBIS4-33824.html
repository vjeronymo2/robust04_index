			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Army Commander General Augusto </F> Pinochet by EL MERCURIO correspondent Freddy Valverde in Prague,  Czech Republic; date not given]    [Text] [Valverde] Local historians find it rather odd that  you visited Austerlitz, where the Three Emperors' Battle was  fought. What made you go there?    [Pinochet] We have studied Napoleon, from a technical  viewpoint, during the battle in Austerlitz. But studying troop  movements on maps is not the same as studying them on land.  There are certain differences in the conclusions one reaches.  I must say I was very impressed, and I am going to study this  battle again now that I am acquainted with the battlefield, and  I am sure it will be of great use for me and for those who study  history.    [Valverde] How do you feel visiting a country that until  recently was behind the Iron Curtain? Did you ever dream of  visiting this sort of country?    [Pinochet] Look here, I am aware of what may happen. Last  year I received an invitation to visit Russia but I turned it  down because there are a lot of things in that country I do not  like, and I do not need to go see what is happening when I can  do so from outside.    In contrast, it has been very interesting visiting the Czech  Republic because life here was not as strongly communist is in  Lithuania, for example. This has not been the case here. But  there seem to have been other things here. I realize there was  strict police vigilance because whenever someone gets near me  they check to see if there is someone next to them. But I must  say that the progress here is quite significant.    In Germany -- in the former GDR, particularly in Dresden --  I  saw very little progress, but it is taking place. There are a  lot of destroyed buildings, a lot of houses in poor shape, in  other words, one is under the impression that nothing much has  changed there. In contrast, here you get the impression that  they are doing well.    [Valverde] Why have you come to the Czech Republic?    [Pinochet] In the first place, I want to say that my visit  is private. I have come in response to an invitation received  from one of the most important weapon and ammunition factories  in the Czech Republic. They invited me and I happily agreed to  come, without any demands.    I have not come to shop. I have come to see, study, and  learn the characteristics of what the Czechs have to offer, and  I believe it has been a very positive visit. People sometimes  complain that I do no receive protocol honors, that I am not...  In the first place, I am not a politician. In the second place,  I have not come to party. I have come to see, work, study,  learn. I am studying the modernization of my Army; I intend to  apply a lot of what I have seen here in Chile. This is the  main reason for my visit.    [Valverde] But several people comprise your entourage. Have  any of them purchased any Czech weapons or has any cooperation  agreement with the Czech military industry been signed?    [Pinochet] So far I have not received any document, anything  that refers to purchases. Obviously, when you visit a factory  you receive offers... we still have not done anything that may  end in a deal.    [Valverde] I believe you have visited several factories  during these past four days. What do you think about the Czech  military industry supposedly being in a retooling process?    [Pinochet] I believe it is a very serious industry. It has  excellent engineers. The material it uses is of very good  quality. I would say the Czech Republic has a sound military  industry. As you may well know, in this country there are  important defense industries that belonged to the dismantled  Warsaw Pact. Therefore, the technology developed here, I  believe, is very interesting and has great development prospects.    [Valverde] Your trip has stirred up polemics. There are  rumors that you had some problems, like the case of the hotel in  The Netherlands, as well as various comments and acts against  you. What can you say about that?    [Pinochet] It seems some people did not like me travelling  to this part of the world and have started a misinformation  campaign. But I would like to say that I have visited many  countries, many cities, and Prague is one of the most beautiful  cities in the world. I have been very happy here, free of any  problems, of any unpleasant gestures. Quite the opposite. The  people on the street have even asked me for my autograph.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Li Tieying, member of the State Council, </F> minister-chairman of the State Commission for Restructuring the  Economy, and member of the Communist Party Central Committee  Politburo, by Peter Kasalovsky and Jaroslav Brabec in Beijing on  20 May: "China Is Making Progress, But It Is Not Competing"]    [Text] During the recent research visit by HOSPODARSKE  NOVINY editors to the People's Republic of China, Chief Editor  Dr. Peter Kasalovsky was received by Li Tieying, a member of the  PRC State Council, minister-chairman of the State Commission for  Restructuring the Economy, and member of the PRC Communist Party  Central Committee Politburo. On this occasion, Li Tieying  granted our daily an interview on the issues affecting China's  economic development, its economic reforms, and cooperation with  Central and Eastern Europe.    [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] The 21st century is considered to be  the century of China. If the trends do not change, during its  first quarter, China should -- according to the forecasts --  achieve overall a gross domestic product of the level of the  United States. Do you think that this is a realistic forecast?    [Li] These observations, being made in the West, seem  exaggerated to us. In any case, China is not governed by any  competition. We simply want to advance the economic and social  level of the Chinese people, to eradicate the centuries-long  backwardness of the country, and to improve its standard of  living. Now, for example, we have set ourselves the task of  eliminating poverty from our country by the end of the century.  Some 80 million people -- mostly in the mountainous regions and  the areas severely affected by drought -- still live in poverty  in our country.    [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] That is a modest reply. Some powers  give the impression that they would like to slow down or at  least check China's economic boom by means of secondary issues  and internal instability. Do you not think that this stems from  their fear of Chinese competition in the economic and political  spheres?    [Li] China is a large country. It plays an important role  in the world. It is necessary to regard China's economic  progression and social progress as a major contribution to the  world's peaceful development. From the historical point of  view, China has always been a peace-loving country. An  economically strong China will also remain a guarantee of peace  in the world. It will never strive for hegemony. It will never  interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.  Naturally, it will oppose activities that interfere in Chinese  internal affairs. Owing to their long-term efforts from the  time of the opium wars in the middle of the last century, the  Chinese people finally rose up, founded a republic, and are  scoring successes. The common goal of the 1,200 million Chinese  is to develop multilaterally the Chinese nation and to work for  the country's prosperity in order to improve its standard of  living and culture. It is impossible to frustrate this goal.    [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] Internal stability is a condition for  reform policy and economic development. In recent years,  however, China has given the impression that it must struggle  again and again for economic balance and social stability. Do  you think that the reason for this is the headlong development,  or rather the tedious transition from a planned to a market  economy?    [Li] Our reform concerns the essence of the system, the  whole process of management. Therefore, we consider this reform  to be a second revolution. As far as its dimensions are  concerned, it reaches into the people's overall economic  activity and living conditions. We think that the reform steps  have to be implemented under the conditions of internal and  social stability. It is difficult to develop the economy in an  uneasy political atmosphere and it is impossible to reform its  management. It is obvious that one should not build a  skyscraper on tectonically very active ground. It is also not  possible to reform the management of the economic system in an  uneasy society. We are concentrating all our efforts on  economic construction. This is the center of our endeavor's  gravity. Now and for the future -- as long as nothing  fundamental that could divert us from this task occurs in the  world.    [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] Do you view the progress of the Chinese  economy, which can be expressed in automobile terminology as  "stop and go," as a consequence of making rapid progress or of  the slow course of reform? The supporters of shock reform  consider the main problems of the Chinese economy to be the  aftermath of slow reform changes.    [Li] The economy develops in cycles in all countries. A  cycle is a typical form of economic development in capitalist  countries. We also had an economic cycle in the past under rigid  planned management. I do not mean to infer that the economic  problems could not also be caused by our mistakes. Moreover, in  the transition from a planned to a market economy, many  phenomena that we are still not very familiar with are cropping  up. The issue of the cycle in the construction of a social  market economy is still the subject of research. A major boom  has occurred in our economy after 15 years of reform. Now we  have the fastest pace of development in China's history.    Japan, and later other Asian countries, experienced a  similar  boom and problems after World War II. In our country, reform  has been responsible for the rapid growth. The rapid progress  in recent years, however, has also contributed to overheating  the economy. Some factors -- such as energy and raw materials or  communications and the transportation infrastructure -- cannot  keep pace with this economic temperature.    [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] Economic progress, however, was also  responsible for the disparate development of the Chinese  regions, for the unequal partnership between the eastern  provinces and the central and western provinces of China. The  self-confidence of the rich regions has increased, and this has  provoked a limited willingness along the seaboard to return to  the rest of China the resources that it put into the special  economic zones and the whole of the east. This is the logic of  a market economy that reproduces wealth, but is reluctant to  give it up. Will administrative measures and the attractiveness  of the raw-material resources in the poorer provinces be enough  to resolve the problem, or will it be necessary to prepare for  more serious political and migration problems?    [Li] The disparate development between the west and east of  China is indeed a serious issue. It has come to the forefront  of the attention of China's leading bodies. For example, this  year we have introduced new reform measures in the spheres of  taxation and investment preferences for the poorer regions. We  want to extend wealth from the east to the west of our country.  More recently, the central government has consolidated 60  percent of all tax receipts. We are beginning to make more  significant investments in energy, the transportation network,  and the raw material base in Central and Western China where  great natural wealth is to be found. We are trying to increase  cooperation between the rich eastern and less developed western  provinces and we are supporting the tendency of domestic and  foreign companies to invest more in the west. We are striving  to ensure that this is advantageous for them.    [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] Practice indicates that this is a  complex process.    [Li] It will take a long time to adjust this difference,  perhaps whole decades, because the eastern provinces are also  not standing still.    [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] Moreover, the wealthy provinces are not  willing to give up their dominant economic position.    [Li] We can make use of the state enterprises that still  predominate in our industry for this task.    [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] They also have their problems. At the  moment, China suffers from relatively low unemployment; compared  with our small country with its 15-percent unemployment rate,  for example. In the process of transferring to a market  economy, how do you intend to resolve in China, with its huge  population potential, the problem of mass unemployment that a  market economy inevitably brings?    [Li] We already have this problem. We are combating it by  creating a labor market and a social security system. The new  economic system must have mechanisms for changes in the labor  force and coping with unemployment. In the cities, we are  developing, on a broad scale, individual and private sectors  that create new jobs. In the country, we are expanding in  particular the tertiary and secondary sectors -- the so-called  rural industry. Rural industry already has 25 million  enterprises. It catches the labor force let go in agriculture.  Some 110 million former farmers have already found work this  way. A further 6 million were added to this number last year.  Another 160-200 million farmers will find work before the end  of the century in the services and rural industry spheres.  Chinese experiences in this regard are important for all  developing states, because they reveal how to industrialize the  country and, at the same time, improve agriculture. Our task is  to develop rural industry and to establish thousands and  thousands of little towns and communities so that the laid-off  labor force from the countryside does not engulf the large  cities. In China we are now modernizing the villages and  industrializing agriculture.    [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] The political changes in Central and  Eastern Europe have greatly reduced the level of economic and  political relations between these countries and China. In your  view, what are the prospects for these relations in the near and  more distant future?    [Li] It should not be a problem to increase the level of  relations. Your pen may also help to build a new bridge. There  is traditional friendship between China and the former Soviet  Union and the Eastern European countries. At the start of our  republic's development, both the former Soviet Union and the  Eastern European countries -- including Czechoslovakia -- gave  us a great deal of assistance, including major investment  deliveries and training experts. In the late 1950's, I myself  graduated from the Charles University Faculty of Mathematics and  Physics in Prague. The Chinese people are grateful to you for  this support. They harbor profound emotional ties toward the  former socialist countries and will never forget their  help.    The Chinese people and the Chinese Government fully  respect the changes that have occurred in the former USSR and  Eastern Europe. The Slovak people have a right to choose their  own political system and way of life. As old friends, we are  monitoring the developments in Slovakia with great attention and  interest. We would be happy to see economic growth and  stability in your country and your people's prosperity. There  is a great deal of scope for cooperation. We can complement  each other economically. We have traditional ties of friendship  at our disposal. There are no historical disputes between us.  I think, therefore, that it is not only possible, but also  essential to boost cooperation between China and your part of  the world.    However, it is impossible to overlook the fact that major  changes have occurred in our economic system. These make closer  cooperation possible by the means normal throughout the world.  The recent visit by our premier, Li Peng, to four of the former  USSR's Central Asian countries is an example of this. In our  view, all countries, whether large or small, strong or weak,  have a right to participate in equal international cooperation.  They have a right to choose their own social system and way of  life. We are against intervening in the internal affairs of  other countries. All countries in the world must live in peace.  Economic relations must be based on equality and mutual  advantageousness. There are more than 180 states in the world  and approximately 3,000 peoples. The world is multifarious,  each country has its own specific history and culture and  specific geographic conditions, and they all have to respect  each other. It is impossible to force a single view or single  model on countries. Variety and diversity are manifestations of  human civilization.    China is a large country with a rapidly growing economy.  Even if we become economically strong, we will not intervene in  the internal affairs of other states. We will not strive for  world domination. We are at the end of one century and we will  soon enter into another. We must bring a peaceful, developing  world into the next century. All forward-looking politicians  must strive for this.</p>

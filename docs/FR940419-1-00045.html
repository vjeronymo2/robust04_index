			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(iii)(A) provides that each country of origin and each country of re-export be a member of CITES and not have entered into any reservations for any species within the Order Crocodylia.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraphs 17.42(c)(3)(iii) (B) and (C) require that no notices have been received by the Service indicating that the CITES Parties or the CITES Secretariat (based on action by the Convention's Standing Committee) has determined that the country of origin or any country of re-export does not have adequate domestic legislation to enforce the Convention, that it has failed to properly implement the Convention, or that a moratorium on trade with that country is recommended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(iii)(D) requires that the countries of origin and re-export submit their annual reports within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prescribed time period. This CITES requirement enables a cross check of trade records from both exporting and importing countries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(iii)(E) requires that they have named their Management Authority and Scientific Authority, a CITES requirement that designates the competent authorities to issue appropriate no-detriment findings and proper issuance of export or re-export permits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraphs 17.42(c)(3)(iii)(F)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )&hyph;(F)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) require each country of origin and country of re-export to certify to the Service's Office of Management Authority that it has the legal authority to inspect and seize or refuse entry for unlawful shipments of crocodilian skins and products imported into or exported from that country and that it actually inspects no less than 40 percent of the crocodilian shipments imported into the country for compliance with the CITES tagging and document requirements. Further, these countries must certify that they require that crocodilian skins cannot be imported or exported without intact, uncut tags from the country of origin. If a tag has become separated during processing or tanning, that skin may be utilized in that country's domestic market. The premise behind this provision is the recognition that the CITES tagging requirement will work only if it is strictly enforced by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> re-exporting countries. Therefore, every piece of crocodilian skin which is not manufactured into a finished product (and which exceeds 9 square inches in area) must bear an intact country of origin tag upon import and export. If the tags are intact through all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> re-exporting countries, then they should be intact at the point of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacture so that the manufacturer can maintain an accurate inventory control system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(iii)(F)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) requires that if the country exporting or re-exporting is a country of manufacture, it must certify that it requires a monitoring system that records tag numbers of skins received and relates the goods produced to the skins received. The proposed rule does not specify the exact parameters of a particular inventory control system. The Service encourages Party countries and the industry to explore established programs that have been in place for a number of years, as well as innovative technologies, such as bar code marking, or other approaches, to develop workable means to maintain accountability for products manufactured from tagged skins.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(iv) allows for the importation of crocodilian skins and parts directly from those countries where the Nile crocodile populations are on Appendix II of CITES or for saltwater crocodile populations in Australia or Papua New Guinea, provided the requirements of 50 CFR parts 13, 14, and 23, including those provisions implementing the CITES resolution on the universal tagging system, are complied with. A direct import does not require routing directly from the country of origin, as long as the specimen remains under customs control and merely transits through a third country. Airway bills or shipping documents should indicate that the consignee/purchaser is located in the United States, as shipments that enter the stream of commerce in a third country are not included under this provision of the special rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(v) stipulates that no 50 CFR part 17 permits will be required for products of Nile crocodile and saltwater crocodile from Australia and Papua New Guinea when imported into or exported from the United States as non-commercial accompanying personal baggage. However, trophies, skins, parts, and products acquired in those countries whose populations of saltwater or Nile crocodile populations are on CITES Appendix I, will require CITES import permits, issued by the Service's Office of Management Authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph 17.42(c)(4) stipulates that if a country of origin or re-export fulfills the criteria in paragraphs (c)(3)(iii)(A&hyph;F), the Service will publish a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  informing the public to this effect, and the Service will implement these criteria by requiring compliance with the Part 17 permit requirements for any skins or products that originated in or have been imported or exported through any country not included on the approved list. A list of those countries that have met all criteria will be available from the Service's Office of Management Authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> E. Effects of the Special Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The degree of endangerment of the many crocodilian species varies by species and specific populations. Some crocodilian species and populations are listed on Appendix I of CITES, and the remaining species and populations are included in Appendix II. Some species are listed as threatened or endangered on the U.S. List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife, while other species are not included. In addition, actions have been taken by several countries to protect their wild populations but allow trade in specimens bred or raised in captivity under appropriate management programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

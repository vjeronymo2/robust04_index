			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / General Motors - The Embattled Giant: Trio of offshoots take leading roles in their sectors GM'S VEHICLE operations overshadow its three huge non-automotive subsidiaries, yet each of the trio is one of the largest American businesses in its sector. Electronic Data Systems (EDS), based in Dallas, Texas, is one of the world's leading computer services companies and was acquired by GM in 1984 from its founder, Mr Ross Perot. Mr Perot joined the GM board with the aim of introducing entrepreneurial flair to the company but quit in 1986 after repeated disputes with the management. Even without him, EDS has gone from strength to strength. Some of its work involves systems integration - designing computer networks for corporate customers. But it also runs entire data processing departments for companies in return for a fee - so-called 'outsourcing' - and is benefitting from a strong corporate trend in this direction. EDS handles most of GM's computer operations, but its non-GM revenues are larger than those in-house and are forecast to reach 66 per cent of the total in 1993, compared with just 29 per cent in 1985. That shift has been helped by acquisitions, including the British group SD-Scicon. It made net profits of Dollars 547m last year on revenues of Dollars 7.1bn and this week reported income of Dollars 457m for the first nine months of 1992, up from Dollars 407m. GM Hughes Electronics has had a more chequered performance since Hughes Aircraft was bought in an auction by GM for Dollars 5.2bn six years ago. GM then merged Hughes with its Delco Electronics business, a leader in automotive electronics. The idea was for GM to diversify its revenues while taking advantage of Hughes' expertise in systems integration, optics and other high technology areas. Rivals Chrysler and Ford both joined the trend but rapidly sold off their aerospace operations when recession loomed. Many analysts believe GM should have done the same, or never bought Hughes in the first place. First, technical transfer between the two businesses has not been particularly exciting. Examples include 'head up' instrument displays in some new car models and involvement by Hughes in the development of battery-powered cars. For another, Hughes has suffered from the sharp decline in the US defence budget and its earnings have moved erratically. Earlier this year GM had to take a Dollars 749m after-tax write-off to cover a restructuring of the subsidiary, including the elimination of 9,000 jobs. Last year it made Dollars 435m, down from Dollars 577m in 1990. General Motors Acceptance Corporation was founded in the early days of GM to finance car purchases and has grown into the largest non-bank finance company in the US, with assets of around Dollars 100bn, offering financial and insurance services to car dealers and buyers, as well as mortgage banking, marine financing and investment services. It reported net income last year of Dollars 1.37bn and made Dollars 942m in the first nine months of this year, up from Dollars 936m. It borrows heavily in the short-term commercial paper market and would suffer seriously from a down-grading of GM's credit rating.</p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Portillo seeks to calm rightwing fears on tax THE GOVERNMENT yesterday sought to head off a rightwing rebellion over taxation by promising big cuts in public spending to offset rising social security costs. However, Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the treasury, refused to bow to pressure from the Thatcherite Conservative Way Forward Group and rule out tax increases in the November Budget. Way Forward, which is supported by several cabinet ministers, warned on Thursday that tax increases 'will not be accepted unless a sharp pruning knife is taken to public spending first'. The warning coincided with a vitriolic attack on Mr John Major's 'disunited' government by Lord Parkinson, chairman of Way Forward, and a former Conservative party chairman. Mr John Townend, chairman of the Conservative backbench finance committee, put further pressure on the government yesterday by warning that tax increases could cost the party the next general election. 'If we do not tackle public expenditure, and we go into the next election as the party that has increased taxation, we don't stand a hope in hell of winning,' he said. Mr Portillo played down the Way Forward comments, which he described as 'lobbying in very colourful language to make sure the government maintains its toughness'. He urged the right not to underestimate the difficulty the government would face in sticking to its commitment to hold public spending steady in real terms. The government would have to take 'difficult' action to constrain the rising social security budget and identify other spending cuts. He added that cuts might be bigger than expected if the pace of economic recovery faltered in the next few months. He conceded that 'we may have to have some tax increases', adding to speculation that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is preparing to widen the VAT net.</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Vietnam's PM to meet businessmen THE Japanese government is planning to show the wonders of modern capitalism to Mr Vo Van Kiet, the Vietnamese prime minister, who arrives in Japan today on a visit that will reflect his country's emergence from diplomatic isolation. Japanese officials see the five-day visit as an opportunity to introduce the Vietnamese leader to leading business executives and to reinforce the idea that Tokyo will have a growing political role in south-east Asia. The visit, the first by a Vietnamese prime minister since Tokyo and Hanoi established diplomatic relations 20 years ago, comes as Japanese companies are rapidly expanding their investments in Vietnam. By the end of November, 28 direct investments worth Dollars 305m (Pounds 215m) had been made. Mr Vo Van Kiet is regarded by Japanese officials as an important force behind Vietnam's economic reform programme, and Tokyo will indicate to him that aid will continue to flow into the country, as long as reform stays on track. Last November, Japan provided a Y45.5bn (Pounds 266m) commodity credit, ending a 14-year ban on aid to Hanoi that had been maintained in sympathy with US concerns about servicemen missing in action during the Vietnam war. However, Japanese officials are planning to raise concerns about the continuing Vietnamese influence on the Cambodian army, which they see as a potential obstacle to peace there.</p>

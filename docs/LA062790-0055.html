			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PORT BACKS USE OF B STREET PIER DURING AMERICA'S CUP  </P> <P> Although no public money has yet been allocated, the America's Cup Organizing  Committee won another round with the San Diego Unified Port District Tuesday,  when its proposal to use the B Street Pier during the international sailing  regatta was approved in concept.  </P> <P> Thomas F. Ehman Jr., executive vice president of the Cup committee, said he was  pleased with the board's decision. Still, despite numerous appearances before  port commissioners in recent weeks, Cup officials have yet to be given a penny  of the $10 million in public money they've requested.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Ehman said, "Everything is right on track. We feel good about  things and don't anticipate any delays. Mr. (Don) Nay (director of the Port  District) and everyone working with us have been really helpful."  </P> <P> Ehman said the committee hopes to use the B Street Pier for administrative  offices and as a Cup museum, as well as a media center designed to accommodate  4,000 journalists from around the world.  </P> <P> Cup participants begin arriving in San Diego later this year, with the finals  of the race scheduled in the waters off Point Loma in May, 1992.  </P> <P> Commissioner Lynn Schenk voted with the other members in a 7-0 gesture to  approve Ehman's request -- in principle -- but she, in particular, asked for  more "bottom-line" figures on why port money is needed and what the Cup  committee will use it for.  </P> <P> "I haven't seen a total, detailed plan yet on what the port is in for in  supporting the America's Cup," Schenk said. "I support the America's Cup in  concept, but to do this in a piecemeal way, bit by bit, as we've been doing,  causes me concern."  </P> <P> San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor took several shots at the America's Cup  committee in her appearance before the port to lobby for reimbursement for city  services on port property.  </P> <P> That part of the meeting was far more contentious than the portion devoted to  the Cup, with Commissioner Dan Larsen grilling O'Connor and other city  officials item by item on why they need money from the port.  </P> <P> Near the end of her appearance, O'Connor pointed her finger at the  commissioners and said, "When you ask the attorney general to review our  proposal, just make sure he reviews the money you plan to give the America's  Cup and that it meets the same test."  </P> <P> In the hallway, after she left, O'Connor said, "I can guarantee you the  America's Cup committee will not go through what we went through in there  today."  </P> <P> "We're not worried about Mayor O'Connor," Ehman said. "She's told us privately  she supports us. We believe she understands how much San Diego will benefit  from the America's Cup. And the benefit will be considerable."  </P></p>

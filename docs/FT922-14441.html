			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Hopes rise for accord on Argentine debt HOPES were high yesterday that the Argentine government could reach imminent agreement with leading commercial bank creditors on a plan aimed at reducing and restructuring the country's foreign bank debt. However, yesterday morning differences remained between the two sides that could yet delay a deal. There were hopes among Argentine officials and the banks, led by Citicorp of the US, that an agreement in principle could be announced with fanfare at the annual meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank in Santo Domingo which formally ends tomorrow. The Argentine delegation is led by Mr Domingo Cavallo, finance minister. A number of European banks and one Canadian bank remained unhappy yesterday about certain aspects of the accord which other leading banks believed acceptable. One central difference between the two sides was how much of the Dollars 8bn of interest arrears the government should pay immediately. Some banks are holding out for Dollars 900m in cash, while the Argentines have said they will pay immediately only Dollars 400m in cash and the rest in Argentine bonds backed by US Treasury paper, to the value of Dollars 400m. Some banks are questioning why this cannot all be paid in cash. The sum not paid straightaway will be paid in Argentine bonds. Other differences include the interest rate on the so-called par bonds which pay pre-determined interest rates. While no specific agreement has been on the rate of discount on the floating-rate bonds to be offered banks in exchange for their loans, the accord seems likely to settle on a 35 per cent level. Apart from the Dollars 8bn of arrears, about Dollars 24bn of medium-term bank debt will be covered by the agreement. The deal, under the debt relief plan named after Mr Nicholas Brady, US Treasury Secretary, is being supported by loans to Argentina from the IMF and other institutions. This finance provides guarantees for the concessional bonds which Argentina will issue to banks in exchange for their debt. Hopes that Brazil would also secure an agreement in principle with banks at Santo Domingo were abandoned last week when a temporary suspension of talks was announced. Brazilian officials had apparently considered such a deadline would unduly pressurise them. Inflation in Argentina rose by 2.1 per cent in March, the government has reported, writes John Barham in Buenos Aires. Although lower than expected, inflation remains stubbornly resistant to the country's rigidly orthodox monetary and fiscal policies. Last month's increase was a fraction lower than February's 2.2 per cent rise, and far less than the 11 per cent increase in March 1991. However, prices have risen by 30.2 per cent over the past 12 months despite a fixed exchange rate.</p>

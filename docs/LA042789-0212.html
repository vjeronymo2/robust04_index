			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> FORD REPORTS $1.64 BILLION EARNINGS  </P> <P> Ford Motor Co. today said its first-quarter earnings rose nearly 1% to $1.64  billion, the second-most profitable three-month period in automotive history.  </P> <P> Ford, the nation's second-largest auto maker after General Motors, said its  first-quarter results translated to $3.44 per share, and compared with earnings  of $1.62 billion, or $3.31 per share, in the first three months of 1988.  </P> <P> Revenue totaled $25.87 billion, up 11.5% from $23.2 billion during the first  three months of 1988.  </P> <P> Ford said its first-quarter profit was buoyed by increased profits overseas, a  continuing source of money for the auto maker. The company said its U.S.  profits fell 5.6% to $800 million during the quarter, principally because of  sluggish sales and costs of incentives.  </P> <P> GM last week reported first-quarter earnings of $1.55 billion. Chrysler Corp.  is expected to release first-quarter results next week.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> HOME USED FOR NEGLECTED CHILDREN PROPOSED AS HISTORIC MONUMENT  </P> <P> The Los Angeles city Cultural Heritage Commission recommended Wednesday that an  83-year-old Craftsman-style home in Highland Park be declared a  historic-cultural monument, alleviating concern over its future.  </P> <P> The concern arose when a program for abused children that operated out of the  home closed last year after 40 years.  </P> <P> The home, built with river-bed boulders, was designed by Los Angeles architect  Robert Edmund Williams. It includes a stained-glass window by the Judson  Studios of Highland Park.  </P> <P> Since 1948, the estate had been operated by the Hathaway Home for Children, a  program for abused and neglected children run by Hathaway Children's Services,  a private, nonprofit child welfare agency that also owns the property. In  September, the agency closed the home and transferred the remaining youths,  ages 6 to 13, to its headquarters in Little Tujunga Canyon.  </P> <P> The commission recommended that only the house be designated a  historic-cultural monument, excluding 2 acres of grounds and dorms.  </P> <P> Brian Cahill, Hathaway Children's Services president, said the agency intends  to keep the home for use as a community service center. He said the agency's  board is considering selling the balance of the 2.8-acre site for development  of single-family homes.  </P> <P> The commission's recommendation requires approval of the City Council. If the  council grants the historic-cultural status, any proposed changes to the site  would require approval by the commission.  </P></p>

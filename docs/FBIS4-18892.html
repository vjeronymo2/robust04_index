			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Franco Venturini commentary: "The Strength of the Weak"] </F>   [Text] The bombs dropped by U.S. NATO aircraft against the  Serbs laying siege to Gorazde broke the magic spell. For some  weeks now, Bosnia was no longer making the headlines, Sarajevo  no longer featured in TV news programs, and, following so many  horrors broadcast live, the media's silence authorized us to  believe that the peacemaking process was by now under way in the  former Yugoslavia.    True, for the past two months the snipers in the hills have  no longer used Sarajevo's women and children for target  practice. The threat of intervention was enough to force the  Serbs to move back their outposts. Restoring the NATO deterrent  was enough to enable Russian diplomacy to do its share, thus  giving rise to a genuine hope of peace.    We must volley the ball, Western governments and the United  Nations immediately told themselves, we must everywhere apply  the formula which worked so well in Sarajevo, we must preempt  the unavoidable resumption of hostilities.    What happened, instead? What happened was that, while the  Americans' and Russians' bipolar diplomacy got bogged down in  the complicated setting up of federations and confederations --  without thereby effectively involving the Serbs, and without  solving the key problem of the territory's division -- the  United Nations did not succeed in mustering, worldwide, the  10,000 blue helmets requested by general Rose (though, in fact,  many more were actually needed) to pull apart the opposing  forces immediately and ensure the surveillance of the worst  hotspots.    Italy was never asked to contribute to this effort, and this  was a lucky break, considering the political climate in which  such a difficult decision would have had to be made. However, a  much weightier factor than our absence, or than others'  half-heartedness, was the confirmation of the United States'  unwillingness to commit land forces in Bosnia unless agreements  had already been subscribed to and guaranteed by the parties  involved. Which is tantamount to saying never.    Washington's unspoken message (which was rendered  unavoidable  by the opinion polls, and by President Clinton's volatile  relationship with Congress) must have played a part in  relighting the fuse and unwittingly convincing the Serbs, and  perhaps also the Muslims, that the use of arms was still a  viable option -- that they could start again, perhaps setting  out from the Gorazde enclave.    This is a major provocation, given that a year ago Gorazde  was specifically declared a "safety area" by the UN Security  Council. Therefore, the massacre which has been going on now for  days, and the imminent fall of the town overcrowded with  refugees, have convinced Butrus-Ghali, and then NATO, to launch  the first limited allied attack against Serbian land positions  since the four Serbian pirate aircraft were shot down.    This irreproachable decision, which might have been rendered  unnecessary if, over the past few weeks, the West had resolutely  jumped the peace train, is now again giving rise to all sorts of  questions: Will the anti-Serb deterrent work this time too?  How will the Russians react? Will it be possible to resume  negotiations?    Above all: Is there a real chance of peace unless America  makes use of her armed credibility also in the field? A sad  question, this latter one, for Europeans.</p>

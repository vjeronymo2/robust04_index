Hooks, executive director of the NAACP, a prime target of the  hate campaign, emerged from the Oval Office saying he was "fairly satisfied"  with federal efforts to solve the bombings, but was seeking further assurance  "that from the presidency down there is a sense of urgency."  </P> <P> Bush invited civil rights leaders and students to the White House to witness  his signing of a proclamation in connection with Monday's holiday marking  King's birthday.  </P></p>

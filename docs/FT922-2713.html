			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Executive loses appeal over ban A FORMER company chair-man who was jailed last year for insider dealing has failed to overturn an order disqualifying him from acting as a company director for 10 years. Mr Ivor Goodman, former chairman of Unigroup, the quoted Leeds-based timber and clothing company, is the only person prosecuted for insider dealing in the UK who has served a jail term for the offence. In April last year he pleaded guilty at St Albans Crown Court to an offence under the Company Securities (Insider Dealing) Act. He was sentenced to 18 months, of which nine months were suspended. As he had been in custody for five months, having been arrested for failing to appear for trial the previous year, he had only four months left to serve. In the event, because of remission, he was released a few days after being sentenced. Yesterday he challenged the disqualification order imposed on him under the Company Directors (Disqualification) Act as part of his sentence. Dismissing his appeal, Lord Justice Staughton said in the Court of Appeal that Mr Goodman's offence was 'a monstrous and scandalous example of insider trading'. Mr Goodman, the chairman of a public company had obtained, or attempted to obtain, a very large sum. 'It is hard to think of a worse case,' the judge said. At the trial the Department of Trade and Industry alleged that Mr Goodman disposed of his 690,209 Unigroup shares - a substantial proportion of the equity - just before the company announced worse-than-expected figures in October 1987. He purported to give the holding to his girlfriend and it was sold for 167p per share, netting Mr Goodman just under Pounds 1.2m. The sale, and Mr Goodman's resignation as Unigroup's chairman, occurred a few days before the Stock Exchange suspended the company's shares at its own request. When dealings were resumed five months later the shares traded at 55p. Chase Manhattan Securities, Unigroup's broker, confirmed in November 1987 that it had acquired the shares. Civil proceedings later resulted in the share sale being set aside.</p>

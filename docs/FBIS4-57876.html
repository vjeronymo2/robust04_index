			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News"] </F>   [Text] President Rafael Caldera has indicated that in  Venezuela, there is a high demand for foreign exchange by  speculators and that his government has been questioned for  political rather than economic reasons. Caldera stated that an  abnormal situation prevails in the country but added that his  government will win the confidence battle.    Caldera emphasized the fact that there are currently two  crises. One is the institutional crisis resulting from the  trials of former Presidents Jaime Lusinchi and Carlos Andres  Perez and the transitional government led by Jose Ramon  Velasquez, which gave public employees a salary increase without  enough available funds. The other is the economic crisis  resulting from the intervention involving Banco Latino.</p>

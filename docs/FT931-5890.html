			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / China State Statistical Bureau registers losses for industrial sector CHINA'S state-dominated industrial sector last year registered losses of about Dollars 76bn (Pounds 53bn), much the same as the year before, according to the State Statistical Bureau, Tony Walker reports from Beijing. The military, tobacco, coal-mining and petroleum sectors accounted for the biggest losses. These sectors tend to be most heavily burdened by rigid pricing policies and by overmanning. Faltering state-owned enterprises accounted for 80 per cent of losses in industry, with the light manufacturing sector hardest hit, the statistical bureau reported. Heavy industry fared slightly better, because of heightened demand for products such as steel due to a construction boom. China's economy grew more than 12 per cent last year. Losses in the military sector were attributed to shrinking demand. Heavy investment in industry over the past few years appears to have yielded only limited improvements in efficiency. China's shrinking state sector accounted for about 50 per cent of industrial output last year. In 1978, at the outset of the 'open door' reforms, it produced 78 per cent of total industrial output.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Maastricht and beyond: Denmark's prime minister outlines his goals A green post-expressionist painting of a peasant woman peeling apples hangs over the desk in Copenhagen of Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Denmark's new prime minister. The companiable Mr Rasmussen, who inherited the picture from Mr Poul Schluter, his Conservative predecessor, admits he has no idea who painted it. Since moving in 10 weeks ago at the helm of a Social Democrat-led coalition, Mr Rasmussen, 49, has had little time to worry about the artistic lay-out of his office. Taking over as head of the EC Council during Denmark's six-month Community presidency, Mr Rasmussen has been pursuing two high-priority policies over the Maastricht treaty. They are interlocked, yet, in a sense, opposing. Mr Rasmussen needs Maastricht - while at the same time knowing it is becoming increasingly unnecessary. Mr Rasmussen owes his job to Mr Schluter's resignation over a scandal involving the treatment of Tamil immigrants from Sri Lanka. Perhaps the new prime minister will become Europe's first leader to face up squarely to the post-Maastricht world. For he gives the strong impression of a man who wants to ratify the treaty, and then discreetly put it aside. Mr Rasmussen's first priority is to steer through approval of Maastricht in the new Danish referendum on May 18. He describes it as 'Denmark's most important foreign policy decision since world war two'. A renewed No would create 'a very bad situation' for Denmark, above all by putting fresh speculative pressure on the krone. He stops short, however, of saying it would automatically force Denmark's departure from the EC. His second priority concerns the condition of the EC economy. Assuming (as he does) the treaty will surmount its ratification hurdles, Mr Rasmussen wants the Community to move on rapidly to finding a way out of recession and crisis. Fretting about Denmark's 12 per cent unemployment rate - and the 17m people out of work throughout the EC - Mr Rasmussen says: 'Stagnation in Europe is a disaster for ordinary people.' The events of the past year - including the initial Danish No last June - have shown, Mr Rasmussen says, that 'European leaders have been too heavily concentrating on building European towers, before being sure that the European foundations are well established'. Realising the psychological importance - not least, for the currency markets  -of a Yes vote next month, Mr Rasmussen denies that Maastricht has become irrelevant. However, the Danes last December secured exemptions in areas such as economic and monetary union (Emu), defence and EC citizenship, which, for Denmark at least, denude the treaty of its principal significance. These opt-outs, Mr Rasmussen forecasts, will win over enough Danish Euro-sceptics to deliver 'a clear Yes' in the referendum. Yet he says it is not Denmark, but other EC countries, which have been 'opting out of reality' by trying to push forward European integration too fast. In view of the EC recession, and the prolonged structural crisis in eastern Europe, Mr Rasmussen believes some basic premises behind the quest for deeper integration have lost their validity. 'Political leaders can find themselves in a situation where the basis on which they took decisions becomes outdated. They have no choice but to put into effect what they decided - and then take new decisions.' Asked whether he fears that the rest of the Community will forge ahead to Emu without Denmark, Mr Rasmussen, uncharacteristically, pauses, then replies: 'Experience has shown that economic and political developments are always taking directions which are not foreseen. You could say it is of interest to discuss where Europe will be in six years' time - from an intellectual, from a political or journalistic point of view. But what we need is not to discuss developments for the year 2000. I'm in favour of concrete decisions concerning those 17m (unemployed) people in 1993-94.' Once uncertainty over Maastricht's ratification is resolved - assuming no further setbacks in the UK - Mr Rasmussen wants the EC's Copenhagen summit in June to decide selective economic expansion. This would include further spending on infrastructure programmes, extending the extra funding by the European Investment Bank decided at the December summit in Edinburgh. He also supports more help for eastern Europe, and wants to establish an EC fund to provide western companies with guarantees against losses from investments there. Because EC companies are operating well below capacity, Mr Rasmussen believes higher economic growth need not be inflationary. Mr Rasmussen's vision of Europe's economic future clearly involves activism, though of a cerebral kind. 'We shall compete on the most advanced level of science, education and competence, service, quality and delivery. He bristles at mention of the Maastricht fiscal targets, laid down to guide the path towards Emu. Do these not preclude any generalised budgetary effort to stimulate growth? Mr Rasmussen replies that the recession is pushing up budget deficits well beyond the benchmark set in the Maastricht treaty of 3 per cent of gross domestic product. This means that EC governments must accept short-run divergences from the Emu track. 'Stagnation can never be the answer to the wish for convergence. Stagnation is the way to greater disparities.' After several years of orthodox fiscal and monetary policies and low growth, Denmark has greatly improved its budgetary position, and is running a substantial current account surplus. Yet its own ability to stimulate the economy is constrained. Although it rules out taking part in Emu, it is one of the few EC countries close to fulfilling the Emu targets. Yet opting out of Emu has put the krone under sporadic pressure, reflecting currency markets' belief that Denmark's political attachment to European parities is weaker than that of, say, France. Mindful of these doubts, Mr Rasmussen pledges to maintain the krone's exchange rate. A British-style bid to seek growth by devaluation would be 'the most negative answer you can ever dream of'. Yet the cost of keeping the krone stable is reflected in short-term interest rates about five percentage points above German levels. One weighty reason why Mr Rasmussen is looking forward to a Yes on May 18 is because he thinks that Denmark, shortly afterwards, will be able to reduce interest rates towards German levels. Mr Rasmussen is convinced that his policies will bring dividends - for Denmark and for Europe. 'I am an optimistic nature, I'm a happy boy - I always have been. The prime minister here is in good shape and wants to take decisions.' In today's Europe, a Danish prime minister has only limited freedom of manoeuvre. But Mr Rasmussen is determined to exploit it to the full.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DENMARK: POPULAR APPROVAL FOR MAASTRICHT  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Don't                                Don't 1992           Yes     No   know     1993           Yes     No   know  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 23 February     39     34     27      7 February     54     25     21  4 April        32     36     27      7 March        50     25     20 11 April        36     35     25     21 March        47     25     24  2 JUNE REFERENDUM                 49.3   50.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Gallup Denmark  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Italy to sell off financial services group ISTITUTO Mobiliare Italiano, the big long-term lending and financial services group controlled by the Italian treasury, is to be floated following the collapse of sale talks to a group of public-sector savings banks. The government will sell the treasury's 50 per cent stake in IMI, and a further 9.3 per cent owned by the Ina state insurance agency. Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury minister, said he hoped a first 20 per cent tranche of IMI's shares could be floated by the year-end. The 20 per cent stake could be worth about L1,600bn (Pounds 700m), based on the valuation of between L7,600bn and L8,000bn for IMI made by SG Warburg, the UK merchant bank. Warburg and IMI itself have now been given the mandate by the treasury to prepare the way for flotation. IMI is one of Italy's biggest financial institutions, specialising in long-term corporate lending. It also has a big securities trading capability, and has in recent years branched out into insurance and retail banking. The failure of the sale talks means the government now has three big banks on its disposal list. Last year, it announced plans to privatise Credito Italiano, Italy's sixth-biggest bank, while Banca Commerciale Italiana, another prestigious financial institution also based in Milan, is due to be sold. The change in strategy over IMI came after the breakdown of talks with a group of savings banks, led by Milan's Cariplo, over the issue of price. In a terse statement, the government said the banks' offer was 'inadequate both as far as the price and the means of payment is concerned'. While some analysts greeted the decision to float IMI as a boost for 'transparency,' it represents a severe setback to both the treasury and Cariplo. The government had been hoping to raise about L3,800bn from the transaction. IMI, which had group net profits of L443bn and a loan book of about L51,000bn in 1992, is one of the most attractive assets on the government's privatisation list. Purchasing IMI would have given Cariplo, always the leading force among potential purchasers, a boost. Although it is strong in retail banking and deposit-taking, Cariplo's presence in investment banking and securities trading is weaker, especially abroad.</p>

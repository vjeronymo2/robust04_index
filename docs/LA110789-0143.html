			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> MYSTERY OVER HORSE AILMENT GROWS; FOOD SUPPLY EXAMINED  </P> <P> There are more reports surfacing today of a baffling illness that has killed at  least 11 horses and badly shaken horse owners and trainers throughout Southern  California.  </P> <P> Seven horses in Orange County have died and several others have shown symptoms  of the twitching muscles, rapid breathing and difficulty chewing or swallowing  that characterize the disease. (Story, A1.)  </P> <P> The mysterious ailment has been reported in several cities in Los Angeles,  Ventura and San Bernardino counties since surfacing at the Orange County  Fairgrounds Equestrian Center 10 days ago.  </P> <P> "We are beginning to get all kinds of reports from other cities going as far  back as September," Orange County Fairgrounds spokeswoman Jill Lloyd said  today.  </P> <P> State officials and a team of veterinarians investigating the malady have not  determined a cause but are looking at the food supply, which apparently is the  only common link among the stricken equines, Lloyd said.  </P> <P> Officials have scheduled a news conference this afternoon at the Orange County  Fairgrounds to provide details on the investigation.  </P></p>

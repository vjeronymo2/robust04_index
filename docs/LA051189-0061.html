			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> ALDRETE SAID TO CONFESS ROLE IN RITUAL SLAYINGS  </P> <P> Alleged satanic cult "witch" Sara Aldrete Villarreal has confessed to  involvement in some of the ritual slaying of 15 people near the U.S. border and  also exhibits signs of having a split personality, U.S. law enforcement  officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> In private, Aldrete loses that "charming aspect" she exhibits when she faces  television cameras and seems to revert to another self, talking in detail about  the cult's rituals, officials said.  </P> <P> "I would say she has three personalities," a source at the Mexico City attorney  general's office, who insisted on anonymity, said in an interview. One  personality comes out when she faces the cameras and denies any involvement in  the human slayings, another emerges when she talks to police and "the third one  comes out when she talks to herself," the source said.  </P> <P> The Houston Chronicle quoted U.S. Customs agent Oran Neck as saying that  Aldrete has "confessed to conspiracy and involvement" in the killings.  </P> <P> Neck, who spent several days in Mexico City assisting investigators, told the  paper that "Sara has kind of lost touch with reality. . . . Her dual  personality is coming up pretty strong right now. When you talk to her without  the TV cameras there, she's pretty truthful.  </P> <P> "She's giving a lot of data with great detail to investigators. . . . It seems  like when the cameras come on, she kind of reverts back to this nice, young,  clean-cut kid from Texas Southmost College," Neck said.  </P> <P> "When the cameras were there, she was real nice. When she was with us, she was  the same ol' witch," Lt. George Gavito, a U.S. investigator who accompanied  Neck to Mexico City, said.  </P> <P> Aldrete, 24, and five other cult members were arrested in a Mexico City  apartment hide-out Saturday afternoon after a shoot-out with police.  </P></p>

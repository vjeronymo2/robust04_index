"Russia has had the elections and we congratulate it with  their successful completion," said the president. "As to  Chechnya, it held the elections in 1991 (the presidential  elections after which the republic proclaimed its independence  -- `IF')."    "The Chechen people have made their choice," said Dudayev.  He said that another presidential election in Chechnya would  take place in 1995, while the parliamentary elections were  planned for 1996.    "If there is a need for early elections to some power  structures of the republic, this will be announced by leaders of  the independent Chechen Republic," said the president.</p>

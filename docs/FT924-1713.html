			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM 'would not block UN effort' THE prime minister expressed reservations yesterday about the enforcement of the no-fly zone over Bosnia, although he indicated that Britain would not block such a move by other countries at the UN. Mr Major, who earlier reviewed Britain's stance on Bosnia at a meeting with cabinet colleagues, said enforcing a no-fly zone might hamper humanitarian efforts and threaten UK troops. He added: 'We have never ruled out a possible need to enforce the zone.' In the Commons, Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said that while appreciating concern about the possible effect on humanitarian aid and the safety of UK troops, there was a growing feeling in this country and the international community that 'there is little point in having a no-fly zone, which can be defied with such impunity'. The prime minister stressed that 'other measures' were under consideration. Downing Street said these included stronger sanctions and 'international expressions of disgust' at Serbia's actions. Breaking telecommunications and diplomatic links with Belgrade is one possibility. Officials have also been examining the possibility of suggesting an end of the blanket UN embargo on arms shipments to the region. In spite of pressure from some Tory MPs and the Labour leadership, the government wants a full discussion with allies before escalating action in Bosnia. Several cabinet ministers are arguing strongly against commiting more British troops in the region. However, at a private meeting with Tory backbenchers, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, hinted that Britain might be prepared to send troops under UN auspices to Macedonia or Kosovo.</p>

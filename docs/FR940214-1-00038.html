			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> State agency surveyors have difficulty measuring facility compliance with the standard due to its lack of specificity. Surveyors favor a standard that includes specific biological and chemical water purity levels and user monitoring guidelines that can be applied consistently during each survey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Water quality is one of the most important aspects of health and safety in dialysis. Contaminants in water used to make the dialysis solution (dialysate) may cause adverse reactions when they enter the patient's bloodstream. Some chemical contaminants are not normally harmful when present in usual physiological fluids but can become dangerous if their concentrations are increased by contaminants in the water used to make dialysate. If water supplies are biologically or chemically contaminated, such contaminates may be passed into the patient during the dialysis session, leading to infection or other adverse consequences. Limits on bacterial growth in dialysate are necessary to prevent high bacterial counts associated with pyrogenic reaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consultation with the Public Health Service and a variety of professionals in the dialysis industry, we have concluded that establishing specific, measurable standards regarding the quality of water used in dialysis would better ensure the health and safety of Medicare beneficiaries. We propose to incorporate by reference the water quality standard approved by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) and published in ``Hemodialysis Systems'' (2nd edition). According to the Public Health Service's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the AAMI standard on water quality is the only standard available, is accepted by the medical community, and is already utilized by most facilities. We assume that using this water quality standard will reduce patient risk. However, we specifically solicit public comments on the validity of this assumption. We are also seeking comments on the assumption that the majority of facilities are already using this standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. AAMI Standard on Hemodialysis Systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 1992 AAMI standard, ``Hemodialysis Systems,'' reflects the collective expertise of a committee of health care professionals, in conjunction with device manufacturers and government representatives, to develop a standard of performance for manufacturers that will, at a minimum, ensure the effective, safe performance of hemodialysis systems, devices, and related materials. Included in the standard are specific water quality requirements, including maximum levels of bacteriological and chemical contamination. Additionally, a guideline for the device user, with specific emphasis on water purity assurance and monitoring, is appended to the standard. The standard is outcome-oriented in that it stipulates only specific biological and chemical water purity levels and does not restrict the methods used by facilities to attain and maintain the acceptable levels. We are interested in comments on whether the outcome measures are appropriate and whether our assumption that most facilities can meet these requirements is reasonable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each AAMI standard or recommended practice is reviewed at least every 5 years. These reviews are required because of the constant changes in medical technology and to clarify or improve existing guidelines. The AAMI Renal Disease and Detoxification Committee initiated a thorough review of the standard ``Hemodialysis Systems'' in 1986, recognizing that the technology of hemodialysis had changed in a number of respects since the standard was originally published in 1982. Task groups were established in those areas that the committee felt needed most careful review. As a result of the work of these task groups and of review by the full committee, a proposed revision of the standard was prepared. (The allowable levels of chemical contaminants in dialysis water were not changed.) Following committee balloting and public review, the second edition of ``Hemodialysis Systems'' was approved March 16, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because AAMI guidelines represent medically acceptable standards and techniques developed in collaboration with health professionals and industry representatives, we believe manufacturers and users already have access to, and are familiar with, the standard. However, ``Hemodialysis Systems'' (2nd Edition) (ANSI/AAMI RD5) may be purchased from AAMI, 3300 Washington Boulevard, suite 400, Arlington, Virginia 22201&hyph;4598. Upon final approval of the incorporation by reference, the publication will be available for inspection at the HCFA Information Resource Center, 6325 Security Boulevard, Room G&hyph;10&hyph;A East High Rise Building, Baltimore, MD or the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We propose to adopt the water quality requirements contained in sections 3.2.1_Water Bacteriology and 3.2.2_Maximum Level of Chemical Contamination, as well as the guidelines for monitoring water purity contained in sections B1 through B5 of Appendix B of AAMI's standard ``Hemodialysis Systems''. The requirements of these sections are summarized below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3.2.1&blank;Water Bacteriology <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;The water used to prepare dialysate should not have a total viable microbial count exceeding 200/ml. The manufacturer or supplier recommends a method of cleaning the equipment to meet this requirement. The user monitors the water bacteriology of the system following installation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

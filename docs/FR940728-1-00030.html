			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Following discussions with EPA on this issue, Maricopa County has agreed to revise the rule to delete section 221.9. However, the County must go through another public notice and comment period before the County Board of Supervisors will approve this change. The County intends to expedite its administrative procedures so that the rule can be revised and resubmitted to EPA prior to final action on this SIP revision. See letter, with attached draft rule revision and notice of public hearing, dated June 23, 1994 from Karen J. Heidel, Maricopa County Environmental Services Department to Dave Calkins, EPA. In today's action, EPA is proposing to approve Maricopa County Rule 310 on the assumption that it will be resubmitted with the noted change prior to final action on this rulemaking. In the alternative, if the County does not revise and resubmit the rule prior to EPA's final action, EPA proposes to approve all provisions of Maricopa County Rule 310 with the exception of section 221.9.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Compliance for certain measures, such as Rules 310, 311, 314, and 316 must be determined in accordance with appropriate test methods. The SIP revision provides that compliance with Rule 310 be determined in accordance with EPA reference method9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Rule 314 requires persons to obtain a permit from the Control Officer in order to conduct prescribed burning activities. Certain types of burning, as discussed in the TSD, must not exceed the County's visible emission standard of 20 percent opacity. Rule 314 specifies that compliance with the opacity standard will be determined in accordance with reference method 9 contained in the Arizona Testing manual. The State's method 9 is the same as EPA's method 9. Compliance with Rule 311 shall be determined in accordance with EPA reference methods 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9. Compliance with Rule 316 shall also be determined in accordance with EPA reference methods 1 through 5 and 9. EPA believes these test methods are appropriate for determining compliance for the following reasons:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Compliance with Rule 310 is determined in accordance with EPA Method 9, except that opacity observations for intermittent visible emissions shall require 12 rather than 24 consecutive readings at 15 second intervals for the averaging time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 310, 314  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As mentioned above, compliance with these rules is determined using EPA reference method 9. While this test method is designed to determine opacity of smoke plumes from stationary sources, EPA believes that it is acceptable for determining compliance with these types of dust generating activities. While there is not a smokestack from which a plume emanates, EPA has not provided a more appropriate test method for determining compliance for sources such as these. Discussions with the Maricopa County Division of Air Pollution Control have indicated that the County enforcement personnel believe a more appropriate method needs to be devised and using method 9 on area source emissions can be difficult. However, they believe that method 9 can be reasonably utilized to determine the severity of visible emissions from the dust producing sources to which the rule applies. Since EPA cannot suggest a reasonable alternative test method that would provide better results, EPA proposes to approve this method of determining compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 311, Rule 316  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As mentioned above, Rules 311 and 316 utilize test methods 1 through 5 and 9 to gauge compliance. These are all appropriate test methods to determine emissions from stationary sources. See 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to meeting the enforceability requirements of the Act and EPA guidance, nonattainment area plan provisions must also contain a program that provides for enforcement of the control measures and other elements in the SIP. See sections 110(a)(2)(C) and 172(c)(7). Moreover, where the State relies on a local or regional government agency for implementing any plan provision, the State has the responsibility for ensuring adequate implementation of that provision. See section 110(a)(2)(E)(iii).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State of Arizona has a program that will ensure that the measures contained in the SIP revision are adequately enforced. Primary enforcement of the RACM and RACT rules will be under the jurisdiction of the Maricopa County Division of Air Pollution Control.

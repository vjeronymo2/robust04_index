			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Business Travel: German hotel Work started last week on rebuilding the Adlon hotel in Berlin, which used to be a magnet for the rich, beautiful and powerful in prewar Europe. The hotel, in Pariser Platz, the square facing the Brandenburg Gate, is due to open in 1997 as a 346-room hotel in the 'five-star-plus' category. Last week Dusit Sindhorn, a Thai company, agreed to buy 50.2 per cent of the Kempinski luxury hotel chain, which has a 20-year lease on the Adlon property.</p>

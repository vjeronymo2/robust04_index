			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: BEVERLY HILLS;  </P> <P> DOWNTOWN REDESIGN PLAN  </P> <P> City officials, concerned by the surge in trendy shopping malls across the  Westside, presented plans for the redesign of the central business district at  a breakfast meeting of the Beverly Hills Chamber of Commerce and Civic Assn.  </P> <P> "Beautification as an end in itself is not worthwhile. It should be a means to  an end, as part of a reinvestment strategy," said Bob Walsh, deputy city  manager.  </P> <P> The urban design proposals, which include street-side flower pots,  granite-banded sidewalks and special lighting, are part of a proposal that  would include parking structures and other capital improvements for the  downtown district.  </P> <P> Responding to complaints from business people on streets that are not part of  the central business district, Walsh said the city would undertake similar  studies for their areas if asked.  </P></p>

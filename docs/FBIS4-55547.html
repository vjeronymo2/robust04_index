			<p>BFN     [Text] Romanian President Ion Iliescu received European  Parliament President Egon Klepsch at Cotroceni Palace this  afternoon. During the meeting President Ion Iliescu briefed the  guest on the current stage and future prospects of the reform  process and on the efforts to implement the reform program. At  the same time, the sides exchanged views on the prospects for  settling the conflict in former Yugoslavia and consolidating  security in the Balkans. In his turn, the guest positively  assessed the progress made of late by Romania and emphasized the  efforts of all forces toward integration in the European  structures.    Klepsch also had a meeting at Victoria Palace this afternoon  with Mircea Cosea, minister of state and chairman of the Council  for Economic Coordination, Strategy, and Reform. The Romanian  minister briefed the guest on the progress of reform and the  economic and financial measures which have enabled Romania to  fulfill the conditions stipulated in the stand-by agreement with  the IMF.    I answered the invitation to come to Romania to prove that  we, the European Community, are very interested in relations  with your country, Klepsch said at the opening of a news  conference organized at the Senate headquarters this afternoon.  He said that our country has a particular importance as far as  ensuring regional stability is concerned. The president of the  European Parliament appreciated the fact that the political  structures in Romania have stabilized and that, after the  signing of the treaty on our country's association with the  European Community, relations between the European Parliament  and the Romanian Parliament can further develop.    Klepsch positively assessed the quality of the talks he  conducted during his two-day visit to Romania and focused his  attention on his meetings with the leaders of political parties  and with various parliamentarians. There is a particular  consensus on your country's European integration, Klepsch said.  Regarding the problem of minorities, he appreciated the valid  legal provisions extant in our country and emphasized that all  that is left to be done is to implement them.    Answering a question, the president of the European  Parliament said that it is very difficult to make a precise  forecast about the date of Romania's admission to the European  Union. Everything is up to Romania, he said, according to our  reporter Victor Spirache.</p>

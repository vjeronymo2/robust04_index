The fourth working-level contact, held at "peace house" on  the southern side of the demilitarized zone, was attended by  Song Yong-tae, chief South Korean delegate, and his North Korean  counterpart, Pak Yong-su.    The two sides are meeting at Panmunjom to determine the  date and agenda for the exchange of special envoys. The envoy  exchange between the two Koreas was one of the conditions set in  the U.S.-North Korean agreement worked out at their  working-level contact in New York.    Pyongyang must resume dialogue with Seoul if it wants to  hold  a third round of high-level talks with the United States,  tentatively slated for March 21 in Geneva.    With the meeting, Seoul is expected to announce the  suspension of the joint U.S.-South Korean military exercise Team  Spirit on condition that practical discussion toward the  resolution of the North Korean nuclear question will be  undertaken through the exchange of special envoys between South  and North Korea.</p>

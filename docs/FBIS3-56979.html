			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Bantin] </F>   [Text] Tokyo January 23 TASS -- Japan intends to stop  giving humanitarian aid to Russia and to monitor the  effectiveness of other programmes for assistance to Moscow,  according to a Japanese Government decision to revise the policy  of assistance to Russia, a number of central Japanese newspapers  reported on Sunday referring to sources in the country's Foreign  Ministry.    According to the sources, Tokyo has arrived at a conclusion  about the need to give up implementing the earlier announced  humanitarian aid programmes, worth a total of 500 million U.S.  dollars, considering the internal political situation in Russia.    Tokyo believes that the implementation of humanitarian aid  programmes now may only be detrimental to the administration of  President Boris Yeltsin, because, in the light of mounting  nationalist and great-power sentiments in Russia, the Russian  Government has been increasingly criticised for accepting  foreign humanitarian aid.    Still, Tokyo intends to carry out all the other programmes  for assistance to Russia in keeping with its commitments but  will also monitor the effectiveness of their realisation.    Japanese Foreign Ministry sources emphasise that it is  planned to attach paramount importance, first of all, to those  programmes which actually promote radical economic reforms and  help moscow take measures necessary to build a market economy.    Tokyo came to a conclusion about the need for such an  approach in view of the formation of a new Russian Government  which plans to introduce changes to the previously pursued  economic policy, and with due regard for the results of the  December elections to Russia's new parliament.    The Japanese Government intends to call on other western  countries to reconsider their programme for assistance to Moscow  so that they would stimulate Russia's headway along the road of  reforms to a greater extent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- A government panel led by  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on Friday [24 June] gave the  go-ahead on 21 items for deregulation, including making it  easier to get a driving license for large motorcycles, officials  said.    The items approved by the office of market access will be  included in a deregulation plan to be announced next week in  line with the market-access scheme unveiled by the government in  March.    The government will try to include specific deadlines for  each item as much as possible, the officials said.    The easing of procedures to obtain a license for motorcycles  with displacement volumes of 400 cc or greater has been  requested not only by domestic manufacturers but by U.S.  companies as well.    Friday's approval by the office came in response to an  earlier submission of the 21 deregulatory proposals by the  Market Access Ombudsman Council, led by Yoshio Okawara, a former  ambassador to the United States and currently a Foreign Ministry  adviser.    The Office of Trade and Investment Ombudsman, a system under  the Economic Planning Agency, is composed of the Market Access  Ombudsman Council and the decision-making Office of Market  Access.    Starting in fiscal 1996 that begins in April of that year,  the license can be obtained at driving schools instead of having  to go to offices of prefectural public safety commissions.    Other deregulatory measures include easing rules on auto  inspection and on specifications related to clothing.</p>

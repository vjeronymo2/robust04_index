			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Arts: Lost in the desert Which contemporary American playwright wrote the following scene? A man stalks out of a dingy apartment into the Southern California desert to buy a bottle of whisky, leaving another man huddled on the floor, shaking uncontrollably. A beautiful young woman enters, carrying a pile of clean laundry and a handbag full of Dollars 20 bills. She drops the laundry on the bed and the bills into the shaking man's lap. 'You should have told me the Derby is in May, Mr Carter. Why would you lie about something as simple as that?' she says. A telephone starts to ring. 'Do you want me to answer that?' asks the woman. The lights slowly fade as the phone continues ringing. The answer is not hard to guess: we are in Shepard country, a land of booze, money, horses; a gritty southwestern setting, with seething tensions and emotionally fraught relationships between men and women alike. Props and events waver between gnomic symbolism and actual reference; mysterious endings go unresolved. All are trademarks of Sam Shepard, the 51-year-old playwright and actor many consider the leading theatrical voice of his generation. The problem is that this scene from Shepard's latest play, Simpatico, now running at the New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theatre in a production directed by the playwright, is the only one in the lengthy evening that finds him anywhere close to form - and it is the moment that ends the play. What has gone before are three dragging hours that are less intriguing than confusing and dull. Simpatico is Shepard's first full-length play since A Lie of the Mind, which earned mixed reviews and had a respectable off-Broadway run in 1985. The current play has travelled a bumpy road to the Public: there were plans last year to bring it to Broadway, but producers were unable to raise the necessary funds for a commercial run. In retrospect, this is a blessing: Simpatico belongs in an off-Broadway, non-profit environment. Its primary interest is that it offers the sad opportunity to reflect on what made Shepard's earlier work great by noting the shortcomings of this production. On paper, Simpatico sounds like an involving, if plot-heavy, thriller about two men bonded together by the legacy of a crime. The action alternates between Kentucky, the site of a racing scandal orchestrated years ago by Vinnie (Fred Ward) and Carter (Ed Harris), and California, where the still-dissolute Vinnie now lives off support cheques from the now-upstanding career man, Carter. Vinnie summons Carter to California to help clear up a misunderstanding with his new girlfriend, Cecilia (Marcia Gay Harden), then heads to Kentucky with a shoebox of letters and photographs to blackmail Simms (James Gammon), the man whom they framed in the former scandal. Carter sends Cecilia to Kentucky to get the incriminating documents back, but she fails, because Vinnie has taken them to Rosie (Beverly D'Angelo), his ex-wife, who is now married to Carter. We end up back in California with Vinnie off in search of whisky, Carter reduced to a pathetic shaking heap, and Cecilia surveying it all, bemused. We know better than to expect wholly rational behaviour from Shepard's characters - his best plays embrace ambiguity and transform the everyday event into mythic action - but a plot as dense as Simpatico's requires a production that gives some sense of the characters' motivations, the layers of guilt, desire, resentment and fear that drive them to act. However, Shepard's flaccid staging makes Simpatico seem a random accumulation of events. The slow deconstruction of the set - every time we return to Vinnie's apartment, another of its walls has disappeared - seems to imply that the play is moving further away from reality as the scenes progress, but the on-stage atmosphere remains static. Scenes drag with too-long pauses, and characters - particularly Carter and Vinnie - have little relationship to each other. The usually excellent Ward and Harris seem to be marking time on stage, playing the ideas of their characters rather than living through their emotions. It is only when the remarkable Marcia Gay Harden is on stage that the production becomes riveting: she turns what could be a one-sided dimwit into an engaging, exasperating, kooky-pathetic lost soul. Beverly D'Angelo, wearing a plunging silk dressing-gown and an almost palpable air of dissolution, also livens things up, but her only scene comes late in the play's second hour and the lift she gives is too little too late.</p>

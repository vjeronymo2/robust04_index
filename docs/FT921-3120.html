			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Britons increase holidays at home THE BRITISH took more of their holidays in the UK last year and made fewer trips abroad, according to a survey published today by the British Tourist Authority. The number going on more than one foreign holiday, however, rose to its highest level ever. The number of holidays taken abroad fell 2 per cent to 20m last year. The foreign holiday market was hit both by the recession and by the Gulf war. The number of holidays taken by people who make more than one foreign trip was 5.3m, up 5 per cent on the previous year. The number of Britons taking holidays in the UK of four nights or more rose 5 per cent to 34m. British spending on UK holidays rose 13 per cent to Pounds 4.7bn. Spending on foreign holidays rose 6 per cent to Pounds 11.3bn. The average cost per person of a foreign holiday was Pounds 550, compared with Pounds 137 for a holiday in the UK. The number of holidays taken in the UK fell in the late 1970s, but has remained fairly stable throughout the past decade. In 1975 40m holidays were taken in the UK by Britons. This had fallen to 36.5m by 1980. Holidays abroad increased from 8m in 1975 to a high point of 21m in 1989.</p>

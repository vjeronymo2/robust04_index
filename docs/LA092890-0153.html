			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> AZTECS;  </P> <P> BUTTS WON'T PLAY . . . YES, HE WILL  </P> <P> Four days ago, the Aztecs announced that Curtis Butts would miss Saturday's  game against Air Force because of a neck strain.  </P> <P> Now, apparently, he will start.  </P> <P> "If he's healthy, he'll probably start," Aztec Coach Al Luginbill said. And  according to trainer Brian Barry, Butts is ready to play.  </P> <P> Running back Tommy Booker, who has been out with an ankle injury since the Cal  State Long Beach game two weeks ago, has also been cleared to play. But  Luginbill said he might hold out Booker. "If he's not 100%, he won't play. We  don't want to take any chances."  </P> <P> Regardless, Luginbill said Larry Maxey will see some time at running back.  Maxey was moved from H-back this week because of the injuries to Butts and  Booker.  </P> <P> After he called Wednesday's defensive practice one of the worst of the year,  Luginbill said Thursday's was the best. "I've been waiting for that. We were  flying around on defense all day. That's the way you have to play against a  team (Air Force) that runs the option. . . . Luginbill named Dennis Arey,  Patrick Rowe and Jimmy Raye as his starters at receiver and Jake Nyberg as the  backup. He said Keith Williams, Merton Harris and Will Tate will also probably  play. Receiver coach Curtis Johnson said he hopes his receivers can hang on to  the ball this week. "Most of the people who were dropping the ball are young,"  he said. "The main thing is to get the kids' confidence back. Because if one of  the older guys get hurt, they're going to have to get in there." DAVE McKIBBEN  </P></p>

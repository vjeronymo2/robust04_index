			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by special correspondent Faycal Metaoui: "Oran: </F> Suburban Poverty Belts"]    [Text] At 2240 on Saturday, 25 December 1993, the Ras El  Ain slum on the western side of Oran was totally silent.  Suddenly the earth began to tremble. The inhabitants panicked.  There was a landslide. The toll was 13 dead, 60 injured. A  little over a month after the catastrophe, confusion still  reigns....    More than a hundred families are living in tents virtually  in  the shadow of the cave-in site. "Several years ago a wadi used  to run through here," one young inhabitant told us. Those who  lost their homes were the hardest hit by the January rains.  Flood waters almost carried away the tents--and the occupants  along with them. "Old people have fallen sick. Children are  spitting up blood. People cannot sleep at night because of the  cold," laments another youth, who says he had to quit his job to  take care of his family.    Several meters from this place, which local authorities call  a "transit camp," passes the road leading from Sidi El Houari to  Planteurs, a populous quarter nestled at the base of Mt.  Murdjadjo. Medical emergencies can occur at any moment. As a  preventive measure, municipal health authorities have put an  ambulance at the victims' disposal.    "We treat about 15 patients a day on-site. Recently we had a  virtual epidemic of diarrhea," we were told by the doctor on  duty. According to one camp resident, the malady was caused by  nonpotable water from a tank truck. For four weeks now, the  inhabitants have been waiting for a running water hook-up.    "The ambulance you see down there departs at 1700. Several  times we urgently needed to evacuate sick people. Without a  vehicle, it was very difficult to do. Even the taxi drivers  refused to come into our quarter," says a man with graying hair.  Another informs us that for lack of room, young people in some  families have to find someplace on their own to sleep at nights.    A brief tour of the camp brought to light scenes worthy of a  favelas. Cooking utensils, mattresses, and linens were strewn  pell-mell beside each tent. The two footpaths that separate the  tents (and are still unusable) are known to the inhabitants as  "Sandala and Anana boulevards." People here try constantly to  make light of the appallingly wretched conditions. But at one  point, a women hidden behind a curtain asks our escorts the  purpose of our visit. "Tell them to help us. We cannot go on  like this any longer," she says in a choked voice.    In a desperate effort to shelter themselves from the winter  rains, families have covered their temporary refuges with nylon  provided by "a charitable soul." With a measure of pride, the  father of a family shows off the abode he built on a small  hillock out of stones and sheet metal. He could no longer stand  to live with his many children under a tent. But for all of  them, mere survival has been a struggle.    Some residents are already getting suspicious, especially  since workers sent by the Oran executive delegation have started  digging a trench in preparation for building a wall.    The families are concerned about their "temporary" housing.  "If they have decided to build a wall, it is because they want  to keep us here a long time," one adolescent protests. The waste  water from toilets hastily built by the commune is carried away  in an open drainage ditch. Household garbage is dumped  haphazardly a few tenths of a mile from the camp. Nauseous odors  attack the nose.    To the victims, the site (nicknamed "Hay Geyouni") is a  constant reminder of the terrifying landslide.    They all want to get away from it. The ruins of houses  destroyed by the cave-in are still visible. Thirtyish Houari  Yahia sighs painfully whenever he looks at them. When the  catastrophe struck, the young man lost both his father and his  mother.  <H5>  Frightening Memory </H5>   It is no use telling him the habitations that collapsed were  built above a tunnel used for growing mushrooms. He does not  want to know. His only concern is to find decent housing for his  two sisters (one of whom is mentally ill) and his young brother.  He was chosen by the other victims to head a committee that is  working to plead their cause with the local authorities.    "We were received by all the officials, including the DEC  [expansion not given] and the head of the daira. Lots of  promises..." we were told. In mid-January the DEC announced that  plots of land in the Quatre Chemins quarter would be distributed  to Ras El Ain victims so they could build their own new homes.  But as soon as heads of families got to the site, they ran into  immense problems with a state-owned enterprise that claimed  ownership of the land.    Still, financial aid totaling 40,000 Algerian dinars was  promised. "What is the Red Cross doing? None of its officials  deigned to pay us a visit. What happens to all the donations  they get?" asks one committee member.    The DEC has acknowledged the existence of about fifty abodes  in the Sidi El Houari quarter still facing the threat of  collapse. According to official statistics, 326 sites providing  shelter for 3,400 families in Oran's old town could fall in at  any moment.    Ras El Ain, perched on a hillside, is one of those forgotten  housing projects--along with Planteurs, Sidi El Houari, and Bel  Horizon--that surround the city of El Bahia. Planteurs is a  quarter that extends for 3 km along the flank of Murdjadjo.    It is separated from the rest of Oran by the Ras El Ain  ravine. The latter is boxed in between the steep, rocky edge of  the Oran plateau and the sloping mountainside of Murdjadjo.  Longtime Oran residents recall that El Bahia's first inhabitants  were attracted there by the abundance of water and fertile soil.  Some inhabitants continue willy-nilly to cultivate a few plots  along the banks of a wadi, although the stream bed has become a  veritable refuse dump.    Emerging from Freres Benkhedda square on the lower side of  Sidi El Houari, the Ras El Ain development presents an appalling  spectacle. Whole blocks of houses are crammed together in  chaotic disorder. What we think of as streets do not really  exist here--just small walkways of packed earth.  <H5>  No Disinfectant </H5>   A topographical study several years ago revealed serious  surface instability at several locations, which puts houses with  stone foundations at permanent risk of collapse. As early as  1977, plans were made to rid Ras El Ain ravine of the "unhealthy  and precarious" structures "already standing." "Relocation of  Ras El Ain's inhabitants to undeveloped zones is an urgent  priority," one reads in this study. But nothing was ever done.  Built of sun-dried bricks or a mixture of rock and clay, the  habitations constitute a constant source of danger. Other abodes  built of sheet metal or wood are on the verge of collapse. Local  authorities had plans under the auspices of various development  schemes to raze some 1,400 (potentially hazardous) structures  housing more than 2,400 families.    For reasons unknown, this operation was never carried out.  Planteurs, as part of the slum eradication campaign, got special  treatment. Not only has the quarter become a gigantic cesspool,  but the unkept promises of officials are doing more damage than  one could imagine.    "People here are living in a sham development. The  inhabitants are crushed beneath the weight of all sorts of  problems, but no one tries to understand the causes of their  suffering," fumes a nurse at a huge medical center originally  designed to specialize in pediatrics and gynecology. According  to our interlocutor, the place is now almost totally abandoned.  She says, for example, that occupancy never exceeds 30 percent.  Entire floors are empty. Patients, seeing the lack of funds,  medicine, and equipment, have opted for other hospital centers.  "How can we care for patients when we do not even have so much  as a jar of disinfectant?" she asks. The facility is in a poor  location...it stands opposite an unauthorized public dump.    The number of inhabitants has grown tenfold in the last 13  years. Moreover, at least according to a goodly number of  sociologists, the populations of Ras El Ain, Planteurs, and Sidi  El Houari are suffering from marginalization: "In the view of  many, Ras El Ain's inhabitants simply do not exist. We are  treated almost as if we were outlaws. Taxi drivers refuse to  pick us up at night. As they see it, the people here are vulgar  `beznassa' if not actually thieves," we were told by one  anguished young victim. An urban planner has observed, in  another academic study, that local authorities have long refused  to treat Ras El Ain and Planteurs "as an integral part of the  city of Oran. In addition, the authorities have always rejected  the idea that these quarters have any legal existence." And  that, in a word, is the whole tragedy of Ras El Ain....</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Decision to shut Yorks mine expected today BRITISH COAL is expected to signal the closure of its Frickley colliery and the rationalisation and possible closure of at least one other today as it takes its pre-privatisation closures programme to the heart of Yorkshire. The announcement that it wants further talks with unions on Frickley and Bentley later in the week will provide a significant test for the rationalisation programme which started last week with the proposed closure of Calverton, Nottinghamshire. Today's announcement would follow the disclosure by British Coal yesterday that it had agreed in principle for the first time for a private sector operator to lease one of 20 pits which have been offered for licence in recent months. RJB Mining is expected to start operating Clipstone colliery in Nottinghamshire in the next two months. A price and the division of liabilities have been agreed, but not disclosed. RJB believes Clipstone has potential to be mined for at least five years. Initially the company will be unable to employ more than 150 men underground, because of legal restrictions, but could employ at least 200 in total. Mr Richard Budge, RJB chief executive, said he had started recruiting at Clipstone, aided by the Union of Democratic Mineworkers. Today's announcements on Frickley and Bentley are expected as unions and management discuss prospects for all pits in the Yorkshire region. Union leaders believe the Hatfield and Prince of Wales pits are vulnerable, but it was unclear last night whether they would be named for further discussions. The trustees of the 570,000-member Mineworkers Pension Scheme yesterday called for legislation requiring that they be included in discussions about how the scheme's assets are to be divided following privatisation. The trustees want the legislation to include specific promises about index-linking and government solvency guarantees for a new scheme for existing and deferred pensioners.</p>

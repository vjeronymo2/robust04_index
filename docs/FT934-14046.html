			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Leading Article: The Cyprus test THE BIENNIAL conference of leaders of the Commonwealth is the diplomatic equivalent of cricket. It baffles foreigners, lasts as long as a five-day test match, and the English team usually gets a drubbing from West Indians and other nations who have adopted the game. It is also losing spectators. The heads and representatives of 50 governments who meet in Cyprus this week have to sharpen their performance and improve their image. First the conference has to set aside past differences over South Africa. Like the English cricketers who moan about Mr Curtly Ambrose's bouncers, Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, complains the Commonwealth has been 'distorted' by the long row between Britain and most other members over apartheid. This view is too partisan. Commonwealth members legitimately used every opportunity to put pressure on Britain to impose economic sanctions against Pretoria. It may well be that they were right. And it's worth remembering that Commonwealth pressure on Britain at the 1979 conference in Lusaka helped pave the way to an independent Zimbabwe. What the row has done is to divert attention from the Commonwealth's valuable work as a development agency. It can be even more effective if it operates in a democratic environment. The Commonwealth must also recover an integrity which has been undermined by its selective morality. It rightly condemned the evils of apartheid; yet all too often turned a blind eye to abuses by its authoritarian member states. Reform is under way, but more should be done. Monitoring and publicising human rights violations in member countries is one step. It should also be made clear that members have subscribed to a set of principles that cannot be broken with impunity. The Commonwealth could decline into an irrelevant by-product of British colonial history; or it could become a force for good governance, in a constituency that embraces a quarter of the world's population, by putting democratic principles into practice. Decisions in Cyprus could determine which route it takes.</p>

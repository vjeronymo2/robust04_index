			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH DEFENDS STANCE IN FAILED PANAMA COUP  </P> <P> President Bush on Friday firmly defended his Administration's action during the  failed coup in Panama, saying that he would do nothing differently, but leading  Senate Democrats blamed him personally for a confused and erratic U.S.  response.  </P> <P> "This Administration has good people, but policy guidance has to start with the  President," said Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), who  charged that the Administration was caught without any plan of action.  "Occasionally, we ought to foresee that our policy of encouraging a coup might  succeed, and we ought to be prepared."  </P> <P> Administration officials acknowledged that Tuesday's coup attempt -- Bush's  first foreign crisis -- has exposed "organizational problems" in the way the  White House handles such emergencies. As late as Friday, for example, senior  officials could not agree on what orders had been given to U.S. troops in  Panama. And as the confusion continued, senior officials began blaming each  other for lapses.  </P> <P> And while attention appeared to center on those institutional failures, the  week's events also have called attention to a sharp division within official  Washington about how to handle Panama and its controversial leader, Gen. Manuel  A. Noriega. Many lawmakers assert that the President should be prepared to move  aggressively against the Panamanian strongman, but Administration officials  appear increasingly to favor a policy of restraint.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Would Not Change Decision  </P> <P> Even in retrospect, Bush insisted that he would not change his decision against  using U.S. troops to ensure the coup's success.  </P> <P> "I don't see anything now that would have made me make a different decision,"  he told reporters after emerging from Walter Reed Army Medical Center, where he  underwent an operation to remove a cyst from his finger.  </P> <P> Nunn and Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman David L. Boren (D-Okla.) said  the President had an obligation to issue detailed instructions to U.S.  personnel in Panama telling them what to do in the event of a coup attempt.  </P> <P> They also said that U.S. officials should have been instructed to ask the  rebels in advance of their attempted revolt whether they intended to recognize  a duly elected government, which Noriega has refused to do.  </P> <P> If the rebels had been asked that question and if they had promised to install  an elected government, Nunn said, the United States would then have had the  "moral basis" on which to use military force to support the coup. "There are  certainly circumstances under which American troops can be used," he said.  </P> <P> On Capitol Hill, sentiment seems to have grown for strong U.S. actions to  remove Noriega -- perhaps even extending to the direct use of U.S. troops. But  within the Administration, this week's failure has accelerated a move in the  other direction.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Emphasized Caution  </P> <P> Bush and Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, for example, emphasized caution in  their comments.  </P> <P> "What people -- some people -- seem to have wanted me to do is to unleash the  full military to go in and, quote, 'get Noriega,' " said Bush. "I suppose you  could have gone to general quarters, but that's not prudent and that's not the  way I plan to conduct the military or foreign affairs of this country."  </P> <P> Late Thursday, Cheney noted that "we could -- if the President gave me the  order tonight -- we could have Noriega out of there, probably by midnight. But  one of the questions you have to ask yourself is how many dead Americans is  Gen. Noriega worth, and under what circumstances are you prepared to use that  kind of force?"  </P> <P> His tone, a senior Administration aide said, reflected a conscious decision to  try to move public attention away from a foreign policy area that has become a  frustrating embarrassment.  </P> <P> "Every Administration that knows what it's doing tries to downplay things that  don't go well," the aide said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Subject of Recriminations  </P> <P> Within the Administration, Panama has rapidly become a subject of  recriminations, several officials said. A senior Pentagon official identified  White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu as the source of a number of comments  critical of the Pentagon's handling of the crisis. Another Administration  official confirmed that Sununu had spread word that he was dissatisfied with  how the National Security Council had responded to the events.  </P> <P> Cheney defended his department's actions. "The only thing I can suggest is  that, as is true a lot of places, not all the Monday-morning quarterbacks  reside on Capitol Hill," he said when asked about criticism from Administration  colleagues.  </P> <P> Regardless of who bears the blame, reconstructions of Tuesday's events make  clear that at key points, the Administration's response was confused. It was  not at all clear, however, that a more coherent response would have led to a  different outcome.  </P> <P> "The full story isn't in yet; they're still trying to sort it out," said one  Administration official. But, he added, "there was no clear line of authority  that would lead to a Presidential decision" on how to handle the coup. "There  were a lot of people providing information, and periodically the President was  informed. There was no clear opportunity for the President to say, 'OK, let's  go get him' or 'Let's stay out of it.' "  </P> <P> "We may have done the right thing," the official concluded, "but we stumbled  into it."  </P> <P> Nunn and Boren criticized Administration policy-makers, both in Panama and at  the White House, for failing to consult with officials in the CIA as the coup  unfolded. As a result, they said, decisions were made without adequate  information.  </P> <P> According to Boren, no one from the CIA was invited to attend either of the two  important decision-making meetings Tuesday between the President and his aides  in the White House situation room. It is highly unusual for the CIA to be  excluded from such meetings.  </P> <P> Perhaps the clearest examples of the confusion involved the movements of U.S.  troops to block two key roads that pro-Noriega soldiers were expected to use to  go to the general's rescue. The troop movements had been requested by the  leader of the coup, Maj. Moises Giroldi Vega, in a meeting with U.S. officials  Sunday.  </P> <P> Even Friday, three days after the failed coup, U.S. officials could not agree  what orders those troops had been given. Asked if the troops were authorized to  block Noriega's soldiers if they attempted to move, White House Press Secretary  Marlin Fitzwater replied yes.  </P> <P> But Cheney, asked the same question, said no.  </P> <P> "That's the kind of decision that would have come up the chain rapidly to the  President, and he would have been given the opportunity to make the broad  policy decision -- 'Yes, we want to intervene militarily.' That decision was  never made," Cheney said.  </P> <P> In the end, Noriega's supporters made the question moot by taking a third road.  But once that happened, U.S. officials apparently failed to tell either the  rebels or Bush.  </P> <P> According to Boren, who was briefed extensively by the CIA, Cheney and Gen.  Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, White House officials  apparently chose not to interrupt Bush's meeting with Mexican President Carlos  Salinas de Gortari to ask the President whether American soldiers should be  stationed on that third road. The coup might have succeeded if the President  had decided to block the road that the Noriega forces were using, Boren  claimed.  </P> <P> "The real question is why did we let the coup fail," Boren said. "The President  should have been given a 'yes' or 'no' option on whether to block that road."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cable Supports Assertion  </P> <P> Both Boren and Nunn said they currently accept Cheney's assertion that the  rebels refused to turn Noriega over to U.S. officials. They said that account  is supported by a cable from U.S. military officials in Panama to Washington.  </P> <P> But Boren said they also have seen another cable sent to Washington by U.S.  intelligence officials in Panama saying that members of the coup wanted U.S.  personnel to take Noriega while he was still in rebel custody. Cheney told the  senators that this second cable was based on a misunderstanding.  </P> <P> When asked by his aides to decide whether U.S. troops should take custody of  Noriega, according to Boren, the President replied "only if he's delivered onto  American territory."  </P> <P> Times staff writers John M. Broder and Melissa Healy contributed to this  report.  </P></p>

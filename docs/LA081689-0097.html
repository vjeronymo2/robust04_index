			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'THE CAJUN BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN';  </P> <P> AFTER THAT BIZARRE ENTREE PROMISE, TOUPS' ZYDECO CAREER HAS HAD ITS DRY WELLS  AND GUSHERS  </P> <P> Wayne Toups was born 30 years ago in Lafayette, La., "the Capital of Cajun  Country." As a full-blooded Cajun growing up in the small neighboring town of  Crowley, he was surrounded virtually from birth by the region's distinctive  accordion-dominated music.  </P> <P> Signed last year to PolyGram Records as only the second Cajun-zydeco act on a  major label (the Buckwheat Zydeco band was first), Toups is now one of a  handful positioned to bring that effusively joyful music beyond its cult  following to mainstream popularity.  </P> <P> He found his entree into the record business through, in the words of the D.L.  Menard song considered the Cajun national anthem, "the back door."  </P> <P> Toups, who will be opening for Carole King (see accompanying story) at the  Pacific Amphitheatre tonight, landed his record deal as a result of bizarre  coincidences, according to Steve Popovich, the former PolyGram vice president  who signed Toups before leaving the label earlier this year for a sabbatical.  </P> <P> "I had first read about Wayne in an airline magazine article about Cajun  music," Popovich said from Nashville. "It had called him 'the Cajun Bruce  Springsteen' because of his marathon live shows. I had underlined his name  because of that. The next day I was in my office trying to dig up more  information about him, when a guy I hadn't seen in years walked into my  reception area with another guy, and said he had a project he just had to play  for me."  </P> <P> That "other guy" was Toups, and the project that promotion man Steve Topley had  with him was Toups' previous album, "Johnnie Can't Dance," which had been  released by a small Louisiana label.  </P> <P> "The raw energy and excitement I heard on that record was so different, I got  really enthusiastic about it," Popovich said.  </P> <P> Despite the analogy to Springsteen, Toups was signed to the label's country  division in Nashville, largely because of Popovich's desire to line up artists  who broadened the boundaries of country music.  </P> <P> "I didn't want to sign things that would only go up Billboard country charts  that are built on just 150 (country radio) stations," Popovich said. "I wanted  something that could happen worldwide.  </P> <P> "I've always loved accordions. . . . I felt Wayne had a shot to take accordions  to a wider audience. I think Wayne stands above a lot of the other Cajun and  zydeco musicians because of the energy, he's all over the stage. . . . In fact,  after I left PolyGram, I think the Nashville office didn't feel comfortable  handling something like Wayne."  </P> <P> Thus, Toups was shifted from the country division over to the company's rock  promotion department. Actually, Toups cites none of the great Cajun  accordionists as his chief role model: "I've always wanted to play the  accordion the way that Duane Allman played the slide guitar," he said from  Boise, Ida., where he was opening for King.  </P> <P> Like most U.S. youths -- even those in rural Louisiana's Cajun country -- Toups  grew up listening to rock 'n' roll. He was also enamored of such soul greats at  Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett and James Brown, influences that  are quickly apparent in his dusky vocals.  </P> <P> On "Blast From the Bayou," the major-label debut of Toups and his Zydecajun  band, several rollicking, upbeat tunes typical of zydeco (the R&amp;B-infused  cousin of the more countrified Cajun style) are interspersed with a couple of  rather bold covers: Aaron Neville's 1966 hit "Tell It Like It Is" and Van  Morrison's "Tupelo Honey."  </P> <P> Why on earth take on rock standards originally recorded by two of pop music's  finest singers? Toups said it was a case of genuine love for the songs, rather  than any cocky attempt to improve on the original versions: "The record company  definitely wanted some cover tunes. 'Tell It Like It Is' is a fabulous tune.  It's been part of our act for a while, and if I didn't think we could do it  justice, I never would have done it."  </P> <P> For most of the audiences Toups has been playing to with King, the Cajun  accordion he wields is a curious contraption. Resembling in bellows only the  more familiar piano accordion (picture Myron Floren and "The Lawrence Welk  Show"), the unusual Cajun variety features a single row of 10 buttons for the  right hand. Like a blues harmonica ("only more expensive," Toups quipped), the  Cajun accordion plays in just one key, though they can be built in any number  of keys.  </P> <P> Though he has been playing the accordion since he was 14, he quit in the late  '70s when got married and had a son. To supply his family with the steady  income that was not available to him then as a musician, he went to work in the  oil fields, ran a backhoe and for a while worked as a gravedigger.  </P> <P> "I've done enough physical labor," he said, "to say I've worked for a living."  </P> <P> About 1982, he formed a band to play gigs at night and on weekends, and by  1985, performing three or four dances a week, he was earning enough to quit the  day jobs. Before the PolyGram album, Toups released two albums for independent  labels.  </P> <P> For all his desire to create a rock-based Cajun-zydeco hybrid that is more  commercially potent, Toups still gets some of his greatest rewards from playing  the old-fashioned way.  </P> <P> He turned in one of many highlights at the 1989 New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage  Festival during an informal performance and lecture that teamed him with fellow  accordionist Steve Riley. Each demonstrated his approach to the same material  -- Riley using a seamless, traditional Cajun technique and Toups (dressed in  his trademark tank top, headband and flowery Bermuda shorts) countering with a  more muscular, rock-conscious style.  </P> <P> "I love the traditional music," he said last week. "I love to do that when we  are at home, and I always sing (some songs) in French. But I also think the  music has to expand. You can't just keep the old -- you also need the new. It's  like the folklorists say: You can't cut all the branches off, or the roots will  die."  </P></p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / World Trade News: ABB raises Russia profile ASEA BROWN BOVERI, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, is forming a joint venture with Saturn - a Russian company best known for producing engines for the Sukhoy 27 jet - to manufacture parts for power plants. The 'swords to-ploughshares' tie-up is one of the most important signed so far between a western company and Russian industry. It is the first time one of the big western power equipment suppliers has joined forces with a Russian defence company. The joint venture company, called ABB Uniturbo, is 80 per cent owned by ABB and 20 per cent by Saturn. It will be based at Saturn's plant near Moscow and will initially employ 500 of its 4,000 workers. ABB said the venture would cover engineering, research and development, product development and manufacturing of components. But The Swiss-Swedish group is discussing other joint ventures in Russia, which could be used for assembly of complete gas turbines. ABB said that by the end of the year it expected to be employing 20,000 people in more than 40 companies in the former Soviet Union and east Europe. Last month it announced a venture with AvtoVAZ, maker of Lada cars, to produce fans in Russia for the domestic and industrial ventilation market.</p>

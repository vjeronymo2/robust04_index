			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / India steel plant doubts grow Long-standing plans to build a Rs64bn (Pounds 1.3bn) integrated steel plant near Calcutta, one of the country's largest investment projects, have been thrown into doubt following the withdrawal of Caparo, the UK engineering group, as principal promoter. Mr Swraj Paul, Caparo chairman, said Indian economic reforms, though on the right track, had not progressed far enough to 'attract industrial investment' and regretted steel was not given the 'kind of priority it deserves'. He blamed Indian state financial institutions for not committing sufficient funds. Caparo had been ready to invest Dollars 90m (Pounds 60m) in the equity of Kalinga Steel, a company formed to implement the 1.5m-tonnes-a-year project at Daitari in Orissa state, south-west of Calcutta. The Orissa government, the joint promoter, was ready to contribute nearly Dollars 30m. Davy International of the US , according to Mr Paul, had been prepared to put Dollars 70m into Kalinga Steel but pulled out after failing to agree terms with the Indian financial institutions. According to Mr Paul, 'there is no way we can build a Rs64bn steel plant without a debt:equity ratio of 3:1. But the Indian financial institutions are insisting on a debt:equity ratio of 2:1' - although, he said, the higher gearing had been approved by the Indian Foreign Investment Promotion Board. Mr Biju Patnaik, chief minister of Orissa, said the land earlier allotted to Kalinga Steel had now gone to Mesco, a diversified Indian business house, to put up an export-oriented steel plant.</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Management: Talking turkey on foreign language lessons / Picking and choosing from the many training programmes now on offer Mention foreign language training and most Britons still flinch. In despair, many managers spend thousands of pounds on training programmes they have not seen or tried, nor evaluated to see whether they meets the needs of staff. Some send employees on lengthy courses without any idea of the value of the training to either the individual or the company. This lack of quality control is endemic in British business, according to Stephen Hagen, curriculum director for languages at the CTC Trust, the government initiative to bolster industry's involvement in higher education. He has co-edited a new book* setting out guidelines for companies planning to buy language training packages. 'Too many companies are adopting a 'quick-fix' approach,' says Hagen, 'while failing to apply the normal rules of purchase to language services as they would to, say, buying a computer system or a company car.' The wide variety and styles of language training means that the potential purchaser faces a vast array of choices. A typical corporate response to language training would be: to send for some well-advertised tapes; to hire a French student to teach a lunchtime class; to send staff along to the local college; or to expect staff to learn in their own time and at their own expense. For Hagen, this type of response is irrelevant and can even be damaging. 'All our competitors in other countries are now pursuing integrated language strategies and it is important that we follow suit,' he says. Hagen recommends that companies establish a formal language training policy, setting out the objectives and including a specific budget. A company should also undertake a 'language audit' to gauge the language learning abilities of existing personnel. Linguistic aptitude tests, available from the Open University and from colleges affiliated to the Export Language Training programme, would play a part in this to determine how long tuition for individual employees would take and the consequent cost. The savings for a company pursuing a qualitative approach can be enormous. Using data from the Australian government, Hagen has calculated the average time it takes business people to reach a set level of language skill. A 'slow-track' learner can take 210 hours to reach the same 'survival' level in a European language as it can take a typical 'fast-track' student to reach in 75 hours. At a training cost of Pounds 40 per hour, the difference can be a staggering Pounds 5,400 per employee. If the language is Japanese, the difference can be 300 hours. There are other issues to be considered. Should the training be conducted on- or off-site? Should it be condensed or given on a continuing basis? What are the abilities of the teaching staff and are they relevant to commercial needs? At the end of it all, return on investment should be measured. With the debate in continental Europe now centring on which third of fourth foreign language should be studied, Hagen says that it is time for the era of consciousness-raising over language training in the UK to move on. 'The message is slowly getting through. The debate now is about quality of training, about how individuals can best be utilised and how companies can get value for money.' *Languages in International Business: a practical guide, edited by Doug Embleton and Stephen Hagen.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By BUSINESS-TASS] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 5 TASS -- The Russian parliament is  preparing to ratify an agreement on the creation of free trade  zones signed by heads of state and governments of the  Commonwealth countries, Vladimir Meshcheryakov, deputy chairman  of the state customs committee of the Russian Federation, told  BUSINESS-TASS.    According to Vladimir Meshcheryakov, the Federation Council  plans to hold hearings on the preparation for ratification of  this package of documents on May 16.    The signing of the agreement on the establishment of free  trade zones, the deputy chairman of the state customs committee  noted, is the first stage in the process of economic drawing  together of the Commonwealth countries. The second stage will  mark the transition to a customs union.    In both cases, Vladimir Meshcheryakov explained, there will  be no quantitative and tariff restrictions in mutual trade but  the existence of free trade zones does not prevent the state  from the independent determination of its foreign economic  policy. After all, a customs union is first of all common  customs tariffs.    Vladimir Meshcheryakov paid attention to the fact that a  concept of free trade in the Commonwealth is not applied in a  pure form now. In practice the so-called exceptions from the  free trade regime are employed which were legalized by bilateral  agreements between Russia and other Commonwealth countries  signed in 1992-1993.    These exceptions concern export tariffs, quotas and  licenses.  For this reason the agreement signed by leaders of the  Commonwealth countries on April 15 is considerably advancing the  Commonwealth towards the establishment of a customs union,  Vladimir Meshcheryakov pointed out.</p>

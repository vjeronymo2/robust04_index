			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / UK Company News: John Lewis dips 16% amid tough trading JOHN LEWIS Partnership, the employee-owned department store and supermarket group, yesterday revealed that it had endured its toughest spell of trading since the Second World War as profits fell for the third successive year. At the pre-tax level, annual profits slipped by 16 per cent to Pounds 77.3m as a result of rising costs and higher interest charges. The company warned that it expected the 'unhelpful economic climate' to continue. Some Pounds 30.2m would be shared between the 34,000 employees in the form of the company's annual bonus. The cash pay-out represented 9 per cent of annual salary and was the lowest percentage payment since 1958-59 when a 7 per cent distribution was made in preference stock. On average, each employee (or partner as they are known) will receive a bonus of Pounds 955 before tax compared with Pounds 1,180 last year. The company, which runs 22 department stores and 97 Waitrose supermarkets, increased sales by 6 per cent to Pounds 2.28bn (including VAT) in the year to January 26. The department stores increased sales by 4 per cent to Pounds 1.13bn while Waitrose supermarkets lifted sales by 8 per cent to Pounds 1.12bn. Trading profits fell by 9 per cent to Pounds 100.1m as the company's manufacturing arm was particularly badly hit. The increase in average borrowings to Pounds 226m resulted in a higher interest charge of Pounds 22.8m (Pounds 18.4m). Mr Peter Lewis, chairman, said in the circumstances it had been 'a pretty solid and certainly very welcome result'. He pointed out that although the annual bonus distribution was 17 per cent lower than last year, partners had on average received 5 per cent more pay in 1991-92 as a result of increases in annual salary. Everything possible must now be done to curtail the growth in expenses to align them more closely with increases in revenue, he said.</p>

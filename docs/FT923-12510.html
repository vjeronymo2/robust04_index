			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Accountants urge DTI change THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry should abolish the statutory requirement for small, limited liability companies to be audited, the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants said yesterday. In a submission to the DTI the institute said arguments for retaining the audit were 'highly suspect'. It called for it to be replaced with a more 'relevant' certification process by a qualified accountant.</p>

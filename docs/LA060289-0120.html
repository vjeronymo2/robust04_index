			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE PREP TRACK AND FIELD MEET;  </P> <P> CONWAY MAKES THE HAWTHORNE BOYS SOLID FAVORITES  </P> <P> The top high school track and field athletes in California will gather today  for the opening of the State meet at Cerritos College at 3 p.m.  </P> <P> The meet ends Saturday.  </P> <P> Hawthorne, the Southern Section 4-A Division champion, is a strong favorite to  win the boys' team title, thanks largely to senior sprinter Curtis Conway.  </P> <P> Conway, who has yet to win an individual state title, is the leading qualifier  in the 100 and 200 meters, with winning times in last week's Masters meet of  10.66 seconds and 21.04, respectively.  </P> <P> Conway will also anchor the Cougars' 400-meter relay team, which has set state  records in each of its last two outings. In winning the Masters meet last week,  the Cougars ran 40.25 seconds, the fourth-fastest time in the nation.  </P> <P> Beno Bryant of L.A. Dorsey is favored to win the 400 meters, after winning the  City Section title last week in a city record of 46.36.  </P> <P> Bryant will also anchor the Dons' relay teams, which will challenge Hawthorne  in both the 400- and 1,600-meter events.  </P> <P> In the middle distances, Coley Candaele of Carpinteria looms as the runner to  beat, after being a double winner in the Masters meet. He won the 1,600 meters  in 4 minutes 10.54 seconds and the 800 meters in 1:51.58.  </P> <P> There is no strong favorite in the girls' competition.  </P> <P> Pasadena Muir, the 4-A Division champion, is expected to be in the hunt for the  team title, based on its strong group of sprinters, headed by junior Inger  Miller.  </P> <P> However, Muir Coach Jim Brownfield says that it is too close to call.  </P> <P> "This is going to be one exciting meet," he said. "There is just no way to  figure out this meet."  </P> <P> Angela Burnham of Oxnard Rio Mesa, the defending state champion in the 100 and  200, is expected to double once again, despite a strong challenge from Miller.  </P> <P> Burnham won the 100 and 200 at the Masters, with the fastest times in the  nation this season of 11.52 and 23.49, respectively.  </P></p>

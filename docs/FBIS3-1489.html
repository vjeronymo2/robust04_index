			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the ANC on the SAPA PR Wire Service] </F>   [Text] The government remains passive, De Klerk fiddles  while Natal burns! The violence throughout Natal/kwaZulu  escalates, while the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] fans the  flames. While Chief Minister Buthelezi prattles on about  "principles," "sovereignty" and "federalism," his supporters are  receiving the hidden sub-text of his message: prevent by all  possible means a free and fair election! Venues for publicly  advertised election rallies are being denied to the ANC by gangs  of armed Inkatha intruders. Throughout the province, homes of  known supporters of Inkatha's opponents are being torched, and  their occupants driven to flight by armed IFP gangs. Men, women  and children are being gunned down in orchestrated gang attacks  and in terrorist 'drive-by' shootings. Buthelezi, the kwaZulu  government and kwaZulu Police wash their hands of any  responsibility of complicity.    This situation cannot be allowed to continue, it is bringing  the province to a state of low-intensity civil war, which is  broadening out beyond the provincial borders - vice todays  IFP-inspired terror on the Witwatersrand. Here citizens going  about their business in central Johannesburg have been  terrorised by roaming bands of armed Inkatha gunmen, shooting at  random, ANC headquarters at Shell House have come under attack  with firearms, and our leaders and administrators besieged; and  forced to return fire in self defence. Unknown numbers of people  are dead and wounded in this bloody aftermath to what the IFP  claimed was a "demonstration of loyalty" to Zulu King Goodwill  Zwelithini.    Unrestrained IFP gangsterism is destroying the hopes of the  majority of our people for our first-ever free vote to determine  the nature of our own next government. It is allowing the gangs  and bully-boys to disrupt the course of democratic change, and  to elevate the rule of the armed mob above the majority will of  the whole South African population.    Buthelezi claims to be motivated by high principles of  "federalism" and Zulu "sovereignty." Such `principles' were  never in evidence during the years when his power in kwaZulu  derived from patronage from the apartheid state. They only  emerge now to sanitise his efforts to prevent government power  passing finally from the minority NP [National Party] government  which installed, upheld and subsidised him in power.    Buthelezi's frenzied opposition to the whole electoral  process is not based on principle. It is based purely on  expediency and fear. Every public opinion poll taken in the  province points conclusively to a decisive election-day defeat  for the IFP. That is a verdict substantiated by the hundreds of  thousands of Zulus who turned out at last weekend's rallies and  marches in Durban and Pietermaritzburg, in support both of the  ANC and of the right to vote on April 27th. Buthelezi and the  IFP dare not face the verdict of the voters.    On his part, De Klerk claims to be inhibited from action to  stabilise the Natal/kwaZulu turmoil, by considerations of  caution, and fear of creating worse disorder. His motives too  are suspect. He purports to be acting as a responsible head of  state. But he also has one eye to advancing the NP election  campaign whose main electoral plank is that it can "stop the  ANC". Buthelezi's ambitions and De Klerk's run parallel. The  vicious IFP campaign of murder and mayhem in Natal is also  designed to "stop the ANC".    It is time to call a halt to this conspiracy against the  people of Natal and kwaZulu.    There are only four weeks to the election. Neither the  thuggery of the IFP nor the indecision and lack of leadership  from the government can be allowed to dictate the outcome.    If the government will not act, the TEC [Transitional  Executive Council] must. It must act firmly and without delay.    The SADF [South African Defense Force] must now be deployed  throughout Natal/kwaZulu in sufficient strength to bring the  bandit gangs under control.    All members of the kwaZulu Police [KZP] who have been  implicated in or trained in the secret "3rd force" camps  identified by the Goldstone Commission, must be immediately  disarmed and stood down.    The remaining members of the KZP must be brought under SADF  command and control.    All units of the SA Police Internal Stability Units must be  withdrawn from the province, and their duties taken on by the  SADF and deployed members of the National Peace Keeping Force.    The financial subsidies to the kwaZulu administration should  be suspended immediately, until full compliance by the kwaZulu  administration with the requirements of the Independent Election  Commission [IEC] for free campaigning and voting.    Conditions must now be created to enable the IEC to commence  setting up polling stations throughout Natal/kwaZulu, under full  protection of the national security forces.    The IFP attempt to frustrate the will of the overwhelming  majority of South Africans can not be allowed to continue. The  IFP can not be allowed a veto over the rights of all others.  The TEC must step in without further delay.</p>

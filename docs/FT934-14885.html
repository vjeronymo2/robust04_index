			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions behind 49% rise at Seton Healthcare ACQUISITIONS helped Seton Healthcare, the medical products and sports equipment group, increase pre-tax profits by 49 per cent to Pounds 3.18m in the six months to August 31. The Oldham-based group, which came to the market in 1990, increased sales by 25 per cent to Pounds 22.2m. Underlying sales growth of UK healthcare products was 9 per cent, but the group said this was partly depressed by a policy of ending discounts and the second half was likely to show double-digit growth. Mr Ian Cater, chief executive, said: 'September was the best month we've ever had.' The healthcare division lifted sales by 30 per cent to Pounds 19.7m, mainly because of acquisitions. Including these, sales to the UK pharmacy and community sector advanced by 64 per cent, compared with increases of 5 per cent to UK hospitals and 7 per cent in exports. Operating profits rose from Pounds 2.14m to Pounds 2.87m. The group made considerable progress in the integration of Cupal, the Blackburn-based manufacturer of over-the-counter medicines, acquired last December for Pounds 8.2m. The workforce had been reduced from 150 to 85 and the sales forces had been merged to provide a team of 23, calling regularly on more than 7,000 independent retail pharmacies and multiple chains. Mr Cater said Cupanol, the paracetamol-based children's medicine for pain and fever relief, was selling well and would be heavily promoted in the autumn. The group was also developing new wound and bandaging products. The sports and leisure division saw flat sales of Pounds 2.55m, and operating profits slightly up at Pounds 348,000. Although conditions on the high street were difficult, the group said it had recently launched a sports care range and would benefit from any improvement in trading. Gearing at the half-year was down from 80 to 21 per cent, following a Pounds 13.1m rights issue in November. Mr Cater said the group wanted to continue growing by acquisition in its core areas. Earnings per share rose by 22 per cent to 7.2p (5.9p). The interim dividend is 1.9p (1.7p). COMMENT Seton quoted Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, to the effect that 'self-medication is an idea whose time has come'. With the wind blowing so strongly from that quarter, Seton's focus on OTC medicines seems timely, and the group has built an impressive position in a market which is forecast to increase by 50 per cent by 2000. The group has grown its previous acquisitions well and the integration of Cupal suggests it also enjoying benefits of scale on manufacturing and distribution. Forecast full-year profits of just over Pounds 8m put the shares, up 9p yesterday to 310p, on a prospective multiple of 17. That premium rating is justified by the group's impressive track record since flotation at 130p per share, although any further advance will be limited by its need to fund significant acquisitions with more paper.</p>

			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NOT FOR JOB CORPS  </P> <P> "What is it exactly that makes (Mt. Laguna) unsuitable" for a Job Corps  Training Center? posed Sheila A. Sada in her letter to the editor April 15.  </P> <P> Perhaps, the most important, bottom-line answer: extraordinary cost to  taxpayers.  </P> <P> The site chosen is located on the top of a mountain in the Cleveland National  Forest, at 6,000 feet, where temperatures frequently fall below freezing and  winds often reach 100 m.p.h. One can expect building and operating costs for  year-round heating, transportation and power to be excessive. The U.S. Forest  Service proposes to renovate the gutted Air Force buildings, removing asbestos,  PCBs and lead paint: another great cost to taxpayers.  </P> <P> The Job Corps complex (estimated population 400) will need to build its own  sewage treatment facility, find a reliable water source, generate its own power  and establish self-sufficient support services, such as medical care, fire  protection, law enforcement, child care and entertainment.  </P> <P> Community services in the tiny village of Mt. Laguna (population 75) are  essentially non-existent. All food, trash, clothing, waste chemicals/toxics  will need to be trucked in/out from 40-50 miles away, using a winding mountain  road that is often closed in the winter. Additional taxpayer funds will be  required for road maintenance and patrol due to the increased year-round,  non-recreational traffic.  </P> <P> With so many military bases closing around the country, there is no shortage of  cost-effective facilities located in established communities that could benefit  economically from a large Job Corps complex.  </P> <P> NADINE SIDRICK  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

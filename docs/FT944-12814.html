			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Architecture: David and the car goliath - Colin Amery outlines Florentine designs for a second renaissance When I think of Florence, I still think of the Flood. On November 4, 1966 the River Arno burst its banks and threatened - indeed destroyed - some of the finest art treasures and buildings of the Italian Renaissance. In recent years Florence has been threatened and damaged by less obvious but equally damaging floods, those of cars and tourists. Any summer visitor to the city will know that it is now impossible to see through the barricade of back-packs and shorts to the pictures on the walls of the Uffizi gallery. It is impossible to penetrate the city centre by car during the day, and there is no chance of a photograph of a Florentine architectural masterpiece without a foreground of massed cars. However, in London at present you can see exactly what the authorities of Florence are planning to do for their troubled city in the next decade. Their plans are on show at the Italian Institute in Belgrave Square until November 25 (Mondays to Fridays, 10am-5pm). The problems of Florence are common to many historic towns and cities of Europe, and it seems fitting to look to the city that produced Dante, Giotto, Michelangelo, Leonardo, Galileo and Brunelleschi to see if it can now produce the right answers for the 21st century. For a start there is honesty in the admission of the Florentine authorities that the last 30 years have been ones of inactivity, indecision and internecine fighting between the city centre, the shopkeepers, the hotel owners and the ill-planned suburbs. This constant struggle has been enlivened by the daily arrival of 80,000 cars, as well as the annual arrival of 7m tourists. When he spoke in London last week, Alfredo Franchini, Florence's councillor for urban planning, announced the city's approval of a completely new master-plan, produced by Marcello Vittorini. Franchini showed a touching faith in rationalism and in planning itself. But it is important to realise that the master-plan is not a ruthless grid of geometry thrown over a dying city. In fact, studied carefully, the Vittorini plan is a gentle adoption of many of the qualities that have made cities work in the past. He appears to believe, thank heaven, in the value of mixed development. All the best cities in the world are an effective mix of homes, workplaces and cultural and leisure activities. The idea of strict zoning has long been discredited. Urban qualities are hard to define, but we recognise them when we see them. With its remarkable skyline and carefully controlled scale within the surrounding hills, the centre of Florence both works and is beautiful. But it has a declining population. Only 400,000 people live in the centre, and the prediction is that numbers will continue to decline. The problem is to make historic centres attractive to residents as well as to tourists. Two important influences are already changing Florence, and there are vital lessons here for London and other declining cities. Alarm at the level of atmospheric pollution forced the passing of a law to ban cars that are not fitted with catalytic converters or carrying fewer than three people from the city centre. Second, realising the inevitability of some cars, Florence has embarked on the expensive but necessary provision of underground car parks. The most significant changes in the city are likely to be in an area largely owned by Fiat, known as Novoli, to the north-west of the historic centre. Under the master-plan it is proposed to devolve many of the city's essential services - town halls, libraries, smaller museums, banks and sports centres  -to five new 'boroughs'. Novoli will be one of these, and the fact that a large part of it is in the single ownership of Fiat - it was once a large components factory - has eased the planning process. The Fiat-Novoli plan has been prepared by the influential urbanist Leon Krier, who has planned a large area, about 1,000 acres, dividing it into 14 urban sections. Each of these sections will feature a rich mixture of uses, and will regenerate in an imaginative way the run-down high-rise housing and demolish much of the disastrous detritus of the 1960s. As the centrepiece of the redevelopment, the plans show a 30-acre park and some 90 acres of new buildings. Wisely it includes major new public buildings for the university and the courts of justice. Krier's work for Florence, which the city authorities believe has a touch of genius about it, revives the architectural and planning traditions of Florence, for each of the 14 sections will have a central piazza. The ground and first floors of all new buildings will be given over to shops and commercial uses, and residential premises will be on the upper floors. Comprehensive building codes set out the guidelines for the city. No ordinary buildings should be higher than four storeys, and the use of stone is to be encouraged for the ground floors and for the entire facades of the more monumental public buildings. Fiat is an enlightened client, and it has instructed the Turin-based architects Gabetti and Isola to turn the plan and the codes into real buildings. There is a sense of excitement and creativity about these plans, and they have won international support. If they are followed comprehensively there is a real chance that Florence will achieve a second renaissance that will make it a city for the 21st century that respects its finest architectural traditions. Once again Florence has become a city to watch. The Accademia Italiana has organised a public conference on the Florence plan in London on November 23. Tickets and details, tel: 071-235 0303.</p>

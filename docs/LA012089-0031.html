			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FALL-OFF IN BUSINESS GIVING  </P> <P> A new study by the Conference Board reveals a leveling off of corporate  charitable giving even as profits have been on the increase. The figures  reflect continued emphasis on education and a continued decline in support for  health and human services -- a trend that has compounded the problems of  social-service agencies that have been the targets of significant government  cuts during the Reagan Administration. Yet the prospects are not as gloomy as  the figures suggest.  </P> <P> The study covers the year 1987. Preliminary indications suggest that 1988  figures will reflect an increase, with a major rebound likely this year.  </P> <P> A survey of 328 leading corporations showed an increase in contributions of  less than 5% in 1987, compared with annual increases of more than 10% in the  previous decade. When the giving of all companies -- large and small -- is  counted, the total for 1987 is the same as for 1986.  </P> <P> The 328 leading companies gave educational institutions 37% of their  contributions, health and human services 27%, civic and community activities  14%, the arts 11%, and a variety of other interests 11%. Education has  maintained a relatively stable share of the total giving, but the percentage  for health and human services has been declining for 10 years.  </P> <P> "The survey also finds that during 1987 increases in corporate profits  significantly outpaced rises in contribution budgets," the board reported. "One  example: While the manufacturing companies reported an aggregate increase of  20% in corporate profits in 1987, their contribution budgets rose by 4%. The  result, of course, was a dip in the ratio of contributions to pretax income."  </P> <P> The pattern of giving has been made somewhat unpredictable by reorganizations,  mergers and leveraged buyouts. In 1986, for example, RJR-Nabisco gave its  corporate headquarters office building in North Carolina to Wake Forest  University, a gift valued at $40 million. And in 1987, after General Electric  swallowed RCA, it gave the Sarnoff Laboratories in New Jersey to SRI  International, a donation valued at $90 million.  </P> <P> Research by the Council for Financial Aid to Education suggests a "pronounced  upturn in 1989 of 5% to 10%," we were told by Hayden W. Smith, senior vice  president. Indeed, his analysis suggests that the plateau in giving has just  been a delayed reaction to the decline in corporate profits that began in 1980.  Profits did not regain the level at which they had peaked in 1979 until 1987.  Despite falling profits, there had been an unprecedented increase in corporate  giving, doubling from 1979 to 1986. That represented an increase in giving from  less than 1% of pretax profits in 1979 to 1.99% of pretax profits in 1985.  Profits are now setting new records, up 30% in the last two years, inspiring  projections of significant increases in corporate giving this year.  </P></p>

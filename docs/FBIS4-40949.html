			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian Supreme Court's Military Collegium is to  continue the trial of one of the 1991 coup leaders Valentin  Varennikov, a spokesman for the Military Collegium confirmed in  an interview with Interfax on Monday. Varennikov faces charges  of high treason and conspiring with the aim of seizing power.    Varennikov is the only leader of the 1991 coup, who did not  agree to being granted political amnesty, announced by the State  Duma on February 23, 1994, and who demanded that the trial be  continued. The cases against the other defendants were  terminated.    Varennikov denied all charges brought against him during the  preliminary investigation and in court. His interests will be  represented by lawyer Dmitriy Shteynberg.    Shteynberg's request for terminating the case in the absence  of any criminal content in Varennikov's actions, was turned  down, because only the court may take such a decision.    Among the witnesses who are expected to appear in court are  former commander in chief of the Soviet airborne troops  Vladislav Achalov, Russia's Deputy Defense Minister Boris  Gromov, former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev and former  Soviet defense minister Dmitriy Yazov.    The hearings will be chaired by Major-General Viktor Yaskin.</p>

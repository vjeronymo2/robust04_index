			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 10 Jun (DPA) -- Foreign Minister Miguel  Angel Burelli Rivas said today Haitian refugees will not come to  his country, and that topic "has only existed in the imagination  of some."    The foreign minister acknowledged the U.S. Government had  made a request to Venezuela to accept a group of refugees, but  they will definitely not be received. "We have sufficient  poverty and masses of uninvited immigrants here who are causing  us problems, and we are not going to increase those problems  with groups of foreigners," Burelli Rivas indicated.    Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom also commented on this  matter, stating Venezuela cannot be tasked with resolving the  problems of the peoples of other countries. The official added  that "all the immigrants who want to cannot enter our country,  only those who are part of a selective immigration program based  on the national interest."    Opposing the arrival of refugees are political and social  sectors, including the Senate Foreign Policy Committee. Through  its chairwoman, Haydee Castillo, the Committee indicated on  Tuesday that "the country does not have the economic and social  conditions to receive those persons."</p>

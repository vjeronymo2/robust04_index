During talks in Bonn  with his Syrian counterpart Faruq al-Shar', Kinkel said that an  act of terror carried out by one Israeli extremist could not be  allowed to bury the prospects for peace and stability in the  Middle East in the long term.    Syria should resume its bilateral talks with Israel as well  as take part in the multilateral negotiations. The German  Government was ready to help stabilize the situation by giving  reconstruction aid to Palestinian areas and Lebanon as well as  to support an international presence if necessary. The German  Foreign Ministry says the Syrian foreign minister stressed that  his country has taken a constructive position regarding the  Middle East peace process.</p>

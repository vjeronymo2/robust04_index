			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Swiss Banking (10): Pressure to consolidate - The future of regional and cantonal banks Switzerland's regional and cantonal banks continue to bear the brunt of the pressure for consolidation in the country's banking industry. Both sectors are now taking on new shapes to try to secure places in an increasingly compet- itive, liberalised environment. The regional and cantonal banks (the latter are owned and guaranteed by cantonal govern- ments) have long played a role in the country's economic life that goes beyond their size. At the end of 1993, the cantonal banks accoun- ted for just over a fifth of all banks' total assets, the regional banks 6.8 per cent. But together, they provided more mortgage loans than the big universal banks that accounted for half of the industry's total assets. They are also key lenders to small and medium-sized businesses, bringing a local sensitivity to the needs of entrepreneurs that the larger national institutions sometimes lack. However, excessive lending by many of these institutions in the easygoing 1980s led to a refinancing squeeze in the early 1990s when the Swiss National Bank pushed up short- term interest rates to over 9 per cent. The collapse of a small regional bank, the Spar-und Leihkasse Thun, in October 1991 roused the Swiss to realise that this squeeze had reached crisis proportions. The number of reg- ional banks tumbled from 185 at the time of the Thun collapse to 138 in February of this year. In the wake of the Thun affair, the banking fraternity, concerned about the international image of the Swiss financial centre, put in place a rescue net to prevent further fiascoes. All the subsequent departures have been either due to agreed mergers or takeovers by other regional banks or by one of the big universal banks. However, this trend did not augur well for the future of the regional bank movement. Last February, the sector's leaders tried to stop the rot by proposing a new central organisation. It would aim at improving the competitiveness of member banks by pooling their efforts in both financial and infrastructure services. Even more important, a central surveillance body would root out the problem cases, providing the public with an assurance of the soundness of the member banks. The plan was widely welcomed, but even as members were being canvassed, more were being gobbled up. By the time RBA Holding, the main central body, was formed in September, only 98 banks with combined assets of SFr45bn were willing and able to participate. A few weeks later, RBA-Finanz, the surveillance body, was set up and has been examining problem cases. By the end of the year, the old Union of Regional Banks will be dissolved. Of those not joining the new RBA group, a few believe they can carry on alone, but others are likely to disappear in the near future. The next steps are the creation of central financial and infrastructure service organ- isations, which will enable the organisation to be up and running at the beginning of next year. Among cantonal banks, the same trends can be seen. The Berner Kantonalbank has been the sector's biggest disaster case, having made large loans to fugitive bankrupt financier Werner K. Rey in the 1980s. The cantonal government had to inject new capital last year to prevent the bank from collapsing. This year, the Solothurner Kantonalbank has been in difficulty, and for the first time, a private sector bank, Swiss Bank Corporation, has made a bid to rescue it. The cantonal government and parliament have approved the sale, recognising that it would cost SFr1.2bn to restructure it. In the usual Swiss way, the people of Solothurn were to vote on the SBC bid on December 4. Other cantonal governments, notably that of Zurich, are beginning to wonder if there is still any need for them to back a bank, raising the possibility of more privatisations in the near future. Early this year, the two Geneva cantonal institutions, Banque hypothecaire du canton de Geneve and Caisse d'epargne de la Republique et canton de Geneve, merged, creating an institution with total assets of SFr14.7bn as at the end of 1993. In the canton of Vaud, Banque Cantonale Vaudoise and Credit Foncier Vaudois agreed in October to merge next year, creating Switzer- land's fifth largest bank with total assets of some SFr30bn and strengthening the position of Lausanne as a regional financial centre. Like the regional banks, the cantonal banks are trying to cut costs and improve services through pooling of resources. Up to now, there have been various ad hoc groupings for various purposes, but analysts expect two constellations gradually to clarify. One, for German-speaking Switzerland, will be built around the huge Zurcher Kantonalbank, which had total assets of SFr52.5bn at the end of 1993, and the other around the Banque Canton- ale Vaudoise.</p>

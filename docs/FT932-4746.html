			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Technology: Slowly acquiring a thicker skin - Four years after the Exxon Valdez disaster, the route to safer tankers is not all plain sailing Standing on the vast deck of a 300,000-tonne supertanker and peering into one of its cavernous, 27m-deep cargo holds, you quickly form a chilling impression of the enormous quantity of crude oil that can be spilled into the sea when such a large ship is ruptured. As accidents such as the foundering of the Braer off the Shetland Islands in January this year and the running aground of the Exxon Valdez off Alaska in 1989 showed, the results can be calamitous for the local environment. Next month, however, a significant step will be taken in the quest for safe, or at least safer, oil tankers. Under new rules made by the International Maritime Organisation (a UN-backed body that sets safety standards for world shipping), all supertankers commissioned from that date will have to be double-hulled - that is, have a two-layer outer skin that will make the oil carriers more resistant to collision or grounding. The rule seems to make sense. A Very Large Crude Carrier, or VLCC, is a gigantic, internally sectioned, flat-bottomed steel barrel with a large engine at the stern and a relatively small superstructure to house the computers and the handful of humans required to load, sail, manoeuvre and discharge it. Doubling the outer casing of the barrel should significantly increase its ability to withstand puncture. But the move to develop 'environmentally-friendly' oil tankers is not all plain sailing. First, some shipowners say double-hulled tankers may not reduce spillages in big supertanker accidents. Second, they are more expensive to build and operate than traditional single-hulled, or even double-bottomed tankers, which has made many oil companies and shippers reluctant to charter them. The Odense Steel Shipyard, owned by the big Danish group A P Moller, this year delivered the world's first two double-hulled VLCCs, out of six it is building for Maersk Tankers, another A P Moller company. The 300,000-tonne Eleo Maersk and Elizabeth Maersk carry their ballast in the minimum 3m-wide space that runs between outer and inner hulls. The builders say the 344m-long ships are designed to have levels of resistance to breaches and to 'raking damage' - the opening of the bottom of the ship - up to 25 per cent greater than IMO specifications. But no-one is arguing that the advent of the double-hulled tanker will mean an end to supertanker disasters. In fact, says Ola Lorentzon, chief executive of Sweden's ICB Shipping, it is doubtful that oil spills would have been avoided in any of the world's most notorious tanker accidents if the ships had been equipped with double hulls. 'In the case of the Exxon Valdez, it wouldn't have made any difference if it had been double-hulled, according to what I understand from the experts,' he says. His point, not denied by shipbuilders, is that even a double-hulled ship could not withstand the force involved in driving fully laden onto rocks. Lorentzon sees the new regulations on double-hulled ships as deriving mainly from political demands for action after spectacular accidents. He wonders whether the extra money to be spent on building double-hulled tankers - which are 15 to 20 per cent more expensive than a standard single hull tanker, costing around Dollars 85m (Pounds 56.3m) - could be better spent on other anti-pollution measures. According to A P Moller, tanker accidents account for only 5 per cent of all oil pollution at sea. Tanker operations account for 7 per cent, while 14 per cent comes from other shipping and 61 per cent from industrial waste. At present, only 14 of the 51 VLCCs under construction worldwide are double-hulled, but the new regulations mean that soon any replacements for the world's 450-strong VLCC fleet will have to be to the new specification. This brings up another complaint that unites shipbuilders and operators  - that double-hulled tankers are, in effect, discriminated against. Many charges, such as port fees, are levied on the volume of a ship. A double-hulled tanker inevitably has greater volume than a single-hulled vessel and can cost up to 20 per cent more in port fees. The complaint extends to single-hulled tankers with segregated ballast tanks. Segregated ballast tanks were made compulsory on all tankers built after 1980 to cut down on pollution from the flushing of oil-contaminated ballast - a leading source of oil pollution. A growing number of old tankers is likely to be de-commissioned in the next few years because of the difficulty of meeting increasingly stringent standards. Nevertheless, more than half the VLCCs now at sea were built in the 1970s and there remains a financial incentive to operate old 'dirty' tankers rather than more modern ships. 'A major part of the oil industry is still looking for the cheapest freight, regardless of the environmental aspects,' says Tommy Thomsen, vice-president of A P Moller. 'So far, society has chosen not to reward environmentally-friendly tankers.'</p>

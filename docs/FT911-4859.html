			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Government may take a share - British Technology Group THE GOVERNMENT is considering taking a golden share in the British Technology Group, the government's agency for backing inventors, to prevent asset stripping by a future buyer. Mr Edward Leigh, a junior industry minister, said yesterday that privatisation of the group, which masterminds the transfer of technology into commercial operations, would include measures to prevent a purchaser from asset stripping, or from ceasing to carry on BTG's transfer technology activities. This could be ensured either through the articles of assoc-iation of the privatised company or through the sale contract with the buyer. 'We intend to privatise this organisation in such a way that its integrity and independence will be preserved,' Mr Leigh said. He also announced that the Committee of Vice Chancellors and Principals was interested in taking a 'small but not negligible stake in the private company'. During the debate, MPs from all parties expressed anxiety that privatisation of BTG could put at stake its 8,000 patents from universities, polytech-nics and research instit-utes. Sir Gerard Vaughan (C Reading East) said he did not believe the minister had given sufficient safeguards for the future of the organis-ation. Sir Gerard said it ran the risk of being taken over by a 'huge industrial concern, almost certainly from overseas', whose sole objective would be to take over BTG's patents and use them for its own commercial advan-tage. Mr Jeremy Bray, the opposition technology spokesman, accused the government of having no clear idea of what it wanted to do with BTG or with the process of technology transfer.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Berlusconi Satisfied After First Day </F> of Government-Formation Talks"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 2 -- Premier-designate Silvio  Berlusconi was "very satisfied" with the "constructive stance"  of union leaders whom he met on the first day of his  government-formation consultations, Forza Italia spokesman  Antonio Tajani said Monday [2 May].    Union leaders also emerged from their talks with Berlusconi  in buoyant mood: "I feel reassured," said Bruno Trentin,  national secretary of the leftist CGIL [Italian General  Confederation of Labor] union. "There could have been a head-on  collision, but there was not."    Sergio D'Antoni, head of CISL [Italian Confederation of  Trade  Unions], welcomed the fact that Berlusconi had begun his  government-formation talks with the unions: "Things may be  coming up roses. This is a good start, that's for sure: we will  have to see whether it goes on like this," he commented.    UIL [Italian Federation of Trade Unions] chief Pietro  Larizza  said that the cost of labour accord hammered out last year had  been discussed at length, and that Berlusconi had promised that  "the deal will be respected in its contents and methods."    The union leaders, who did not give their approval to  Berlusconi's outline programme which has yet to be completed,  also pressed for more investment in industry, an industrial  policy which is closely linked to demand, and measures to  improve the labour market and professional training.    The prime minister designate, engaged tonight with Fiat  managing director Cesare Romiti in what he called a "meeting  between friends," told reporters he thought he might be ready to  present a government by next Monday.    He also confirmed he did not intend to split the Interior  Ministry in two to accommodate the demands of his Northern  League partners for a greater role in local administration.    Meanwhile League leader Umberto Bossi continued to insist  his  group be given control of that important ministerial post -- a  move that other political forces have warned they do not support  because they do not believe Bossi is "responsible" enough to  take on the sensitive job of supervising the nation's police and  security forces.</p>

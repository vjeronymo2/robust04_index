			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ZEPEDA COMES OFF BENCH TO LEAD SAN FERNANDO, 60-46  </P> <P> Entering the basketball season as a substitute, San Fernando High's Fernando  Zepeda figured it was a good idea to make himself noticed.  </P> <P> Zepeda scored a game-high 17 points to pace San Fernando to a 60-46 nonleague  win over host Birmingham on Monday afternoon, the season opener for both teams.  </P> <P> "Fernando was a surprise today," Tiger Coach Dick Crowell said. "His stock  certainly went up."  </P> <P> San Fernando (1-0) led, 26-24, at halftime before going on a 17-8 run in the  third quarter. George Garcia finished with 14 points and Gabe Vidana scored 12  for the Tigers.  </P> <P> Birmingham (0-1) was led by sophomore Glenn Lyles, who scored a team-high 11  points. Kevin Horton added 11 rebounds and six points for the Braves. In other  nonleague games:  </P> <P> Marshall 58, Van Nuys 47 -- Jahmin Assa scored 27 points and grabbed 13  rebounds and teammate Thamh Diep added 10 points for Marshall in the opener for  both teams at Van Nuys.  </P> <P> Sylmar 45, Verdugo Hills 35 -- In a low-scoring opener for both teams, Sylmar  used a 12-point halftime advantage to coast to a nonleague victory.  </P> <P> The Spartans (1-0) were led by 6-foot-4 senior forward Brandon McBride, who  scored 14 points and grabbed nine rebounds, and senior point guard Kim Shostle  (14 points). The low offensive output left second-year Coach Larry Link  worried.  </P> <P> "We have to find some offense," Link said. "We've got to find somebody who can  score some points. If Brandon keeps out of foul trouble, he can score in  there."  </P> <P> Sylmar will play in the Simi Valley tournament Thursday.  </P> <P> "We may get blown out of the gym four times," Link said. "But it will be good  practice for us with regards to our conference."  </P> <P> BOYS' SOCCER  </P> <P> San Fernando 5, Monroe 1 -- Oscar Arevalo scored two goals and Gadial Palomo,  Fabian Galvin and Hector Molina scored one each for host San Fernando (1-0) in  a nonleague game.  </P> <P> North Hollywood 3, San Pedro 1 -- Walter Cordova, Oswaldo Vega and Ramiro Vega  each scored one goal for North Hollywood (1-0) at San Pedro in a nonleague  game.  </P> <P> Birmingham 2, Westchester 0 -- Tony Serpas scored two goals and goalies Andy  Sherman and Willie Palacios recorded the shutout for Birmingham in a nonleague  opener for both teams.  </P> <P> GIRLS' BASKETBALL  </P> <P> Birmingham 47, San Fernando 37 -- Tracie Harris scored 19 points and Dorrie  Chang added 11 as Birmingham won a nonleague season opener for both schools at  San Fernando.  </P></p>

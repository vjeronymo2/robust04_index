The exiled spiritual leader of  Tibet's Buddhists accepted the award in Norway two days ago. The Dalai Lama  fled the Himalayan country in 1959 after an abortive uprising put down by  Chinese troops. The Chinese government portrays him as a separatist who incites  anti-Chinese sentiment in Tibet.  </P></p>

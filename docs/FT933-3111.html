			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / International Company News: Sharp increase in foreign investment by US funds US FUND managers indulged in a 'a minor tidal wave' of international investment in the first half of this year, compounding the process by which national barriers are breaking down in the world's financial markets, according to a leading analyst of institutional investment. A report issued by InterSec Research Corporation*, a US-based consultancy which specialises in monitoring asset allocation by fund managers, claims that there has been a surge in the purchase of overseas bonds and equities by institutions such as pension funds. InterSec reports that the total value of US tax-exempt assets with international and global mandates rose by nearly Dollars 50bn in the first half of 1993, from Dollars 154bn to almost Dollars 200bn. This investment is a sharp increase on US fund managers' investments overseas in 1992, which saw an increase over the whole year of only Dollars 30bn. The report suggests that some of the increase may have been due to the strength of overseas equity and bond markets. But although this may have been responsible for a significant proportion of the investment, InterSec says that net cash flows (new money less withdrawals) still amounted to Dollars 18bn in the first half. 'This is an unprecedented mid-year number,' the report says. '1992's net flows for the entire year were an all-time high of Dollars 22bn.' US fund managers have traditionally been more conservative than their European and Japanese counterparts when considering whether to make investments overseas. About 8 per cent of Japanese pension fund assets are invested outside Japan, while 26 per cent of UK assets are invested in non-UK markets. However, analysts anticipate that interest in non-domestic investments will grow faster in the US than in other countries. The report claims that there were signs in the first six months of this year of a larger proportion of US fund managers' money being invested in equities than had been the case in 1992. Of the net new money allocated to active international and global mandates in the first six months of this year, only 18 per cent went into fixed-income mandates. At the end of 1992, the market share of fixed-income investments was 23 per cent, while equities absorbed the remaining 77 per cent. The general increase in international asset allocation has strong implications for currency market dealing. Banks dealing in foreign exchange find they are making increasingly large returns by managing the exposure of internationally-held assets to exchange rate movements. *InterSec Research Corporation, 66 Gatehouse Road, Stamford, Connecticut 06902</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gennadiy Aleksandrov under the ``Money Can't Buy </F> Everything'' rubric: ``The Magnificent Six'']    [Text] ``Treated at no charge -- treated to no purpose.''  This homespun sentence, popular in the recent socialist past,  was evidently first spoken by some humorist after vain attempts  to restore his health at a public hospital. And it was  immediately seized by the broad masses of patients and  physicians: Both knew that you can only hope for qualified and  quality medical care after you transfer some amount of good  cognac from a slack wine store to the physician's office.    Now other times have come upon us, and one of the main  achievements of socialism, free medicine, is gradually lowing  its position in favor of medical care requiring payment.    Well, many of our fellow country women know what it means to  give birth for free in a conventional Soviet -- I beg your  pardon -- Russian maternity hospital. But if it were for money?  Would it really be more pleasant?    An employee of the Medilyuks, a medical cooperative that I  randomly selected from a directory and that is affiliated with  the Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Perinatology Scientific Center,  who wishes to remain anonymous shared the following information.    The Medilyuks rents a building at the center. The  cooperative  has single- and double-occupancy rooms. There is one nurse and  two physicians for every four women. There is one pediatric  nurse and physician for every four infants. Each infant  compartment contains one newborn.    And in the center's free-care department, women lie  literally  up against the wall in six- to eight-bed rooms, each infant  compartment holds six infants, and there is one physician and  two nurses for 40 women giving birth and one physician and one  nurse for 40 infants.    Among the other advantages of births for payment, the  Medilyuks workers list single-use instruments. But the bed  linens are laundered in the common laundry center. In the  cooperative there are individual meals at a a cost of about  1,000 rubles a day (of that amount, 200 rubles goes for the  cook's salary), and food is bought to the room.    But the main thing is that here births occur in a separate  room in the presence of a physician, midwife, hospital  attendant, and anesthesiologist. The medical personnel, as my  anonymous informant emphasized, have had at least 12 years of  work experience. The physicians are all candidates and doctors  of medicine from the very same Scientific Center. They ``treat''  in their off time.    And now about prices. First visits, depending on the  physician's academic degree, cost a mother-to-be about 3,000 to  3,500 rubles. Repeat visits are less expensive -- only  2,000-2,500. Service for the course of a week in cases of  physiological (that is, normal) births costs 150,000 rubles. In  cases of pathological births and cesarean section, the cost is  50 percent higher. But a mother giving birth will remain in the  hospital for 10-11 days.    ``Is this really expensive?'' the cooperative employee asked  me. If you consider the mad course of the dollar, of course it  isn't. Normal births cost on the order of 150 ``greenbacks.''  But if you take the average Russia salary, not exactly every  woman will be lining up at the Medilyuks. But in actuality there  is a line. The cooperative can only service six women giving  birth at a time -- that is the number of beds.    Not every woman can end up as part of the ``magnificent  six'': Only women who have reached their 37th week of pregnancy  and who have no type of infection can enter the Medilyuks. And  if you are a woman who has some pathology and there is no  guarantee of a live birth, you cannot give birth in the  cooperative for any amount of money. In the normal way and in  the public hospital, please.    It seems that the receiving physicians do not want to risk  the name of their precious enterprise. And indeed, I repeat that  they are the same people who deliver babies during the day free  of charge as employees of the government medical institution.  Two or three shifts in the cooperative can cover their monthly  government salary.    According to this scheme, free medicine is doomed to  obscurity. But medical care requiring payment does not offer any  guarantees. Everything will still be ``as with them.'' Really,  people turn to medical offices requiring payment in the hope of  receiving the full attention and qualified assistance of a  physician -- something they are deprived of in government  polyclinics and hospitals. They go there, and they meet the very  same specialists. This is all strange....But it is nevertheless  necessary to give birth. ``Think for yourself, decide for  yourself'' when and how.</p>

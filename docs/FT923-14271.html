			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / UK Company News: An automatic initiative to take on Goliath  -Andrew Baxter on how Control Techniques plans to attack a global mass market THERE IS nothing wrong with being ambitious, but some western industrialists who have seen their markets hammered by Japanese competition might think Mr Trevor Wheatley and Control Techniques have gone too far. Mr Wheatley, chairman of the Powys-based controls and drives producer, is about to attack a mass market of fundamental importance to the development of factory automation but one where the UK has been conspicuous for its absence - except, as so often happens in engineering, in the pioneering years of the 1950s and 1960s. This autumn, two years after CT bought Cranfield Precision Systems, it will start shipping a product that it hopes will put the British flag on a map dominated by powerful Japanese, US and continental European companies - the world market for computer numerical control (CNC) equipment used to run machine tools. The story has all the hallmarks of a David and Goliath encounter, with no guarantee of a similar ending. Control Techniques is no minnow - sales could reach Pounds 100m this year - but recognises it faces a tough challenge against far larger companies, Fanuc of Japan and Siemens of Germany. Fanuc has about 50 per cent of the world market, while Siemens is market leader in Europe and credited by many European machine tool builders for polishing up its act in recent years. And Allen-Bradley, the CNC supplier owned by Rockwell of the US, hopes that with a new product range it will regain market share lost over the past decade. According to the UK head of one big rival producer, therefore, CT 'would be better to concentrate on a niche rather than take us on head-on.' However, Mr Terry Margetts, Cranfield's sales and marketing manager, says he would like to see CT being number one in the European market in five years time. 'It will mean a lot of work, but it's not impossible,' he says. The CT initiative raises some questions: is it launching too late into the mass CNC market, or right to take the plunge in the middle of a worldwide machine tool recession, and, most importantly, does it have the right product? Mr Wheatley robustly defends the initiative. First, he says, it was important for CT to have a CNC range to accompany drives and servos that are increasingly bought in a package by machine tool builders. As such, the CNC launch caps an acquisition programme that began with Soprel, the Italian servo drive company, and Moore Reed, the UK brushless motor producer, before CT took over the Cranfield company in 1990. Secondly, CT genuinely believes it has come up with something different. Its new flexible numerical control (FNC) technology has been developed as a mass-market product from Cranfield's existing, highly sophisticated CNC equipment. According to Mr Margetts, CT found that while there was still a market for Cranfield's highly-specialised 16-axis control, the machinery industry overall was crying out for a low-cost but flexible approach where optional extras are standard, and end-users have the power to customise their system whenever and however they wished. 'We now have a highly competitive total package to offer to the machine tool industry,' says Mr Wheatley. CT is gambling that the machine tool industry and its customers will like FNC enough to specify it in preference to other CNC technology. In its favour is the Cranfield name, and the fact that there are already plenty of big users of its existing top-of-the range system. Machine tool builders are often willing to switch CNC systems if a customer requests it, so long as there are no technical obstacles. The recession, too, could even have a beneficial effect on early sales of the FNC system, says Mr Wheatley. 'If you are a machine tool builder and you're not selling, you've got to look at every aspect of your machine. If we can offer a new product at a lower price or at a competitive price, he's going to take it.' Initially, the challenge for CT will be to win market acceptance for the product. One UK machine tool builder said it had no doubts about FNC's technical excellence, but felt it should wait a few years to see how the initiative developed before committing itself to a new supplier. A second problem for CT is the risk of being drawn into a price war by the larger concerns. CT plans to be competitive, but will also stress other factors such as UK delivery times of one to three days compared with seven weeks for some competitors. For a UK entrant to the market, CT also faces the need to develop overseas sales quickly without overstretching itself. The company is now working on engineering support and training for the European market, but Mr Wheatley says: 'We're not going to rush in. We'll select where we go, and the way we do business.' CT is discussing two deals, one in Germany and the other in the US, to supply FNC to electrical companies which offer part of the machine tool drive package but lack a CNC range. This, says Mr Wheatley, would be a way for CT to develop volume quickly. Along with the other acquisitions, the FNC initiative ought to enable CT's automation division to double or treble its Pounds 20m sales over the next two to three years, he says. CT now has the potential to sell a Pounds 10,000 package to machine tool builders, compared with Pounds 1,000 before its acquisitions programme. This could transform the shape of CT, which is selling its loss-making process control division to concentrate on automation, and motion control where it makes most of its profits. The bulk of the process control side has been bought by Coreci of France in a deal announced last month. This year, the City expects CT to make pre-tax profits of about Pounds 7m, up from Pounds 4.1m in 1991, on turnover boosted by the 1991 takeover of Emerson Electric's industrial control drives division. The US company gained a 29.9 per cent stake in CT in exchange. For the FNC initiative to succeed the company will have to do more than win technical plaudits from the machine tool industry. In the UK, Mr Margetts' plan to extol the virtues of buying British might strike a chord with machine tool builders worried about foreign dominance of the CNC equipment used on most metal cutting machine tools. 'The UK machine tool industry would welcome a British CNC producer,' said one potential customer. Buying it will be the acid test.</p>

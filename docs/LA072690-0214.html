			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWPORT MAN AND SONS CHARGED WITH DEFRAUDING BANKS  </P> <P> A Newport Beach man and his two sons will be arraigned next month on charges of  defrauding 13 banks and other financial institutions around the country of $8  million through a complex real estate scheme.  </P> <P> John M. Coughlan Sr., 74, was indicted on 17 counts of mail and wire fraud  Tuesday.  </P> <P> John M. Coughlan Jr., 54, of Long Beach and Errol Coughlan, 49, of Malibu were  indicted on the same charges.  </P> <P> The U.S. attorney's office has alleged that the men would borrow money for a  family construction business they claimed was working on various real estate  projects and use another of their companies -- Eagle Bonds &amp; Insurance  Brokers in Agoura -- to provide the bonds to back up those loans, assuring  lenders that their money was safe.  </P> <P> The indictment claims that the money -- obtained in the mid-1980s -- was not  used for construction but instead for the Coughlans' own enrichment, including  the purchase of three Rolls-Royces.  </P> <P> Attorneys for the Coughlans denied the charges.  </P> <P> "They intend to defend themselves vigorously," said Terry Christensen, attorney  for Errol and John Jr. "We feel this is based on years of misinformation and  misunderstanding, one assumption piled upon another."  </P> <P> Richard Kirschner, attorney for John Coughlan Sr., called the charges  "outrageous."  </P> <P> He said his client "was not an officer, not a director, (and) not a control  person" of either company.

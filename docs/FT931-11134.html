			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Oil rig builders warn of 3,000 more job losses OIL RIG fabricators warned yesterday that 3,000 jobs were expected to go in the next three months as work in the UK section of the North Sea continues to dry up. The number of workers employed by offshore fabricators, including sub-contractors, has halved to 10,000 since September, the Offshore Manufacturers' and Constructors' Association (OMCA) said yesterday. The association, along with representatives of North Sea oil and gas operators, met Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday, to warn of the possible devastation if the government interfered with gas-fired power station projects as part of its energy review. 'We expressed fears of an exodus of oil industry investment to other parts of the world,' said Mr Harold Hughes, director-general of the UK Offshore Operators Association, which has said 55,000 offshore and support jobs are at risk if new gas projects do not go ahead. A trade and industry select committee recently suggested that the government look very carefully at approving further gas-fired power stations and consider restricting gas-fired generators to supplying peak electricity demand. The OMCA warned job losses would be greater and that some construction yards would face extinction if coal jobs were to be protected at the expense of gas production. Mr Bill Allison, its chief executive, said: 'In the long term 3,000 permanent jobs  - on top of the 3,000 expected to go in the next three months  - could be lost by fabricators alone if the committee's recommendations are accepted.' Mr Arthur McQuillan, general manager of Amec Offshore, said the company's Tyneside Yard had already halved its workforce to 2,000. Mr Jim Franklin, managing director of McDermott Scotland, said it had employed 3,500 at its peak last year but expected to reduce its labour force to less than 100 by April.</p>

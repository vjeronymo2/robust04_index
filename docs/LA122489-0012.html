			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEAR AND REALITY  </P> <P> I was truly incensed at the statement that immigrants will not become  Americans. We are Americans before we ever get here, because Mexico, Guatemala,  El Salvador, Colombia and Peru are all America, the American continent.  </P> <P> Who gave Anglos permission to settle in Massachusetts and Virginia? God? Well,  God told us to come here, too, thank you very much, with the difference that  Mexicans did not "come" from anywhere but were here since way before Plymouth  Rock.  </P> <P> Maybe now the Anglos will get a taste of how the Indians felt.  </P> <P> ANTONIO BERNAL, Montebello  </P></p>

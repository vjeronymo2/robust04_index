			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Hiroaki Ito] </F>   [Text] Washington, 19 Apr -- According to a senior White  House official and U.S. Government sources, the U.S. Government  has decided to hold a Japan-U.S. summit between President  Clinton and a successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in  Naples on 7 July immediately before the annual summit of the  Group of Seven [G-7] industrialized nations to be held there.  The U.S. Government will begin final coordination on the  Japan-U.S. summit meeting after the new administration is  inaugurated in Japan.    The next Japan-U.S. summit meeting was originally regarded  as  the deadline for drawing up agreements on all the sectors in the  economic framework talks. However, since the framework talks  were virtually broken off in February, the schedule is expected  to be greatly delayed. Because both Japanese and U.S.  Governments believe that "the next Japan-U.S. summit meeting  will serve as a major turning point in efforts for the economic  framework talks," they intend to seek the resumption of the  economic framework talks and agreements on the three priority  sectors -- namely, automobile and auto parts; government  procurement; and insurance -- at least before the Japan-U.S.  summit meeting.    It has so far been believed that the Japan-U.S. summit will  take place before the Naples summit of G-7 leaders. There was  speculation that the Japanese prime minister would visit the  United States to hold summit talks with the U.S. President on  his way to Naples. In response to the U.S. request, the  Japanese Government and the new prime minister will make a final  decision on the schedule for the Japan-U.S. summit after the new  administration is inaugurated.</p>

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: R. J. Reynolds enters cigarette price war in US R. J. REYNOLDS, the domestic US tobacco arm of the R. J. R. Nabisco food and cigarettes group, is to match the large price-cuts in full-priced cigarette brands that its big rival, Philip Morris, announced earlier this month. Reynolds said yesterday it would slash the price of its Winston brand by Dollars 4 a carton, or 40 cents a packet. It would also apply 'increased promotional activity' to its Camel brand, although it declined to be more specific. 'Frankly, we'd like to stay light on our feet,' Reynolds said. But the Reynolds cuts will apply to June only, and no other brands will participate. The company said yesterday it would reassess in late June. Winston is one of Reynolds' flagship brands and the one which competes most closely with Philip Morris' Marlboro. Camel is also a non-menthol, full-priced brand, although its total US market share, at around 4.1 per cent last year, was smaller than Winston's, taking close to 7 per cent. Philip Morris' decision to reduce the price of Marlboro, the best-selling US cigarette brand, by 40 cents a packet (from around Dollars 2.10-Dollars 2.20 to Dollars 1.70-Dollars 1.80), sent the cigarette market into turmoil earlier this month. Tobacco stocks plunged on the prospect of a ferocious price-war in one of the most profitable consumer product sectors. Reynolds, which has almost 29 per cent of the US cigarette market, against Philip Morris' 43 per cent, said immediately it intended to remain competitive, but had not previously detailed its response. Philip Morris shares were Dollars  3/8 lower, at Dollars 46 3/4 , compared with almost Dollars 65 ahead of its price-cut announcement. RJR closed at Dollars 5 3/4 , against Dollars 8 before the price-war broke out.</p>

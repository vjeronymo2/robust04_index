			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A COMEDIAN CLEANS UP HIS ACT;  </P> <P> ENTERTAINMENT: A PRINTER BY TRADE, HE GIVES UP X-RATED ACT FOR THE PERSONA OF A  HOBO CLOWN, MAKING CHILDREN LAUGH WITH HIS MAGIC TRICKS.  </P> <P> Robert Nebel, 51, happily believes he has a split personality.  </P> <P> Once, for instance, he walked around dressed as a parrot to advertise an  Anaheim nightclub called Crackers. On weekend nights he worked there as an  X-rated stand-up comedian.  </P> <P> His risque act made even hardy audiences wince, so he assumed another persona:  Garbi the Hobo Clown, who specializes in children's birthday parties.  </P> <P> "I'm a different person in my day-to-day ordinary life," said Nebel, who lives  in Anaheim and has a night job at a printing company in Commerce. "The guys  would ask me to tell jokes, but I told them I don't mix the two jobs."  </P> <P> It is a different story when Nebel puts on his hobo clown costume and makes  kids giggle, often using magic to make doves and rabbits appear and disappear.  </P> <P> "I'm out there to make people happy," said Nebel, an Air Force veteran who has  spent much of his life as a drive-in theater manager.  </P> <P> His entrance into show business came eight years ago, when "an agent friend of  mine was looking for a monthlong clown act in Japan and I said I could do it,  so I put together the hobo clown outfit."  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the Japanese were not interested in that kind of clown.  </P> <P> But, said Nebel, "since I invested a lot of time and money on the hobo  character, I started doing it on my own.  </P> <P> "It became a great source of happiness for me. Once a little girl came up, put  her arms around me and said, 'Mr. Clown, that was so nice.' I'll never forget  that moment."  </P> <P> As a young man, he said, "the three things I wanted most in life was my own  home, a nice car and a family." He has the house and car, "but my marriage  didn't work out, and I never had a family."  </P> <P> But he has clowning and magic to make him happy. "I enjoy it, and it helps me  carry on my life."  </P> <P> Nebel is a member of the Magic Castle in Hollywood and, he says, "one of these  days I'm going to be a performer there."  </P> <P> However, he already has something like it at his home in Anaheim. One room is  decorated with photographs of hobo clowns, a pool table and a make-believe  electric chair from a film studio.  </P> <P> "They said it was used in the movie 'Bird Man of Alcatraz,' " Nebel said. It  makes an electrical buzzing sound when someone sits in it.  </P></p>

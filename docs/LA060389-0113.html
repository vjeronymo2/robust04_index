			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> The San Francisco 49ers want their former team doctor to pay a $1-million  settlement to former lineman Charlie Krueger, saying the doctor was responsible  for the effects of Krueger's crippling knee injury.  </P> <P> In 1987, the 49ers were found liable by a state court for fraudulently failing  to reveal the severity of Krueger's knee injury, which has left him unable to  stand for long periods of time.  </P> <P> Krueger won $2.36 million in damages last year from a San Francisco Superior  Court judge in a non-jury trial. The case was settled for a reported $1 million  to avoid an appeal. The 49ers asked to have the entire cost shifted to Dr.  Lloyd Milburn, their physician during the period of Krueger's injuries.  </P></p>

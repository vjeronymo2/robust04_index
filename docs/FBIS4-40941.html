			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lyubov Tsukanova: "Public Chamber Wants To </F> Influence the President's Decisions. It Is Charged With  `Overseeing' the Treaty on Accord"]    [Text] There are already 863 signatures on the Treaty on  Social Accord. Social organizations and parties account for 265  of these, entrepreneurial, commercial, and banking structures  for 285. Fifty-two trade unions, 65 scientific organizations,  17 mass media sources, 10 creeds, six parliamentary factions,  and others, have signed. These figures were cited at a routine  session of the Russian Federation President's Public Chamber 18  June by Sergey Filatov, leader of the Presidential Staff, who  was recently appointed leader of the conciliation commission  implementing the treaty. Sergey Filatov said that, first, the  agreement on civil peace is still open for people to join and,  second, work on signing it is being stepped up in the regions.  The operation of the treaty itself is already becoming  apparent, in the Presidential Staff leader's opinion: At any  rate, even the intransigent opposition has been forced to take  account of public opinion and change tactics, giving its  "protest actions" a more respectable look.    Since the signing of the treaty is only the first stage of  the journey down the road of civil peace, a conciliation  commission is being formed to implement it; it includes  representatives of all the branches of power. Independent  experts will be involved in its work. Both cochairman from the  Public Chamber (A. Sobchak and B. Topornin) will sit on the  commission, as will the leaders of five newly created  commissions: for political stability; for socioeconomic  problems; for questions of federative structure and national  relations; for security; and for problems of science, education,  and culture. According to the president's idea, these Public  Chamber commissions are necessary to analyze progress in  fulfilling the Treaty on Social Accord and to elaborate  recommendations for its implementation.    Despite the optimism with which Sergey Filatov and Vice  Premier Aleksandr Shokhin tried to infect members of the Public  Chamber, many of the sociopolitical movement leaders present in  the Kremlin expressed doubt as to the Public Chamber's prestige  and political weight. The sufficiently trenchant but  constructive criticism expressed in particular with regard to  the president's edict on fighting organized crime also suggests  that the Public Chamber does not wish to be a eulogistic chorus  of "courtiers." If the chamber wants to be a truly prestigious  body, one participant said, it should not only criticize the  president's unsuccessful steps but also have the possibility of  averting them.</p>

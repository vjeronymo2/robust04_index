			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Paris urged to rethink arms policy France should be more selective in its military equipment programmes and organise better 'a division of labour' with its EU partners, a high-level planning body recommended yesterday. The report on the French defence industry's future by the Commissariat general du Plan, an official think-tank, says international co-operation is difficult in nuclear weapons but France will have to 'redefine its concept of near-total independence in armaments'. It suggests Paris should define the military technologies it wants to retain in France and what it is prepared to buy from other EU countries without endangering 'national autonomy' in exports. Direct employment in the French arms sector has fallen by 80,000 in the past decade to 230,000 this year, and could decline by up to 93,000 by 1997.</p>

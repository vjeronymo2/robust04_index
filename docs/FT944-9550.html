			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Siebe buys US group for Dollars 90m Siebe, the international controls group, has agreed to pay Dollars 90m (Pounds 54.8m) for Triconex, a US company which makes critical process safety shutdown systems for the chemicals, oil and gas industries. The UK-based group will make a tender offer worth Dollars 17.75 a share; the deal has been recommended by the board and senior management of California-based Triconex, which is quoted on Nasdaq. Triconex pioneered triple modular redundant (TMR) technology for the process industry. Siebe said this provided a similar level of safety to that available to the aerospace industry, at an extremely competitive cost. TMR architecture utilises three parallel components throughout the system, so the failure of any single component will not cause an interruption in control. Siebe said Triconex was not only the recognised leader for such safety systems, but had also been instrumental in making this technology the industry standard. Triconex, founded in 1983, has achieved rapid sales growth, particularly during the past five years. In the year to September 30, it made net income of Dollars 5.2m on sales of Dollars 48.8m. It has net assets of Dollars 36m. Its equipment has been used for many years by Foxboro, Siebe's Massachusetts-based subsidiary, which has been gaining market share with its Intelligent-Automation process control systems. Siebe said safety shutdown systems were the fastest growing part of the process control industry. Although it was paying a high multiple of earnings for the US company, Triconex was already achieving Siebe-style margins and was being bought for its potential.</p>

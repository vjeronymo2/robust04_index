			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Iraq's defiance increases threat of UN attack IRAQ yesterday sustained its defiance of United Nations weapons inspectors, and brought closer the threat of a UN-backed strike against its military installations, by refusing to allow UN experts to seal equipment at two missile testing sites south of Baghdad. A UN team led by Mr Mark Silver, a US weapons specialist, abruptly flew out of Baghdad after failing to persuade the Iraqi authorities to allow switches at the two sites to be fixed down and sealed with wax. Mr Silver's three-member team spent less than 24 hours in Iraq and left the moment it decided the Iraqis would not budge. 'I was not allowed to do what I went in for, and that is why I came out immediately,' Mr Silver told reporters soon after arriving back at UN headquarters in Bahrain. The team's failure to accomplish its task is certain to prompt a renewed collision between the UN and Iraq and raise the possibility of a military strike against the two sites. Mr Al Gore, US vice-president, said on NBC yesterday, that as a first step Iraq would be asked to destroy the sites, if it continued to resist their monitoring. 'If he (Iraqi president Saddam Hussein) refuses to do that, the UN could consider a range of options - one of which could include the use of force against them'. Iraq called on the Security Council to prevent any punitive attack by the US. But at the same time Baghdad signalled continued defiance. Gen Amer Rasheed, who heads Iraq's weapons development programme, said after Mr Silver's departure that the country 'cannot accept seals of activities'. He added: 'We, as a nation, take all necessary measures to protect our people, our land and facilities.' The UN Special Commission had sought to seal the equipment as an interim solution to the deadlock between UN inspectors and Iraq, after Baghdad's refusal to install video monitors at the two sites.</p>

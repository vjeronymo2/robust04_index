			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Esperanza Navarro Francois] </F>   [Text] The Coalition of Panama Canal Commission's Labor  Unions, AFL-CIO, yesterday rejected an amendment proposal  presented to the U.S. Congress by President Bill Clinton to  regulate Panama Canal operations administratively and  financially, because they believe the proposal "threatens"  worker interests.    According to Commission workers, the proposal gives absolute  and total power to the Panama Canal Board of Directors by giving  the Board authority to determine which federal standards will  remain in effect for the Canal Commission during the transition  period.    According to Commission workers, the proposal presented by  the Panama Canal Board of Directors, based on a study and  recommendations by the firm Arthur Anderson, "will create  uncertainty and nervousness." The workers are afraid they will  lose the rights they have attained with so much effort and  sacrifice.    In a communique sent to the workers, the Coalition has  alerted international organizations in the United States to  ensure their participation in the congressional debates.</p>

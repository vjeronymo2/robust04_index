Anglers report catching several species of fish.  </P> <P> Dorado and yellowtail counts continue to climb and now tuna and skipjack have  been on the move.  </P> <P> The Department of Fish and Game, which keep records from party boats' daily  catch counts, reports that more than 6,000 dorado have been caught since a run  started last week.  </P> <P> The Dream Street Foundation of West L.A., which provides summer camp programs  for boys and girls with life-threatening diseases, introduced 60 youngsters to  ocean sportfishing.  </P> <P> Capt. George Xenio donated his boat, the Victory, the crew and all the fishing  equipment for the trip. Conditions were perfect as a run of big barracuda and  bonito kept the youngsters busy for three hours. The trip's organizer, Linda  Giella, said it was an experience that youngsters will never forget.  </P> <P> John Maur of San Pedro reeled in several bonito that weighed up to eight pounds  and Crystal Flores of Carson reeled in a 10-pound barracuda.  </P> <P> An official international game fish scale has been installed at the Union 76  fuel dock in Marina del Rey. Marina del Rey anglers installed the weigh station  that will be open to all anglers. Ron Worthington will be the official weigh  master.  </P> <P> Jean Milener, 11, of Carson has been deep sea fishing since he was 5 and had  never caught an exotic fish until last weekend. Fishing aboard L.A. Harbor's  Sportking, Milener hooked 10 fighting dorado that weighed up to 15 pounds.  </P> <P> Redondo Sportfishing's Blackjack was at the 209 spot fishing the floating kelp  for dorado and yellowtail when angler Ernie Kaplan of West Los Angeles noticed  a marlin jumping nearby.  </P> <P> Using 15-pound test line and a small sardine for bait, he cast toward the  marlin and hooked it. Kaplan headed the fish toward the boat and within 15  minutes brought it to gaff. It weighed in at 90 pounds.  </P> <P> King Harbor Marlin Club members with some impressive catches this past week  were Frank Matsuhara, fishing on the Rowena III 28 miles out from San Diego.

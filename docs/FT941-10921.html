			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (7): Caught up in the bull run - Singapore A year ago Singapore brokers were bemoaning the unexciting nature of the local market. All that changed in 1993 as Singapore was caught up in the bull run that swept through the Asian markets. The Singapore main index went up 59 per cent in 1993 and total market capitalisation increased by more than 150 per cent to SDollars 219bn (Dollars 138bn). Singapore is heavily influenced by the Kuala Lumpur market. The two were once joined but split in 1990. However, Singapore can still trade in Malaysian stocks through CLOB (Central Limit Order Book) International, an over-the-counter market for trading securities listed on foreign exchanges. It is estimated that up to 60 per cent of Singapore's daily trading volumes are in CLOB-listed Malaysian stocks. Out of the 30 most active stocks traded last year in Singapore 24 were Malaysian companies. Singapore has the reputation of being an open and well regulated - some would say over-regulated - market. In spite of recent government moves to partially privatise a number of state companies and encourage share ownership among the public, the market is also still a narrow one. Though 21 companies went public last year, raising a total of SDollars 6.85bn - compared to 15 initial offerings in 1992 raising only SDollars 514m  -almost 60 per cent of total funds raised in 1993 were in connection with the October listing of Singapore Telecom (ST), the telecommunications and post utility. Analysts say it is unlikely that any more large, state entities will come to the market before early 1995. Foreign ownership: The Singapore government jealously guards what it considers to be key industries and places limits ranging from 15 to 49 per cent on foreign ownership of such companies. These include Singapore Airlines, Singapore Press Holdings and the four big local banks. There are separate quotations for foreign shares in these companies. Names of foreign owners must be declared when shares are registered. Individual foreign investors must declare their interest if they hold 5 per cent or more of any one company. Foreign exchange/repatriation: There are no controls on such funds in or out of Singapore. Singapore deducts at source a 27 per cent withholding tax on dividend income earned within the country. There is no capital gains tax in Singapore. Settlement procedures and other regulations: Singapore is moving towards a fully scripless trading system. Dealing costs are payable by both buyer and seller on a downward sliding rate starting at 1 per cent for the first SDollars 250,000. Trades on the Ready Market are due for settlement on the same day in the week following the date of transaction. The SES enforces a buy-in on the day following a failed settlement. The regular trading lot is 1,000 shares.</p>

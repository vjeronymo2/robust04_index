			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, May 18 (TANJUG) -- The vice-president of  the Yugoslav Federal Government, Zeljko Simic, said on Wednesday  [18 May] that the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) should once  again adopt an impartial position in performing its peacekeeping  mission on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. During talks  with UNPROFOR director for civil affairs, Serge de Melle, and  with the coordinator for civil affairs at the Belgrade  headquarters of the "blue helmets", Vladislam Gerasev, Simic  said that UNPROFOR should do everything possible to inform the  U.N. and world public opinion in a timely manner about the real  situation in war-torn regions.    By so doing UNPROFOR will restore the credibility it needs  to  take part in appeasing tension and establish lasting peace in  the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, he said. The Yugoslav Ministry  of Information announced that the representatives of UNPROFOR  informed simic about the implementation of the agreement on the  cessation of hostilities in the region of Gorazde, a Moslem  enclave in the east of the former Yugoslav republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina [B-H] in which war has been raging between  local Serbs, Croats and Moslems for over two years.    The agreement was signed here on April 22 by representatives  of the U.N. and the Bosnian Serb republic, a state of Bosnian  Serbs.    Simic told UNPROFOR representatives that the civil war in  B-H  should not be viewed only from the angle of certain hotbeds,  such as Gorazde, since there are other areas, such as Brcko (in  the north-east of B-H) which, he said, are potentially more  dangerous and which are directly provoked by the Moslem side  whose political and military acts are often kept secret and  hushed up. Simic pointed out that Bosnian Serbs have objective  reasons for dissastifaction and caution towards UNPROFOR due to  certain indiscretions committed by the "blue helmets". He cited  as an example the direct participation of the Nordic battalion  of UNPROFOR on the side of Moslems in clashes in the region of  Tuzla (north-east B-H), last week. Simic stressed that the  Yugoslav Government will continue to extend its help to UNPROFOR  to stabilize the situation in B-H in order to create  pre-conditions to continue talks for finding a lasting political  solution to the conflict, in accordance with the foreign policy  of the country. Finally, Simic expressed his gratitude to  UNPROFOR representatives and to the special envoy of U.N.  secretary general, Yasushi Akashi, for their efforts to overcome  the crisis in B-H.</p>

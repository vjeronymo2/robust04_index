			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Warning hits Motor World shares Shares of Motor World Group, the car parts and accessories retailer which floated in February last year, fell 14p to 314p yesterday following an adverse trading statement at the annual meeting. Shareholders were told that the exceptionally wet winter weather had resulted in a customer fall-off which had affected retail sales during the opening half year. However, this was partially offset by increased spending per head and, in the light of an increase in the number of branches from 180 to 209, the board said it was 'quietly confident' in the outcome for the current year.</p>

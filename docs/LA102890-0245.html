			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: WALNUT;  </P> <P> PUBLIC TO VOTE ON FIREWORKS  </P> <P> Residents will be able to decide for themselves next year whether they want to  allow the continued sale of so-called safe and sane fireworks in the city.  </P> <P> The City Council Wednesday voted 4 to 1, with Councilman Drexel Smith  dissenting, to let the public vote on the matter during the November, 1991,  municipal election.  </P> <P> Anti-fireworks activists had favored a special election. But by scheduling the  vote during a municipal election, Mayor Bert Ashley said the city could avoid  the $16,000 cost of a special election.  </P></p>

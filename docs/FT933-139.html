			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: A cash cow ready for market - Norma Cohen on Gartmore in the light of its imminent flotation FIVE YEARS ago, Gartmore, ranked number 16 in a highly competitive and overcrowded field of investment fund managers vying for clients among pension fund trustees. Today, it ranks fourth, attracting a disproportionate percentage of all the UK pension fund money looking for a new home and ranks alongside some of the most venerable names in the business. It manages Pounds 16bn in funds, more than three-quarters of which are British pension fund assets. After this spectacular growth, Gartmore's owner, Banque Indosuez of France, has decided to milk its cash cow. Having bought Gartmore from the collapsed British &amp; Commonwealth group in April 1990 for a mere Pounds 132m, the bank is expected to announce a November date for the flotation of 25 to 30 per cent of the fund manager. Mr Philip Gibbs, financial industry analyst at stockbrokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd, estimated the flotation would value the company at Pounds 270m to Pounds 300m. However, the flotation has caused some anxiety among pension fund consultants who have championed Gartmore's skills to their own clients. 'It will probably be good for Gartmore and for Banque Indosuez. But will it be good for clients?', said one. According to another, 'the big danger for a firm which has done so well is general complacency.' Gartmore's investment performance successes have helped its pension funds under management grow by 173 per cent in less than four years. The question is whether Gartmore can hang on to what made it a success, particularly in its new guise as a public company. Gartmore's management is well aware of consultants' anxieties. Mr David Watts, head of pension fund investments, said: 'I think it's a question of keeping your decision-making structure focused. You have to keep your decision-making group small.' Despite the rapid growth in funds under management, only four top executives made the decisions on how to allocate assets between sectors - an aspect of the business at which Gartmore is acknowledged to have been particularly adept. Gartmore is unusual in that it has been able to add value both in its allocation of funds between types of investments and markets and in its selection of stock. The company has a heavy bias towards equities and expects to weight its portfolios 90 per cent in that category, somewhat above the industry average. 'We have a style which is fairly robust in asset allocation,' said Mr Paul Myners, the chairman. 'If we think a sector is going to outperform, we don't go into it with just a half per cent weighting. Our clients expect us to take risks. That's what they pay us for.' For example, on the day Britain withdrew from the ERM last September, Gartmore made a move out of large stocks and into smaller companies, which have outperformed the FT-A All-Share Index since then. It has also held a heavy weighting in foreign bonds, the best performing asset class all year. Following the flotation Banque Indosuez, which Mr Myners says has never meddled in Gartmore's affairs, will have representation on its full board as well as on its remuneration and audit committees. 'But they subscribe to the view that if it ain't broke, don't mend it,' he said. And it certainly ain't broke yet. In 1992, Gartmore's median rate of return in the investment pools it managed was 26.4 per cent, according to data from Combined Actuarial Performance Services. Overall, its individual funds made returns ranging from 22.6 per cent to 29.8 per cent - this in a year when the Caps' median performance was 22.4 per cent and the FT-A All-Share Index returned 20.6 per cent. Gartmore has taken the precaution of warning its clients not to expect more of the same in 1993. 'It is most unlikely we will ever again be able to outperform in every market,' said Mr Myners. Indeed, Gartmore's 1993 performance so far is just straddling the industry median - a statistic which does little to alleviate the nagging worries about the impending flotation. But after last year's excellent returns, it would take at least three years of below-average performance before clients began to defect, said BZW's Mr Gibbs. The company's profits have grown with its assets. For the first six months of 1993, operating profits were Pounds 10.8m on revenue of Pounds 30m. Analysts at Cazenove, Gartmore's brokers, estimate that its ratio of operating profits to funds under management stood at 0.15 per cent in June. MAM and Henderson Administration Group, both quoted, had ratios of 0.13 and 0.11. However, securities analysts point out that Gartmore has some vulnerable points. With UK pension funds accounting for 77 per cent of its funds under management, it is heavily dependent on a single product for its profits. Most of these are the assets of defined benefit schemes, which promise workers a percentage of final salary upon retirement. With a government advisory panel considering changes to the way UK pension funds are regulated, the fund management industry is bracing itself for the possibility that new regulations will prompt employers to switch to less complicated schemes which only promise a lump sum upon retirement. Mr Myners acknowledges that such a shift would have implications for Gartmore. 'Some employers will still continue to hire us. But if we move away from the current world, there will clearly be more competition.' Gartmore is bracing itself for these changes by developing its unit and investment trust product lines and by expanding the investment products it offers for just those types of pension schemes. Also, unlike its three main competitors, Gartmore has done little to diversify outside the UK. It has fledgling businesses in Denmark and the Netherlands, along with a Canadian operation. But only within the past two months has it applied for Securities and Exchange Commission permission to operate a fund management company in the US. Meanwhile, Gartmore's competitors are anxious to see what kind of a company it will be when it has shareholders of its own. It is in the arena of corporate governance that Mr Myners has probably earned his greatest public recognition. He has been a repeated critic of long-term employment contracts for corporate directors, complaining that they force shareholders to pay huge sums to get rid of incompetent management. Mr Myners says details of his own contract are not yet complete. 'Whatever we do has got to be defensible because we are in a glass house,' he said.</p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / International Company News: Hachette reveals plan to finance Matra merger HACHETTE, the heavily-indebted French media group, yesterday announced details of a FFr2.8bn (Dollars 581.3m) recapitalisation package to finance its proposed merger with Matra, one of France's largest defence companies. Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, the chairman of both Matra and Hachette, said that Hachette was on course for a return to modest net profits this year - having sustained a FFr1.93bn loss in 1991 - but it was still experiencing pressure on operating margins. Hachette was also under pressure because of the cost of servicing its debt, he said. The group incurred heavy borrowings to finance an ambitious expansion programme in the late 1980s and is trying to make disposals. Mr Lagardere said he expected within weeks to announce the sale of Hachette's landmark building on Boulevard St Germain in Paris for around FFr500m. For several months Hachette, which is trying to recover from the collapse earlier this year of La Cinq, the French TV station, has been locked in negotiations with its shareholders and bankers over its proposed recapitalisation. The talks include the Gan insurance group, and Credit Lyonnais and Banque Nationale de Paris, the state-controlled banks. At an extraordinary general meeting yesterday, Hachette secured shareholders' consent to implement its proposals, which include issuing FFr900m of new ordinary shares and FFr600m of convertible bonds. The remaining FFr1.3bn will be raised by the issue of subordinated floating notes, a form of debt that resembles equity. Mr Lagardere said the recapitalisation should be completed by the end of this year or early next year and that Hachette would then proceed with the Matra merger. This merger, which Mr Lagardere claims will yield considerable cost benefits, has been fiercely criticised in France because of the apparent lack of synergy between the two companies. Hachette was last year affected by the impact of the economic slowdown on its media businesses, particularly in the US, as well as by the La Cinq debacle. The company managed to make operating profits of FFr636m last year, but fell into the red chiefly due to a provision of FFr1.8bn on La Cinq. Mr Lagardere said its markets were 'still in a recessionary phase' and that the group may suffer another fall in operating margins in 1992. However, he said there were signs of recovery in the US.</p>

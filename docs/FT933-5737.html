			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Newspaper price war stepped up by Murdoch: Times cut to 30p as News Corp unveils satellite TV expansion package MR Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation last night widened Britain's newspaper circulation wars by announcing that the price of The Times would be cut by 15p to 30p from next week. The price cut, the biggest of its kind in the broadsheet market for decades, is aimed at reversing a declining circulation which is affecting most of Britain's newspapers. The announcement coincided with Mr Murdoch's launch of a multi-channel package of satellite television channels in the UK as part of an ambitious expansion package which includes a German TV deal and an 'open university' in Asia. The Times' price cut is likely to herald a period of intense competition between broadsheet papers. Rivals, such as The Independent and The Daily Telegraph, will be under pressure to follow suit. In a front-page editorial, The Independent today appealed for its readers' support, accusing Mr Murdoch of trying to drive it out of business. But none of the other broadsheets would comment. Mr Murdoch's move follows a successful 15p price cut for The Times in Kent which increased sales by up to 15 per cent and a 5p cut in the 25p cover price of The Sun, News Corp's leading UK tabloid, this summer. That resulted in a 300,000 rise in sales. A 30p Times, News Corp hopes, will take the paper from its current circulation of about 370,000 to well above 400,000 and into second place in the broadsheet market behind The Daily Telegraph. The immediate aim is to win readers from The Independent, which has been going through difficult times both financially and editorially. Mr Murdoch's satellite TV package will make 18 channels available to UK audiences by early next year. They will range in content from home shopping to children's programmes. Most will be available only by subscription. At a banquet in London last night to mark the launch of the Sky Multi-Channels package, Mr Murdoch, News Corp chairman, said the age of the media mogul was over. 'The consumer is in the saddle, driving the telecommunications industry.' He outlined a series of deals designed to ensure that News Corp would be 'part of this process of economic expansion'. They included: A deal with British Telecom and Cellnet to explore digital 'super highways of the future' with a 500-home experiment combining access to telecommunications, TV shows, movies and specialist information. A deal with Pro 7, the German broadcaster associated with the Kirch Corporation, to develop pay television in German covering as many as six channels. The launch in Asia of a wide range of programming including an Open University and educational channels using the Star satellite system. News Corp recently bought control. The launch of a second satellite sports channel in the UK. A deal with Televisa of Mexico to produce 500 hours of multilingual popular drama. Completing the array of deals, News Corp last week spent Dollars 12m (Pounds 8m) on acquiring a small electronic publishing company, Delphi Internet Services, which can handle electronic newspapers. Meanwhile, Ms Ann Clwyd, shadow heritage secretary, called on the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to investigate 'News Corporation's penetration of this country's mass media'.

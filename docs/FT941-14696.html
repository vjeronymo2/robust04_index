			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Upbeat sounds in Motown: The Big Three US carmakers are enjoying a renaissance in their expanding home market The outside temperatures are sub-zero, and ice floes are drifting down the Detroit River, but inside the US motor industry the heat is on. By implementing 'massive structural changes', US automakers have turned the tables on their foreign rivals and brought about 'nothing less than the renaissance of the American automobile industry', says Mr Helmut Werner, chief executive of Mercedes-Benz. While sales continue to plunge in west Europe and Japan, demand for new vehicles is rising in North America, where the domestic US producers are making the biggest gains, in particular in light trucks, traditionally their strongest market. The previously all-conquering Japanese carmakers have lost market share in the US for the past two years in succession. Japanese and European vehicle producers are also losing money as the big three US carmakers - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler - are back in the black, to an enthusiastic reception on Wall Street. The share prices of the Big Three began to climb back from the depths in early 1992, but the pace became hectic last year. In recent days prices have again reached new peaks, as financial analysts returned to New York from last week's Detroit motor show convinced that the best of the recovery is still to come. The surge has been led by Chrysler, the smallest of the US carmakers, which was virtually written off as a serious competitor in the world industry at the start of the 1990s. The Chrysler share price has risen sixfold in the past three years, jumping from a low of Dollars 9.38 at the end of 1990 to close at Dollars 62 1/2 on Tuesday. Yesterday the company announced a record pre-tax profit of Dollars 3.8bn for 1993, four times the Dollars 934m earned in 1992. As recently as 1991 it suffered a pre-tax loss of Dollars 910m. The company has been rejuvenated since the end of the 1980s by a drastic restructuring and a series of successful product launches. 'Right now we are having a lot of fun,' says Mr Robert Eaton, Chrysler chairman and chief executive. 'We were the first automaker to recognise that basic changes were taking place in our industry, and we were the first to prepare for them. 'We began by cutting costs and eliminating waste while preserving future product spending. We sold non-automotive assets. And we began to get lean. But as we trimmed our workforce, we also reorganised into (chassis) platform teams that design cars faster and more efficiently.' Chrysler increased its US car and light truck sales by 19.9 per cent last year to 2.047m in a market that rose by 8 per cent. It raised its market share to 14.7 per cent, the highest level for 23 years, and its latest products such as the Dodge Stratus/Chrysler Cirrus large family car range, unveiled at the Detroit show, are yet to reach the market. While Chrysler's rise from the ashes has been the most striking aspect of the recovery of confidence in Motown, Ford, the second-largest US player, has also made impressive progress in its home market. It boosted its share of the US light vehicle market - cars and light trucks - to 25.6 per cent last year, its highest level since 1978, and accounted for five of the 10 best-selling vehicles in the US last year. 'The recession is behind us,' says Mr Alex Trotman, Ford chairman and chief executive. 'There has been steady economic growth for several quarters and there will be more growth in 1994 with low interest rates and low inflation.' The US new vehicle market rose by 8 per cent last year to 14.2m, the highest level since 1989, and US industry leaders are forecasting further gains this year to 15m-15.2m. At General Motors, the leading US vehicle maker, it is still too early for celebration, but the stumbling giant of the world auto industry appears to be seeing some light at the end of the tunnel for its North American automotive operations. GM remains the high-cost US producer and its balance sheet is still weak, but the group's new management team, installed following a boardroom coup in 1992, has at least stopped the bleeding in North America. Mr Jack Smith, GM chief executive, insists that the strategies are now in place that will allow GM 'ultimately' to reassert its leadership of the world industry. GM at least achieved an operating break-even on its North American automotive operations in 1993 before interest, tax and special items, which represented a turnround of more than Dollars 10bn from the horrendous losses of the previous two years. The new target is to achieve at least a break-even at the net level in 1994. 'GM's unrivalled size and success made it easy for us to ignore the significance of change and the signs of potential future problems,' admits Mr Smith. 'The lesson we have learnt is that for unrivalled leaders, success itself breeds the roots of complacency, myopia, and ultimately, decline.' GM's biggest cost reductions in the short term - Dollars 4bn between the end of 1990 and the end of 1993 - have been achieved by consolidating 27 North American purchasing units into one. The shock waves of GM's drastic moves to cut purchasing costs - led initially by the now notorious Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who moved last year to Volkswagen - are still reverberating through the US components industry, however. 'The scar tissue does not heal very fast. Trust must still be rebuilt,' says the chief executive of one leading US automotive supplier. The drive to cut purchasing costs was GM's short-term panic response to its financial crisis. More significant for the long term, it is seeking radically to restructure and rationalise its product development and engineering operations in North America to reduce costs and lead times and to introduce more common processes, systems and parts. The target is to reduce the total number of its passenger car chassis platforms in North America (excluding its Saturn small car) from 12 in 1991 to only five by the end of the decade. 'We know we won't get there overnight,' admits Mr Smith. It is taking time to turn round the cumbersome GM bureaucracy, but belatedly the company is trying to acquire the agility that has been discovered by Chrysler. GM is already benefiting, however, from one aspect of the current recovery in the North American market, namely the surge in demand for light trucks - the pick-ups, four-wheel-drive sports/utilities and minivans or multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs) - that US consumers are increasingly buying in preference to traditional passenger cars. GM has had to move to three-shift, round-the-clock assembly at some truck plants to meet demand. Light trucks now account for 40 per cent of US passenger vehicle demand, and it is a sector still dominated by the Big Three. While new car sales rose by 4 per cent to 8.5m last year - still way below the peak of 11.46m in 1986 - light truck sales jumped 16 per cent to a record 5.7m. Americans' love affair with trucks dates from the 1970s and early 1980s, when successive oil crises forced US vehicle makers to start building smaller, less powerful cars. Mr Roy Roberts, general manager of General Motors' GMC Truck, says that trucks continued to offer 'the performance and power that customers wanted', but he admits that US producers have underestimated the strength of demand. 'The sheer size of this infatuation with trucks has caught us somewhat off-guard. The industry has struggled to find the capacity to meet the demand. Right now we have excess capacity for cars and not enough for trucks.' The dominance of the US industry in this sector is greatly helped by a 25 per cent tariff on several categories of light trucks imports, which has helped to keep its Japanese rivals at bay. Japanese vehicle makers, which had carved out a share of 25.7 per cent of the US light vehicle market by 1991, are now under pressure on many fronts in the US. Most important, they have been forced to increase prices much faster than their US rivals to compensate for the appreciation in the value of the yen. Their market share fell last year to 23.1 per cent. The resurgence in the US auto industry's fortunes has not been achieved easily, however, and Mr Trotman warns that the world's vehicle makers still face 'a severe dogfight. Some producers are not going to survive.' The US industry, so recently itself on the critical list, must now fight to hold its edge. 'We aren't smiling about the problems they are having in Japan,' says Mr Eaton. 'They'll be back . . . If we let ourselves get caught up in the euphoria of the moment we'll never get where we want to go. And we have a long way to go.'</p>

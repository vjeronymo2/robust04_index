Khergamvala: "Raphel's Remarks Will Help </F> India"; boldface words as published]    [Text] Manama (Bahrain), Nov. 20. With the dust settling on  the controversial remarks on Kashmir passed by a senior U.S.  State Department official these will turn out to be beneficial  in the long run. At least, these will help India avoid the  mistakes in the Arab-Israeli process. The remarks have also  enabled Indians to see holes in India's attitude towards Kashmir  and the U.S.    Last month's "background" briefing of Ms. Robin Raphel, the  U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia sparked a  highly informed and honest public debate in the Indian media. A  vital debate like this was by and large missing when the West  Asia peace process was launched by the Bush administration. The  U.S. hinged on its own prestige, not informed public debate  among the direct participants. That came later.    The violent and halting fallout of the secret Oslo deal  between Israel and the PLO shows that Mr. Yasser Arafat's brave  but rash move necessitated a desperate effort to economically  prop up the peace deal after a wider consultative process was  by-passed. On the Israeli side, the Labour-led coalition now  finds itself stranded between barbed wires on the deal with  Syria.    The debate in India, and in due course in Pakistan and among  Kashmiri elements, will make movement on an eventual deal  ponderous but once made will ensure that it sticks. For long,  Governments in India did their own private running of policy,  without adequate input from the large number of specialist  studies on the subject.    It is extraordinary that a Government that calls for  transparency at the UN on decision making is not obliged to do  so for its own people. The holes have been exposed not only by  the debate following Ms. Raphel's remarks but also by the  British Foreign Secretary, Mr. Douglas Hurd's broadly similar  remarks.    Parallel message: The essential parallel message  from West Asia, applied to Kashmir, is to forget the biblical  times and 45-year-old resolutions and make recent agreements  work, or else improve upon them. In other words, give up  maximalist dreams. It may not be of much satisfaction to New  Delhi and Islamabad that many Arab and Islamic governments feel  the same way.    Kashmir's 2nd century B.C. Buddhism, its 14th century  transfer to muslim rule, its accession in 1947, the UN  resolutions of the late 1940s -- none of these is relevant. Like  the Arab-Israeli entanglement everyone is sitting on 10 layers  of history that does not resolve but guide.    The one common thread running through every editorial or  commentary in the Indian and foreign media, and in conferences  abroad is that Kashmir is the main obstacle to peace between  India and Pakistan. This is a big gain for Pakistan's repeated  plea that the dispute is a "core" problem.    India has made little if any ground in lumping together all  problems between India and Pakistan. The omniscient claims and  attitude of various governments in New Delhi, to the exclusion  of academic inputs, have led to taking stagnant and irrelevant  positions in the international fora. Some telling debating  points have been missed.    A relevant question: For instance Mr. Amar  Saksena, the Legal Counsellor to an international bank in West  Asia, has in an essay to a regional paper raised a valid point.  If only Kashmiris could decide Kashmir's fate, he argues, "why  and pursuant to which legal right did Pakistan cede Kashmiri  territory to China." In all the years of monitoring Indian and  Pakistani positions in Arab and Islamic conferences one has  never heard India making this searching argument.    It must be conceded that India's policy in Washington has  paid dividends. It was no mean feat to wean a close ally and  bringing it to the brink of declaring Pakistan a terrorist  state. But the flaw in India is that it appears to have elevated  the U.S. to the status of chief arbiter on terrorism in the  sub-continent. That has now backfired.    India corroborated mindlessly on U.S. intentions against  Libya. India had expected that if at the UN Security Council it  looked at Libya and Iraq through the U.S. prism, the pay-off  would be Pakistan being labelled a terrorist state.    Backbone non-existent: The Indian official  spokesman's unprincipled statement after Mr. Bill Clinton's  Cruise missile attack on Iraq -- where he reminded that India  too faced cross-border terrorism -- must rank as the most  begging request New Delhi made to the U.S.    Consequently, when Ms. Raphel downgraded Kashmiri terrorism  and labelled it as "political consciousness," the bottom fell  out of India's looking up to the U.S. as the judge of terrorism  on the subcontinent. Pakistan had abstained on the Security  Council Resolution 883 tightening the Libyan sanctions and is  none the worse for it.    It's amusing that all these years, the Indian political  establishment complained of neglect from the U.S., but when a  new administration, dubbed by Mr. George Bush as being run by  "two bozos," switches on, the U.S. is branded as an unwanted  do-gooder.    The political establishment do not ask it who, in the first  place, invited the U.S. into the terrorism issue. India forgets  Mr. Sharad Pawar's remark of India winning the war without  firing a shot, when Pakistan was put on the so called watch list.    U.S. is out of it: Ms. Raphel's prodding remarks  have also ensured that the U.S. is out of the Kashmir peace  process. Her remarks have injured public sentiment and now that  the public and the media will debate the subject neither is  likely to allow the Government to use the U.S. in the dispute.    Indo-U.S. differences lie primarily in issues concerning  space, non-proliferation, missiles, trade related agreements,  among others. At the business and public level there was a  tremendous forward leap. It is in the public diplomacy domain  that the relationship has suffered.    That is perhaps the major reason why the U.S. is backing  off.  To wit, on November 9 at his briefing the State Department's  spokesman talked about the bilateral relationship as "one that  is considered among the most important in the region.... if not  in the world itself" and is of the "utmost importance" to this  administration.    The added clarification, that the disputed area includes  those parts of Jammu and Kashmir ceded to or in possession of  China, suggest a recognition of one of India's main arguments,  well put across by the foreign office -- that the country's  concerns have to be understood in its Asian (China) construct.  Whether, by including China the U.S. intends to include it in  the overall South Asian security regime remains to be seen.    Since four years India has tried everything to give Kashmir  a  non profile internationally. It may now turn out that whatever  motivated the Hazratbal operation, has done the gravest damage  to an old Indian Kashmir policy.    An entirely new element has to be reckoned with by both  India  and Pakistan. In many ways a whole new ball game is beginning in  a new ball park. And with new rules.</p>

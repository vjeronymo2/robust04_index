			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Argentina tipped to top 1993 ARGENTINA offers the best return in dollar terms to equity investors in Latin America next year, while Brazil and Peru are the wild cards in the pack, according to Mr Audley Twiston Davies, managing director of Latin American Securities. He told a group of investors yesterday that Argentine equities are now looking oversold, after a volatile year in which they rose by 45 per cent before falling back to show a loss of 38 per cent by mid-November. Assigning Argentina an asset allocation of 20 per cent, the second-largest after Mexico with 35 per cent, he forecast that its stock market would rise by 60 per cent in 1993. Describing Mexico as the core holding in any Latin American portfolio, he expected that market to rise by 40 per cent next year. Brazil and Peru were more difficult to predict following the political upheavals this year, he said, and their gains could be anywhere between zero to 100 per cent. Venezuela was given the smallest asset allocation, of just 2 per cent, due to uncertainty ahead of the country's elections. Mr Twiston Davies noted that other countries in the region were mid-term in their political cycle and that by the end of next year, forthcoming elections would have an increasing influence on their stock markets.</p>

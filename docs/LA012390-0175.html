			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PERLES TO REJECT JETS' JOB OFFER, TRUSTEE SAYS  </P> <P> Michigan State Coach George Perles, who has been offered the New York Jets'  coaching job, will reject the offer and remain at his alma mater, a member of  Michigan State University's board of trustees said.  </P> <P> The trustees, in an effort to keep Perles at Michigan State, will formally  offer him the job of athletic director tonight at a board meeting, one trustee  said.  </P> <P> Perles is expected to accept the athletic director job, a position he has  coveted since it became available.  </P> <P> "George received an informal offer from the Jets and he will turn it down,"  said the board member, who claimed that he spoke with Perles Monday evening.  </P> <P> Perles met with Jets General Manager Dick Steinberg on Monday in Hempstead,  N.Y., presumably to hammer out a deal. Perles returned immediately to East  Lansing, Mich., where he was expected to meet today with school officials.  </P> <P> According to Steinberg, Perles had to consult with certain officials before he  could be released from his contract. Steinberg said the athletic director job  "has nothing to do with the discussions."  </P> <P> But Perles was noncommittal after his meeting with Steinberg. "(My wife) and I  have talked about this before," Perles said. "Now I have some things I can  convey to her. Now it's reality. Mentally, I've got a lot stored up in my  mind."  </P> <P> Perles was in a similar position two years ago. He had accepted an offer to  become the Green Bay Packers' head coach, but he backed down at the last minute  when Michigan State offered a 10-year contract.  </P></p>

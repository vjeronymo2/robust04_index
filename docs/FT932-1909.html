			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Shop rents 'likely to rise 5% next year' SHOP RENTS have stopped falling and are likely to rise by at least 5 per cent next year, according to a report published yesterday. The study by Erdman Lewis, property consultants, forecasts that property outside towns will experience the sharpest rent increases, with rises of 7 per cent in 1993 and 1994. High street shop rents have stabilised after falling by 2 per cent in the first five months of this year. A rise of 5 per cent is predicted next year. Erdman Lewis reports an increased level of inquiries about letting space from retailers, although they are still slow to conclude transactions. The property market is benefiting from a fall in the rate of retail receiverships. The total fell to 152 in the year to May from 233 in the same period last year. The investment market is also recovering, with yields on high-street shops likely to fall for the first time in three years. The recovery has been led by the out-of-town sector, where yields are continuing to be pushed down. The Midsummer Retail Report, Erdman Lewis, 6 Grosvenor Street, London W1X OAD. Free.</p>

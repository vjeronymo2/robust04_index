			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / You pay the money and take your choice: John Willman argues for more variety, not cuts, in UK public services Lenin wanted to abolish it. John Major says that he will shrink it. No US president can get elected without promising to get it off people's backs. 'It' is the state. And on Wednesday, Mr Major told the European Policy Forum in London that his ambition was to limit its role. Despite his good intentions, the UK prime minister is unlikely to be any more successful than other western leaders in cutting government down to size. Using public expenditure as a measure, the state is bigger now in almost every country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development than it was 10 years ago. Even where bits of the UK state have been sold off, most remain umbilically tied to the public sector. Privatised utilities such as electricity and water are largely controlled by government-appointed regulators. British Rail, which is in the process of being privatised, will depend on public subsidy for the foreseeable future. Far from shrinking, the state is becoming more dominant in the economy. Businesses from pharmaceuticals to broadcasting operate in a world where the regulator giveth and the regulator taketh away. The defence industry has long wallowed in the warm bath of government contracts. Now the financial services industry is being co-opted into providing pensions, while the City finances public infrastructure and social housing. There are no signs that the state's appetite will diminish, or that voters' demands for it to provide ever-better public services will abate. Rather than promising downsizing, Mr Major would have been better advised to concentrate on the sort of state he wanted to provide. There is a gulf between the Conservatives and the Labour party on that issue, and some achievements for the government to brag about. The public services that the Conservatives inherited in 1979 offered a standard product, on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. Like the model-T Ford, you could choose any colour so long as it was black. That was fine in the early days of the welfare state, when people were grateful for free education, a National Health Service and modern council homes to replace slums. But, like car-buyers, their aspirations have been raised. Now they want to be able to choose between different options in public services, just as they can in their private consumption. The Conservatives have recognised this in many of their public service reforms, breaking up monolithic institutions like the health service and local education authorities. Instead, competing hospitals, schools, colleges and housing associations offer a variety of choices. There is not a completely free choice, of course. There never is. If you want to buy a washing machine, they are all pretty much the same apart from colour and size. And while most families have a car with four wheels and an engine, not everyone can choose a Rolls-Royce. But people using public services have some element of choice where there was none before. Public service managers have been given greater freedom to respond to what the customer wants and incentives to encourage them to do so. Labour still seems ambivalent about this. It worries about some people losing out by making the wrong choices, and that inequalities will result. It opposes the internal market in the health service, saying that competition there is inappropriate. It says that the GP-fundholding scheme, which allows family doctors to shop around for the best treatment on behalf of their patients, is creating a two-tier service. It promises to bring all state schools back under local authority control. Local authorities would again begin building homes for rent. It is true that some people will make bad decisions, and the middle classes will find ways of getting more than a fair share. The organisations providing the services may be tempted to cream off the best customers, leaving the most vulnerable in sink schools or with the worst doctors. But these things happen already. High-quality, free state education is available to those who can afford to move into the right school catchment areas. Articulate folk have always known how to argue their way to the head of any queue. They already benefit disproportionately from the welfare state. However, it is not beyond the wit of policymakers to devise systems that stop some people hogging the resources. Giving extra payments to public services which provide for those who need them most would counteract cream-skimming. More information and advice may be needed if people are not to make foolish choices. And there are opportunities for a left-of-centre party to build on the Conservative reforms in order to advance its egalitarian agenda. Parties like Labour were created to give ordinary people access to opportunities reserved for the privileged. Further extending choice in public services would contribute to that end. For example, why should the best services in health and education be reserved for those who can pay for them? This, more than public service reforms, creates a two-tier society. The existence of private markets in health and education creates an 'opt-out' society in which a few can buy the standard of service that many more desire. Those private markets cannot be abolished in a free society. But they could be integrated into the public sector if the state bought in their services so that everyone had access to them. Giving people vouchers to buy their own health and education would further enhance choice, and force schools and health organisations to meet users' needs. Some of Labour's policy advisers have been pressing the party's strategists to develop the Conservative reforms, not reverse them. Having studied the reforms in the health service and education, they have seen gains in efficiency and responsiveness. Luckily for Mr Major, Labour shows no signs of listening to such voices. So this allows him to present the Conservatives at the next election as the party that believes in real choice in public services, and Labour as a party that appears not to. If he wants to put clear water between the government and the opposition, Mr Major should say less about the doomed objective of reducing the state, and more about making it provide the sort of services that voters aspire to.</p>

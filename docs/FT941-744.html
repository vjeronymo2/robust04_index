			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Delors guarantee may sway sceptics Ministers were preparing last night for a tough fight to sell the European Union enlargement compromise to sceptical Conservative backbenchers. The key is likely to be a written guarantee from Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, of British independence in social and employment matters. The assurance, which the government hopes to receive this morning, would signal an end to EU attempts to use health-and-safety legislation to circumvent Britain's opt-out from the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty. The assurance is intended to address widespread fears among Conservative backbenchers that the EU is determined to roll back de-regulatory reforms introduced by the Conservatives since 1979. The most recent example occurred two weeks ago, when the government was forced to announce a Pounds 65m increase in maternity payments because of a European directive. Other examples include: A European parliament vote to force Britain to limit working hours for young people such as paper boys and girls. The government wants the vote overturned, if necessary by the European Court. A House of Lords ruling that the 1978 Employment Protection Act is unlawful because it fails to comply with EU legislation on the rights of part-time workers. Other social and employment policy initiatives emerging from Brussels are equally at odds with the liberalising instincts of the British government. These include proposals for compulsory works councils, which would give unions a voice in running British companies. Mr Padraig Flynn, the EU social affairs commissioner, is preparing a green paper on job creation which is expected to culminate in a social action plan to help halve the EU's level of unemployment to 9m workers.</p>

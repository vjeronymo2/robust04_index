			<p>BFN     [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, the president of the presidency  of our country, today sent a letter to John Major, the prime  minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern  Ireland. In the letter, President Izetbegovic thanked Prime  Minister Major for his letter of 21 April. I am pleased that  the Minister of State Douglas Hogg will visit Sarajevo during  the first week of May. We will welcome him and wish him success  in his mission. As you suggested, during the visit we can agree  on the date and the program of my and my prime minister's visit  to London. I also wish to thank you for your message regarding  the tragedy of Gorazde and for your government's active role in  passing the latest UN and NATO resolutions. These resolutions  have considerably alleviated the situation for the tens of  thousands of Gorazde citizens but unfortunately peace and safety  from Serb attacks are still far away.    I am glad to hear that your government shares the view that  a  peaceful solution to Bosnia-Herzegovina implies the withdrawal  of Karadzic's Serbs from the considerable part of the occupied  territories. In our view, these are the areas with the majority  Muslim and Croatian population before the aggression, President  Izetbegovic says in conclusion of his letter to British Prime  Minister John Major.</p>

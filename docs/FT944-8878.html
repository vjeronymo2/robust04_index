			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Region mostly hesitant awaiting US trend Afternoon buying by dealers helped share prices recoup earlier losses resulting from profit-taking by institutional investors, and arbitrage unwinding, and the Nikkei 225 average finished with a marginal decline, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index was off 85.02 at 19,306.66 after a day's high of 19,444.29 and low of 19,252.15. Hedge selling by institutional investors depressed futures, prompting unwinding of arbitrage positions. Cross trading, or the selling and buying of shares by investors realising profits while not altering their stock portfolios, boosted activity. Volume totalled 240m shares, against 218m. Traders said the amount of 'real' stock transactions were minimal. The rise in US interest rates and the subsequent appreciation of the dollar failed to affect sentiment. 'Investors were using the Federal Open Market Committee's meeting as an excuse for inactivity,' said a dealer. The Topix index of all first section stocks dipped 3.14 to 1,525.50 and the Nikkei 300 lost 0.59 at 280.21, while falls led rises by 502 to 446, with 216 issues unchanged. The ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.27 to 1,260.77. Earnings related announcements affected share prices. Pioneer Electronic fell Y150 to Y2,360 on concern over its consolidated earnings. However, Matsushita Electric Industrial, which saw its consolidated net income for the first six months jump 49 per cent, gained Y30 at Y1,560. Nishimatsu Construction, which announced that it was expecting to post a record high recurring profit for the current business year, moved ahead Y40 to Y1,040. Murata, a machinery maker, put on Y50 at Y3,980 following reports that its consolidated after-tax profits would surge 40 per cent. Steel issues were actively traded. NKK, the day's volume leader, firmed Y2 to Y278, but Sumitomo Metal Industries slipped Y5 to Y336. Profit-taking depressed some high-technology shares. Fujitsu receded Y10 to Y1,040 and Hitachi softened Y1 to Y973. Privatisation stocks were firm, with Japan Tobacco up Y5,000 to Y996,000 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone adding Y1,000 at Y877,000. East Japan Railway, however, lost Y3,000 at Y469,000. In Osaka, the OSE average declined 28.19 to 21,409.28 in volume of 60.2m shares. Roundup Much of the region was in hesitant mood, awaiting further indications of Wall Street's likely performance in coming sessions. HONG KONG weathered a near day-long bout of profit-taking, amid disappointment at Wall Street's overnight fall after the US interest rate rise, before some late buying tipped the market back into positive territory. The Hang Seng index, which shed 61 points in morning trade, ended a net 26.58 higher at 9,592.24. Improved earnings prospects and foreign buying helped HKR International to rally 20 cents to HKDollars 7.55, while Seapower Resources added 4 cents at HKDollars 0.93 on bargain hunting. SEOUL was lower after a consolidation of financial shares, as institutional investors became defensive and individual investors began selling. The composite index dipped 7.05 to 1,118.75. Unfounded rumours of debt defaults by unlisted construction companies pressured some banks and securities houses, which have extended or guaranteed loans. The financial sub-group index fell 12.99 points to 728.76. SYDNEY ended a touch easier after negative sentiment from the bond and futures markets spilled over into stocks and pushed the market off its highs. The All Ordinaries index lost 1.1 at 1,940.3. Stocks were mixed overall, with resources issues finishing a shade firmer but industrials closing lower. Western Mining picked up 10 cents to ADollars 7.65 and MIM was 6 cents ahead at ADollars 2.60 as they continued to rebound after the heavy selling last week. KUALA LUMPUR saw widespread profit-taking drag equity prices back after initial gains. The composite index, which had risen by 40 points over the previous two sessions, declined from a day's best of 1,079.64 to close 6.59 down on the day at 1,063.15. SINGAPORE held on to small gains at the close and the Straits Times Industrial index ended 5.32 up at 2,346.50, off an intraday peak of 2,353.92. However, the UOB OTC index, tracking Malaysian stocks, retreated 7.68 to 1,189.79. BANGKOK was slightly lower on profit-taking in finance stocks as the market entered a period of consolidation. The SET index eased 7.70 to 1,489.15. KARACHI sank sharply at the close as local investors and institutions kept to the sidelines, short of cash and unnerved by political tension. The KSE 100-share index weakened 17.27 to 2,161.64. TAIPEI remained preoccupied ahead of next month's elections and the weighted index gave up 35.02 at 6,346.78 as nervous investors continued to drift out of the market. BOMBAY rebounded 1.94 per cent on renewed buying by domestic mutual funds and speculators after the sharp falls of the previous week. The BSE 30-share index, which lost more than 280 points last week, recouped 78.30 at 4,113.79.</p>

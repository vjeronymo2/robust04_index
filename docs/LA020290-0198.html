			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> GETTING READY FOR MANDELA STORY  </P> <P> With the release of apartheid foe Nelson R. Mandela from a South African prison  imminent, the networks are poised for some intense coverage -- at least as much  as the beleaguered government permits.  </P> <P> CBS News, which has a contingent from "48 Hours" in the air today in  anticipation of a forthcoming broadcast from South Africa, already has  Johannesburg bureau chief Richard Wagner on the scene, along with Bob Simon in  from Tel Aviv and Martha Teichner (for "48 Hours") in from London.  </P> <P> Correspondents Phil Jones, Richard Schlesinger and Bernard Goldberg are in the  "48 Hours" team en route.  </P> <P> ABC News has dispatched correspondent Don Kladstrup from Paris to join Richard  Sergay, the Johannesburg bureau chief.  </P> <P> NBC News has had consultant Gordon Manning and senior producer Jerry Lamprecht  in South Africa for several days trying to line up interviews. The network has  also augmented its bureau in Johannesburg with an extra crew, a producer and a  desk assistant, and correspondent Robin Lloyd will soon be joined by a second  correspondent there.  </P></p>

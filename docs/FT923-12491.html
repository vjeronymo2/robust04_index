			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Gen Consolidated General Consolidated Investment Trust raised net asset value per share by nearly 11 per cent to 172.3p at the end of June 1992, against 155.6p six months earlier. Mid-year earnings however were static at Pounds 1.65m, as a result of lower bank interest on cash deposits and reduced dividends from some companies in the trust's portfolio. Earnings per share came out at 4.54p (4.56p). The interim dividend is held at 4.3p but the directors warn that the total will be about 10 per cent lower than last year's 10.41p.</p>

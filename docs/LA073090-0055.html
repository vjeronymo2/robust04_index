			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> GENE REPLACEMENT TESTS  </P> <P> An inherited human disorder that causes retardation and skeletal abnormalities  has been cured in mice by the injection of a human gene, a researcher said last  week.  </P> <P> The technique cannot now be used in humans, but the experiment demonstrates  that gene replacement is feasible for treating an important group of human  disorders, said Edward Birkenmeier of the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Me.  </P> <P> "It works remarkably well," Birkenmeier said. "You can completely cure the  mice."  </P> <P> The mice carried a genetic mutation like that seen in the human disorder called  mucopolysaccharidosis type 7, or MPS-7, which occurs in about one in 25,000  births. The seven forms of MPS are characterized by genetic defects that leave  the body without an enzyme needed to break down and dispose of waste products.  </P> <P> Birkenmeier has eliminated the symptoms of MPS-7 in afflicted mice in two ways.  In the first, he injected the human gene into fertilized mouse eggs, which were  then grown into healthy mice. In the second, he removed bone marrow cells from  afflicted mice, inserted the gene into the cells, and put the cells back into  bone marrow, where they replicated and produced the missing enzyme.  </P></p>

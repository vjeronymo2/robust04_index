			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN RALLIES TO TIE WASHINGTON IN TWO OVERTIMES  </P> <P> In regulation play and double overtime, Washington's soccer team appeared to  have Cal State Northridge beaten Wednesday night.  </P> <P> But Steve Linhart and Danny Daniels, Matador forwards who recently had been  sidelined because of injuries, scored to help CSUN tie the 19th-ranked Huskies,  3-3, before 542 at North Campus Stadium.  </P> <P> With his back to the net and 3 minutes 21 seconds remaining in the second  overtime, Daniels took a pass from Armando Valdivia, turned, and shot blindly  from 25 yards out to tie the score for the final time. Regular-season games do  not proceed beyond two overtimes.  </P> <P> "I knew where I was and I didn't have time to look or to think," said Daniels  of his first career goal.  </P> <P> After missing the first 3 1/2 matches of the season with a hyperextended  Achilles' tendon, Daniels entered the match against Washington just before  halftime.  </P> <P> "I was thinking I got to get on the field and do something good," Daniels said.  "Those two weeks out were the longest I've ever been hurt."  </P> <P> The sophomore from the island of Cyprus also figured in the CSUN goal that tied  the score, 2-2, with 2:11 left in regulation.  </P> <P> Just as he was attempting to shoot from close range, Daniels was tackled by  Husky defender James Dunn and the Matadors were awarded a penalty kick.  </P> <P> Linhart, a junior from Thousand Oaks High, scored with a boot to the right  corner. Washington keeper Rolf Norton got a hand on it when he dived, but  barely slowed the ball on its way into the net.  </P> <P> It was Linhart's second goal of the game in only his first start. He had been  used as a reserve because his knee was weak following surgery June 30.  </P> <P> "I didn't get into top form until two weeks ago," said Linhart, who played for  CSUN as a freshman in 1987 but missed the '88 season as a redshirt and last  season to concentrate on his studies.  </P> <P> Washington (3-0-1) scored 12 minutes into overtime on a goal by Shannon Murray.  Daniels appeared to clear the rebound off Chad Crithfield's corner kick, but it  deflected off a CSUN player and landed near Murray.  </P> <P> CSUN trailed, 1-0, at halftime but tied the score less than four minutes into  the second half. Bobby Reyes' corner kick started the play. The perfectly  targeted crossing pass soared over a bottleneck of players in front of the net  and was headed by Gus Cardenas. He laid the ball at the feet of Linhart, who  booted it into the net.  </P> <P> Matador midfielder Terry Davila suffered a concussion. He already had 21  stitches in his forehead following a collision last weekend.  </P> <P> CSUN captain Ed Burns limped off the field with a left knee injury in the first  half.  </P></p>

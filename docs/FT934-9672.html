			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / RAF condemns Treasury THE HEAD of the Royal Air Force last night made an extraordinary verbal attack against what he claimed was a campaign to discredit the armed services prior to public expenditure cuts. The outspoken declaration by Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydon, chief of the air staff, reflected bitter resentment in the armed forces at the prospect of a further expenditure squeeze. Sir Michael appeared to point the finger at Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, who is a leading government critic of inefficiencies in the forces. Breaking the normal rule of discretion for service chiefs Sir Michael complained that a 'disreputable' campaign had been conducted to discredit the RAF as well as the other services. 'We know who has instigated it,' he said in a speech to the Air League in London. He blamed the campaign on 'the same people who basked in the reflected glory of the Gulf war'. In particular he objected to 'silly and dishonest' comparisons that had been drawn between the number of senior staff in the RAF and those in the Israeli air force. Every air force appeared to have more personnel for each combat aircraft than Israel, which had in effect been at war since the 1950s, he said. 'I say to those detractors: stop undermining the services,' Sir Michael said. The RAF, which is already reducing its personnel to well below the 75,000 level foreseen in the 1990 Options for Change review, now faces significant further cuts, particularly in its support branches. Government public-spending plans, due to be announced in the Budget on November 30, include a reduction of about Pounds 1bn in defence spending over three years. The largest reduction will come in 1996-97 and it implies similar reductions over the remainder of the 15-year period of the Ministry of Defence's long-term planning cycle. Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Conservative chairman of the Commons defence committee, last night joined the row with a strong defence of Sir Michael, Philip Stephens writes. Sir Nicholas, speaking on BBC television, accused the Treasury of 'deliberate and misleading leaks' in its determination to force through defence cuts. He said the leaks, almost certainly from senior Treasury civil servants, had probably been sanctioned by ministers. Sir Nicholas, who has threatened a Tory backbench rebellion if spending cuts bite too deeply into the defence budget, said he wanted Treasury officials to appear before his committee to answer the charges.</p>

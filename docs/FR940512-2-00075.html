			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Such additional technical criteria regarding transaction information transmitted and the format for transmission of such information as is reasonably appropriate for third party ATM processing for unaffiliated multiple banks. No such criteria shall distinguish or discriminate between intercept processors and third party processors, except that volume discounts may be offered in a nondiscriminatory manner as provided in paragraph IV.G of this Final Judgment. Defendant shall not require any third party processor to satisfy additional certification requirements, or pay additional certification fees (other than reasonable set-up fees), by reason of its seeking or obtaining the business of additional customers as long as the processor elects to employ for these additional customers a message format/communications protocol combination for which defendant already has certified the processor. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Notwithstanding the foregoing, Defendant is not required to certify as a qualified processor any branded ATM network that is dominant on a state-wide basis or a subsidiary of such network that seeks to become a qualified processor in the MAC or any successor branded ATM network controlled by Defendant unless reciprocal access to become a processor in that network is available on a substantially similar basis as to pricing and terms to all qualified third party processors including other branded ATM networks that offer third party ATM or authorization processing to depository institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> F. Defendant shall not terminate any third party processor's access to the MAC or any successor branded ATM network controlled by defendant except on written notice to the processor thirty (30) days before such termination, except that Defendant can terminate any processor immediately if that processor: (1) Fails to pay at any time specified fees, charges or other amounts due and owed to defendant or any participant in defendant's branded ATM network; (2) violates any law or government regulation applicable to it that has adverse effect upon the MAC or any successor branded ATM network controlled by defendant; (3) has a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding filed against it; or (4) appoints or has appointed by court order a trustee or receiver for any substantial part of its property. Defendant shall provide a copy of any notice of termination to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, to the attention of counsel of record or their named successors. Any termination in violation of this Final Judgment shall constitute a contempt of this Court and be punishable thereby.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> G. Defendant shall not discriminate in the pricing of branded ATM network access to the MAC or any successor branded ATM network controlled by defendant on the basis of a customer's choice of ATM processor, but shall offer branded ATM network access on a nondiscriminatory basis, except that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Defendant may offer volume discounts on branded ATM network access fees on a nondiscriminatory basis, provided that defendant shall permit any depository institution or third party processor for a depository institution to aggregate that institution's transaction volume delivered to a MAC switch, and any such depository institution shall be entitled to any such nondiscriminatory volume discount. Defendant shall not offer volume discounts to a depository institution operating as an intercept processor that are more favorable than those offer to a depository institution that obtains ATM or authorization processing from a qualified third party processor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Defendant shall be permitted to offer depository institutions the option of obtaining transaction switching between member depository institutions by third party processors at nondiscriminatory royalties that shall not be greater than the price for switched transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Baiba Melnace: "Government's Internal Debt Is </F> Growing"]    [Text] Riga, 5 May -- Parliament has accepted amendments  to the state budget law, which foresee a 41,253 million lat [Ls]  increase in the maximum state internal debt. The amendments  increase income by Ls18.15 million and expenditures by Ls21.44  million.    The accepted amendments are connected mainly with children's  benefits. Ls17.39 million have been earmarked for this purpose.  Other big expenses (Ls4.8 million) are granted for the increase  in the wages of the employees of state security institutions --  in the Ministries of Defense and Home Affairs, as well as in  Home Guards and the Security Service. Part of the expenses are  connected with the increase in the minimum wage from Ls15 to  22.5, adopted by the Cabinet of Ministers. Colleges will  receive an additional Ls220,000; health protection -- Ls201,000.  Additional funds are allocated for orphanages, and centers for  social aid and rehabilitation, but at the same time, funds are  reduced for homes for the elderly and disabled, as well as for  boarding-schools for disabled youth.    At the same time, there are plans to increase the budget by  Ls9.18 million, preserving the same tax tariffs, but not  foreseeing any reduced rates in this field. The government  expects to gain Ls565,000 from the social tax payments, because  the minimum wage has been raised and the minimum amount of  tax-free duties has been reduced. It also expects to acquire  Ls2.95 million from the budgets of towns and regions, and Ls5.44  million from the joint stock company "Lata International"  credit, and credit interest.    The Ls41.2 million growth of the state internal debt is  connected with the Latvian Savings Bank and Latvian Universal  Bank rehabilitation program. As State Budget Minister Janis  Platais reported, government securities are to be issued in the  amount of Ls57.5 million, which will be deposited in these  banks. Simultaneously, the state internal debt, in the amount of  Ls23.4 million, connected with the savings of the population,  existing in the Savings Bank but not covered by assets, (the  so-called lost Moscow assets, which until now have not been  officially settled) is to be reduced. The government securities  are supposed to yield a profit, and both banks will be able to  recover, J. Platais said.    The state budget minister also said that the funds assigned  for the rehabilitation of both banks will be returned to the  state budget. The part of the state funds connected with the  servicing of bad credits will be allotted to the banks on  condition that the bad credits are repaid. In that case, the  bank will keep 15 percent of the amount of the credit at its  disposal, while 85 percent will be used to cancel the government  securities.    The parliament accepted a total reduction of budget  expenditures of Ls553.000, and an increase in expenses of  Ls520,000. The cost of implementing the law on civil service,  reform of the Ministry of Interior Affairs, and training of the  State Reform Ministry clerks was reduced. As a result,  additional funds were gained by State Land Service, cultural  institutions, Central Elections Commission, Saeima, and the car  service of the Saeima.</p>

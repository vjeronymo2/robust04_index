			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Books: The liberals South Africa has left behind RETURN TO PARADISE by Breyten Breytenbach Faber Pounds 17.50, 224 pages IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS by Helen Suzman Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 17.99, 310 pages THE LADY: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF WINNIE MANDELA by Emma Gilbey Jonathan Cape Pounds 18.99, 328 pages As South Africa toils towards next April's election and majority rule - towards the 'New Sarth Efrica' as Breyten Breytenbach puts it - some of those who fought the long battle for democracy are bowing out: the exiled Poet, the retired Politician and the discgraced Leader's Lady. The Poet is Breytenbach, an Afrikaner who fell out with his country(men) when he married a Vietnamese in the heyday of apartheid in 1973. They were given a special dispensation to visit his country, a trip which produced A Season in Paradise. He became politicised and returned illegally on behalf of the ANC in 1975. He was jailed for seven years - which led to The True Confessions of an Albino Terrorist. He describes Return to Paradise, an account of a three-month tour of the country in 1991, as the last part of a triptych. He describes a transformed country country which used to be his own but is no longer. 'Why did I come back? . . . .to complete the incomplete, for annihilation, deathwish. Why will I not return to stay? Too late now. Foreigner here. Painted monkey. Bitter dreams . . .' He is saddened as he zig-zags around the country, interspersing what must be diary entries with recollections of visits to West Africa, where in 1987 he helped to arrange the first meetings between South African progressives and Black Africa. Breytenbach says: 'I am looking at the future and it chills me to the bone'. His host, friend and sponsor for the visit is Van Zyl Slabbert, the politician-academic who quit the whites-only parliament to the anger of his fellow Progressives in 1986. At the end they have an awful row. Slabbert shouts at him, 'You make out as if you're the only ones who cares' It is the South African liberals' indictment of the exiles. This is a fascinating, quiet, detailed journal, full of acute and witty insight and striking vignettes. South Africa's two most famous women are 'Helen' and 'Winnie'. Helen Suzman was an MP for 26 years and for half of them was the single truly anti-apartheid figure in the Cape Town Assembly. She was - and is - a wonderful woman, brave, formidable, indefatigable, witty, twinkling. She started out on the liberal wing of the United Party in 1953, split in 1959 to form the Progressive Party, soldiered on alone from 1961-74, and only stepped down in 1989, not entirely happy about the emergence of the present opposition Democratic Party. Her autobiography is disappointing only because it does not go far enough. It reads like an extended version of one of her famous Report-Back meetings to her posh northern Johannesburg constituency - it describes the detail of her political career but holds back not just on personal things but on many other areas of delicacy: for example, her fury at Van Zyl's desertion of the parliamentary party is inadequately reported, and her thoughts about 'Winnie' could surely have been developed now that she does not have to play the politician. Helen Suzman has her place in the history books, and the affection of many of the leaders of the New Sarth Efrica, but there is a necessary argument about her role. Did she somehow help legitimise an utterly undemocratic government which was happy to let her travel the world abusing them? Was she right, Van Zyl wrong? And, more important, can we now see that her passionate opposition to sanctions throughout the 1980s was misguided? Or not? Perhaps she should be best remembered as a most valiant champion of the oppressed - 'Our Lady of the Prisoners', as Breytenbach once described her. The story of Winnie Mandela is a terrible tragedy, and Emma Gilbey has had the sense to tell it straight. As everyone knows, the pretty girl from the Transkei married the charismatic and much older Nelson Mandela just a couple of years before he vanished into 26 years of imprisonment. The young Winnie seems to have assumed that she would deputise for him, but her qualifications to do so were inadequate, as was her character. She was very brave but - this is Ms Gilbey's central point - the police broke her in interrogation in 1969. When she was banished to the Free State in 1977 she was still very brave but by then something had gone wrong: she had been abused beyond the endurance of anyone but a saint. There followed drink and men and money mysteries and a violent temper which, when she returned to Soweto, were to lead to the notorious 'Mandela Soccer Club' and a reign of terror which resulted in her house being burned down by her own people. Then came the kidnapping and murder of 14-year-old 'Stompie', after which she lost most of her remaining sympathy and eventually came to trial. Here was a nightmare for the ANC leaders in exile, let alone for her loving husband-in-prison. ANC leader Oliver Tambo buries his face in his hands: 'What must I do? We can't control her. The ANC can't control her'. Winnie rapidly became a liability to the entire anti-apartheid movement. The South African government would have been thanking the good lord, except that they could hardly risk a long jail sentence when she continued to command the support of the unemployed and uneducated urban youth. In the end, in June 1993, the Appeal Court gave her a suspended sentence. Nelson, out of prison in 1990, left her in 1991, by which time the new generation ANC leadership had taken necessary steps to sideline her. Was it the ANC's own fault? In Ms Gilbeys words, in 1980 'the movement needed a figure within the country who could act cohesively as a symbol to draw the elements of the 'Release Mandela' campaign together. Winnie came to be chosen because in the abstract she was the ideal choice. Here was someone in a tragic situation who was sympathetic and charismatic, who was courageous, outspoken and to top it all was the beautiful wife of their leader. On paper she was perfect. But she was not perfect . . .'</p>

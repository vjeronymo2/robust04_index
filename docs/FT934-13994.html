			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Interest hits Waste Management - Pace of acquisitions poised to continue in fourth quarter WASTE MANAGEMENT International, the UK-listed arm of WMX Technologies of the US, reported a 3 per cent decline, from Pounds 40.1m to Pounds 38.9m, in third-quarter pre-tax profits. Turnover in the three months to September 30 increased to Pounds 235.1m (Pounds 210.9m) and operating profits jumped 21 per cent to Pounds 42.8m (Pounds 35.4m). The gain in operating profits, however, was more than offset by substantially higher net interest costs of Pounds 8.47m (Pounds 827,000) and lower other income - including foreign exchange earnings and dividend income from the 15per cent stake in Wessex Water - of Pounds 4.53m (Pounds 5.51m). After a reduced tax charge of Pounds 10.7m (Pounds 13.4m) and minority interests of Pounds 2.54m (Pounds 3.88m) the group recorded retained profits of Pounds 25.6m (Pounds 22.8m) and earnings per share of 6.8p (6.1p). Mr Edwin Falkman, chief executive, said the earnings increase had been achieved despite difficult trading conditions in Europe and fewer acquisitions than had been anticipated. He added that the results were also adversely affected by delays in obtaining landfill permit extensions in Italy, which caused lower volumes. However, he added: 'We anticipate that volumes to these landfills will increase later this year.' Mr Falkman also said that Waste Management had made 'significant progress in several markets in Asia', including Hong Kong and Indonesia. So far this year the group has completed 34 acquisitions in 10 countries and, following a lull over the summer, expects this pace of activity to continue in the fourth quarter. The results lift nine-month pre-tax profits to Pounds 110.3m (Pounds 102.7m) on turnover ahead 17 per cent to Pounds 690.9m (Pounds 592.8m). Earnings per share were also up by 17 per cent, to 19.6p (16.8p). The group was floated on the Stock Exchange through a listing of 20 per cent of its shares in April last year by Waste Management, since renamed WMX Technologies. As indicated at the time of the flotation, the company is not paying a dividend for the first three years. See Lex</p>

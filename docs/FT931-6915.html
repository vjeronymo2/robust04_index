			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gatt expects beef export fall to continue WORLD BEEF exports fell by 2 to 3 per cent in 1992 and a similar decline is likely in 1993, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade says in a report published today. In its annual review of international meat markets, Gatt highlights a continuing slump in European Community beef exports, which now account for about a quarter of the world total. The EC itself is predicting a drop of 22 per cent in beef exports this year after a 12 per cent fall in 1992. Despite lower production, EC beef stocks ended 1992 at record levels of about 1m tonnes. Australia has regained the top spot among the world's beef exporters from the EC, which is followed by the US in third place, New Zealand and Brazil. Argentina's shipments plunged nearly 30 per cent last year because of rising production costs and the strong currency. 'Major changes in world market shares are likely in 1993,' the report says, predicting fresh gains by the US and Brazil at the expense of the EC and New Zealand. World beef and veal production is estimated to have declined by about 1 per cent in 1992, largely because of lower output in the EC, central Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States. Gatt expects a further 1 to 2 per cent slide in 1993, mostly the result of falling EC production. The Gatt report says prospects for the international beef market are clouded by the uncertain economic outlook and changing diets. In many countries consumers have switched to cheaper poultry meat, which now represents a quarter of world meat production. In the US, per capita consumption of poultry meat, at 43 kg the highest in the world, roughly equalled that of beef for the first time last year. In the EC, beef consumption stagnated or fell in all countries except for Spain and Portugal. Import demand is set to rise substantially in Japan and other East Asian countries, especially South Korea, but elsewhere will remain sluggish, Gatt says. EC exports in particular are being hit by falling demand from the Commonwealth of Independent States. Gatt expects beef prices to weaken further in the US but to remain firm in East Asia and to strengthen in Europe as a result of lower EC production and a possible rise in beef demand in central Europe and the CIS. Gatt's Arrangement on Bovine Meat, designed to expand and liberalise world meat trade, has 27 members (the EC counting as one) which account for about 90 per cent of world beef exports and about 60 per cent of consumption and production.

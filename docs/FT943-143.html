			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Hopkinsons in red but interim held Hopkinsons Group, the industrial abrasives and engineering concern, yesterday reported a first half pre-tax loss of Pounds 749,000, but is maintaining its interim dividend of 0.5p per share. The loss for the six months to July 31 compared with profits of Pounds 722,000 a year earlier and reflected exceptional items of Pounds 1.36m. Reorganisation of the bonded abrasives business produced a Pounds 1.5m charge, offset partly by a profit on the disposal of the drinks equipment business. Before exceptional items, pre-tax profits fell by 15 per cent to Pounds 611,000. Operating profit overall declined by 9 per cent to Pounds 1.02m (Pounds 1.12m), but rose 37 per cent to Pounds 697,000 for continuing operations. Sales rose from Pounds 51.7m to Pounds 53.8m. Mr Bill Goodall, chairman, said progress had been made in implementing the company's strategic review. The sale of the drinks equipment subsidiary had realised cash proceeds of Pounds 5.1m and the reorganisation of the abrasives operations in Germany and the UK would be 'well on the way to completion' by the end of the year. After a tax credit of Pounds 401,000, there was a net loss of Pounds 348,000 (profit of Pounds 722,000). Losses per share were 0.45p (earnings of 0.91p). On the outlook for abrasives, Hopkinsons said the German market was showing signs of recovery, albeit somewhat unevenly, while the UK market was improving steadily. In the Bryan Donkin engineering business, South America and the Far East offered good prospects for growth in sales of gas controls and machinery.</p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Discounting forces down retail inflation INFLATION at the retail level has shown a sharp fall, helped by a drop in the price of seasonal foods, widespread discounting in shops and only a small rise in the prices of many services. The Central Statistical Office said yesterday that the retail prices index (RPI) rose in the year to June by 3.9 per cent, from 4.3 per cent in May. The June figure is the lowest since last October. The RPI excluding mortgage interest payments - a measure favoured by the Treasury as indicating underlying inflation - rose by 4.8 per cent in the 12 months to June after 5.3 per cent in May. That is the smallest increase in the measure since June 1988. The Treasury said that, on the basis of an unpublished internal study, the equivalent inflation rate for the European Community as a whole was 4.9 per cent in June. That meant UK inflation was for the first time since 1986 lower than the EC average, if the two are measured on a comparable basis. Between May and June the RPI stayed unchanged at 139.3. There was a relatively sharp 0.4 per cent increase in the index between the comparable months last year. Of the fall of 0.4 points between year-on-year inflation in May and June, roughly half was due to a fall in the prices of seasonal foods, particularly potatoes, British lamb and fresh fish. Last month the price of this type of food fell by 2.9 per cent, while in June last year - due largely to wet weather - prices increased by the same amount. As a result of that statistical quirk, prices for seasonal foods dropped 6.8 per cent in the 12 months to last month - the biggest year-on-year drop for the items since 1984. Prices of household goods such as furniture and carpets showed a 0.1 per cent fall between May and June. That resulted in a year-on-year increase last month of 2.6 per cent, the lowest for this class of goods since 1987. Do-it-yourself products for home decorating also saw lower prices, as did some processed vegetables such as baked beans. Prices of leisure services, such as charges for sports activities and those for personal services including hairdressing, both saw an increase of just 0.1 per cent between May and June. Prices associated with motoring showed a 0.2 per cent increase between May and June, to make the year-on-year rise in those prices last month 7.5 per cent. Petrol prices fell during June by about 1p a gallon, while prices of many secondhand cars went up.</p>

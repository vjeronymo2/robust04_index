			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Chugayev of IZVESTIYA: "Social Accord </F> Treaty Stabilizes Situation in Russia"]    [Text] The calm, peaceful atmosphere in which the May Day  festivities largely passed off in Moscow and throughout Russia  provides serious grounds for the conclusion that the Treaty on  Social Accord signed ahead of the holidays has proven quite an  effective document, contrary to many forecasts.    Essentially before the signing of the treaty Russia was once  again confronted with a choice: Either switch to resolving all  political, economic, and class contradictions through talks and  compromise, or continue the war until victory. Until one side  had totally annihilated its political opponents. Today it is  becoming quite clear that what transpired in October of last  year in Moscow was a sharp skirmish between forces seeking to  destroy their opponent and forces seeking accord. As we can  see, those who were victorious in October have used their  victory not in order to annihilate their opponents but in order  to achieve accord.    The treaty's critics declare that it has been imposed from a  position of strength, concerns only the elite, and originated in  the Kremlin, not in the midst of the people's masses. This is  fundamentally true. But it should not be forgotten that, first,  it is a matter of the constitutional strength of the president  and the executive branch, and, second, the political elites that  took part in signing the treaty reflect precisely the sentiments  of the people's masses. Scarcely anyone would dispute Russian  society's desire for peace and accord inside the country.    Ultimately what matters is not the form of the treaty. What  matters is the fact that at long last the idea of a quest for  dialogue between different political forces has met with broad  support. Such documents, even if they outwardly appear  superficial, are entirely capable of changing the face of  society and helping it to embark firmly on the road of  democratic development and rid itself once and for all of the  threat of dictatorship which constantly hangs over it (as  confirmed by A. Rutskoy's recent statement regarding his  intention to create a social-patriotic, essentially paramilitary  party in order to seize power). And the president of Russia, as  the initiator of the conclusion of the treaty, here played what  is for him a not altogether common constructive role.    At the same time, paradoxical though it may appear, the  treaty on accord has split the Russian political elite into two  camps -- signatories and nonsignatories. This is primarily  testimony to the strict pragmatism of both camps.  Characteristically, the killing of State Duma Deputy A.  Aydzerdzis on the eve of the signing of the treaty, contrary to  many expectations, did not wreck the signing ceremony.  Incidentally, the same goes for the president's refusal to  replace the minister of internal affairs.    If you analyze the deep-seated essence of the treaty, you  may  come to the conclusion that it offers essentially a mechanism  for the preservation, redistribution, and transfer of power in  Russia. It is easy to see that the overwhelming majority of  signatories to the treaty are already part of the power  structure in one degree or form or another. By the fact of  their signature they demonstrated that they are ready to waive  some convictions in order to start cooperation with the  president and the executive branch without waiting for the next  elections and that they are prepared to continue this  cooperation even after 1996. Naturally, they are hoping here to  increase their share of power.    V. Zhirinovskiy's party is acting most frankly here. The  party leaders declare quite frankly that, unlike V. Zorkin, who  once wanted to see B. Yeltsin as a Russian De Gaulle or F.  Roosevelt, they consider the role of a Russian Hindenburg more  advisable for the president. So they intend to press for the  appointment of V. Zhirinovskiy to a key government post. So  that the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader, while  gaining the statesman's image he needs, can use his ministerial  post as a springboard to vault into the presidency. However,  these plans are scarcely destined to be realized so long as the  LDPR's influence among the president's entourage is negligible.    At the same time it looks as though the LDPR leaders are not  the only ones entertaining such thoughts. And the statement  made by V. Chernomyrdin in Orenburg that no personnel changes  are expected in the Russian Government in the immediate future  should scarcely be regarded as pure chance.    For their part the political leaders who firmly refused to  sign the treaty -- primarily A. Rutskoy and G. Yavlinskiy --  quite clearly gambled on a different way of coming to power.  This strategy is based not on slow integration with the  authorities (which, incidentally, is simply impossible for them  both under the present regime), but on instant arrival in power.  The hope here is presumably that there will be a sharp  deterioration in the economic situation in the country and, as a  consequence, that voters will turn against the entire political  elite implicated in running the state.    But, as always happens with such splits, a number of  political leaders are between the two camps. The most dramatic  figure in this respect was G. Zyuganov, who came to the Kremlin  but did not sign the treaty. Thereby demonstrating the utter  contradictoriness of his position. It looks as though, as an  experienced politician and a true pragmatist, the CPRF  [Communist Party of the Russian Federation] leader realizes the  need to sign the treaty but, being tightly bound by plenum  decisions, he is forced to comply with party discipline. The  Agrarian leader M. Lapshin looks much more prosaic against this  background. He did not come to the Kremlin. The next day he  took part in a press conference by the "hard-line  nonsignatories" -- the leaders of the "Accord for Russia" bloc.  However, in the Duma corridors he immediately disowned his  neighbors at the press conference and, according to information  from reliable sources, will soon sign the treaty once he has  obtained the requisite concessions from the government in the  agrarian sphere.    Overall, analysis of the initial period of operation of the  treaty on accord makes it possible to conclude that it has  become yet another powerful stabilizing factor in Russian  domestic political life. And in principle there are now no  factors in the country capable of seriously unbalancing the  situation. The main potential source of destabilization -- the  question of the president's health -- has apparently lost its  urgency. Since the conclusion of the treaty the problem of the  worsening economic situation can now be resolved by civilized  means, up to and including changes to the government.    The problem of crime and corruption presents a serious  threat  to stability. The fact that the president has signed a  directive on checking the "purity of the ranks" of staffers of  the top state apparatus gives grounds for assuming that the  state authorities are at last launching a large-scale offensive  on this "front." Which in turn makes it possible to conclude  that the signing of the treaty on accord has on the whole led to  a strengthening of the executive branch and of its collaboration  with the legislative branch and ultimately to a strengthening of  the state.</p>

			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND CHECKLIST FOR DEDICATED DIGGERS AND PLANTERS: GARDENING  </P> <P> For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of  Nurserymen:  </P> <P> Bedding begonias can give you immediate color in the late summer or fall garden  and can be counted on for a repeat performance next spring.  </P> <P> When cutting flowers to fill indoor vases, make clean cuts with sharp clippers  or a knife; these cuts will heal faster than ragged edges.  </P> <P> Take inventory of the garden: Snip off infected leaves, dead flowers and  awkward shoots; you'll get better, more continuous blooms by keeping faded  blooms trimmed.  </P> <P> Don't fertilize your lawn just before leaving on vacation. Tender new growth  could suffer if there's a heat wave while you're gone.  </P></p>

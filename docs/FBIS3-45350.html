Speaking after an opening ceremony  today, Patten stressed that Britain will not abandon what it  believes to be right for the territory. That is despite China's  threat to revamp after 1997 all electoral arrangements  unilaterally laid down by Britain before the takeover. Linda Li  reports:    [Li] "Governor Chris Patten remains as defiant as he is,  though many question how Hong Kong will benefit from his  electoral reform proposals when they will last only up to  mid-1997."    [Patten] "It isn't a very persuasive argument to say, that  if China chooses to or says it will break all the windows after  1997, that we should break them in 1994 and 1995."    [Li] "It's discharging British sovereignty, Patten stresses,  to put in place a fair and reasonable set of electoral  arrangements for Hong Kong's district organizations and  Legislative Council [Legco]. Talking about his trip to London  tomorrow, Patten believes the British ministers will want to  hear his views on when to table the second portion of his  political reform bill in Legco. The main consideration, he says,  is to proceed in a sensible, step- by-step manner, and the  priority is to get the present bill onto the statue book. In a  separate interview with the Singapore Broadcasting Corporation,  Patten said he would be disappointed if Legco didn't pass his  bill."    [Patten] "I certainly don't intend to put proposals to the  Legislative Council which I would like the Legislative Council  to water down or change in some way. That's not political  leadership."    [Li] "While Patten appears to be a tiger in a battlefield,  he's willing to bow out gracefully from the political scene in  three and a half years' time."    [Patten] "And I rather doubt whether there is a life in  politics -- in British politics for me after this. After this I  will be 52, 53. On present likelihood, it would be between  elections. I wouldn't be able to fight an election for another  two or three years after that. I think I will be looking to  other forms of public service after this job."    [Li] "But until then, the governor vows to stay on until  June 30, 1997. Linda Li, TVB News."</p>

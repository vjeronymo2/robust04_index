			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Chance of poll boost seen for Labour LABOUR would sharply improve its chances of winning the coming general election if it gave public backing to electoral reform, according to new opinion poll findings. The policy shift could lift Labour's support by 3 percentage points nationally and provoke a 4.5 per cent swing in the Conservatives' southern heartlands. Detailed poll results, gathered by Mori for the Electoral Reform Society, show that Labour would also pick up one in five Liberal Democrat votes. The survey, conducted in April with 1,992 people, showed Labour turning a deficit of 2 percentage points into a 1-point lead over the Tories if the policy commitment was made.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 13 Jun (EFE) -- The  presidents of Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela here on Monday  signed the free trade agreement of the Group of Three (G-3),  which calls for a gradual elimination of tariffs among these  nations within 10 years.    The agreement was signed by Mexican President Carlos  Salinas,  Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera, and Colombian President  Cesar Gaviria. They will participate, beginning on Tuesday, in  the Fourth Ibero-American summit of chiefs of state and  government in this city in northwestern Colombia.    The treaty, which was signed at the Presidential Home for  Illustrious Guests, will benefit 150 million inhabitants of  these three countries, and in initial stages, will generate  business amounting to $600 million per year. Its signing was  achieved after more than three years of efforts that nearly  failed in May.    The G-3 agreement will go into effect in early 1995, and for  Colombia and Venezuela it offers an opportunity to request  membership in NAFTA, of which Mexico is a signatory as well as  the United States and Canada.</p>

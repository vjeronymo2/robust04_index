			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> OVERRIDE OF VETO ON MENTAL HEALTH FAILS  </P> <P> An effort to override Gov. George Deukmejian's veto of $15 million in mental  health aid failed in the Assembly. The 45-24 vote fell well short of the  two-thirds majority of 54.  </P> <P> The attempt was squelched by the same Republican defense of the governor that  has safeguarded every Deukmejian veto since he took office in January, 1983.  Democrats hold a 46-33 majority with one vacancy. The bill would have restored  $15 million in financing for community mental health programs. Defending the  veto, Deukmejian said the $1.1-million rainy-day reserve in this year's budget  already has been cut in half by earthquake-related costs and revenue revisions.  He also said state mental health spending has increased from $630 million to  $1.25 billion since 1983, and community mental health aid has doubled to $793  million.  </P></p>

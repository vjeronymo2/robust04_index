"The South Korean Government regrets that the U.S.  administration decided to revive the Super 301 provision on  March 3, at a point when the Uruguay Round multilateral trade  talks had been concluded after seven years of negotiations and  when the world trade organization is to be formally launched  from 1995 after an official signing next month," a Foreign  Ministry spokesman said.    The spokesman reminded that Seoul had repeatedly stressed in  South Korean-U.S. economic talks that trade disputes should not  be dealt with through the domestic procedures of any single  nation.    Seoul re-emphasizes its belief that disputes "should be  resolved through the strengthened and supplemented settlement  procedures of the world trade organization," the spokesman said.</p>

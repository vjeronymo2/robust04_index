			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Belgium proposes carbon tax THE Belgian Presidency of the EC yesterday called for a carbon energy tax to offset the costs of reducing employers' mandatory social security contributions and boosting job creation, writes Lionel Barber in Brussels. Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgian prime minister, told the European economic and social committee in Brussels that the carbon tax should be part of a European-wide response to the twin challenge of unemployment and the need to curb state budget deficits. Mr Dehaene's call came as the Belgian coalition government is struggling to put together its latest austerity plan aimed at trimming the huge state budget deficit, and reassuring the financial markets about the stability of the Belgian franc. One element is expected to be a reduction in employers' mandatory social security contributions, with the loss in income to the state being offset by increased indirect taxes on alcohol and tobacco. More broadly, it anticipates the White Paper on competitiveness being prepared by Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. The paper, which will examine why Europe is failing to create jobs, is to be the centrepiece of the EC summit in Brussels in December. Mr Dehaene said he was counting on the Maastricht treaty being ratified by Germany in October, so that its provisions could take effect without delay. These would include a clear demonstration of a common security and foreign policy, strengthening the European Monetary System, and provisions for European citizenship.</p>

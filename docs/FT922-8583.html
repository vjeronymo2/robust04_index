			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / International Company News: Wasserstein settles Interco suit WASSERSTEIN Perella, the investment banking business set up by two prominent Wall Street bid advisers in 1988, has agreed to pay Dollars 18.25m to Interco in settlement of a legal action brought against it by the St Louis-based furniture and shoe manufacturer. Wasserstein maintains that it has no liability to Interco, to whom it gave investment banking advice in the late 1980s. It said that the settlement 'reflects growing concerns as to the unpredictability of the outcome of jury trials, regardless of the merits of the case'. Nevertheless, the payment will be seen as a further blow to the investment banking firm, which has been losing ground in the bid-advisory league tables in recent years. Wasserstein was formed by Mr Joseph Perella and Mr Bruce Wasserstein, two high fliers previously with First Boston. It ranked third in the merger and acquisition league tables in 1989, according to Securities Data. It had slipped to 12th place last year, and came 15th in the first quarter of 1992. Interco had brought legal action against Wasserstein as a result of advice received at the end of the 1980s. The company 'recapitalised' in 1988 in an attempt to avoid a hostile takeover. This involved Interco taking on a large amount of debt and paying special dividends to shareholders. The company subsequently sought protection under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code after asset sales failed to generate as much money as projected and earnings fell short of forecasts. Interco sued its former investment banker, Wasserstein Perella, in January 1991, claiming that Wasserstein had delayed the sale of its Ethan Allen subsidiary, and caused it to accept a lower price. The Interco suit had originally asked for Dollars 109m, plus punitive damages. In March last year, an 'examiner' - a bankruptcy and creditors' rights lawyer - was asked by the bankruptcy court to consider whether the recapitalisation gave rise to possible legal claims by the company and creditors against former professional advisers. In her report, the examiner concluded that the Dollars 2.8bn recapitalisation did render Interco insolvent, and that there had, therefore, been a fraudulent conveyance of assets. However, she spread the blame widely, effectively exonerating Wasserstein on the grounds that company officials has misled it. 'They (Wasserstein) performed their services at a level that was acceptable by investment banking industry standards,' she said. The examiner added that 'their real problem was that they were not given complete information from the company'. However, her report did not address the Ethan Allen issue in any detail. No claims were subsequently brought against Wasserstein Perella over the recapitalisation itself. The Ethan Allen suit was complex, but essentially it alleged that Wasserstein 'failed and refused' to execute a fairness opinion which would have allowed a proposed sale of the subsidiary in 1988 for Dollars 475m to go ahead. The business was eventually sold for Dollars 385.5m in 1989.</p>

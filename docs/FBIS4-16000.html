			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 15, 4-10 Apr 94] </F>   [Text] On 10 April natural gas supplies will be  discontinued to those state-run enterprises, which have failed,  by the deadline, to repay their debts for earlier imported  natural gas supplies, under the most recent decision by the  Ukrainian Government.    This last resort on the part of Ukrainian gas distributors  under the State Committee for Oil and Gas (Ukrgazprom and  Ukrgaz) follows from the government's resolution No. 196 "On  enterprises' settlement for natural gas."    The Cabinet's earlier resolutions (No. 91 of 4 February, and  No. 789 of 22 September 1993), which demanded repayment of  natural gas supplies by consumer enterprises and reduced gas  supplies to those of them, which failed to timely pay for gas  supplied to them, were virtually ignored.    It was only in March, that the agents under the State  Committee for Oil and Gas took a series of actions to make the  debtor-enterprises, primarily those under the Ministry of  Industry and the Ministry of Engineering, MIC  [Military-Industrial Complex] and Conversion, remarkable for  their power-consuming production, start repayment of their  accumulating debts, or, as a most promising alternative  solution, switch to other sources of energy.    However, the State Committee for Oil and Gas can not  discontinue gas supplies to many of its clients, be they most  inveterate defaulters, without running the grave risk of  breaking their technological processes, which may cause  technical failures and accidents.    The latest resolution, No. 196, allows the State Committee  for Oil and Gas to resort to complete suspension of gas  delivery, if the debtors fail to settle by 10 April. The  responsibility for likely consequences will lie entirely on the  debtor-enterprises' managers.    In view of this qualitatively novel situation, the managers  will have to rely on their enterprises' currency means,  including those on accounts with foreign banks, however  reluctant they may be to do this.    For several months by now, the government has been very  unswervingly trying to make Ukrainian export-capable enterprises  share the burden of payment for imported Russian fuels.    As Ukrgazprom and Ukrgaz spokespersons maintain, the thus  changed system of payments (prepayments thrice a month by  consumer-enterprises of their contractual gas consignments) and  final settling for 1993's supplies, will allow the State  Committee for Oil and Gas to accumulate, within a relatively  brief period, means, necessary for settling with the Russian  natural gas suppliers. Moreover so that the government's earlier  resolutions contain provisions demanding settling in hard  currency by those enterprises, which have currency means on  their bank accounts.    However, natural gas supply reductions by the government's  decision do not extend to enterprises, which operate in the  housing, communal services and public amenities sector of  Ukraine's national economy, financed through the state budget.  Instead, regional administrations have been instructed to  tighten their control over rational gas consumption by these  enterprises.    To speedily implement the mechanism for mutual settlement  with Russia's gas suppliers, the Ukrainian Government has  endorsed a scheme, which provides for the debt's repayment with  Ukrainian commodities through the agency of Ukrzarubezhneftegaz  (Ukraine's Foreign Oil and Gas), Ukraine's authorized  go-between. In line with this scheme consumer-enterprises are  supposed to remit their karbovanets sums to Ukrgazprom's bank  accounts. The latter organisation then remits them to  Ukrzarubezhneftegaz, which, in turn, purchases the agreed  assortment and amounts of Ukrainian commodities (the resolution  endorsed this list of commodities including automobiles, trucks,  equipment, foods) for karbovanets, thus pooling the necessary  resources to settle with the Russian suppliers. Earlier,  Ukrgazprom had to buy Russian rubles or hard currency on its  own, paying for the prices at the NBU-set [National Bank of  Ukraine] official rates. In many instances, however, it could  not raise the necessary sum, anyway.    The latest scheme is said to replicate, in many of its  elements, its precursor, which proved to be inefficient (see UBN  No. 2/1994). The two parties' authorized agents, Ukrheftesnab  and Rosneftekomplekt, failed to reach the objective of  materially and technically extinguishing the Ukrainian debt for  Russian fuels.    The Ukrzarubezhneftegaz scheme is very much resemblant of  the  one, which the Austro-Swiss Nordex Group applies. However, its  efficiency in Ukrzarubezhneftegaz's interpretation and  application is to be tested.    On 4 April the Cabinet of Ministers adopted yet another  resolution of the same gas series, "On prices for natural gas  supplied to enterprises under the Ministry of Industry and the  Ministry of Engineering, MIC and Conversion in 1994."    The resolution specifies that settling for imported gas by  enterprises of the said ministries is effected in Russian rubles  or hard currency at price rates, which are equivalent to 65 US  dollars per 1,000 cu. m [cubic meters]. The price includes  haulage payable gas piping agencies, which is equivalent to 4.1  USD per 1,000 cu. m.    The above stated prices, however, are not applicable to  enterprises, which manufacture fertilizers and pesticides in  contracted amounts, intended for vernal agricultural purposes.    The government's previous resolution No. 23 of 3 January  1994  "On settling for natural gas by enterprises under the Ministry  of Industry and the Ministry of Engineering, MIC and  Conversion," specified, however, that these enterprises were to  pay charges for gas piping across Ukraine's territory with  Ukrainian karbovanets.    This item's abrogation may testify to the government's  determination to make the said gas consumers follow the  government-designed strategy, which provides for the Ukrainian  enterprises paying not only for imported fuels, but also charges  involved in fuel delivery to end-users.    The piping agencies under the State Committee for Oil and  Gas  are supposed to be safeguarded by the government's resolution  against the consumers' non-timely payments for natural gas  imported from Russia and supplied to them.    The January No. 23 resolution also specified that the two  above listed ministries and the State Committee for Oil and Gas  were to ensure conclusion by their subordinate enterprises of  contracts for additional acquisition by each ministry of 6  billion cu. m. of natural gas for the national economy's needs.  The price to be paid for these amounts of natural gas was not  specified earlier. However, as it is quite obvious now,  industrial enterprises were none too eager to conclude such  deals by late January, as instructed by the government.    So, the 4 April resolution by the Cabinet of Ministers, in  addition to making it incumbent on the enterprises to conclude  such agreements (without setting the deadline, though), contains  a provision, which specifies the price to be paid, to wit, 52.4  USD per 1,000 cu. m. The State Committee for Oil and Gas, same  as before, is to pay for this amount of natural gas to  industrial enterprises with Ukrainian karbovanets at "the  official currency (exchange) rate set by the National Bank of  Ukraine, as of the date of payment."    The resolution does not mention any additional payments by  enterprises, which did conclude agreements and which did pay the  previous price. If any such enterprises are found their  position will be most enviable, anyway.    Obviously, by hooks or by crooks, the government has thus  been trying to make state-owned enterprises pay for the bulk of  fuels, consumed by state-budgeted entities.    The state's financing is not enough to cover the fuel  expenses of state-budgeted entities at least by 50 per cent by  the State Committee for Oil and Gas, as its chairman, Mikhail  Kovalko, noted in late 1993 (see UBN No. 5/1994).    Nonetheless, the Cabinet of Ministers instructed the State  Committee for Oil and Gas to fully and continuously ensure fuel  flows to the state-budgeted sector of Ukraine's national economy.    Probably, industrial enterprises will have to offset the  financial gap through currency rate margins. However, the  government's apparent determinedness on the issue does not mean  that enterprises under the Ministry of Industry and Ministry of  Engineering, MIC and Conversion will rush to pay for fuel  imports.    The new settling system places the State Committee's gas  piping organisations in a favorable position. If previously  they had to willy-nilly credit industrial enterprises and were  unable to settle for imported fuels, the situation has radically  changed now.    According to utterances by Ukrgaz's and Ukrgazprom's senior  officers, if Ukrainian domestic consumers repay all their fuel  debts and start regular prepayment of fuel supplies (as  specified, on a thrice a month basis). Ukraine's gas piping  organisations will be able to redeem the major part of Ukraine's  tremendous fuel debt to Russia, which is Ukraine's major fuel  supplier, by 1994 with very good prospects for final settling by  October and ability to purchase Russian gas in required amounts  henceforth.    Ukraine's is reported to have succeeded in settling with  Russia for gas supplies over 1994's first three months (about  100 million dollars).    However, 1993's remaining 700 million USD indebtedness is a  major challenge.</p>

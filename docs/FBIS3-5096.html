Mr. Hata, what do you think of the U.S. decision to revive the  Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act?    [Hata] For a long time, there have been moves among U.S.  congressmen to submit a bill to revive the Super 301 provision.  At the same time, the U.S. Administration has maintained that  it would be better to issue a presidential executive order  rather than enacting the bill in Congress. It has been reported  since last month or earlier that the administration would decide  to revive the Super 301 provision.    [Kawabata] Do you mean that the Japanese Government has  anticipated the revival of the Super 301 provision?    [Hata] Yes, yes. The idea of reviving the Super 301  provision has been around in the United States for a while. The  latest step the U.S. Government has taken is a procedure to  revive the Super 301 provision. It is said that the revival of  the Super 301 provision targets Japan because the Japan-U.S.  framework talks ended in a breakdown, but it is not true. Our  understanding is that the revived Super 301 provision will be  applied to all other nations and will not target any specific  nations.    [Mochitsuki] Mr. Hata, U.S. Trade Representative Kantor has  unequivocally told a news conference that the Japanese market is  very closed. Has the United States decided to revive the Super  301 provision with Japan in mind?    [Hata] Americans already have in mind that Japan is the top  surplus nation among trade partners of the United States. In  that sense, I think there are many venues for the United States  to discuss the trade issue with Japan. For the United States,  Japan is its second largest trade partner, second to Canada.  Japan's imports from the United States equal the imports of  France, Britain, and Germany combined from that country. I  believe Japan is an important trade partner for the United  States.    [Watanabe] Mr. Hata, we just had a discussion in this  studio.  What do you think of a six-month moratorium for negotiations?    [Hata] I think the United States probably intends to set a  direction of settling the trade dispute within six months. My  understanding is that the terms of the Super 301 provision are  more reasonable than the past terms. In this connection, the  Uruguay Round of GATT was recently concluded, and a new trade  organization called the World Trade Organization will be  created. Various trade disputes will be settled by the new  trade organization, and this is an international rule for  negotiating trade disputes. The United States intends to settle  bilateral trade issues through the revival of the Super 301  provision after the Uruguay Round has just concluded. We deeply  regret the revival of the Super 301 provision by the United  States.    [Mochitsuki] In reality, the Japan-U.S. framework talks  ended  in a breakdown. I think the talks did not end, but they should  be resumed in the future. Japan is said to be ready to discuss  the issue of numerical targets with the United States.    [Hata] Yes.    [Mochitsuki] What do you see as the prospects of such talks?    [Hata] The moment the Japan-U.S. framework talks ended in  breakdown, what I told officials from ministries and agencies  was that, despite the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. framework  talks, they should not be careless. I also told them that Japan  is the world's largest trade surplus nation, and this is a  problem, and opening the Japanese market will make the people's  lives affluent. Japan should work to voluntarily open its  market. The prime minister returned to Japan with the same  idea. He called in cabinet members the day after he returned to  Japan. Recently, key cabinet members met to agree to map out a  package of measures in March to open the Japanese market.    [Kawabata] If the United States raises the issue of  numerical  targets in future negotiations, will Japan say no to them again?    [Hata] Rather than us saying no, U.S. Trade Representative  Kantor has not said that numerical targets should be a yardstick  and only one means to measure bilateral trade. [sentence as  heard] The Hosokawa cabinet intends to promote administrative  reform and deregulation. In other words, the cabinet is moving  toward keeping it from intervening in the activities of the  private sector. Japan, therefore, has told the United States  that setting such numerical targets is no good at a time when  the Japanese Government is making such moves. Japan also told  the United States that setting such numerical targets would  disrupt free trade and the Uruguay Round has just concluded. I  am confident that the issue of the numerical targets will  undoubtedly be resolved if the two countries trust each other  and fully understand each other's recent actions. There are  some other trade issues between the two countries. I think  negotiations between the two countries on such trade issues as  the insurance sector and government procurement came closer to  agreement. I believe an agreement will be hammered out through  negotiation. I believe the two countries should do so.    [Kawabata] I would like to ask about future Japan-U.S.  relations. Do you think that the breakdown of the Japan-U.S.  framework talks has prompted the U.S. Administration to decide  to revive the Super 301 provision?    [Hata] I do not think so. I do not think that the U.S.  Administration has decided to issue the presidential executive  order because of the breakdown of the framework talks.    [Kawabata] Some are pointing out that the revival of the  Super 301 provision would affect not only bilateral economic  issues, but all Japan-U.S. relations.    [Hata] During a meeting with me, Mr. Kantor told me that  although the Japan-U.S. framework talks ended in a breakdown,  the United States has experienced many breakdowns in trade talks  with European nations and Canada. Mr. Kantor also told me: Mr.  Hata, do not worry about the breakdown of the Japan-U.S.  framework talks. Mr. Kantor went on to said to me: No matter  how well security, political, and international cooperation  goes, bilateral economic issues will trigger frustrations among  Americans. The bilateral economic issues will hurt bilateral  relations. The two countries should settle the economic issues.  He and I feared that if the economic issues are not settled,  this would create a rift in relations between the two countries.  I hope to resolve the economic issues in one way or another.  An agreement document was exchanged between the prime minister  and the President on cooperation between Japan and the United  States in tackling environmental problems, the population issue,  and AIDS.    [Kawabata] I would like to ask about how the Japanese  Government will deal with the revival of the Super 301  provision. In past negotiations on the Super 301 provision,  Japan avoided facing sanctions from the United States by making  concessions to the Untied States. Will Japan make concessions  to the United States again?    [Hata] No, Japan will not make concessions to the United  States. The United States has not decided to revive the Super  301 provision to target Japan. I hope the two countries will  discuss their trade issues in the WTO. My frank feeling is that  the United States should have been cautious about reviving the  Super 301 provision.    [Tsuruo] The government intends to map out a package of  measures on its own to relax the bureaucratic regulations and  open the Japanese market. This package will be mapped out, but  it is often said that bureaucrats are strongly resisting the  relaxation of bureaucratic regulations. Mr. Hata, will Prime  Minister Hosokawa display his leadership?    [Hata] We are talking with various bureaucrats. Politicians  and bureaucrats realize that if Japan is left untouched, it  would be able to do nothing. The people are also realizing that  deregulation will raise their living standard. Deregulation  will create new projects, and the people are realizing that. I  am confident that bureaucrats will work for deregulation, and I  can say there will be no problem. Prime Minister Hosokawa is  working on the issue with a firm resolve. I believe that  deregulation will bring about a tangible effect. The United  States intends to sell its goods in Japan and gain access to the  Japanese market, and other nations intend to do so too. Japan  should open its market to those nations and compete with them.  I think that Japan cannot bypass this.    [Kawabata] The government will map out a package of measures  in March. Would you specify them?    [Hata] I cannot specify them since the government is now  working on them.    [Tsuruo] Mr. Hata, what do you expect from private  enterprises?    [Hata] Private enterprises should be determined to compete  with foreign firms. Private enterprises should purchase their  goods from many foreign firms. If they make effort to that end,  their efforts will be understood in the international community.    [Kawabata] Mr. Hata, thank you very much for appearing on  our  interview program.</p>

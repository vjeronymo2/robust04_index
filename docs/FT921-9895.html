			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Fleming American asset value up 32% A 32 per cent increase to 209.3p in net asset value per share was achieved by Fleming American Investment Trust in 1991. Mr Iain Saunders, chairman, said that, for investors in the US market, the year was one of the most rewarding of the last decade. The trust benefited from good selection and its exposure to small companies. However, gross revenue fell from Pounds 4.62m to Pounds 3.87m and earnings per share from 2.06p to 1.26p. The final dividend is cut from 1.25p to 0.75p for a total of 1.25p (1.75p). The chairman explained that the reduction was a consequence of the trust being fully invested throughout the year and was consistent with its declared focus on overall return, which meant the dividend fluctuated from year to year.</p>

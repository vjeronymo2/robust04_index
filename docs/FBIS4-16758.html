			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yekaterina Achalova report: "Opposition Unites Once Again. </F> New Coalition Wants To Do Without Rutskoy and Zorkin"]    [Text] The intransigent opposition has decided to jettison  its former "October" leaders. Yesterday, a Public Committee for  the Rule of Law and People's Power was set up in Moscow to  replace the National Salvation Front [NSF], which was banned  right after the October events. The committee's objective will  be to continue extra-parliamentary struggle and to coordinate  the activities of the left-wing and patriotic movements in all  regions of Russia.    It is expected that the Public Committee for the Rule of Law  and People's Power will be based primarily on the former  structures of the NSF, the Officers Union, the Russian  All-People's Union, and other patriotic and left-wing  organizations. The new committee's founding fathers include  such well-known political figures as State Duma deputies Sergey  Baburin, Vladimir Isakov, Yuriy Vlasov, and also Lieutenant  Colonel Stanislav Terekhov. KOMMERSANT-DAILY has learned that  during preliminary meetings, which took place in an atmosphere  of strictest secrecy, they decided not to associate the  organization with people who have been blamed for the  opposition's defeat in October -- Aleksandr Rutskoy, Ilya  Konstantinov, Aleksandr Sterligov, and Viktor Anpilov. It was  also decided not to give support to the "Accord for Russia"  movement set up by Aleksandr Rutskoy and Valeriy Zorkin.    Given that the Public Committee's predecessor -- the  National  Salvation Front -- was effectively a club of Moscow politicians,  the new coalition's organizers decided to boost their influence  in the workers movement. The committee's priority objective was  defined as the penetration of the fuel-and-energy and  military-industrial sector trade unions in order to persuade  them to switch from economic to political demands when calling  strikes. The main political demands should include the  resignation of the government and early presidential elections.    According to the strategy devised by the Public Committee,  one of its "power" centers will be the Officers Union and the  Russian Power Party [Rossiyskaya Derzhavnaya Partiya] being set  up by its activists (their congresses were held last weekend).  It is expected that the Officers Union will step up its  campaigning in the Russian Armed Forces and prod servicemen into  voicing demands similar to those of the trade unions. Another  fairly noteworthy development was the participation in the  Officers Union congress by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who has  shunned contacts with the intransigent opposition since his  election to the State Duma. Now he asked the officers to see  him as their ally, and also recommended that they penetrate "the  rear of the enemy -- the party of authority" -- so as to know in  advance about the expected actions by the authorities and to be  ready to counter them.</p>

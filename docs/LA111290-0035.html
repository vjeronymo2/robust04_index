			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESPONDING TO AUTHOR'S DEFENSE OF CENSORSHIP  </P> <P> In the final paragraphs of his article, Steffens ridicules the notion that  there is a force in society poised to wrest our freedom of expression from us.  He asserts that the American people can be trusted to defend our freedoms.  </P> <P> The danger of this argument is that it leads to the conclusion that the Bill of  Rights is superfluous because "we are a good people, a fair people."  </P> <P> Consider the philosophical thought and the historical necessity that gave rise  to the Bill of Rights. The guarantees of freedom of expression (press,  religion, assembly) in the Constitution expressly prohibit the majority from  denying these rights of the individual.  </P> <P> If we can rely on legislators to protect our freedoms of the press and of  speech, why does the Bill of Rights begin with the words, "Congress shall make  no law abridging. . . ."? Our founding fathers knew what Steffens has forgotten  about -- demagoguery and mob rule.  </P> <P> 2 Live Crew may not be Steffens' (or my) idea of what the founding fathers had  in mind. I think that "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" is constitutionally protected  speech. Steffens may disagree. But clearly the framers of the Constitution  didn't leave the question of censorship up to us, or to politicians, or to the  wisdom of the majority.  </P> <P> RANDY FINCH  </P> <P> West Hollywood  </P></p>

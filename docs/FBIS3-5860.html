			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Fidel Ramos by Manila </F> correspondent Rigoberto Tiglao; place, date not given]    [Text] Do you think that your image as a decisive  president has been damaged by the rollback of petroleum prices  and the lifting of the levy you imposed in September?    It may have been, but I'm not worrying about prestige now.  As long as we can keep things going, I am willing to take the  flak. There are certain costs to be paid and I'm willing to take  those now.    What was the levy really for?    It was to fund the electric power projects we needed so we  wouldn't have brown-outs. Funds were necessary not only for the  power plants but also for the distribution lines. The  three-week suspension was really a holding operation, not a step  backwards, which we needed so we could identify alternative  measures.    The observation has been made that one of the country's  biggest problems is political gridlock between the executive  branch and Congress. Do you think that the Congress, especially  the Senate, has been an obstructionist body?    I'm saying that in the past 18 months, the Congress has been  very productive. There are many important laws enacted and they  are of high quality, and we collaborated with them on these. We  have discussions with legislators once a week, and we have more  regular dialogues now with the leadership of the House and the  Senate, so we can chart directions more precisely. The senators  tell me that one of their problems is that there are just 23 of  them, and they are supposed to deal with the products of 200  congressmen, so they are swamped with work.    The oil levy controversy has highlighted the budget  deficit as the biggest block to economic growth. Are you  confident of solving this problem?    You have to look at the bigger picture. The total deficit  has been going down substantially, and we'll bring it down to  below 3 percent (of GNP) this year. All the economy's  parameters -- interest rates, inflation, the exchange rate --  are improving. The commercial portion of the foreign debt  burden has been brought down to a minimum, and better terms  negotiated. The domestic debt service is still a major problem,  but we are reducing that also. What is important is the  direction.    Are there gains in collecting the taxes due to the  government?    We are implementing a three-pronged approach: improving tax  collection, creating a broader base of taxpayers, and  undertaking reforms in the tax and tariff system itself, and in  the collecting agencies. For example, we are restructuring the  Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). Where there used to be 80  revenue districts, there are now 115.    We have also removed the discretionary power of  lower-ranking  officers in deciding tax compromises, and this can be done now  only by the bureau's top five officials. A large taxpayers unit  in the BIR is now operating, which will allow them to focus  their efforts on the big taxpayers.    Your efforts seem to be frustrated by the courts, as in  the case of your campaign against magnate Lucio Tan. The  courts' involvement has also blocked major development  projects.    That is something out of my control, but at least efforts  are  being made. But we are also taking steps to solve those. We  are seconding the justice department's state prosecutors, who  are better paid, to the BIR or to any other department who need  such lawyers. Last week, I appointed 177 new state prosecutors.  The Department of Justice has filed cases against tax evaders  for a claim of P [Philippine pesos] 23 billion (US$836 million).  But we have due process in this country. If these tax evaders  lose in the lower court, they appeal all the way up to the  Supreme Court, and they have smart lawyers behind them. But we  have to start the process.    Early on in your administration, you said that one of  your thrusts would be to dismantle cartels and monopolies. So  far, however, it has only been the monopoly in the  telecommunications industry which you've addressed.    We have made an investigation of the cement industry, and  we're not quite through with that yet. But (cement producers)  have made the commitment that there will be no artificial  shortage and no price manipulation, and we're making sure of  this province by province.    The banking system is one area we want to liberalise. That's  why we're pushing for a new banking law. The biggest bank here  is smaller than Thailand's 10th biggest bank. Why? Because the  banking industry has largely been in the hands of a few  families. We're about to open up that industry, so that our  banks will be more competitive vis-a-vis the entire Asean  region, so that access to credit will be maximised, and its cost  minimised.    The observation has been made that you are involving  yourself too much in the details of your administration, rather  than in giving overall direction.    You have to start with the basics. I've spent time visiting  neighbours in the region, I've spent time talking with senators  and congressmen about bills and policies, and talking with the  private sector. However, we cannot neglect providing solutions  for problems down below, where because of neglect in the past,  there is a need for interagency collaboration.    There are observations that given the country's  political structure, the Philippines may not be  "governable."    I think it definitely is governable. That's why we went into  this, as a challenge. All other efforts have failed. It's just  that we did not do many things right. The structure depends on  the people who run it. You can have the most beautiful  structure, but if the people who are running it are not devoted,  and are not dedicated to the goal, it will never work.    What would you say is your biggest lesson in  governance?    You have to be awfully patient. You have to be steady. You  must not be diverted from your original objectives.</p>

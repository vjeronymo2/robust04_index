			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Oftel plans renewed assault on BT's dominance Mr Don Cruickshank, the telecommunications regulator, plans a raft of fresh measures aimed at encouraging competition for British Telecom. Mr Cruickshank intends to make the UK's regulatory regime more accommodating to companies planning new services, and to take a more active stance in policing existing operators. BT, which commands nearly 90 per cent of the UK telecoms market, is likely to come under closer scrutiny by Oftel, the telecoms regulatory office headed by Mr Cruickshank. But cable companies building combined television and telephone networks in urban areas can also expect to have their activities examined. In a report on future policy, included in Oftel's 1993 annual report published yesterday, Mr Cruickshank was sharply critical of the status quo. 'New entrants are not yet delivering the range of choice I am looking for,' he said. 'We cannot relax merely because licences have been issued and promises made . . . we still have a long, long way to go.' He is impressed by the greater range of telecoms services in the US, and Oftel will publish studies comparing the range and quality of services in the UK with those of the US and France. Areas highlighted for Oftel scrutiny in the next year include cable companies' adherence to Oftel-agreed timetables for constructing networks. The annual report shows a sharp fall in consumer complaints to Oftel, from 41,026 in 1992 to 23,413 last year. Separately, BT and Mercury, its main competitor, have announced cuts of up to 25 per cent in the price of international ISDN services, high-capacity lines used by businesses for data transfer and video-conferencing. The government signalled its concern yesterday at delays by US authorities in allowing British operators to compete in the US. Lord Strathclyde, a Department of Trade and Industry minister, told a conference in London: 'In the US some interests seem to want to close off their market to international competition rather than see International Simple Resale (ISR) bring down tariffs.' ISR would allow new competitors to use leased international lines to provide a service connected to the public network in both the US and the UK. The US is blocking ISR pending studies of the 'openness' of the UK market.</p>

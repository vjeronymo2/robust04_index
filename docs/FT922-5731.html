			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / People: P&amp;O expands into Asian waters Ian Mullen, a 44-year-old merchant banker, has been hired by P&amp;O to spearhead its expansion in Asia. A Scot who has spent 13 years in Hong Kong, Mullen has been appointed executive director of the newly-established P&amp;O Asia which is based in Hong Kong. Although P&amp;O has long historical ties with Hong Kong - Thomas Sutherland, one of P&amp;O's more famous chairmen helped found the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank - it is under-invested in the area. Last year P&amp;O's stock was listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange and P&amp;O chairman Lord Sterling, who will also be chairman of the new Hong Kong-based company, has given Mullen the job of getting P&amp;O more heavily involved in the fast-growing economies of the region. Mullen, a former director of Midland Montagu where he was responsible for the parent bank's Pounds 20bn UK corporate banking portfolio, plans to expand by a combination of organic growth and non-hostile acquisitions. P&amp;O Asia will have offices in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and Japan. Before joining Midland Bank in 1984 as the Hong Kong-based regional head of corporate finance, Mullen had been a shipping adviser with the Hong Kong Bank. A graduate of Edinburgh University, he began his career in shipping in Shetland with Hay and Company and in Italy and the Far East with Mollers Group. The other members of the new P&amp;O Asia board are Brian Baillie, executive deputy chairman, Bruce MacPhail, Sir Frank Lampl, Tim Harris, and Richard Hein. ***** Paul Fletcher, previously md of Holman Wade, and Jamie Hay, previously a director of Oakwood Underwriting Agency, have been appointed directors of CASSIDY DAVIS MEMBERS AGENCY. ***** John Clayton has been appointed company secretary of GUARDIAN ROYAL EXCHANGE on the retirement of John Evans. ***** John Bacon, John Howard, Bob Murrell, and Geoff Sherman have been appointed directors of RICHARDS, LONGSTAFF (INSURANCE); Bill Wright is appointed a director of its estates and private clients division, and Chris Allen a director of its special risks division. ***** Diethart Breipohl has resigned from the Cornhill board because of additional commitments within the Allianz Group; Alexander Hoyos, a member of the executive board of Allianz Versicherungs, has been appointed to the board of CORNHILL INSURANCE. ***** Paul Little has been promoted to deputy md of LOWNDES LAMBERT CARGO. ***** BANKSIDE Underwriting is the latest Lloyd's agency group to look outside the Lloyd's insurance market for its new chief executive; it appointed a banker and stockbroker, Angus Scrimgeour (above) last week. Scrimgeour, 47, joins Bankside after a spell with Henry Cooke Group, the stockbroker and financial services group, where he was deputy chairman. Before that, he spent over a decade with Citibank. 'We particularly wanted someone who was not narrowly based in Lloyd's and with a wider financial background,' says Elvin Patrick, the chairman. Bankside is a 'business school textbook case of an entrepreneurially lead company which is now of a size and complexity where it needs to be properly run,' he adds. ***** JOHNSON &amp; HIGGINS Ltd, the Lloyd's broking arm of the New York-based insurance broking group, has appointed a merchant banker, Emmanuel Olympitis, to be its managing director. Olympitis, now in his early 40s, has also been appointed managing director of Johnson &amp; Higgins Holdings and a director of Johnson &amp; Higgins UK. He was formerly group chief executive of Aitken Hume International, the publicly quoted banking and financial services group, and earlier was a partner in The American Acquisition Company, a New York-based mergers and acquisitions firm. ***** Sir Alex Jarratt, 68, succeeds Trevor Holdsworth as a deputy chairman at the PRUDENTIAL Corporation, the UK's largest life insurance and financial services group. Sir Alex, a former chairman of Reed International, is resuming a position he has already occupied between 1987 and 1991. He is a director of Smiths Industries and chancellor of the University of Birmingham and has been a director of the Prudential since 1985. ***** Three non-executive directors Lord Hunt, Lord Butterfield and Julius Neave have retired from the board. ***** Cecil Buckett has become finance director of BRITISH FITTINGS GROUP in place of Brian Smith. ***** Charles Taylor has been appointed md of Fortress Interlocks, a subsidiary of HALMA. ***** Jonathan Ward, previously a director of Tootal, has been appointed chairman of REPORTS FOR BUSINESS. ***** Robert Meakin (above left) is appointed director of personnel at BRITISH AEROSPACE on the retirement of Frank Saundry. ***** Gerald Owen (above right), lubricants Asia director of BURMAH CASTROL, is appointed director chemicals and to the main board, on the resignation of John Griffiths because of ill health. ***** Mike Harling, Midlands divisional director of DIXONS, and Ted Stanley, who moves from Federal Express, have been appointed sales and operations director, respectively, of E&amp;S Retail, the joint retailing venture between Eastern Electricity and Southern Electric. ***** Justin Jewitt has been appointed md of LAUNDRYCRAFT, part of Initial UK; he moves from Rent-a-Center, a North American subsidiary of Thorn EMI. ***** John Broadbent has been appointed md of MARLEY FLOORS. ***** Stephen Connock, general manager (human resources) for Pearl Assurance, is appointed personnel and public affairs director of EASTERN ELECTRICITY, on the retirement of Lawrence French. ***** Mark Galsworthy has been promoted to md of the British operations of KNOGO. ***** Jim Grant, md Somerfield, and Bryan Taker, organisation and manpower development director, have been appointed to the main board of GATEWAY FOODMARKETS. ***** Terry Green, chief executive of Debenhams, and Geoffrey Powell, group operations director, have been appointed to the board of The BURTON Group.

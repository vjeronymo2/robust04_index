			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Scholl advances to Pounds 12.3m SCHOLL, the personal healthcare products supplier, yesterday reported pre-tax profits ahead from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 12.3m for the six months to June 30 after making a Pounds 420,000 provision for disposals costs. The charge was made to cover estimated costs of disposing of a small retail operation in France and the planned sale of associated shops in Belgium and Luxembourg. Turnover expanded to Pounds 85.8m (Pounds 82.9m) bolstered by Pounds 1.1m from two new acquisitions - the Scholl retail operations in Canada acquired in February from Schering Plough, and Gerard House, the UK-based herbal medicines business, acquired in May. Mr Gordon Stevens, chairman, said trading conditions were poor in all main markets. 'In the UK we experienced a 14 per cent increase in turnover in foot and legcare products despite continuing trade destocking which appears to be deepening in continental Europe.' Gross margins were maintained, but operating profits fell by some 8 per cent to Pounds 11.6m (Pounds 12.5m) reflecting increased promotional costs and R&amp;D expenditure. The decline, however, was more than offset by the effects of reducing working capital and a turnround in interest from charges of Pounds 874,000 to income of Pounds 1.1m from the proceeds of last year's rights issue. An extraordinary gain of Pounds 1m represented the release of a provision previously held against the sale of the fashion hosiery business. Since June the group has disposed of the Isabelle Lancray business, acquired as part of the Valdor cosmetics group in 1989, and said it would incur an Pounds 800,000 extraordinary charge in the second half. The interim dividend is 2.6p (2.5p), payable from earnings of 10.4p (11.6p) per share.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with General Paul Kagame, leader of the rebel </F> Rwandan Patriotic Front, by Renaud Girard in Byumba; date not  given: "Kagame Still Distrusts France"]    [Text] [Girard] Alain Juppe is envisaging French  intervention. What is your reaction?    [Kagame] I have heard your minister's statement. I do not  understand exactly what he is demanding. I do not see how an  intervention of the kind he is considering could improve the  situation. If France wants to do what we are doing itself, it  would be better if it left us to do it.    [Girard] Do you not actually fear that the arrival of French  soldiers might prevent you from continuing your action?    [Kagame] France's involvement in the Rwandan conflict has  been proved. It has clearly shown that it is partisan. The  return of its soldiers here would merely complicate matters.    [Girard] French policy has nonetheless changed from  Mitterrand to Balladur.    [Kagame] In Rwanda, France has taken sides since the  beginning of the war in 1990. This partisan spirit has  continued over the past few months. I have not noticed any  change of French policy. It has given its support to the  so-called interim government, this regime of militiamen, and  Rwandan officials have recently been received in Paris. France  has not openly condemned the interim government for the crimes  it has committed in Rwanda. And if France now wants to do  something here, it would do better to wait for us to invite it.    [Girard] The French are nonetheless not responsible for the  genocide of which Rwanda has been the theater since 7 April,  when President Juvenal Habyarimana was assassinated?    [Kagame] It is obvious that the French are partly  responsible  for what has happened. France trained the militias and the  Army. It has not condemned the assassins.    [Girard] What role would you agree to the United Nations  playing in your country?    [Kagame] The United Nations can pursue its humanitarian  mission, its aid to the populations that have survived the  massacres. This is the maximum that the United Nations can  achieve here. The Blue Helmets have shown themselves to be  incapable of protecting the civilians who are being murdered by  the militias. At present, I do not see who they could aspire to  save by military means.    [Girard] Do you support the Security Council's decision to  send 5,000 additional Blue Helmets to Rwanda?    [Kagame] It is a question which still has to be debated.  First, the United Nations must clearly define its mission. Only  then will we be able to tackle the question of the number of men  likely to accomplish that mission effectively.    [Girard] But once the United Nations has clearly defined its  humanitarian mission, you would not oppose the dispatch of these  reinforcements?    [Kagame] General Dallaire (head of UNAMIR, the UN Assistance  Mission in Rwanda) is in fact demanding 5,500 Blue Helmets. We  think that is a large number. We are currently negotiating to  arrive at a reasonable figure.    [Girard] What figure do you advocate?    [Kagame] The same sort of number that UNAMIR had when the  war  resumed in April, in other words, around 2,500 men. But the  United Nations must first have a clear humanitarian mandate.  What it lacks in this crisis is not numbers but a mandate.  Otherwise the United Nations would have been able to protect  the civilians from the start of the massacres. The Blue Helmets  have always told us that they did not have a mandate to do so at  the time.  <H5>  `Minimizing Losses in Our Ranks' </H5>   [Girard] Your movement, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF],  was known for its discipline. But the archbishop of Kigali was  murdered by the RPF men who were guarding him. What is your  explanation?    [Kagame] We still maintain very strict discipline in our  movement. But this does not rule out some loss of control,  individual crimes. You have blunders of this kind in all  armies, even those of the developed countries.    [Girard] Will those responsible be prosecuted?    [Kagame] Of course. One of the assassins was killed when  resisting arrest. Three others are on the run. We are actively  seeking them. I will arrest the officer commanding the unit in  question. He is not directly responsible for what happened, but  as chief he is responsible.    [Girard] What is stopping you from capturing Kigali?    [Kagame] We are taking our time. We are making plans to  minimize the losses in our ranks.    [Girard] Do you still refuse to negotiate with the interim  government while agreeing to have discussions with the military?    [Kagame] Yes. But the FAR (Rwandan Armed Forces) have  disappointed us. They do not keep their promises. Scarcely was  the cease-fire signed than the massacres resumed and the  civilians were prevented from going to the area of their choice.  The general staff told us that they did not control the  militias. But how can anybody think that professional soldiers  are unable to control militiamen armed with machetes?</p>

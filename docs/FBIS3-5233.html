Items shipped to China that boosted South Korean trade  last year were shaky as record-breaking imports from Seoul's  neighbor far outpaced exports, officials said.    China imported goods totaling 348 million U.S. dollars in  January, a 29.3 percent increase from the same month last year  and disappointing compared to the 94.1 percent rise for 1993.    Imports by Korea, on the other hand, set a new high that  month of 386 million dollars, 56.1 percent higher than a year  ago and a stark contrast to the 5.5 percent increase for all of  1993. This led to a 38-million-dollar deficit with China for  January. The last time the figure tilted in Beijing's favor was  in November 1992.    KFTA officials attribute the result to China's policies on  curbing overheated competition, which closed the door to new  investments this year. In a bid to reduce its trade deficit,  China is controlling imports of capital goods.    Meanwhile, Chinese farm products flooded the South Korean  market in January, just in time for the new year celebrations.    "The astounding export increase last year to China kind of  saturated the potential of South Korean goods," said one  official. "Unless we find a breakthrough, like automobile  exports, our sales to China cannot but be stunted."    Exports to China grew 71.4 percent in 1991 and 161 percent  in  1992.    The figure climbed to as high as 150 percent in the first  half of last year but has fallen to 20-80 percent since then.</p>

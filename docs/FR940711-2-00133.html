The Oversight Board adopted a resolution approving the policy at that meeting. In that resolution the Oversight Board suggested that the RTC make the public aware of the new policy through publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The RTC is rapidly resolving the remaining institutions it operates in conservatorships. Inasmuch as the policy affects only the operation of those institutions in conservatorship, there is a critical need to make the public aware of this new policy quickly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In light of the request of the Oversight Board and the need to publicize the policy quickly, the RTC has concluded that publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  would be the best means of disseminating the new policy to members of the public with an interest in the subject matter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Policy on Procedures for Non-Defaulting Commercial Borrowers to Appeal Adverse Credit Decisions of the RTC Acting as Conservator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The RTC is issuing procedures which provide a process for non-defaulting business and commercial borrowers to appeal the RTC's decisions (when acting as a conservator) which terminate or otherwise adversely affect credit or loan agreements, lines of credit or other similar arrangements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Scope <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The appeals process outlined herein pertains to adverse credit decisions affecting a non-defaulting commercial borrower made by the RTC as conservator for an insured depository institution for which the RTC was acting as conservator on or after December 17, 1993. These procedures shall only apply to adverse credit decisions affecting a non-defaulting commercial borrower made on or after December 17, 1993 by the RTC as conservator for an insured depository institution and only during the period for which the RTC acts as conservator for such insured depository institution. The appeals process is not intended to deny borrowers any rights otherwise provided under law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The appeals process described in this policy does not limit or affect the exercise by the RTC, as conservator or receiver, of its authority to repudiate contracts pursuant to 12 U.S.C. &sect;1821(e). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Generally, a predecessor institution retains the obligation to fund unfunded or partially funded loan commitments, and such obligations are not transferred to or assumed by the new savings association which the RTC operates in conservatorship. However, it has also been the RTC's policy for the conservator to consider funding partially funded loan commitments, as generally outlined in the Asset Management and Disposition Manual, Circular 10100.1, Change-One, Section F(3), and as further detailed with respect to the handling of construction loans in Circular 10100.32, Subject: ``Funding of ADC Loan Commitments,'' which can be obtained upon request to one of the above listed contacts or from one of the public reading rooms of the RTC. These practices will continue. Pursuant to Section 21A(b)(4)(C) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act, as added by Section 3(b) of the RTC Completion Act, effective December 17, 1993, whenever the RTC acting as conservator decides to deny an extension of credit to a non-defaulting commercial borrower, the borrower shall have an opportunity to appeal the decision to the next level of authority above the initial decision maker, as described below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MINOR LEAGUE REPORT;  </P> <P> BROTHERS TATUM BACK TOGETHER WITH BREWERS  </P> <P> The baseball careers of Jim and John Tatum are now harbored in the same port,  but the tides that brought them there came from much different directions.  </P> <P> Jim was the player of the year at Santana in 1984 while leading the Sultans to  the 3-A title.  </P> <P> John was a finalist for the same award at Grossmont while helping the  Foothillers win the 2-A title in May.  </P> <P> With regards to Crawford's Bob and Ray Boone and Hoover's Mike and Mark Davis,  the Tatums might be the finest baseball brothers in San Diego Section history.  </P> <P> Today, they find themselves playing minor league ball for the same organization  -- the Milwaukee Brewers -- at the same position -- third base.  </P> <P> Jim, 22, is hitting .278 with six home runs and 23 RBIs in 21 games for the  Stockton Ports, a Class A team. John, who will turn 18 next Friday, is hitting  .407 with nine RBIs in seven games for Peoria, Ariz., a rookie league club.  </P> <P> And in time? Well, you can only have one third baseman on the field at once.  </P> <P> "If it came down to that," Jim said, "I'd be happy if he made it, or I'd be  happy if I made it. I'm sure he feels the same way."  </P> <P> At Santana, where he also starred in football (quarterback) and basketball, Jim  was a notably fierce competitor.  </P> <P> He also could be outspoken and brutally honest at times and quiet, lonely and  confused at others. Either way, he said, he was mostly misunderstood.  </P> <P> Their parents went through a divorce when Jim and John were 13 and 8. Jim said  it affected him immensely.  </P> <P> "I couldn't understand why they couldn't work things out," Jim said. "It was  hard. There wasn't much stability in my life then. I was basically by myself. I  knew the only thing I could grasp hard was athletics."  </P> <P> In doing so, he left behind quite a legacy when he graduated in 1985.  </P> <P> John, who used to go to all of Jim's games with their father, grew up with the  "big shoes" and "shadow" syndromes. People reminded him all the time what a  great athlete Jim was. But John handled it amazingly well.  </P> <P> Moving and attending Grossmont helped. He was not really accepted at Santana,  he says.  </P> <P> "I was compared with my brother all the time," he said. "(But at Grossmont),  the parents, the players, the coaches, they let me be me. They all took me for  who I am."  </P> <P> Both Jim and John, feared hitters and pitchers alike in high school, caused  significant revisions in the section record book.  </P> <P> Jim is the only player in section history to hit four home runs in a game and  is among four with nine runs batted in in a game. John, who twice hit two  homers in one game (including two in the same inning), broke the record for  saves in a single season with 13 and also equaled the career mark. In two  years, he was 10-0. Both hit 11 home runs their senior years while batting in  the high .400s.  </P> <P> Similar as their high school careers were, John is hoping his minor league  years are more fortunate than Jim's.  </P> <P> Jim, after four somewhat successful years in the Padre organization -- he was a  third-round draft choice in 1985 -- ran into off-field problems during the  1988-89 off-season.  </P> <P> He was divorced from his high school sweetheart after two years of marriage in  December, stabbed in the arm by her new boyfriend during a fight on Christmas  night and accused of vandalizing her car in March (he was arrested but says  charges were never brought).  </P> <P> The timing of the latter incident -- two days before spring training -- led the  Padres to suspend Jim and request that he go through a counseling program.  </P> <P> Jim says he tried the program but didn't feel anything was wrong with him and  didn't understand what the team was trying to do.  </P> <P> "I felt insulted," he said. "I didn't mind talking to those guys. They had some  great ideas, but then they all started to sound the same."  </P> <P> He wasn't getting paid but says what hurt him most was not being able to play  baseball. Finally, after sitting out the year, Jim asked for his release, and  the Padres obliged.  </P> <P> The year off, he said, gave him time to grow, and for the first time, watch  John play ball.  </P> <P> "To go away for so many years, and then come back, all of a sudden, he was  dominating. It was really neat," Jim said.  </P> <P> John went 10 for 12 in a playoff drive that ended with a loss to Carlsbad in  the 1989 2-A championship.  </P> <P> That summer, Jim starred on a National Baseball Congress team. In September,  1989, he signed with the Indians. He started this year in double-A at  Canton-Akron (Ohio) but hit just .180 and was soon released.  </P> <P> The Brewers had been interested when he signed with Cleveland, so Jim made some  calls.  </P> <P> John had been drafted in the 15th round by the Brewers.  </P> <P> Their signing dates were just days apart.  </P> <P> Said John jokingly, "At first, I said, 'Oh my God. I thought I got away from  him.'  </P> <P> "But then I thought, 'All the better. We can work as a team now.' I looked up  to him for so long, then I competed (with his legacy) in high school.  </P> <P> "When we talked after we both had signed, he said, 'John, you're not my little  brother any more. You're my teammate.' I was ecstatic. It made me feel great."  </P></p>

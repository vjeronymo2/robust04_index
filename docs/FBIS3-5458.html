As a result, inter-Korean economic cooperation could start  as  early as next month, they said.    Such cooperation would include permission for South Korean  businessmen to visit the North, investment in the Najin-Sonbong  and Nampo free economic zones and the establishment of direct  shipping lines to North Korea, they added.    The sources, from both the administration and the business  sector, said Seoul has already decided to stop linking the issue  of Pyongyang's nuclear program with inter-Korean economic  cooperation if a special envoy from either side visits the  other's capital this month.    The government plans to finalize the decision at a meeting  of  national security-related ministers after watching developments  at the next round of working-level contacts at Panmunjom  scheduled for Wednesday.    A formal announcement on the government's amended North  Korea  policy could come shortly after Washington holds a third round  of high-level talks with Pyongyang in Geneva on March 21, they  said.    One government source said, "tension on the Korean peninsula  has eased greatly as a result of North Korea's acceptance of  outside inspections of its nuclear facilities.    "It is now the time to resume working toward inter-Korean  economic cooperation, which has been suspended for more than a  year," he added.    "If the U.S.-North Korean talks proceed smoothly and North  Korea doesn't suddenly change its attitude toward the exchange  of special envoys, the government will announce the change in  its North Korea policy around March 23," he said.    Seoul, however, has not ruled out the possibility that  Pyongyang's attitude could change or circumstances on the Korean  peninsula could worsen, forcing a policy readjustment, the  source said, asking for anonymity.    In addition to increased investment in the North Korean free  economic zones, South Korea will push plans to establish  inter-Korean economic liaison offices, liaison offices of big  businesses in the truce village of Panmunjom and direct shipping  routes to the North.    As for visits to the North by South Korean businessmen, the  government could give the go-ahead as early as next month while  sending working-level missions to the North to sound out  investment opportunities, they said.</p>

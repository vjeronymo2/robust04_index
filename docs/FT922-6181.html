			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Management: A coalition versus a dictator / Learning from experience that shareholders have a hard fight ahead if they want to fire the management Bad managers have been eyeing their shareholders with anxiety recently. Over the last 18 months the big institutional investors have shown themselves willing to remove managements which are not performing well. The trend has been greeted with general applause: onlookers argue that the institutions have found a new spirit at last. However, this view is mistaken. There is no new spirit. The apparent revolt by the institutions is just another aspect of the recession. The weak economy has exposed bad management and has also made it difficult for institutions to sell shareholdings. The decline in takeover activity has also put the spotlight on management, as companies which might otherwise have been predators have been forced to turn their resources inwards. Most cases of bad management unfold slowly. For instance, at Brown &amp; Jackson, the discount retailer, and at Great Western Resources, the oil and gas group, institutional pressure has led to a change of chairman. But the circumstances leading up to the changes took a year or more to unfold, during which time the share prices declined steadily. Many people have argued that institutions should act more quickly. However, the balance of power between managements and their shareholders is heavily skewed in the former's favour, making quick action in most cases difficult, if not impossible. The typical fund manager runs a portfolio of between 50 and 150 stocks, and looks at up to 100 new stocks a year for possible investment. Other calls on his time include reports to investors, marketing presentations and internal management meetings. He will not be able to spend more than a few days a year on any one stock. Suppose you are a fund manager who feels the management in one of your stocks has taken the wrong track. You have a choice: change the management or sell the stock. If you wanted to adopt the first route, what would be involved? Your first port of call would be the management itself to unearth information and air your concerns. But the managers are unlikely to accept your criticisms. They will plead deeper understanding of their business, a plea that you cannot refute. You are not convinced, so you contact fellow institutions. Many will not share your concerns; after all, this is not a headline case. Some shareholders are bound to agree with you, although most of them will be intent on selling the stock, not on causing a revolution in the boardroom. To go on, you need to speak for 10-15 per cent of the company (assuming there are no big blocks supportive of management). If you get to this level, you have done well: you have got the support of say three of the top five institutional shareholders in the company. Now the real task begins. You need time because there is now going to be a serious fight. You are not just challenging management decisions, but the very livelihoods of the managers. The stakes for them are much higher than for you, and they will fight hard. They also have money on their side: the board will activate the whole corporate finance panoply - auditors, lawyers, merchant bankers, stockbrokers, public relations consultants. Each will depict a good management doing its best. Their presentations will be authoritative because they are based on hard information from inside the company. Some changes in policy may be announced, together perhaps with the sale of a subsidiary. Are these sufficient for you? If not, check how the rest of your ginger group views them. It is important to maintain cohesion. The management's presentation is now being wheeled around the uncommitted institutional shareholders. Meanwhile, you are having to make your case without a battery of advisers. The company may be able to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds on professional fees, but your budget is likely to be close to zero. It will be hard to convince the trustee of your fund to allocate fund money for professional fees. Nor will your own company be an easy touch. Even if you do raise some money for professional fees, the other fund managers you have enlisted may be unable to do so. Your cohesiveness becomes more fragile. You lack experience of this type of exercise. Fund managers are listeners, not persuaders. Even if you have a flair for presentation, it will be difficult to match the management's arguments because you are working only on the basis of the information they have given you. Most debilitating of all, you are a coalition facing a dictator. The management will react quickly and decisively to each turn of events, whereas the fund managers, who work for different firms, may find decisions difficult to arrive at, especially when the writs start flying. Even if you have found the time, and can manage without the money, how about the visibility? How does your marketing director feel about your efforts? Corporate governance may be a good thing, but it tends to draw clients' attention to your bad investments. The next problem is the likely reaction from your other investments. In future, their managements may prove less willing to be open with you. Beware your own chief executive. Does it look wise, from where he sits, to put your firm in the spotlight? In reality, this sort of battle rarely happens, and for good reasons. At every stage there is only one rational course of action for the fund manager: sell the stock. If you cannot, you will have to wait for a takeover bid. Failing that, wait for the bad management to become so acute that the board itself sorts the problem out. Only if none of these solutions is possible will the odds be sufficiently in the fund manager's favour to make it worth exercising shareholder power.

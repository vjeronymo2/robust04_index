			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Arts: The mystery of the two yarnwinders - A question of attribution Leonardo da Vinci was infinitely distractable. In 1501, the head of the Carmelites in Florence wrote to warn Isabella d'Este that her chances of getting a painting out of Leonardo looked worse than ever. Leonardo, the prior reported, was so enthralled by mathematical experiments that 'he cannot bear the brush'. No doubt more irritating still for the marchioness was to learn that another collector, a Frenchman called Florimond Robertet, had now jumped the queue. Distracted Leonardo might have been, yet even so he managed to come up with what the prior recorded as a novel version of the Virgin and Child: the 'Madonna with the Yarnwinder'. Soon, Leonardesque painters were turning out versions and pastiches of it, both good and bad. Leonardo da Vinci. 'The Mystery of the Madonna of the Yarnwinder', at the National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh, takes a close look at a problem which has long bothered Leonardo scholars. Two unquestionably lovely versions of the theme have survived. Which has the stronger claim to be by Leonardo, and could it be the painting for Robertet? Puzzle-solving exhibitions have been the success story of this decade. The Edinburgh show runs true to type in not being particularly large, although it is filled out with drawings and historical material on Robertet, secretary to Charles XII. But the fact of the puzzle being about Leonardo, makes this the most significant show about scholarly sleuthing yet. The scholar in question is Professor Martin Kemp, creator of the memorable Hayward Gallery show of 1989. In 1898, two Madonnas with Yarnwinders were exhibited in the Burlington Fine Arts Society. One belonged - as it still does - to the Duke of Buccleuch. The other was the property of Lord Battersea and is now owned by a New York collector. As is the way of these things, each has had adherents as well as detractors, even as recently as the last decade. Researchers beavering away in the archives and scientists using infra-red reflectography, have helped push the question forward. Now, for the first time in almost a century, the two versions meet again. At a glance, it is clear that for all the obvious similarity, there are important differences. The New York version is brighter in colouring but, even to the layman's eye, more damaged. With its deep green-blue hue, the Buccleuch painting shows more clearly Leonardo's extraordinary 'smokey' technique in the way the flesh is modelled. It carries a strong echo of the Virgin of the Rocks. But most of all, the difference lies in entirely different backgrounds. In the New York painting, the Virgin and Child are seated in front of a dizzying view of ice-blue alpine ranges, reminding us of Leonardo's fascination with mountains. The Buccleuch version sets the figures in front of a murky landscape with rocky outcrops and bushes which border a desolate, dead-calm sea - something found nowhere else in Leonardo's work. If the varnish were not dirty and discoloured, the band of light at the horizon might be more eye-catching and point more clearly to the time-honoured description of the Virgin as stella maris, star of the sea. That said, it is hard to feel happy with the idea that anyone might fiddle about cleaning this calmly beautiful, melancholy painting. As the prior Fra Pietro implied to the marchioness, there was much for a sophisticated Christian to ponder in this novel scene. On one level, Leonardo shows a young mother patiently restraining her lively son who is in the way of her spinning. Medieval society naturally viewed the Virgin as a busy working mother. But the cruciform yarnwinder represents the cross and the Virgin's solemn expression suggests prescience of the sacrifice which her son will one day eagerly embrace. Many painters, notably Raphael, took up the idea of baby Jesus as an active little chap. No one, however, appears to have followed Leonardo's notion explored in one of the exhibition's drawings, of showing the Christ Child in the Virgin's arms, squeezing the life out of a cat. There was a legend that a cat gave birth at the same time as the Virgin, but Leonardo was motivated less by an interest in inventing subjects for their meaning, and far more for the formal opportunities they offered. The drawings, from public and private collections, bring out well Leonardo's insatiable curiosity about the underlying structure of the natural world. How did a child's anatomy differ from a man's? (It is a macabre thought, but Leonardo was presumably not able to dissect infants as he did grown men.) Babies dimpled, he noted, exactly where grown men had bulges. Among the sketches in the exhibition, we see a sheet covered in drawings of chubby limbs, together with studies of the Christ Child standing and walking, and of a child's head probably done to help members of the studio. Contemporaries particularly admired Leonardo's brilliance at conveying emotion through movement. Furiously executed sketches show him working out ideas. A sketch from a private collection shows one of the artist's stranger inventions: Christ slipping off the Virgin's lap, who in turn rises from the lap of her mother, St Anne. This drawing may help Leonardo scholars solve another mystery. It conforms exactly to another description by Fra Pietro, again writing to Isabella, this time about a cartoon. Could it be that the drawing is a fake, produced by someone who had read the prior's letter? Professor Kemp takes a more charitable view; that Leonardo went first, then someone with a clumsy touch went over the top of his outlines. What then, of the 'Mystery of the Madonna of the Yarnwinder'? Kemp's view is that both the Buccleuch and the New York paintings were mainly painted by Leonardo, but partly also by his assistants. The Buccleuch painting is that is the one secured by Florimond Robertet. But the New York painting is emphatically no mere 'copy'. Here is yet another exhibition which, like the Mantegna and the Rembrandt shows, aims to kick a hole through rigid ideas of Old Master authorship. From start to finish, the professor concludes, Leonardo had his hand in both these beautiful little Madonnas; happily for their owners, both are 'fully acceptable as works by Leonardo'. Exhibition runs to July 12 Sponsored by Martini Brut</p>

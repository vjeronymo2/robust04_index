			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> SHOP TALK: Let's talk corporate synergy. Giant Records mogul Irving Azoff liked  Aussie band Boom Crash Opera so much that he convinced Warner Bros.  </P> <P> Records, which distributes Azoff's new label, to let him have the group's new  album as his debut Giant release. Actually the record, titled "These Here Are  Hard Times" and due out June 12, is being issued under a one-time-only  Giant/Warner logo, in recognition of Warner's initial involvement with the  band. . . . Warrant is finishing up its new album, due later this summer. New  tunes include "I See Red," "Love in Stereo" and "Uncle Tom's Cabin." . . .  Ex-Prince proteges Wendy &amp; Lisa, after going nowhere at Columbia Records,  have signed with Virgin. Expect a new album later this summer. . . . Anita  Baker is back in July with a new album called "Compositions," which features  pop fare like "More Than You Know," "Soul Inspiration" and "Love You to the  Letter." . . . And our '70s Funk Flashback of the Week goes to Peppers, the  dance club located in City of Industry, which recently featured Tower of Power  and has the Ohio Players coming next Sunday and Kool &amp; the Gang due June  24.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] United Nations, February 20 (XINHUA) -- The  American U.N. ambassador, Madeleine Albright, said today that  the first thing NATO countries to do after the ultimatum  deadline is to make an assessment of the situation about the  compliance.    The ambassador made the remarks this evening when she was  asked by the CNN about her understanding on U.S. Defense  Minister William Perry's statement that there would be no air  strikes against targets in and around Sarajevo on Monday [21  February].    "My understanding is that Perry said that he was optimistic  about the direction in which the compliance was moving but he  also made it very clear that the ultimatum stood and the  deadline is in fact very clear."    She said that they were all encouraged by the pace of  withdrawal of heavy weaponry from around Sarajevo, as set by the  NATO ultimatum to be completed by midnight today.    The measure of success was not whether there were air  strikes, she said, it was whether the Serbs had complied.    In Washington, a Pentagon official said what Perry had said  was he was hopeful that there would be no air strikes on Monday,  CNN reported.</p>

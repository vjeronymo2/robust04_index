			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> OFFENSIVE PUSHED SALVADOR WAR TO NEW, BLOODIER LEVEL  </P> <P> First, there was an ominous tip from a factory guard on the northern edge of  San Salvador: Peasants in civilian clothing and military boots were asking  directions into the city.  </P> <P> Fighting had all but ceased in rural Chalatenango and Morazan provinces, the  traditional theaters of the civil war. Then, rebel radios fell silent, a sure  sign that the long-expected urban guerrilla offensive was about to begin.  </P> <P> By the time 1,500 to 2,000 guerrillas had infiltrated the city, the government  thought it was ready. Military units had been placed on alert, and President  Alfredo Cristiani had abandoned his residence. The rebels had lost the  advantage of surprise.  </P> <P> Yet, the intensity and duration of the offensive, which started the night of  Nov. 11, has mocked all official predictions and sent Cristiani's elected  right-wing government reeling.  </P> <P> After 2 1/2 weeks of fighting, the armed forces hold a tenuous advantage  against the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN). But the rebels  have slipped in and out of the city several times, striking again Wednesday at  a number of neighborhoods and occupying mansions of the rich. Few here are  willing to bet that the offensive, or the fierce right-wing backlash it has  provoked, will soon end.  </P> <P> "The crisis is just beginning," San Salvador Mayor Armando Calderon Sol said.  "The country has entered a very violent stage."  </P> <P> A right-wing businessman close to the government said: "Things are returning to  normal. But I'm afraid it will be a normalcy a lot like Beirut's."  </P> <P> For 10 years, the Marxist-led FMLN has fought a series of U.S.-backed  governments to a military standoff in the steamy coastal lowlands and forested  volcano slopes of this tiny agrarian nation. About 70,000 people have died.  </P> <P> The November offensive has produced neither a decisive popular uprising nor an  outright military victory. But it has advanced at least two rebel aims: It has  brought the chaos of the deadlocked peasant war into a city that has more than  one-third of El Salvador's 5.8 million people -- a situation that, if  prolonged, could make the country ungovernable; and it has unleashed a  murderous crackdown that swiftly undermined a decade of U.S. counterinsurgency  policy and $4 billion in aid aimed at building a political center.  </P> <P> State of Siege  </P> <P> El Salvador today is under a formal stage of siege, dominated by militarists on  the far left and the far right.  </P> <P> Both armies issued analyses this week boasting of military and political gains.  Interviews with diplomats and Salvadorans across the spectrum leave the  impression that the conflict has become even more intractable, with little hope  for a peaceful solution.  </P> <P> "The army and the guerrillas can both claim victory," leftist politician Ruben  Zamora said. "And a winner does not negotiate."  </P> <P> The rebels' offensive, their biggest of the war, appears to be part of a  two-track strategy to end the fighting through negotiation or outright military  victory.  </P> <P> While issuing a flurry of peace proposals throughout the year -- and starting  negotiations with the government in September -- the FMLN was stockpiling  thousands of weapons in urban hide-outs.  </P> <P> According to several sources, the stalling of the peace talks and the increase  of paramilitary attacks on pro-FMLN groups in the capital last month sparked  the battle plan to action.  </P> <P> The guerrillas attacked Cristiani's house as the offensive started. Rather than  focus on military targets, they entrenched themselves in working-class suburbs  north and east of downtown, handing weapons to anyone who would fight on their  side. In doing so, they trapped tens of thousands of people in those barrios.  </P> <P> "We knew the robber was going to enter the house, but we didn't know how," a  senior Salvadoran army officer admitted. "He didn't catch us asleep, but we  didn't know where he would be coming from."  </P> <P> The army appears to have underestimated the guerrillas' strength. It tried to  defend the capital with 3,000 soldiers, but they were spread thin. Gradually,  as simultaneous rebel raids on four other cities bogged down, the government  brought another 7,000 soldiers to the capital.  </P> <P> It was not until the air force began rocketing and strafing the occupied  neighborhoods -- on the fifth night of the offensive, after what one diplomat  called "days of massive confusion" -- that the government gained the advantage.  </P> <P> Yet, the government's relative ineffectiveness on the ground allowed most of  the rebels to slip out of the capital after nine days of hard fighting and  return with a startling siege of the wealthy Escalon neighborhood and the  Sheraton Hotel two days later. Rebel columns have been moving in and out of the  capital ever since.  </P> <P> "The army is reacting, not attacking," a Western diplomat said. "The FMLN  throughout this has dictated the when, the where, the how."  </P> <P> The army has admitted that more than 400 of its soldiers have been killed,  while it claims to have inflicted heavier casualties on the guerrillas. The  rebels do not report their losses. Hundreds of civilians have died in the  cross-fire and air raids.  </P> <P> In its analysis of the fighting, the army said the FMLN has "suffered a  military defeat . . . the greatest losses of its history." But it conceded that  "there are still possibilities that (the rebels) can initiate limited  offensives in the near future."  </P> <P> The rebels broadcast a long evaluation claiming that the offensive has brought  "accelerated political decomposition" to the capital, threatening the future of  U.S. aid and proving that there can be no peace without serious negotiations.  "The battle of San Salvador," it concluded, has barely begun.  </P> <P> The war's most important political battles are being fought in Washington.  Every turn of events in El Salvador is closely watched by an Administration and  Congress that provide roughly $1.4 million per day in aid to the Cristiani  government.  </P> <P> American public opinion was shocked by the slayings of six Jesuit priests,  their cook and her daughter on the fifth night of the rebel offensive -- an  attack widely viewed as retaliation by a rightist paramilitary death squad.  </P> <P> An army officer said the massacre was more damaging to the government than the  rebel offensive -- a view repeated by civilians close to Cristiani. It was  followed by a police crackdown on churches and leftist organizations and by  legislative approval of a sweeping anti-terrorist law that, among other things,  would make it a crime to speak in favor of FMLN peace proposals.  </P> <P> Skeptical of Salvadoran pledges to investigate the slayings, Democrats in  Congress tried to withhold 30% of El Salvador's current $85-million package of  military aid until next April. The attempt failed by a narrow margin.  </P> <P> Last weekend, the Salvadoran government scored a propaganda coup, one that  might neutralize any more moves to cut U.S. aid. It discovered the wreckage of  a light plane that crashed with 25 anti-aircraft missiles and other arms that  were apparently being sent to the rebels from Nicaragua. The missiles -- the  FMLN has not yet used such weapons -- were an ominous sign of escalating  warfare.  </P> <P> Because El Salvador is host to the largest U.S. counterinsurgency effort since  the Vietnam War, the all-out rebel attack has invited comparisons with the 1968  Tet offensive against the U.S.-backed government of South Vietnam. Tet  ultimately failed militarily, but it helped turn American public opinion  against U.S. involvement in the war.  </P> <P> Some Salvadorans prefer to compare the present situation to that of January,  1981, when the FMLN undertook its so-called final offensive in an effort to  seize power before Ronald Reagan became President. Despite conditions that made  El Salvador ripe for revolution then, the offensive sputtered out in a few  days.  </P> <P> Zamora, a leftist with ties to FMLN leaders, has spent much of the last two  years, since he was allowed to return from exile, trying to persuade the rebels  that political conditions have improved in El Salvador since 1981.  </P> <P> Thus, Zamora contends, although the FMLN came far better armed this time and  has sustained its offensive far longer, it failed to spark an insurrection  because people had become hopeful of a peaceful solution and too weary of the  war to want to take up arms.  </P> <P> "The offensive of the FMLN showed that it is a strong force that cannot be  defeated militarily," he said. "But at the same time, it became clear that the  people are not in an insurrectional stage."  </P> <P> The FMLN, which could not find enough people to use all of the weapons it had  smuggled into town, admitted in its analysis that an insurrection had been  thwarted. It blamed the government air strikes for intimidating potential  supporters.  </P> <P> But the sheer intensity of the fighting has worked in the rebels' favor by  aggravating the dismal social conditions that spawned their movement in the  first place. A decade of massive U.S. aid has failed to close the huge gap  between rich and poor. Half of all Salvadorans in the labor force lack adequate  employment.  </P> <P> Despite the questionable guerrilla tactic of entrenching combatants in crowded  neighborhoods and daring the army to blast them out, most people in  bomb-damaged homes blamed the military for their plight.  </P> <P> "This was not a conflict between two armies but between the airplanes and the  people," said a church worker who treated wounded civilians in the  working-class suburb of Mejicanos. "For the army in El Salvador, the poor are  an enemy to be combatted."  </P> <P> Nearly all of the fighting occurred in poor barrios, creating new homeless and  jobless people whom the state cannot care for. The government has estimated  $130 million in direct damage, not to mention the loss of foreign investment it  was courting.  </P> <P> Cristiani Hurt  </P> <P> The biggest loser in all this could be Cristiani, a wealthy businessman elected  last March on a protest vote against the troubled economic record of his  centrist predecessor, Jose Napoleon Duarte.  </P> <P> As with Duarte, U.S. policy-makers invested their hope in Cristiani not only to  manage the economy but also to rein in death squads and other anti-democratic  elements of the armed forces. Although founders of his Nationalist Republican  Alliance ran death squads in the early 1980s, Cristiani, a 42-year-old  political novice, is described by the U.S. Embassy as a decent man who means  well.  </P> <P> That moderate image, designed to court favor with Congress, has been severely  tested by the guerrilla offensive.  </P> <P> Cristiani has defended the harsh anti-terrorist law, rejected new peace talks  with the guerrillas and taken the radical step of suspending relations with  Nicaragua. In doing so, he has turned increasingly to the army high command for  advice.  </P> <P> "This is converting him into a dictator, as the majority of the army would  like," said a businessman who has been consulted by Cristiani. "I don't believe  he agrees with death squads. In that sense, he's a moderate. But he doesn't  believe in democracy."  </P> <P> On the other hand, U.S. officials and Cristiani's advisers credit him with  freeing some foreigners arrested in the police crackdown and preventing  less-discriminate military attacks on guerrilla-held barrios.  </P> <P> Roman Catholic Church officials say Cristiani's biggest test, the investigation  of the Jesuits' massacre, will depend on who wins a power struggle between  hard-liners and moderates in the armed forces and his party.  </P> <P> U.S. officials had hoped that an expected Dec. 1 shake-up of the armed forces  would push out extremist officers. But Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, the army chief  of staff, said Tuesday that there will be no shake-up while the fighting  continues.  </P> <P> When changes do come, those who fought well could be rewarded. For example,  Gen. Juan Rafael Bustillo, the hard-line air force chief, apparently has been  strengthened by his pilots' pivotal role in the recent fighting.  </P> <P> Other features of El Salvador's political landscape will not become clear until  the urban war fades -- if it does. A dusk-to-dawn curfew is in effect, and  hundreds of opposition leaders are silenced or in hiding, waiting to see if the  political center will reopen.  </P> <P> The biggest imponderable is the fate of the FMLN. Having endured heavy  casualties and exposed its carefully constructed civilian-support networks  without a clear victory, how long can Latin America's strongest irregular army  fight on?  </P> <P> Behind their accelerated push to end the conflict, according to diplomats in  Central America, was a feeling among the rebels that the East-West thaw is  quickly making an anachronism of liberation movements such as theirs.  Nicaragua's stepped-up support for the FMLN, in this view, could be part of a  last-ditch effort before regional negotiations oblige a halt to such aid.  </P> <P> But even then, the guerrillas are not likely to disarm and join a system that  so many Salvadorans consider unjust. Before the Nicaraguan connection hit the  news, U.S. officials had taken a sobering lesson from the rebel offensive: A  decade of counterinsurgency had made little progress.  </P> <P> "It's a disaster," a senior official in Washington said. "We knew we had  problems in El Salvador, but it's worse than we thought."  </P> <P> Times staff writers Doyle McManus in Washington and Tracy Wilkinson in San  Salvador contributed to this story.  </P></p>

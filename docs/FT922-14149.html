			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: NYSE firms post record profits WALL Street's booming trading conditions have been underlined by the 1991 results of securities companies belonging to the New York Stock Exchange. The firms reported record after-tax profits of Dollars 3.86bn for the year, compared with a loss of Dollars 106m in 1990. The previous record of Dollars 3.62bn was set in 1986. The record was achieved thanks to sharp rises in equity and bond markets, together with extremely heavy issuance of new stocks and fixed income securities, which are underwritten by Wall Street firms. This year has also started well, with Wall Street reaping record underwriting fees in the first quarter - some Dollars 1.73bn, compared with the record Dollars 1.6bn set in the fourth quarter of last year. However, observers question whether this hectic pace can be kept up over the course of the year. In the fourth quarter of last year the stock exchange firms made after-tax profits of Dollars 1.20bn, compared with a Dollars 128m loss a year earlier. In the third quarter of 1991 they reported profits of Dollars 842m. The figures do not include specialists who make markets in stocks on the floor of the exchange, but do not deal with the public. Revenues in 1991 totalled a record Dollars 61.31bn, up 13.4 per cent from Dollars 54.05bn in 1990. The previous peak was Dollars 59.54bn in 1989. Fourth-quarter revenues were Dollars 15.35bn, up 15 per cent from a year earlier. Revenues totalled Dollars 15.25bn in the third quarter. The full-year profits represented a 10.2 per cent annual return on the average net worth of Dollars 37.82bn. NYSE said member firms' expenses for 1991 had been Dollars 55.46bn, up 2.3 per cent from Dollars 54.19bn in 1990 and the second highest on record. The highest was Dollars 57.69bn in 1989. Expenses for the fourth quarter of 1991 increased 0.4 per cent to Dollars 13.53bn from Dollars 13.47bn in the same quarter in 1990.</p>

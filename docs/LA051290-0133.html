			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUDDHA'S BIRTHDAY  </P> <P> Most Buddhists observe the birthday of Siddhartha Gautama Buddha (circa 560-480  BC) in May, although the dates vary according to ethnic tradition and  scheduling convenience. Also called the Wesak festival, and commemorating the  Buddha's enlightenment as well, it is often celebrated on dates closest to the  full moon.  </P> <P> Japanese Buddhists observe the holiday in April, but some of their clergy take  part in the pan-Buddhist observances in May.  </P> <P> TRADITION: Siddhartha Gautama, son of a wealthy member of the Sakya clan, was  said to have been born at Lumbini near the present border of India and Nepal.  Protected in his youth from suffering, the young prince later saw the troubling  side of life and left his family to seek the right spiritual path, eventually  becoming a Buddha, or "Enlightened One."  </P> <P> OBSERVANCES: A joint Los Angeles-area celebration will be held today at Wat  Thai Temple in North Hollywood, starting at 9:30 a.m. Candles, flowers and  incense are offered and the baby Buddha is ritually bathed in a service  reflecting the legend of the religious founder's birth. Thai, Sri Lankan,  Cambodian and Laotian monks will pay homage to the Buddha and then Chinese,  Vietnamese, Japanese, Korean, Tibetan and Anglo-American monks will take part  in chanting. A seminar on clergy-laity relationships, from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m.,  will feature talks by Sri Lankan Abbot Walpola Piyananda and the Rev. Masao  Kodani of Senshin Buddhist Church.  </P></p>

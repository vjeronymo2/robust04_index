			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Radical economic plan proposed for Italy ITALY'S prime minister-designate, Professor Giuliano Amato, yesterday unveiled sweeping plans to tackle the country's huge public sector deficit centring on cuts in welfare spending, a tighter rein on the state payroll and greater accountability and autonomy for local authorities. The plans were contained in a 23-page discussion paper delivered to the 16 parties represented in Italy's new parliament. Restoring the country's public finances and bringing down inflation are the central elements in the paper which seeks to provide a tight framework for Italy to comply with the terms of the Maastricht treaty. The 54-year-old deputy leader of the Socialist party, who was asked to form a new government last Thursday by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, has refrained from detailed proposals in order to obtain reactions from the principal parties likely to support him. However, he is anxious to implement essential measures as soon as possible. The paper is an unusual example of strategic thinking and takes account of all the criticisms directed at Italy's faltering economic and political structure by its EC partners. According to Prof Amato, the next government must address four essential issues: the public sector deficit; electoral reform; organised crime; and a clean-up of morality in public life. On the economy, the paper says urgent decisions are necessary to curb public spending, especially the generous pensions scheme, public health subsidies and civil service employment. It also singles out the need to reform taxes, limiting progressive taxation, and ending some tax holidays while making collection more efficient. However, Prof Amato says short-term measures such as a mini-budget must be quickly accompanied by structural reform, reducing labour rigidities, creating more competition, and privatisation. So far he only has the backing of the four-party outgoing coalition led by the Christian Democrats. This gives him a 16-seat majority in the 630-seat chamber of deputies but is insufficient for such a radical plan. However, Yesterday Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the governor of the Bank of Italy, reminded the politicians yet again that time was running out. Talking to the Italian bankers' association, he said the Bank had managed in the past two weeks to protect the lira but the wave of speculation against the currency had made quick action ever more pressing.</p>

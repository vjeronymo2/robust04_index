			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Bosnian faction leaders gather for peace talks THE first face-to-face talks between leaders of the three warring factions in Bosnia-Hercegovina since hostilities began last spring open today in Geneva, amid mounting international pressure for outside military intervention to halt Serb aggression. The talks, due to break on Tuesday before resuming later this month, are aimed at thrashing out a political settlement for Bosnia based on the draft constitution prepared by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the international mediators, last October. This provides for a decentralised political structure, comprising between seven and 10 largely autonomous provinces based on geographical, economic and historical factors as well as ethnic composition and strong human and minority rights guarantees. Attending today's meeting will be Mr Alija Izetbegovic, president of the mainly Moslem Bosnian government, Mr Mate Boban, the Bosnian Croat leader, and Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader. President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia and President Dobrica Cosic of the rump Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) will also be represented. While the politicians discuss Bosnia's constitutional future, and in particular where the provincial boundaries should be drawn, their military advisers will continue talks begun under UN auspices in the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo. These will focus on the demilitarisation of the city, a reduction of hostilities throughout Bosnia and a lifting of the siege on Moslem-held towns. Expressing fears that talk of military intervention could undermine the Geneva negotiations, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary-general, this week described today's historic meeting as a 'last chance' for the peace process. However, Mr Vance and Lord Owen are said to see it as a 'first chance' for top-level negotiations between the protagonists, in which a Bosnian settlement would pave the way for a broader regional accord. The talks, which are the culmination of four months of painstaking peace-broking by Mr Vance and Lord Owen, follow last month's elections in Serbia which confirmed hardline President Slobodan Milosevic in power, and the reluctant acquiescence by Mr Izetbegovic to sit down at the same table as Mr Karadzic whom he (and the US administration) labels a war criminal. The Bosnian government and Bosnian Croats are said to have moved closer in talks last weekend to drawing provincial boundaries, and Mr Vance and Lord Owen will have their own map in readiness to move the bargaining process along. But when Lord Owen met Mr Karadzic and Mr Milosevic in Belgrade on Wednesday there was no detectable sign of flexibility in Serb demands for a single Bosnian Serb 'state-within-a-state' which could at some stage become part of a Greater Serbia.</p>

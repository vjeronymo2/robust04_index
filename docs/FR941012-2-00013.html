The revised application and APO respond to the concerns and requests of the Trade Bar that regularly uses our APO procedures. Copies of the proposed revised application for APO and the proposed standard APO are printed at the end of this notice, and are available in the Central Records Unit. Written comments will be considered before the ITA issues a final decision regarding this matter, if received not later than 60 days after publication of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  October 12, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Ann Sebastian, for Investigations, at (202) 482&hyph;3354, Maureen McPhillips, for Compliance, at (202) 482&hyph;3019, or Andrew Lee Beller, Central Records Unit, Import Administration, at (202) 482&hyph;1248.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ITA's APO procedures apply to the vast quantity of proprietary information ITA receives in the course of its administrative antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) proceedings from both foreign governments and companies, and the U.S. domestic industry. The Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905, prevents a federal agency from disclosing business proprietary information unless a specific exemption is provided by statute. Section 777 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1677a, however, provides an exemption for the ITA from the Trade Secrets Act, and permits limited disclosure of business proprietary information under an APO to representatives of parties to specific proceedings for which the proprietary information was submitted. The purpose of limited disclosure is to provide representatives with the information necessary to fully represent the interests of the parties in open and fair proceedings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ITA last revised its APO application, procedures, and relevant regulations in 1989 in order to implement the provisions of The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (the Omnibus Trade Act) affecting access under APO. The Omnibus Trade Act broadened the scope of disclosure of business proprietary information under APO, required direct service of APO information on authorized parties, and established statutory deadlines for the release of APO information. Given the dramatic increase in the amount of information submitted in ITA's proceedings, as well as in the increased desire for access to electronic media, the 1989 APO application and procedures reflected ITA's concerns that information in both hard copy and electronic form be adequately protected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under these still current procedures, ITA's APO application and the APO itself contain detailed restrictions on the use and distribution of proprietary information. A party's representative submits an APO application, and the ITA generally issues an APO to that representative. Except for instances where a party is represented by co-counsel, a party may have only one representative for each proceeding. If a party wishes to have an additional representative, it must operate through the single representative. Any time a party wishes to add or change a representative, it must file an additional APO application, and the ITA will issue an amended APO.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: St James Beach rises to Pounds 1.67m In its first set of results since gaining a full listing in April, St James Beach Hotels, which operates in the Caribbean, beat its prospectus with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.67m for the year to March 31, against a forecast Pounds 1.64m. The company, which has changed its year end from September 30, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.92m for the six months to March 31. The annual profit for the year to September 30 1993 was Pounds 254,000. Earnings per share came out at 12.11p (2.15p) or 8.22p fully diluted, also ahead of forecast. Turnover rose to Pounds 8.85m (Pounds 7.51m), with room occupancy rates 18.2 per cent ahead on the comparable 12 month period. In the last three months of the financial year occupancy rates rose to 79 per cent (53 per cent). The company has completed the Pounds 2.6m acquisition of the Barbados Beach Village hotel since the year end. This has been renamed the Crystal Cove and closed for refurbishment, in a programme which will add Pounds 2m to the company's capital expenditure for next year. Negotiations are in progress for the purchase of a warehouse and office in Barbados for Pounds 1.1m to provide the company with a new headquarters. In line with the dividend policy stated in the prospectus, the group is planning a first interim in respect of the period to September 30 1994. The shares closed down 2p at 126p against an initial placing price of 120p.</p>

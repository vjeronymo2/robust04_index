			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Beckett seeks to secure her job MRS MARGARET Beckett insisted yesterday that her position as Labour's deputy leader was secure, in spite of rising speculation that her failure to give Mr John Smith whole-hearted support over the reform of Labour's union links had put her post at risk. Shadow cabinet colleagues - including Mr John Prescott who is now seen as the frontrunner for deputy leader should he want the post - publicly expressed support for her and paid tribute to her behind-the-scenes work. Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury and a newly elected member of Labour's ruling National Executive, said reports that Mrs Beckett had equivocated had been 'blown up out of all proportion'. In private, however, many senior figures were sharply critical of her lack of enthusiasm for reforming the union role in candidate selection, and said that her strongest card was that there was no desire within the party for an internal election. Friends of Mr Prescott yesterday said that he should be rewarded for his effective and bravura performance in Thursday's debate on union links with a senior economic position. A transfer from the transport to the employment portfolio was seen as the most likely move. The manoeuvrings in advance of the shadow cabinet elections took some of the gloss off Mr Smith's narrow but decisive victory on the role of the unions. The speculation has also intensified the pressure on Mrs Beckett to produce an effective performance when she speaks to the conference today on party campaigns. In a series of media interviews yesterday Mrs Beckett said that her position was safe and that although she agreed Mr Prescott would be a 'superb' deputy leader, 'I'm afraid I do think that I'd be a better one'. She said she did not accept that she gave 'only qualified support' to Mr Smith. 'It is nonsense for people to try to pretend there are some differences between me and John or that it has caused problems for us and the party,' she said. Her comments, however, failed to put an end to discussion about her continued future at a senior level. Some colleagues said that her task is now to ensure that if anyone outside the shadow cabinet - such as Mr Bryan Gould - sought to mount a challenge, he would not achieve support to force a contest. The prospects of a reshuffle after the shadow cabinet elections later this month has prompted some frontbenchers to talk about a move from education for Mrs Ann Taylor, whom many colleagues think is ineffective in the job.</p>

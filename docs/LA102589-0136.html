			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MONARCH BUTTERFLY'S MIGRATION STILL A MYSTERY, DESPITE DECADES OF STUDY;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: NO OTHER INSECT MIGRATES, AND SCIENTISTS ARE UNABLE TO EXPLAIN THE  PHENOMENON. DO THEY NAVIGATE BY THE SUN OR BY EARTH'S MAGNETIC FIELD? NO ONE  KNOWS.  </P> <P> Conditions are nearly ideal as John Fales heads briskly out the front door with  his butterfly net and a worn green canvas bag slung over his shoulder.  </P> <P> It's 75 degrees on a mostly sunny afternoon in the early fall. A gentle breeze  ripples the waters of Chesapeake Bay, a short walk from Fales' home at Plum  Point in Calvert County, Md.  </P> <P> Fales records the temperature from a gauge atop a pole in his yard and writes  down the time. Ready now, he scans the shrubs in his yard and the sky overhead.  He is quickly rewarded.  </P> <P> "There goes one," he says, glimpsing a monarch butterfly as it flutters  overhead, too high to catch.  </P> <P> The monarch is flying due south, following an ancient migratory path to its  winter home in Mexico.  </P> <P> No other insect migrates as the monarch does. Each fall, millions east of the  Rockies from Texas to Canada fly south, to return in the spring. Those in the  West winter near the coast in Southern California and Baja California.  </P> <P> Despite decades of study, scientists cannot fully explain the phenomenon. Do  they navigate by the sun or take their cue from the Earth's magnetic field? No  one knows. The mystery enhances the allure of one of the most beautiful and  popular of butterflies.  </P> <P> The migration is easily observed in early fall. The butterfly's distinctive  wings of burnt orange, black and white as well as its larger-than-average size  make it stand out. You can spot monarchs as they stop to feed in gardens, along  the beach or at the sides of highways. Or just look up.  </P> <P> "Between Labor Day and the middle of October, on any really sunny day I could  go out in the mall and see them flying overhead," says Robert K. Robbins,  research entomologist at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.  </P> <P> There might be one monarch or many. Philip Kean, a member of the Maryland  Entomological Society, once saw thousands clustered in a field of tick weed  sunflowers near in Anne Arundel County, "tanking up for the trip home."  </P> <P> Scientists assume that the monarch has been making this annual journey for  thousands of years; whether they can continue it will depend on actions of its  worst enemy: people. The butterfly's winter homes are under assault. In Mexico,  poor people living next to the forests of coyumel firs where the monarchs stay  have cut into them for timber and to clear land for crops. In California,  developers' projects have destroyed the insects' habitat.  </P> <P> A number of private organizations and the government of Mexico, however, have  taken action in the '80s to prevent irreversible damage.  </P> <P> Mexico's efforts in particular are noteworthy. In an impoverished country where  environment often takes a back seat to economy, the national government has  established monarch refuges. The refuges, or reservas, are a two-hour drive  southwest of Mexico City in an area of about 1,500 square miles. Despite the  official designation, however illegal encroachment has occurred.  Preservationists believe that the monarch's security depends on developing  economic alternatives for the resentful residents nearby.  </P> <P> "They're very, very poor people," said Alfredo Arellano, a biologist with the  Monarch Civil Assn., a private group in Mexico City. "They want work."  </P> <P> Even limited logging can hurt the monarch, however. Thinning of the forest  results in higher temperatures in the day and lower ones at night, upsetting an  environment that would otherwise be a perfect spot for the mariposa monarch to  spend the winter.  </P> <P> Biologists say that if the temperature rises too much, the monarchs become too  active, burning energy they need to survive and to make the return flight  north. If it becomes too cold, the monarchs die.  </P> <P> In the United States, the Xerces Society and National Wildlife Federation are  among the organizations supporting efforts to preserve the monarch. A number of  scientists are trying to unravel its secrets, with the assistance of volunteers  such as Fales who pass on their observations and tag butterflies so that they  can be tracked.  </P> <P> Fales has been collecting butterflies of all kinds since 1942. He was an  entomologist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture research facility in  Beltsville, Md., until 1972, when he retired and moved with his wife to their  small house overlooking the bay.  </P> <P> Fales, who is fit and nimble at age 76, snares the butterflies with a quick  snap of his net and tags them with the dexterity of a surgeon.  </P> <P> He spots what looks like a monarch perched in a patch of wildflowers. It turns  out to be a viceroy, a look-alike that often fools an untrained eye. The  viceroy also fools birds, which generally avoid monarchs because the chemicals  derived from the butterflies' ingestion of milkweed, their favorite food, make  them a poisonous meal.  </P> <P> Fales soon nets the real thing. Kneeling, he opens the bag to extracts his  tools: a peanut jar containing ethyl acetate, which he uses to kill butterflies  he intends to collect, and a small box.  </P> <P> Fales removes the struggling butterfly from the net and lays it on the yellow  jar top, his thick fingers holding it gently in place. He takes a marker and,  with the pointed end, delicately scrapes off a small patch of scales on both  sides of the top right wing, being careful not to poke through the wing  membrane. Then he picks up a folded gummed tag a bit larger than a thumbtack  and places it on the cleared area of the wing, pressing gently.  </P> <P> The white tag has a number, 1099, and the address of the Natural History Museum  in Los Angeles, where monarch research data is collected. So far, none of the  butterflies Fales has tagged during the past four years has turned up.  </P> <P> Fales then tosses the tagged monarch into the air. It obstinately heads  northward, ignoring Fales' prediction that it would go the other way. He seems  mildly surprised, but the other butterflies he tags this afternoon do fly  south.  </P> <P> The typical generation of monarch does not live more than a month, Fales says,  but the migrating generation can live long enough to survive the winter and a  trip of perhaps 2,500 miles.  </P> <P> Part of the mystery is that no one is sure how far north a monarch makes it  back in the spring. Fales has caught tired specimens whose colors have faded  and wings have become ragged, suggesting that their trips had started far to  the south. Scientists are certain, however, that the butterflies mate along the  journey north, producing new generations that join the migration.  </P> <P> "I've been monitoring the monarchs for many years," Fales says. "In the last  couple of years, it's been in short supply. We're trying to figure out what's  going on."  </P> <P> In 1987 and 1988, Fales said, there was not a "massive fall migration" --  during one of those, you can spot 100 in a 10-minute period. The numbers have  so far been small this year, he said, although higher than they were for 1988.  </P> <P> In Mexico, preservationists have discovered four new wintering sites, all in  the same region, according to a report last summer by Fred Urquhart. Urquhart  is the Canadian scientist who deserves much of the credit for discovering the  monarch's winter homes.  </P> <P> For many years, scientists suspected that monarchs migrated to Mexico, but they  did not know where. Finally, in 1975, an American named Kenneth Brugger, using  information from Urquhart, found a colony of monarchs. Local residents, of  course, had known all along about the butterflies.  </P> <P> In the 14 years since, the butterflies have acquired many friends, the  Entomological Society of America among them. The society is one of more than 11  groups seeking to make the butterfly the national insect.  </P> <P> Mexicans are also fond of their colorful visitors, and one refuge is open to  the public to accommodate the increasing number of people who want to see an  unusual sight.  </P> <P> On a chilly morning last January, for instance, tens of thousands of monarchs  -- too many to estimate -- were clumped like leaves in the branches of tall fir  trees in a forest in the state ofMichoacan more than 7,000 feet above sea  level. As the sun climbed higher into the sky, warming the air, the butterflies  begin to stir. Thousands begin to fly between the trees and to light on bushes.  A few settled on the awe-struck people who had trekked up a steep unpaved path  to the refuge.  </P> <P> "It's a glorious silent dance," whispered Connecticut artist Lois Read as she  painted the scene in watercolors.  </P></p>

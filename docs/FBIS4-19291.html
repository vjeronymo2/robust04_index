			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has  promised Poland support from Germany on its path to the European  Union [EU]. After a meeting with Polish Prime Minister Waldemar  Pawlak, Kohl told journalists in Bonn today that he will be  starting initiatives to this effect during Germany's EU  presidency. Poland's application to join the EU played an  important part in the talks with Pawlak.    Kohl stressed that Poland has made considerable progress in  its economic reforms over the past few years. Germany wants to  support that process as far as possible. The chancellor said he  has always resisted any suggestion that Germany's eastern  borders could represent the EU's border in the future. It is  therefore important for Poland, like the Czech Republic,  Slovakia, and Hungary, to find its way to the EU. However, the  decision on EU membership rests in the first instance with those  countries themselves.    Kohl stressed that German-Polish relations have developed  positively over the past years. The task for the future is to  achieve equally trusting and good-neighborly relations with  Poland as exist with France.</p>

			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNCILMAN FAILS TO REPORT WIFE'S INCOME FROM FIRM;  </P> <P> ETHICS: GARY L. HAUSDORFER MIGHT HAVE VIOLATED STATE LAW IN NOT DISCLOSING THE  INFORMATION. HIS SPOUSE WORKS FOR A COMPANY THAT HAS CITY CONTRACTS.  </P> <P> City Councilman and regional transportation commissioner Gary L. Hausdorfer, in  possible violation of state law, has failed to disclose income received by his  wife from a prominent planning and engineering firm that does business in the  city.  </P> <P> Records reviewed by The Times also show that Hausdorfer -- who was mayor at the  time -- voted in September to approve a city contract with a company whose  subcontractors included the firm that employs his wife.  </P> <P> In an interview, Hausdorfer said Friday that he was unaware when he voted that  his wife's employer, The Keith Cos., was authorized in the contract to receive  $8,100. That vote and his failure to report his wife's income on his 1988 and  1989 disclosure forms, he said, might have been "mistakes."  </P> <P> "You try to avoid all these things, and life's too short not to," said  Hausdorfer, who owns a commercial mortgage business. " . . . If I've made  mistakes, then I'll take the blame. . . . We certainly have nothing to hide."  </P> <P> Hausdorfer's wife, Debora, is director of public affairs for The Keith Cos., a  firm that does work on behalf of developers and public agencies throughout  Orange County. She said that she began working for Keith in late 1988 and that  her duties include efforts to obtain new contracts -- although not in San Juan  Capistrano.  </P> <P> State conflict-of-interest law requires public officials to disclose the  sources of their income -- including community property income generated by a  spouse -- and to abstain from governmental decisions that affect those income  sources.  </P> <P> In addition to being a councilman since 1978, Hausdorfer also is a member of  two powerful regional transportation agencies: the Orange County Transit  District and the Foothill-Eastern Transportation Corridor Agency.  </P> <P> Hausdorfer said that he recently abstained on one matter that came before the  Foothill Transportation Corridor -- the agency that is building two toll roads  in eastern Orange County -- because The Keith Cos. had an involvement.  </P> <P> "I don't vote on anything that has their name on it," said Hausdorfer, 44.  </P> <P> The San Juan Capistrano council vote involving the Costa Mesa-based firm came  in September, at a time when Hausdorfer was serving as mayor. The issue was  whether to approve a $304,197 contract for a study of how to use 140 acres of  agricultural land that San Juan Capistrano voters agreed last spring to acquire  through a $120-million bond issue.  </P> <P> The Keith Cos., which had received earlier city payments for studying the 140  acres and surrounding properties in the city's northwest area, was authorized  in the September contract to get $8,100 of the total award. After presentations  by planners and discussion, the council voted unanimously to approve the  contract, according to minutes of the meeting.  </P> <P> "If they (The Keith Cos.) are officially a part of the team, I didn't know it,  and it wasn't pointed out to me" at the time of the council's vote, Hausdorfer  said, noting that the bulk of the award went to The Keith French Group, a San  Clemente firm unrelated to the company that employs Debora Hausdorfer.  </P> <P> Hausdorfer had championed the open-space initiative approved by voters last  spring. And, The Keith Cos. has been involved in studying that land since at  least 1988, according to city records.  </P> <P> San Juan Capistrano paid The Keith Cos. $19,081 -- on Aug. 10, 1989, and on  June 28, 1990 -- for work related to the city's "Northwest Planning Study."  Records reviewed by The Times also show that, beginning in May, 1987, and  continuing through October, 1990, San Juan Capistrano paid the firm $109,321  for other professional services. The council approved all the Keith payments in  routine "consent calendar" actions.  </P> <P> Hausdorfer, commenting on his not reporting his wife's income on his disclosure  statements, said that he did not believe he was required to do so because Keith  was not operating and "located" in San Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> State law, however, requires officials such as Hausdorfer to disclose such an  income source if the company is located or has done business within the city,  according to Jeevan Ahuja, an attorney with the state Fair Political Practices  Commission. Ahuja said that a company's physical location is irrelevant.  </P> <P> "If that's the case," said Hausdorfer, "it's easy to amend (the earlier  disclosure statements) and I'll check with the FPPC and the city attorney."  </P> <P> The Keith firm has been active with a number of other significant projects in  San Juan Capistrano since the mid-1980s, including the planning and designing  of a members-only development that was approved by the council in 1987 and 1988  -- the Marbelle Golf and Country Club.  </P> <P> Hausdorfer said his wife went to work for Keith in late 1988 after being  introduced to the firm's owner by her former employer.  </P> <P> "I stay out of my wife's business career," Hausdorfer said. "She stays out of  mine."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Jeffrey A. Perlman contributed to this report.  </P></p>

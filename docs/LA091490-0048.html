			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY BOOSTS PAY FOR FIRM RUNNING TROUBLED HOTEL  </P> <P> The Oxnard Redevelopment Agency will more than double the amount a consulting  firm can earn for managing property and relocating residents of the Lemon Tree  Hotel, officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> The agency decided recently to increase the pay limit from $86,100 to $192,100  for Mecky Myers and Associates of Redondo Beach because the job turned out to  be more involved than expected, according to agency reports.  </P> <P> The motel was used primarily as housing for about 150 tenants. It was  overcrowded and some of the 45 small rooms held as many as eight people. Myers  is in charge of helping the residents find affordable housing before the city  can demolish the hotel to make way for public parking.  </P> <P> In addition, Mecky Myers and Associates originally were hired to provide an  on-site resident manager at the motel. But "due to the nature of the Lemon Tree  Hotel, two full-time on-site resident managers have resided at the hotel since  the agency took possession," the report said.  </P> <P> "It is the mecca of crime in the city," said Senior Crime Analyst David Keith  of the Oxnard Police Department. "It's the No. 1 address in the city as far as  crime is concerned. Homicide, robbery, burglary, theft, sexual assault,  narcotics-related crime: You name it, it's happened there."  </P> <P> The city condemned the building two months ago, and owner Bertha Ochoa will  receive $795,000 for the 25-year-old hotel.  </P> <P> Ochoa could not be reached for comment.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, May 30 (BTA) -- "I do not think the world  has become a safer place now there is no Warsaw Pact. Quite the  opposite, many analysts admit the danger for armed conflicts has  become greater," Russian Federation Security Council Chief  Secretary Oleg Lobov said upon his arrival at the Sofia Airport.  Mr. Lobov is heading a Russian Government delegation on an  official visit to this country. The delegation also includes  the Russian Federation deputy ministers of economy,  foreign-trade affairs, defence and finance, senior officials of  the military-industrial complex and businessmen.    "While the danger for a nuclear war might be more distant  now, we see local conventional wars breaking out just beyond the  Russian and Bulgarian borders," the Russian guest also said.  "We should therefore seek to stabilize the bilateral relations  in the name of a greater world security," he also said.    "We hope that Bulgaria and Russia will further promote their  bilateral contacts, and not only those in the economy but in  culture and tourism as well," Mr. Lobov said commenting on the  results the visit is expected to bring. This visit is aimed,  among other things, at restoring the broken contacts between the  two countries, the head of the Russian delegation said. He  further specified that apart from the contacts on government  level, the visit will focus on the direct ties between Bulgaria  and the different administrative units and autonomous republics  within the federation. The sides will also discuss the military  and technical cooperation which is of particular importance for  both countries, Mr. Lobov said.</p>

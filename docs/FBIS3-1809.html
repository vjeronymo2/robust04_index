In an interview with local journalists, Qian said, "After  the  end of the cold war, the world peace can be maintained, but  there are sill power politics and hegemonism in the world as  well as regional confrontations and turbulences".    He pointed out that the economic environment of many  developing countries are worsening and the gap between North and  South are widening.    Thus so, Qian noted that maintaining the world peace and  developing economy has become the main task of the world today.  In order to achieve this task, "China stands for establishing  an new international political and economic order which should  be founded on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful  Co-existence".    "If we say that China can play a certain role in this  process, China should be a factor for promoting the world peace  and economic development".    Asked about China's market economy, Qian said, "The  objective  of China's economic reform is to build a socialist market  economy. This is a new trial and China's experience in the  recent past has proved that this new trial is very successful."    "Over the past 15 years, market economy in China has been  gradually instituted and the economic growth has continued",  Qian said.</p>

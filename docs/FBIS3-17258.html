			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Vladimir Gondusov and Galina </F> Gridneva]    [Text] Dushanbe March 23 TASS -- "The law on the status of  Russia's peacemaking forces may be adopted by legislators  already in April this year," Pavel Grachev, Russian defense  minister, said today at a meeting with servicemen of the  Tajikistan-stationed 201st Motorized Infantry Division forming a  part of the collective peacemaking forces in Tajikistan.    The Russian defense minister is currently in this central  Asian republic in connection with conducting exercises of the  collective peacemaking forces in the south of Tajikistan.    The adoption of the law on the status of the Russian  peacemaking forces will allow to resolve many problems including  the one concerning social benefits to servicemen and members of  their families located outside Russia, Russian Defense Minister  Pavel Grachev stressed.    The fate of the Russian troops in Tajikistan whose term of  stay expires on December 31 this year "will depend on the  political solution to the problems of this region", the minister  told ITAR- TASS in an exclusive interview.    At the same time, he noted, the "strategic interests of  Russia and other Commonwealth countries make Russia to station  its troops in the republic and on the Tajik-Afghan border".    Speaking on the exercises being carried out in the south of  the republic, the defense minister emphasised that this was not  the "demonstration of force" but a planned event within the  framework of collective security of the Commonwealth countries.    According to Pavel Grachev, one of the aims of his visit is  to discuss principles and terms of a political settlement of the  region's problems with the leadership of the republic and the  command of the peacemaking forces.    "Negotiations are the main way to the peaceful settlement of  the conflict," Pavel Grachev stressed. The variant of handing  over the peacemaking forces from the Defense Ministry to any  other department is unacceptable as other departments "have no  experience of handling troops", the Russian defense minister  pointed out.    On Thursday morning Pavel Grachev is due to visit the area  of  the exercises of the peacemaking forces.</p>

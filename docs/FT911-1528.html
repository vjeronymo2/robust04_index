			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family (Serious Money): Why paranoia can pay dividends YOU DO not have to be paranoid to be a financial services consumer, but it helps. Take the commissions versus fees debate, which may not cause too many arguments in your local Dog &amp; Duck, but which can rouse tempers in the life assurance industry. A small company, Campbell Financial Services, has caused a stir by offering a discount pensions service. Clients could ask the advice of a commission-charging adviser but then switch to the Campbell service for execution. They would be charged a fee of Pounds 199 but initial commission, which could be as much as Pounds 1,000 for a long-term policy, would be rebated. The service was far from perfect - Campbell planned to keep any excess commissions it earned and ethical questions were inevitably raised about the likely poaching of clients. But it was in keeping with the Thatcherite philosophy that competition, red in tooth and claw, can benefit consumers. Vengeance came on Campbell from all directions. Its phone line was jammed with obscene and threatening calls from competitors, leading to the involvement of the police. There was a demand for a boycott of the company. Then Fimbra suspended the group for lacking capital backing just over a week ago. The investigation was unconnected with the recent controversy, said the regulator. But after the bad publicity over the weekend, the company was reinstated on Monday, having sorted out its problem. Fimbra was probably only doing its job - and Campbell admits the service was its main hope of pulling itself out of an unprofitable period. But it is not necessary to believe that Campbell is entirely whiter than white to feel slightly uneasy at the way it was treated. Fees have many advantages for consumers, not the least of which is that they ensure that the adviser and the client have a commonality of interest. An adviser charging commission may be independent, but it is impossible for him to be entirely disinterested. Of course, journalists tend to be great enthusiasts for fees, an attitude which causes advisers to smile at their naivety. Out trot the counter-arguments in quick succession. The public is not prepared to pay fees This is probably because consumers do not know what they are paying. It is easy to believe, when consulting your friendly adviser, that commission comes out of some ill-defined insurance company 'pot' and not from your own pocket. This is because the system of telling you what you fork out is opaque. The regulatory body, the Securities and Investments Board, has hardly been the consumer's champion in this respect. The public will be driven into the arms of the tied agents, whose commissions are much easier to hide This argument is really a development of the first. It depends on consumers being told as little as possible about the products they buy. If advisers charge fees and recommend the policies of life companies with the lowest expenses, they should be able to demonstrate value for money compared with tied agents. As Eric Short pointed out in the last Weekend FT, life company expenses are a vital component of investment return. Again, the regulators (Lautro this time) have produced rules which tend to obfuscate rather than elucidate the issues. Why should commissions be revealed, when consumers are not told the mark-up on a washing machine? When you choose a washing machine, you know exactly what it is for - washing clothes - and it is easy to compare its price and functions with other models. A washing machine has a warranty if it goes wrong in the short term; but it could be decades before you find out whether a life assurance policy has performed well and you will then have little comeback. In any case, the function of a financial services product is to give you a return on the money you invest. The charges you pay are thus the very essence of the product's worth. Independent financial advisers will go out of business, under a fee-based system. One can see the appeal of this argument to an adviser, but not to a consumer. It is certainly worth having independent financial advice but the title IFA is a recent creation applied to people who were previously called  -perish the thought - insurance salesmen. Ten years ago, 'independent' financial advice was seen to come from accountants, solicitors and, rightly or wrongly, bank managers. Many of the last-named, now that banks are financial supermarkets, may no longer fit the name. But why cannot consumers turn to accountants for advice? It is hard to believe, with 200,000 UK accountants, that they cannot fill most of the market niches. All this is not to deny that many financial advisers are extremely professional and try hard to give their clients a good service. It is just that the system for selling financial services is flawed. It was set up to suit the life insurance companies, not the consumer. One of the most suspicious slogans of all is that 'life insurance must be sold, not bought.' It can be used to cover a multitude of sins and it is easy to insert the words 'double glazing' for life insurance without changing the sense. The system is changing slowly but be suspicious. Check how your adviser is being paid and ask for commissions to be rebated. Paranoia can pay dividends.</p>

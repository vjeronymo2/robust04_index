			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BOY BURIED WAIST-HIGH IN BRICKS FROM CHIMNEY  </P> <P> A 10-year-old boy was buried waist-high in more than 2,000 pounds of bricks  when a chimney collapsed, but police said he was not seriously injured and was  in stable condition Sunday.  </P> <P> The chimney, all that was left of a house formerly on a lot where the boy was  playing, collapsed Saturday, apparently because the boy and a friend were  beating on it with sticks, police said. It took rescuers about 20 minutes to  free the boy, who suffered a fractured thighbone.  </P></p>

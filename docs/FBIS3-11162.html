The OAS-sponsored meeting opened in Buenos Aires  yesterday,    Chatting informally, the participants were more emphatic  than  Di Tella. They stated that "every time the OAS discusses the  security issue, the Armed Forces of member countries have been  systematically excluded. It is time the military component of  the policies of member countries was considered as a factor in  the OAS assessments."    Di Tella addressed an auditorium in which uniformed members  of the Armed Forces of the OAS member countries mingled with  suited diplomats. He stated: "Until we can impose a new pace in  the military field, the integration process lacks an  indispensable component for its consolidation."    The Argentine foreign minister said: "It is time to combine  our political, economic, and social progress with the military  aspect."    He said this should be based on the following essential  premises: Defining military doctrines based on legitimate  defense needs; and "clarity" through communication, information,  observation, verification, and the maintenance of a subregional  military balance that will finally lead to a "functional  integration."    This change of attitude by OAS member countries comes just  as  the United States is exerting pressure on the Latin American  military to engage directly in the struggle against trafficking.    This contradicts an ancient and deep-rooted lack of  confidence within OAS member countries: The Armed Forces are  considered latent coupist elements -- following the experience  of decades -- against democratic governments.    As for the possible objectives of the meeting, Di Tella said  that the OAS can become "a natural forum for discussion,  agreement, and implementation of hemispheric decisions on  security issues." There is also "the possibility of  establishing a regional center to prevent and handle conflicts  and controversies."    Hernan Patino Mayer -- the Argentine ambassador to the OAS,  who is one of the main promoters of the meeting -- asserted that  the Armed Forces of the region "have a special role to play in  this continental integration process."</p>

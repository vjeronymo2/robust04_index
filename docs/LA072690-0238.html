			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> $500,000 VIOLIN STILL MISSING  </P> <P> A $500,000 Stradivarius violin owned by violinist Erich Gruenberg remains  missing today after disappearing from an airport baggage cart at Los Angeles  International Airport.  </P> <P> "The violin is still outstanding and we have no suspects at this time,"  detective Jerry Sparks said.  </P> <P> Gruenberg, 65, was carrying the violin, crafted in 1731, as he checked through  customs at Los Angeles International Airport on Tuesday, Sparks said.  </P> <P> But Gruenberg noticed that the violin was missing from the baggage cart  "somewhere along the way" to ground transportation, the detective said.  </P> <P> Thefts at the airport are common, but in this case the thief may not have  realized the cart was carrying a Stradivarius.  </P> <P> The instrument was insured for about $500,000. Also stolen was a violin worth  $8,000 and two bows worth $3,500.  </P></p>

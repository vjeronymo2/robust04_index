The delegation included Deputy Prime Ministers Gagik  Martirosyan and Gagik Shakhbazyan, Transport Minister Henrik  Kochinyan, Davit Shakhnazarian, the chairman of the National  Security Department, the head of the president's office, Shagen  (Kara-Muntyan), and other government officials.    Levon Ter-Petrosyan and the other guests were given a hearty  welcome at Tbilisi airport by Eduard Shevardnadze, the chairman  of the Georgian Supreme Council and head of state, Prime  Minister Otar Patsatsia, the chief of the head of state's  office, Vazha Lordkipanidze, and other officials.    A face-to-face meeting between Eduard Shevardnadze and Levon  Ter-Petrosyan lasted for almost one and a half hours.    At the same time, Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia and  officials  from the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Georgia  discussed with the other guests a number of economic issues that  are pressing for the two countries.    After this, the full delegation was received by Eduard  Shevardnadze.    The head of state told members of the Armenian delegation  that a good tradition had developed. We are meeting each other  to examine problems facing us and, for me, every such meeting is  a step forward toward achieving objectives that have been set,  and toward strengthening traditional friendly ties between our  two neighboring countries and peoples.    Mr. Levon Ter-Petrosyan thanked the Georgian leader for  allowing this visit to be organized at short notice. The  Armenian president said that apart from personal relations that  are playing a productive role, an effective mechanism for  interstate relations had been created. Levon Ter-Petrosyan  announced that during the face-to-face meeting with Eduard  Shevardnadze, they examined issues relating to economic  cooperation problems and aspects of regional conflicts. It was  stated that both countries supported the implementation of an  idea of Caucasian dialogue and a meeting between the leaders of  the Transcaucasian states with the participation of Russian  President Boris Yeltsin.    The talks discussed problems relating to the organization of  the delivery to Armenia of bread products and fuel, in  particular, gas. The sides agreed that grain intended for the  people of Armenia would be delivered to them as soon as possible  by rail from the seaports of Batumi and Poti. Special  interstate treaties would be very important to speed up this  process. In this connection, it was admitted that agreements  reached at the level of broker firms and organizations were  often not very effective and could even delay the process of  delivery.    Eduard Shevardnadze supported taking quick measures to  establish unhindered work of the railway and other transport, on  which the situation in neighboring countries depends to a large  extent. He also addressed other problems, stressing the  importance of a (?common) approach by the two country's official  leadership toward solving regional problems.    Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia, Jaba Ioseliani, the chairman  of the Provisional Committee for the State of Emergency, Zurab  Kervalishvili, the first deputy prime minister, Security  Minister Igor Giorgadze, the chief of the head of state's  office, Vazha Lordkipanidze, the chief of the Customs  Department, Viktor Lordkipanidze, and the chief of the head of  state's Information Bureau, Ramaz Sakvarelidze, took part in the  talks.    The sides signed a protocol on the implementation of the  accords reached during the talks.    On the same day, the delegation from the Republic of Armenia  returned to Yerevan.</p>

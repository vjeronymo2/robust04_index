			<p>for   Drug Smuggling   <F P=102> PA0406184294 Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1702 GMT 4 Jun 94 </F> <F P=103> PA0406184294 </F> <F P=104>  Panama City ACAN </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa, 4 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- The United Nations  informed Honduras that ships bearing the Honduran flag are  violating the embargo against Haiti, an official Honduran  government source confirmed today, Saturday.    The Honduran Foreign Ministry received a note from this  international organization regarding the presence of at least  five Honduran-flagged ships off the Haitian coasts that are  supplying that country with fuel and other materials.    Merchant Marine Superintendent Reynaldo Flores said the  ships  were identified as Erma, Sea Wind II, Aida Luz, Lady Sandra III,  and Rooster.    Flores said "we cannot impede" the presence of ships  registered under the Honduran flag because they are flagged for  legal activities and "we have no way of knowing if they commit  illegal activities."    One of the ships, the Rooster, had previously been detained  for drug trafficking, the Honduran Merchant Marine Office  confirmed.    Deputy Carlos Sosa Coello of the Innovation and Unity Party  warned that the United Nations could penalize Honduras for this  event.</p>

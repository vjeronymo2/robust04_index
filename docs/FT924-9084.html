			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Voluntary exodus from pits at 2,976 THE number of miners applying for voluntary redundancy has risen to 2,976. It is believed that most of the volunteers work at the 10 pits earmarked for early closure. There has been a steady increase in the number of applicants since the government's announcement of its redundancy programme on October 13. The latest figure from British Coal compares with a total of 500 miners who had applied by October 23 and 1,000 who had applied by early last week. British Coal said last night that it was 'not surprised' by the latest figure. 'By any standard it's a generous redundancy scheme which is on offer,' it said. 'There are older miners in particular who appear to be taking up the offer.' However, it stressed that it was too early to establish any definite trend and that the situation could change in the coming weeks. The caution appears to be based on reports that British Coal is receiving from local managers that the uptake of voluntary redundancies is tailing off since the out-of-court agreement on Tuesday between British Coal and mining unions. British Coal has given an undertaking that in considering redundancies it will not discriminate against miners opting to remain in employment during the 90-day consultation period. Local British Coal officials and union representatives said yesterday that the agreement had acted as a break on many miners who had enquired about voluntary redundancy, fearing they would lose out if they waited until the end of the consultation period. There is still wide variation between areas. Officials of the National Union of Mineworkers said that one of the main haemorrhages of the workforce was at the South Yorkshire pit of Markham Main.</p>

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of Dutch Banking and Finance (3): The EOE will be humming in 1996 - The European Options Exchange plans to introduce a unique new trading method Amsterdam's European Options Exchange (EOE) is planning to become the first options exchange in the world to combine the traditional 'open outcry' of human voices with the subdued hum of computer-screen trading. The unique new trading, due to be launched in early to mid-1996, marks a new phase in the EOE's 16-year -history. When it was established in 1978 as the first options exchange outside the US, the EOE adopted the open outcry system that prevailed on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) exchange in the US. The electronic exchanges of the late 1980s had not yet been born, and the 'pit' seemed the logical place to bring together supply and demand. In keeping with the widespread use of electronic trading, the EOE wants to move with the times yet also retain its trading floor. 'What we're effectively going to be doing is building an electronic exchange alongside our existing exchange, and then coupling the two together,' Joost Kuiper, the EOE's general director, said. 'It'll be an important event in the existence of our exchange. As the first options exchange in Europe - hence the ambitious name - the EOE had originally hoped to become Europe's sole centre for the trading of options. But other countries, from the UK to Germany and from France to Switzerland, eventually built their own national exchanges. Most of the recent newcomers have introduced fully electronic trading systems, eschewing the trading floor. However, EOE believes there is still room for open outcry in Amsterdam because of the 'atypical' character of the exchange: the EOE is overwhelmingly a retail exchange, with 70 per cent of turnover generated by private investors rather than the institutional investor who sets the tone on institutions such as Germany's Deutsche Terminborse (DTB) or the London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe). 'The market for the larger retail order is at heart a 'talk market',' Mr Kuiper said. The proposed new trading system, called Switch, will allow the EOE to use open outcry in some areas and electronic trading in others. Details are still being worked out, but small retail orders below some sort of limit, such as 10 or 20 contracts, will be executed electronically through automatic matching. This is expected to be far more efficient and cost-effective than the present system of writing order slips and matching supply and demand through open outcry. However, larger retail orders and smaller wholesale orders for institutional investors will remain the preserve of the trading floor. Big institutional orders - so far an underdeveloped market segment at the EOE - will probably also be handled electronically. This computer-based trading is probably best suited to handle the growing trend to more tailor-made, less standardised contracts for bigger investors. The Switch system will be flexible, enabling the EOE to determine for each class of options contracts which system is more suitable - open outcry on the floor or electronic trading by screen. For traders on the floor, the two types of trading will be brought together by hand-held computer terminals. Besides building its ambitious new trading system over the next two years, the EOE will also be concentrating on attracting more insti-tutional investors to the exchange. Unlike the DTB, which was established with the full co-operation of the big German banks, the EOE's birth in the late 1970s was not wholeheartedly welcomed by the Dutch financial esta-blishment. The exchange was considered too risky for the cautious Dutch, and an early demise was predicted. The EOE's success in the face of widespread scepticism was due to the efforts of many small brokers and traders and of the publicity campaign waged by its first director, Tjerk Westerterp. His unusual step of sponsoring a Dutch soccer team and linking the EOE's name to classical music competitions brought a wealth of publicity and a crowd of retail investors to the exchange. This retail bias is reflected not only in the 70:30 ratio between retail and insti-tutional turnover but also in the relatively low share of index options in the EOE's total turnover. 'My targets are 50:50 for retail and institutional, and index options must grow, too,' Mr Kuiper said. Index options, typically a product for institutional investors, accounted for roughly 25 per cent of contract turnover in 1993, against nearly 65 per cent for stock options, a type of option that generally attracts private investors. By 1996, the EOE hopes to have raised index options to nearly 40 per cent of the total. One way the EOE has found to woo institutional investors is to offer them a single account at the clearing level, regardless of the number of different brokers used. Another recent concession to bigger investors was a sharp cut in brokers' exchange fees on the EOE's futures subsidiary, the Financiele Termijnmarkt Amsterdam (FTA), on June 1. The cuts, designed to be passed on to investors, are meant to boost liquidity and volume. The EOE has also introduced 'flex options' on Dutch state bonds, allowing the investor to tailor the expiry date and exercise price to his precise requirements. 'Flex has been very important for us, and we'll certainly be offering more flex options,' Mr Kuiper said. And, finally, the EOE hopes to deepen the liquidity of its market by helping to create better-capitalised market-makers able to handle the bigger deals that institutional investors are expected to bring to the exchange. To this end, Mr Kuiper is trying to put together a 'liquidity fund' through which institutional funds can be injected into smaller, promising market-makers. The total money involved will not be large, but the ultimate effect can be important for the exchange. 'Investing Fl 1m in a smaller market-maker can really put the firm on the road to bigger things,' he said.  ----------------------------------------------------------------           NUMBER OF OPTIONS TRADED ON THE EOE  ----------------------------------------------------------------                                     1993           1992  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Stock options                         40             42 Index options                          4              5 Bond options                           8              5 Future options (OOF)                   1              1 Currency options                       2              2 Precious Metal options                 1              1 Special products (warrants)            7              1  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Total                                 63             57  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Source: EOE  ----------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------            TURNOVER OF EOE OPTIONS CONTRACTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------                                1993         %        1992       %  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Stock options             8,035,741      64.0   6,808,646    63.8 Bond options                436,199       3.5     270,442     2.5 Dutch Index options       3,106,437      24.7   2,945,704    27.6 Eurotop Index options         2,647       0.0      10,554     0.1 MMI/XMI Leaps Index options   6,809       0.1      21,569     0.2 Currency options            672,632       5.4     543,312     5.1 Precious metal options      284,040       2.3      72,815     0.7 All options              12,544,505     100.0  10,673,042   100.0  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Source: EOE  ----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

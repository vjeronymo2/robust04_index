			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / International Company News: Weatherstone called for Banesto crisis meeting Sir Dennis Weatherstone, chairman of J. P. Morgan, the US bank advising Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), wrote to the central bank of Spain on the day it ousted Banesto's board of management, asking for a meeting to explain Morgan's position. Sir Dennis wrote to Mr Luis Angel Rojo, the central bank's governor, last Tuesday asking him to meet Mr Roberto Mendoza, Morgan's vice-chairman who sat on Banesto's board. Sir Dennis' letter, written following the central bank's intervention, emphasises that Mr Mendoza represented J. P. Morgan's corporate office, 'where all decisions relating to the investment by Corsair in Banesto have been made'. Corsair is the investment fund managed by Morgan on behalf of US investors which bought Dollars 175m of equity in Banesto last summer. Mr Mendoza sat on Banesto's board as a representative of Corsair, and supervised Morgan's advisory work. Sir Dennis' letter indicates that he was familiar with Morgan's dealings with Banesto. Morgan yesterday described as 'completely false' a report in the Spanish newspaper El Pais that Mr Mendoza had failed to keep Sir Dennis informed. Sir Dennis said in the letter he 'would appreciate' a meeting between Mr Mendoza and Mr Rojo, 'given the gravity of the measures taken by the Bank of Spain'. Morgan believed that Banesto, Spain's fourth-largest bank, was in a better condition than Mr Rojo claimed last week. It estimated that Banesto's assets were over-valued by Pta372bn (Dollars 2.6bn), compared with the central bank's estimate of Pta503bn. Mr Rojo told the Spanish parliamentary finance committee that the central bank had intervened after discovering a serious over-valuation of Banesto's assets, partly created by over-rapid growth in loans between 1988 and 1991. The document written by the bank to justify intervention shows that Morgan thought the over-valuation was less serious. In particular, it put the over-valuation of loans at Pta166bn, rather than the Bank's figure of Pta223bn. Although Morgan executives are thought to accept that the central bank was right to intervene when the run on deposits started, they had believed until then that Banesto could return to profitability helped by further capital-raising. Mr Mario Conde, Banesto's former president, was dismissed along with other board members when the central bank intervened.</p>

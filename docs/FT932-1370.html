			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Senate gets down to debating deficit plan: President Clinton's White House is fighting to hold the Democratic majority in line THE US Senate yesterday finally got down to the serious business of debating and then, probably later this week, voting on its version of the Clinton administration's deficit reduction plan. The White House, more than conscious of the stakes both for the presidency and for the credibility of its economic programme, has launched what is known in basketball as 'a full court press' to hold the shaky 56-44 Democratic Senate majority in line. Last week the administration allowed the Democrats on the finance committee to work out their own compromise legislation to 'save' about Dollars 500bn (Pounds 333bn) over the next five years by a combination of tax increases and spending cuts, which, it claims, are now in roughly equal balance. This week it has pulled out all the stops. President Bill Clinton and his wife spent all Tuesday in White House meetings with Democratic senators, interrupted only by a televised message to the US conference of mayors, meeting in New York, and a quick lobbying excursion by Mrs Clinton to Capitol Hill. Over the last 48 hours Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, and Mr Leon Panetta, the budget director, have delivered their own critiques of the half-formed Republican alternatives, which seek deeper spending cuts and smaller tax increases. Mr Clinton chipped in by saying the Republicans could never forego tax breaks for the rich. Yesterday, Ms Alice Rivlin, Mr Panetta's deputy, took to the New York Times in an article headlined 'Where is the old Bob Dole?' She contrasted what she said was the Senate minority leader's longstanding commitment to responsible deficit reduction with his alleged current penchant for 'misleading rhetoric' and 'nitpicking'. The purpose of the attack on the Republicans is to reinforce wavering Democrats. Although most of the more conservative among them have now been squared, liberals such as Senators Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio, Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and Paul Wellstone of Minnesota have complained about the depths of the proposed cuts in social and health programmes. On a different tack, Senator Herb Kohl of Wisconsin is disappointed that many of Mr Clinton's original proposals to help small business have been gutted by the finance committee. Most experts believe the Senate will pass the committee bill, with perhaps some minor modifications on the floor. The only certain Democratic defector is Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, who has consistently opposed the administration on almost every big issue. Even Senator Dole has conceded that the Democrats 'have the votes'. The whole issue would then pass to an even more contentious conference committee, which would have to reconcile the considerable differences between the Senate version and that already through the House. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, finance committee chairman, has already predicted the outlines of a deal between the two chambers. He envisages an energy tax compromise somewhere between the Dollars 72bn BTU-based levy passed by the House and the more modest Dollars 24bn general fuel tax increase preferred by the Senate. He thinks the difference in cuts in Medicare and other programmes can be split. But the devil is likely to lie in the details. For example, Senator John Danforth, the Republican from Missouri - which has a heavy concentration of civil aviation - is lobbying hard to have aviation fuel exempted from any increases in energy taxes simply because, he argues, the industry is in too parlous a shape to absorb higher costs. The funding of prestige science projects like the space station and the supercollider, both endorsed by the president last week in more modified form, is already under intense scrutiny, as witnessed yesterday when the space station only survived a House motion to kill it by one vote. Some northern Democrats feel that rewarding Texas, where much contracting for both is carried out, is perverse since the state now has two Republican Senators. Two editorials in the New York Times yesterday encapsulated the reservations. One urged that the space station be jettisoned as it was unnecessary and too costly, while the second complained the Senate bill sacrificed investment in the social and business infrastructure on the altar of simplistic deficit reduction. This, it said, was 'too close to (last year's presidential candidate Ross) Perot's myopia and two-thirds away from what Mr Clinton wisely promised'.</p>

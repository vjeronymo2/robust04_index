			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Littlewoods boost for Iceland ICELAND Group, the food retailer, reported pre-tax profits in the six months to July 3 up by 24 per cent from Pounds 24.2m to Pounds 30.1m Mr Malcolm Walker, chairman and chief executive, said the outstanding feature of the period had been the success of Iceland at Littlewoods food halls. Of 50 new stores opened in the half 20 were in Littlewoods shops. Two Littlewoods halls are being opened each week. Mr Walker expects to reach the full complement of 48 by the end of October. Turnover rose by 16 per cent to Pounds 555.3m (Pounds 480m). Like-for-like food sales were ahead by 7 per cent. Mr Walker said that the food retail market was becoming increasingly competitive. Operating margins eased from 6.1 per cent to 5.9 per cent. Operating profits were ahead 12 per cent to Pounds 32.7m (Pounds 29.1m). Profits at the pre-tax level were lifted by a halving of interest charges to Pounds 2.55m (Pounds 4.93m), reflecting lower rates, reduced borrowings and better cash flow. By the end of the year the group expects total borrowings to be between Pounds 70m and Pounds 80m. Earlier this year the group changed its name from Iceland Frozen Foods in order to cast off its image as a freezer centre. In the first half frozen foods accounted for 54 per cent of sales, with 23.5 per cent to groceries, 15 per cent to chilled and 7.5 per cent in fresh goods. Customers per week have reached 3.4m, In Iceland an average spend of Pounds 7.50 per customer had been static for two years. In Littlewoods the average number of customers was twice as high, but their average spend was half that of an Iceland customer. The group opened its first Iceland store in France in June, and has followed up with three more in an experiment described as tightly controlled with low risk. The stores sell more than 180 of its standard UK products. Fully diluted earnings per share were 6.75p, up from 5.48p. The interim dividend is lifted to 1.2p, against an adjusted 1.03p. COMMENT While nobody in the food sector is immune to the battles between the supermarkets, Mr Malcolm Walker is probably correct in his insistence that Iceland is not a scaled down supermarket and will therefore come through relatively unscathed. The link with Littlewoods appears to have been a shrewd move which will accelerate the evolutionary changes in Iceland's product mix. If the French experiment fails, the group can walk away at little cost, but it has everything to go for. It is on target to open a record 100 stores this year, and the Pounds 30m Swindon distribution centre is on schedule to open next spring. Full year earnings per share are heading for about 14.5p, showing that Iceland can trade well in a hostile environment. The multiple of 15.5 makes them attractive enough.</p>

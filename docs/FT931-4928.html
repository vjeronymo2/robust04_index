			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / People: Non-executive directors Justin Dukes (right), 51, a former managing director of Channel Four Television, has been appointed a non-executive director of VTR, which provides video post-production facilities for advertisers and programme makers. Dukes' name has been linked with a number of high-profile media jobs since he quit Channel Four, including, most recently, a bid to get Britain's fifth television channel based in Scotland. A former joint managing director of the Financial Times, he joined Channel Four in 1981 and was involved in its start-up. However, he lost out to Michael Grade in the battle to succeed Jeremy Isaacs for the top job there and in June 1988 left to become chief executive of Galileo, the newly-created European airline computer reservation systems group. Since 1989 he has been chairman of the European Communications Industries Consortium.</p>

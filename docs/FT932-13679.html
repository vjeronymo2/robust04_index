			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / The Lex Column: US bonds The performance of the US bond market recently has something of a fin de siecle feel. While the market has scored impressive gains since the presidential election, there is a fear that the long bull market may be drawing to a close. Thirty-year interest rates below 7 per cent have not been seen consistently for a generation and, if the economic recovery follows the pattern of the last 20 years, capacity constraints and tightening labour market conditions will eventually reignite inflation. The nervousness in the bond market over commodity prices earlier this year underlined the point. And with short-term rates held at the inflation rate, the strong growth seen in the fourth quarter of last year may soon be resumed. Perhaps. But the issue turns on whether there are any real differences between this upturn and previous cycles. Neither borrowing nor lending patterns will quickly recover from the shock of this recession. Personal incomes are also still under pressure and there is little sign yet of a substantial upturn in employment. It may be that the buoyant consumer spending late last year was a one-off release of pent-up demand. Bond prices have been rising for so long that the air must be getting a little thin for some investors used to less heady levels. The bond market is thus vulnerable to a short-term correction. But with plenty of unused industrial capacity, much stronger economic signals will be needed before a wholesale retreat begins.</p>

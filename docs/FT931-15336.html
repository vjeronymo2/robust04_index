			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / New Irish cabinet to tackle punt crisis IRELAND'S new Fianna Fail-Labour coalition government, which formally took office last night, will tackle the crisis facing the punt at its first cabinet meeting today. Mr Albert Reynolds, who has been re-elected prime minister by parliament, said in announcing his new cabinet that the coalition was committed to defending the existing parity of the punt within the ERM 'and we are ready to implement the domestic policies necessary to underpin (this)'. 'We are looking to our European partners for assistance in fighting off the currency speculators. The future of the EMS itself and economic and monetary union is at stake if countries can be successfully picked off one by one,' Mr Reynolds said. The Labour party has been allocated six of the 15 cabinet posts, with its party leader Mr Dick Spring being given the posts of deputy prime minister and foreign minister. It also has been given the big-spending Health and Education ministries and a new Ministry of Enterprise and Employment, which will replace the existing Industry Ministry. Mr Bertie Ahern, the outgoing finance minister, has retained his portfolio. Interest rates in the Dublin inter-bank money market continued their roller-coaster ride yesterday, falling sharply as the central bank dropped its overnight lending rate from 100 per cent to 30 per cent. It also offered limited amounts of one-month funds on tender to the clearing banks at 14 per cent in an effort to improve liquidity in the market and head off commercial interest rate rises.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, 19 May (AFP) -- Some members of the Campaign  for Democracy (CD), an umbrella group of about 40 pro-democracy  and human rights organizations, today in Lagos threatened to  "physically disrupt" the election on 23 May of ward delegates to  the constitutional conference.    The conference, which is expected to start on 27 June, is a  priority for the regime, which seized power in November, 1993.  The conference is expected to discuss national problems and  threats to the country's unity.    A statement signed by Olaitan Oyerinde, chairman of the  Lagos  State branch of the CD, said that its members will not allow  elections to be held in the state on 23 May, a day which has  been declared a public holiday by the government in order to  ensure that voters turn out to participate in the exercise.    The statement called on polling agents, generally recruited  from among teachers and civil servants, not to show up at the  polling stations on 23 May. The CD, which described the  constitutional conference as a "trick," expressed support for  the call made on 16 May by the National Democratic Coalition  (NADECO), for General Sani Abacha to leave office before 31 May,  and for the holding of a "sovereign national conference."  NADECO is a new prodemocracy organization, which was formed on  13 May.</p>

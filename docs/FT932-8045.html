			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank opens year firmly TOTAL operating profits at the Deutsche Bank group rose by 'a good 20 per cent' in the first four months of the year against the comparable period for 1992, the chief executive of Germany's biggest bank told shareholders yesterday. Mr Hilmar Kopper said at the bank's annual meeting that it was unrealistic to expect this level of growth to be maintained throughout the year as a whole. Last year, total operating profits rose 7 per cent to DM6.39bn (Dollars 3.96bn). But he said that the result for the year would be satisfactory, given the sharp recession in the German economy. He warned that provisions for bad and doubtful debts would have to be on the same scale as last year, when they reached DM2.6bn. Deutsche gave no figures, but the percentage increases are calculated with reference to a third of the total figure last year, rather than the actual profits made in the the first four months of last year. Thus total operating in the first four months of the current year were in the region of DM2.55bn, up about 16 per cent from the actual figure for the first third of 1992. Deutsche is the third of Germany's big three banks to report excellent growth in operating profits in the early months of the current year. Commerzbank improved profits by more than a quarter in January to March and Dresdner Bank by 15 per cent in the first four months. These profit increases provide a slightly unrealistic picture of German banks' prosperity as they are calculated before provisions which are set to rise steeply over the course of the current year, reflecting deteriorating credit risks in recession-struck Germany. As at other large German banks which have reported strong growth in profits for the early months of the current year, the bulk of the gain at Deutsche Bank came from own-account trading activities, stimulated by buoyant conditions in bund and equity markets earlier in the year. Growth in net interest income was more subdued. Own-account trading profits rose by 32 per cent, Mr Kopper said, and commission income climbed by 13 per cent, while net interest income rose 6 per cent.</p>

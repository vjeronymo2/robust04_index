			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> A LITTLE REST DOES DEER, BREWERS A LOT OF GOOD  </P> <P> Rob Deer played only part of the game Saturday, but he played a key role.  </P> <P> Deer entered the game as a pinch-hitter in the sixth inning, but made two  dazzling catches in right field and drove in the tying runs with a two-run  single in the seventh as the Milwaukee Brewers rallied for a 7-6 victory over  the Blue Jays at Toronto.  </P> <P> "I never lost confidence in my defense," Deer said. "I've been more concerned  with my hitting."  </P> <P> Paul Molitor started the seventh with a solo home run to left field off  reliever Jim Acker, his sixth of the season.  </P> <P> Dave Parker and Eddie Diaz walked before B.J. Surhoff advanced both runners  with a sacrifice bunt off loser David Wells (2-1). Greg Brock flied out to  shallow left and Wells walked Bill Spiers to load the bases for Deer.  </P> <P> Duane Ward, a right-hander, relieved, but Deer hit a line-drive single to  right, scoring Parker and Diaz to tie the score, 6-6.  </P> <P> Spiers took third on Junior Felix's throwing error and scored the winning run  on Greg Myers' passed ball.  </P> <P> Deer robbed Kelly Gruber of extra bases with a diving catch in the bottom of  the sixth, then raced into foul territory to snare Tony Fernandez's pop-up in  the eighth.  </P> <P> Baltimore 4, New York 2 -- Randy Milligan broke the Orioles' bases-loaded  drought with a two-run single in the fifth inning at New York, handing the  Yankees their sixth loss in seven games.  </P> <P> Baltimore, batting .200 with the bases loaded this season, broke through in the  fifth when Milligan singled for a 3-2 lead. Milligan was hitless in three tries  with the bases loaded this year, but he has reached base in 17 of his last 23  plate appearances, going nine for 15 with eight walks.  </P> <P> Dave Johnson (4-3) won for the second time in eight starts, giving up two runs  on eight hits in five innings. Gregg Olson went two shutout innings to get his  10 save.  </P> <P> Tim Leary (3-6) gave up three runs on nine hits in five innings. He is 0-3  lifetime against Baltimore, yielding 11 earned run in 16 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> Kansas City 10, Oakland 4 -- Gerald Perry had three hits and scored two runs as  the Royals took advantage of two errors by third baseman Mike Gallego to score  five unearned runs and beat the Athletics at Kansas City.  </P> <P> Bret Saberhagen (5-3) won his fourth consecutive start and improved to 10-6  against Oakland. He has not lost since May 1. Saberhagen went seven innings,  allowing two runs and eight hits. He walked one and struck out three.  </P> <P> Mike Moore (4-5) lasted 3 1/3 innings -- the shortest stint this season by an  A's starter. Moore, 2-7 in Kansas City, yielded nine runs and nine hits,  including three doubles and a triple.  </P> <P> Minnesota 2, Chicago 1 -- Dan Gladden, hitless in his last 10 at-bats, hit a  run-scoring double with two out in the eighth inning, lifting the Twins to  victory at Chicago.  </P> <P> Greg Gagne singled with two out in the eighth for the third hit off Chicago  starter Eric King (4-1). Gladden followed with a liner off the fence in  left-center, scoring Gagne.  </P> <P> King walked one and struck out five in 7 2/3 innings.  </P> <P> Cleveland 7, Boston 5 -- Stan Jefferson, batting .088 entering the game, had  two singles, scored three runs and drove in the game-winner in the eighth  inning as the Indians rallied to victory at Cleveland.  </P> <P> Jerry Browne drew a one-out walk from Rob Murphy (0-3). Carlos Baerga followed  with a double to center, scoring Browne with the tying run. Jefferson then  singled through the left side, scoring Baerga.  </P></p>

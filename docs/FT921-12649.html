			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / UK Company News: City Site losses rise to Pounds 3.4m PRE-TAX losses at City Site Estates grew from Pounds 980,000 to Pounds 3.37m over the year to September 30. Mr William Syson, chairman, ascribed the losses in general to 'one of the most difficult years the property market has faced in the last three decades', and in particular to the Pounds 1.95m loss on the sale of the shop and office development in London's Sloane Street and to the exceptional Pounds 1.77m provision against the value of the Milton Keynes office development. The board has recommended reducing the final dividend to 0.5p (0.96p) for a total of 1.46p (1.92p). Rental income rose to Pounds 9.68m (Pounds 8.56m), but other costs, principally from property disposals, totalled Pounds 406,000 (income Pounds 1.07m). Net interest took Pounds 9.12m (Pounds 9.13m) and, below the line, losses per share emerged at 22.68p (7.93p). Net assets per share declined to 122p (227p) at the basic level and 174p (237p) fully diluted.</p>

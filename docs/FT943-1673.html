			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Red Cross search agreed Kuwait and Iraq are ready to accept a proposal by the International Committee of the Red Cross to form a technical team to investigate the fate of all people missing from the 1991 Gulf War, the ICRC said, Reuter reports from Kuwait. Mr Arnold Luethold, ICRC delegate for the Arabian peninsula, said formation of a technical team, the details of which had yet to be settled, would speed the search for the missing. Most of those missing are the 600 Kuwaitis alleged by the emirate to be held in Iraq, which occupied Kuwait for seven months in 1990-91. 'Kuwait and Iraq have informed the ICRC that they are ready to accept the proposal,' Mr Luethold, who is based in Kuwait, said in a telephone interview. The return of captives held in Iraq was a condition of the ceasefire imposed on Baghdad after a US-led multinational force ejected its troops from Kuwait in 1991.</p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> IVORY BAN HELD SAVING ELEPHANTS  </P> <P> An international ban on ivory trading is proving effective in the struggle to  save Africa's endangered elephants, a World Wide Fund for Nature official said  today.  </P> <P> The ban, agreed to by the United Nations Conference on International Trade in  Endangered Species last October, has quashed the demand for ivory and forced  prices down, fund spokesman Rick Weyerhaeuser said.  </P> <P> "The price of ivory has fallen (about) 50% since the ban was announced," he  said. "First indications are that (the ban) is proving successful."  </P> <P> But he said the group fears the refusal of some southern African countries to  accept the ban might jeopardize efforts to protect the continent's dwindling  elephant population.  </P></p>

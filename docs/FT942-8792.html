			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Congress cancels Dollars 100m US pledge for IMF arm A US congressional committee has cancelled from this year's budget the Dollars 100m contribution promised by the Clinton administration to the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility, an arm of the International Monetary Fund which lends money at subsidised interest rates to the very poorest nations. The House of Representatives appropriations subcommittee in charge of foreign operations voted yesterday to delete the Dollars 100m proposed by the administration in its foreign aid spending bill for the 1995 fiscal year. US officials yesterday sought to play down the significance of the move, noting that the money would not have been called on in any case for another two years. Nevertheless, representatives of other countries at the IMF called the decision 'very bad news,' and said it would further damage the reputation of the US, which is perpetually in arrears on its pledges to international institutions. The US was one of the last big industrialised countries to promise money to the ESAF, which comprises an SDR4.5bn (Pounds 4.2bn) capital fund and a separate SDR2bn fund to subsidise its interest rates, and its Dollars 100m contribution was described even by the US Treasury as 'a meagre share for the largest economy in the world.' Other congressional committees have been pressing for the ESAF money to be linked to a promise of greater transparency from the IMF. The US appears, however, to be riding a lonely hobby horse on this issue, with little support from other nations.</p>

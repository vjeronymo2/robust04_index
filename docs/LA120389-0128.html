			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> U.S. GREENS DRAFT PARTY PLATFORM  </P> <P> A variety of activists on environmental, energy and social issues are drafting  a political program to create a national Greens political party as early as  next year, organizers say.  </P> <P> Modeled after Greens parties in Europe, the party would seek to build  nationwide policy on environmental and social issues that it says get  inadequate attention from the Republican and Democratic parties.  </P> <P> But Greens planners are divided on whether their new party should make an early  run at national office, traditionally almost impossible for American third  parties, or first concentrate its efforts on capturing local and state offices.  </P> <P> The Green Committees of Correspondence, a federation of about 200 groups  nationwide, mailed a 36-page list of proposed stands to 3,500 people this fall,  said Jim Richmond, coordinator for the group's national clearinghouse in Kansas  City, Mo.  </P> <P> The Greens, as they call themselves, plan to ratify the final platform at a  September, 1990 meeting in Boulder, Colo. Meanwhile, the 200 groups are  planning regional meetings to debate stands on 19 issues, including land use,  water, social justice, energy, health, education and finance.  </P> <P> "It's activists and just regular folks of all stripes who are concerned what  direction this planet is headed in," Richmond said of the 4-year-old group.  </P> <P> Born from the remnants of Vietnam war protesters and the environmental and  anti-nuclear movements that appeared in the 1960s, the largely white,  well-educated Greens are far behind European parties with the same name, said  writer Brian Tokar, an organizer.  </P> <P> Tokar, a toxic chemical and energy consultant, said the U.S. and Canadian  Greens movements have been held back by the political systems in each country.  </P> <P> Many European countries use a system of proportional representation in  parliamentary elections, which allows even small parties to get into Parliament  if they win a minor percentage of the vote nationwide. Fringe parties have a  harder time under the U.S. and Canadian systems, which elect representatives by  district.  </P> <P> European Greens, united by polluted rivers and forests dying from acid rain,  won 30 seats this year in the 475-seat European Parliament.  </P> <P> West Germany has the largest Greens contingent -- 42 of the 519 federal  parliamentarians. They also are in the legislatures of Belgium, Italy, Austria  and the Netherlands.  </P> <P> "European Greens are basically defined by four pillars," said Tokar. Those are:  ecology, social responsibility, community-oriented democracy and the nonviolent  movement -- where they are often seen demonstrating against nuclear missiles.  </P> <P> "Greens in this country strongly embrace those principles, but we've sought to  elaborate on them," Tokar said from his Plainfield, Vt., home.  </P> <P> The draft political program emphasizes:  </P> <P> Creating environmental and economic policy that is not harmful to the United  States or the world.  </P> <P> Decentralization, bringing decision-making back from the federal and state  levels to local communities and the people whose lives it affects.  </P> <P> * An end to oppression based on race, sex and economics.  </P> <P> * Focusing on how the nation can work in harmony with the world community and  nature.  </P> <P> "The centerpiece is to rethink our relationship to the Earth," said John  Rensenbrink, professor of political science at Bowdoin College in Maine and  another organizer.  </P> <P> Issues such as the destruction of the Earth's protecting ozone layer are  related to any number of government decisions in areas of energy, health,  education and finance, he said.  </P> <P> A handful of people guide the group, which opposes the concept of hierarchy.  Decisions are made by committees of representatives, and a national leadership  probably will not be chosen until the U.S. Greens jump into politics, he said.  </P> <P> As they continue to organize, Greens are forming clubs at universities and have  state organizations in Michigan, California, Georgia, Maine, Wisconsin and  Massachusetts, Rensenbrink said.  </P> <P> However, the would-be political party is hindered by divisions on several  issues.  </P> <P> * Greens' principles call for restraining capitalism where it harms the  environment or community life. But conservative Greens, who joined to fight  pollution, believe in a national economy driven by relatively free capitalism,  Tokar said.  </P> <P> * Greens members debating the proposed national platform are leaning toward a  pro-choice abortion stance -- but some members are anti-abortion, said Richmond  and Rensenbrink.  </P> <P> * Some Greens want a national party to organize on the state and local levels,  while others want to field a national candidate, Greens leaders said.  </P> <P> While the Greens are closest ideologically to liberal Democrats, Democratic  National Committee spokeswoman Ginny Terzano said her party is not worried.  </P> <P> "The bottom line is that the Democratic Party has a strong platform," she said,  adding that it includes environmental and human rights issues.  </P></p>

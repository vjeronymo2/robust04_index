			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / International Company News: Reduced interest charge behind rise at British Data BRITISH Data Management, the data storage specialist which came to the market through a placing a year ago, reported doubled pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.66m for the six months ended December 31, against Pounds 779,000 last time. Sales rose 13 per cent from Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 7.04m. The pre-tax figure was struck after a much reduced interest charge - down from Pounds 687,000 to Pounds 53,000. Earnings per share rose 25 per cent to 6.5p and the group declared an interim dividend of 1.5p. The directors said the earnings figure was flattered by a Pounds 138,000 tax charge that was significantly lower due to Pounds 258,000 of over-provisioning in the previous year. Mr Stephen Crown, British Data's chairman, said a strict comparison of earnings could not be made because in the previous year BDM paid no tax because of losses brought forward. He said he continued to seek substantial organic growth that would be supplemented by bolt-on acquisitions. The company expected to gain a significant amount of new work from the government which, through its market testing programme, is seeking to farm out support functions.</p>

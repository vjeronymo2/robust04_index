			<p>BFN     [Text] The ruling Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] and the  ruling New Japan Party are advocating breaking up the unified  parliamentary group "Kaishin" [Innovation]. Commenting on the  two ruling parties' move at an 18 May meeting of Komeito  legislators, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa said:  "If the two ruling parties, which formed "Kaishin," have  altered their policies, their leadership cannot escape the  responsibility." In this way, he indicated that if the  "Kaishin" is dissolved, Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the DSP;  Morihiro Hosokawa, representative of the Japan New Party; and  Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party], would need to step down.</p>

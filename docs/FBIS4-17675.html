			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Simonov: "It Is Good To Be a Guest of </F> Turkmenbashi"]    [Text] The leaders of the foremost Russian publications  who visited Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] for the weekend at the  invitation of Turkmenia President Saparmurat Niyazov had  occasion to be convinced of this personally. The new five-star  hotel, a whole convoy of red Volvos for the guests, lavish  feasts -- all this was to serve as graphic illustration of the  fact that the "10 years of prosperity" economic program  proclaimed by Turkmenbashi has begun to operate.    In their official, but sufficiently frank talk with  President  S. Niyazov, the Moscow journalists learned that:     -  Turkmenia could soon become Kuwait if it sells its energy  carriers to states with the real ability to pay (at present the  debts of Ukraine, Georgia, and several other CIS members for  Turkmen gas and oil are $1.3 billion). The president pins great  hopes on the construction of gas pipelines to the West -- to  Iran, Turkey, and Europe -- and to the East -- to China and  Japan;    -  The idea of a Eurasian Union voiced by Nursultan  Nazarbayev to the recent Moscow summit is unfounded and that  countries which recently had a taste of independence will  scarcely agree to some "coordinating and guiding  center;"    -  Turkmenbashi himself is not against criticism leveled  at him but would prefer to meet it face to face in personal  talks with his fellow fighters and not in the press. The  president was disapproving about the Russian press, which allows  itself keen attacks on Boris Yeltsin -- because in Niyazov's  opinion these attacks contain more destructive than creative  force;    -  The national assembly has already approved agreements  whereby the 400,000 Russians living in Turkmenia will be able to  acquire second -- Russian -- citizenship. That, incidentally,  is so far the only instance of the solution of the problem of  dual citizenship -- such difficult and delicate one for the  entire CIS;    -  The Turkmen leader does not greatly like the  abundance of portraits and sculptures of himself but believes  this is a temporary enthusiasm -- until the completion of the  economic reforms and the appearance of property owners who will  become far more independent of all kinds of ideological  epidemics. Nonetheless it is better to decorate the bank notes  with a portrait of the first president in Turkmenia's history  than to put pictures of animals on them....    Apart from its familiarization aspect, the Moscow  journalists' meeting with Saparmurat Niyazov had a diplomatic  nature: The president did everything to emphasize his right to  an independent view, differing greatly from others, of the  strategy and tactics of reforms and insisted on the correct  coverage of Turkmen problems from Moscow and the newspapermen of  course promised to be objective and assured him that Russian  newspapers will not harm the Turkmen people's political  stability or moral health.    As a result of this dialogue the guests hoped that the  Turkmen Government will find the opportunity to subscribe to  Russian publications in the second half of 1994, earmarking  funds for the conversion of the manat, with which subscribers  now settle acocunts for Russian publications. It was with this  hope that the guest left.</p>

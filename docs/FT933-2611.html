			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: European turnover continues to advance  -The holiday season failed to dampen enthusiasm in August European bourses saw turnover rise for the third successive month in August, although the pace of increase slowed as the holiday season got under way, after the strong advances of the previous two months. Volume rose by 5 per cent from July levels after the month-on-month increases of 20.8 per cent in July and 20.3 per cent in June. Mr James Cornish of NatWest Securities, which produces the turnover figures, notes that the rise in August accompanied a 6.3 per cent advance in the FT-A Europe index during the month, with only share market indices for Belgium showing a decline. The biggest gainers in turnover were the markets with the steepest growth in the local index, propelled by hopes of an accelerating fall in interest rates following the EMS crisis at the beginning of the month,' he says. However, he notes that turnover on Seaq International, the London screen-based trading system, increased by only 2.7 per cent on the month for the seven continental European markets, indicating relatively greater interest by domestic investors in trading in their local markets. Italy made the biggest gain in August, with turnover up by 32.8 per cent to a record level, in spite of the unravelling political scandal. This represented a 64.9 per cent increase over the average for the previous three months for a market which saw a 12.1 per cent rise in local market stock indices over the month. Mr Michele Pacitti of NatWest Securities notes that daily trading turnover had topped L600bn throughout much of the month, compared with last year's unusually low level of less than L100bn, when the country was beset by worries about a burgeoning budget deficit. This year, there had been a marked improvement in foreign demand as the economic outlook had improved on the back of interest rates that had fallen from 15 per cent to 8 1/2 per cent. The government's privatisation programme had also provoked much interest, since it was an indication of the administration's determination to tackle its budget deficit difficulties, and it also showed that the country was serious about tackling inefficiency and low productivity in industry. Spain saw the second largest increase in turnover, up 19.1 per cent from July and 4 per cent above the average of the previous three months. But turnover was well below the record level set in May. The market index, meanwhile, rose 12.3 per cent to an all-time peak, activity spurred by recurring hopes throughout the month for lower interest rates. Continuing expectations of lower rates also underpinned France, where turnover climbed by 17.1 per cent on the month as the local market index advanced 7.3 per cent to an historic high. The rise on the month took volume 23.9 per cent higher than the average of the previous three months. UK turnover expanded by 10.7 per cent to a level not seen since October 1987, the month in which the Black Monday market crash occurred. German turnover fell by 2.3 per cent after its 43.2 per cent rise in July, while Swiss turnover was down 8.9 per cent on the month as the market continued to underperform Europe.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER Monthly total in local currencies (bn)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bourse              May         Jun         Jul       Aug         US                    1993        1993        1993      1993    Dlrs bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium           40.98       50.65       59.86     64.52       1.80 France           122.95      154.32      151.18    176.99      30.20 Germany          104.40      131.80      188.75    184.40     109.96 Italy          19,665.6    30,864.8    35,687.2    47,394      29.59 Netherlands       15.70       16.90       21.60     23.60      12.52 Spain          1,116.74      844.84      806.04    959.64       7.12 Switzerland       16.70       24.80       26.90     24.50      16.55 UK                40.62       41.86       45.99     50.90      75.69  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Volumes represent purchases and sales.

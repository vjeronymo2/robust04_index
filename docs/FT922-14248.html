			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: BP/Shell feature strongly THE OIL majors, British Petroleum and Shell Transport, benefited from a much-needed recovery as a combination of US support, technical factors and Middle East tension sent them racing upwards. Both groups' shares were considered oversold in London last week and a bounce had been expected. BP also benefited from a reiterated buy stance from US investment house Merrill Lynch after the market closed on Friday night. Yesterday's recovery was exacerbated because many traders had left themselves short of stock at the end of the trading account. They also bucked the impact of a bearish 37-page report from County NatWest, published yesterday, to contribute almost 8 points to the rise in the FT-SE 100 Index. BP jumped 12 to 254 1/2 p on very heavy turnover of 21m shares. Shell leapt 16 to 457p with 4.6m changing hands. Fears of renewed fighting between Iraq and Iran, the worsening situation in Libya and talk of a refinery fire in the US prompted a squeeze in crude oil prices. Brent crude for May delivery reached Dollars 19 a barrel for the first time in almost two months. Finally, observers said some UK investors, who had been shunning oils for some time, were returning to buy them for their defensive qualities. As oil is quoted in dollars it benefits from a weak pound, and falls in sterling are anticipated after the UK general election. Saudis boost BAe The prospect of further orders from Saudi Arabia under phase two of the Al Yamamah defence agreement buoyed British Aerospace, the project's lead contractor. The shares forged ahead 16 to 315p to make the stock the best-performing FT-SE 100 constituent of the day. The Saudis have deposited Pounds 1.5bn with BAe as an instalment for the contract. Among those welcoming the news was broker Strauss Turnbull, which turned positive on the stock after a two-year bear stance. Mr Zafar Khan at Strauss said the financial injection of Pounds 1.5bn would resolve the cash flow problems at the company and predicted: 'The share price has a potential upside of 380p, last year's rights issue price. However, the low turnover figure of 1.6m shares was said to be an indication that scepticism about further orders remains. Mr Chris Avery at Smith New Court said: 'This breaks the log jam, but the market is looking for more positive confirmation of orders.' Boots weakens Stores were generally firm following stronger than expected consumer credit figures for February, but Boots weakened 9 1/2 to 406 1/2 p in active trading of 4.4m shares as the market took fright on news of a 7 per cent pay rise for counter staff. The company said this was partly a catching-up exercise and that any increase in the wage bill above the level of inflation will be corrected through productivity gains. Nomura last week downgraded its 1992-93 profits forecast for Boots to Pounds 400m from Pounds 410m, but the Japanese-owned securities house indicated that yesterday's reaction to the pay news was probably overdone. Brewing group Whitbread was swamped by news that included denied rumours about a link with Dutch brewer Heineken, and a failure to reach agreement on the future of its joint venture with Pizza Hut International. The shares were, however, particularly depressed by an exceptional charge of Pounds 37m for bad and doubtful debts in the year recently ended. On heavy turnover of 3.7m shares, Whitbread 'A' dropped 19 1/2 to 358 1/2 p as the company blamed falling property values in southern England, where the beer trade has been badly affected by the recession, for the provision. Mr John Wakely at Shearson Lehman Brothers said Whitbread, with its large loans on public houses in the south, might be at the sharp end, but this was the 'tip of an iceberg' and bad news for the industry in general. Bass, regarded as less exposed to the problems of southern England, eased only 2 to 518p, while Allied-Lyons lost 5 to 578p. Banking issues joined in the general market strength after last week's savaging. Barclays, the worst hit, picked up 7 to 294p. Lloyds gained 7 to 348p and NatWest 12 to 265p, but Midland, which has been buoyed by hopes over the proposed merger with Hongkong and Shanghai Banking, dipped 2 to 337p. A large line of Forte stock (2m shares) was placed at 221p. The stock declined 7 to 215p. Thorn EMI, boosted by County NatWest reiterating its buy recommendation, added 9 at 747p. Glaxo was a weak spot, losing 6 to 761p. US approval of its anti-migraine drug Immigran is said to be slightly less imminent than previously thought. Weekend press comment and political factors lifted Cable and Wireless. The positive view in some corners of the media echoed an analysts' meeting a week previously in which C and W promised to tighten its investment strategy. Sentiment was also helped by the group's overseas earnings record on the back of continued nervousness over a Labour-led government. The shares, which reached 532p at one stage, ended at 528p for a gain of 8 on the day. Vodafone Group's recent dismal run continued, in spite of some encouraging figures on new cellular telephone connections. The stock slipped 5 to 303p as worries about possible fresh regulatory measures for the sector under a new government persisted. Recently out-of-favour food retailer Albert Fisher increased its market valuation by nearly 10 per cent as an institution bought a block of 500,000 shares. On heavy turnover of 2.4m, the shares rose 6 to 69p. Tesco gained 9 to 251p ahead of today's results, while a buy recommendation from Henderson Crosthwaite helped to lift Argyll 7 to 318p. Vosper Thornycroft, another beneficiary of the Al Yamamah project, put on 6 to 248p on the prospect of further orders. Talk that a Labour government would cancel a fourth Trident submarine faded, helping VSEL bounce 5 to 300p following last week's falls. Weekend press reports of renewed merger talks between British Airways and Dutch airliner KLM helped the former add 6 at 247p. A large agency cross in Saatchi &amp; Saatchi was responsible for most of the advertising company's turnover of 32m shares yesterday. SG Warburg Securities crossed 12m shares with institutions at 14p apiece. The stock finished  3/4 cheaper at 14 3/4 p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991/92 NEW HIGHS (7).

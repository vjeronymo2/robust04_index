Apart from a rising tendency in inter-group clashes, there  is  growing evidence of criminality in militant ranks. Extortions  from the public are on the rise as also is the harassment of  women. The militant's gun, as had been the case in Punjab, is  becoming the new symbol of power as well as access to easy  money. Again, like in Punjab, the tactic is now to recruit youth  at gunpoint.    The creation of a large number of pro-Pakistani militant  groups indicates a growing tendency of internecine rivalry,  mutual suspicion, and suspicion also on the part of Pakistan.  "Pakistan is suspicious of the Kashmiri militants. That explains  the growth of militant groups and the influx of mercenaries,"  says a senior intelligence official.    With most Pandits having fled the Valley, militants have  turned to making the local Muslims as their target whether on  the suspicion of being police informers, settling personal  scores or simple criminalisation. For example, over 1,700  Kashmiri Muslims have been killed since 1990 in contrast to  about 350 Pandits killed in the same period.    About 4,000 private houses have been set afire, over 1,300  schools and government buildings burned, about 1,100 persons  have been abducted and another 1,450 odd shops gutted apart from  a total 2,175 innocents killed by the militants. Till the end of  1992 alone, there were 81 incidents of extortions and robbing of  innocent persons and over 100 incidents of abductions and  killings of civilians in the same period.    More significantly, like in Punjab, public response to bandh  calls by militants has also been on the decrease. This trend has  been on the rise after the Hazratbal problem was resolved  peacefully and the cleansing operations carried out in Sopore,  Baramulla and Anantnag, all erstwhile nerve centres of the  militants.    For example, last month the residents of Bijbehara, which  had  witnessed nearly 50 deaths in BSF (Border Security Force) firing  in last October, the local residents observed a week-long bandh  in protest against the militant activities. In Kupwara, another  militant stronghold, the imam of the local mosque prevented  militants from addressing a congregation.    The most commonly practised tactic adopted by the Kashmiri  militants has been "long-distance stand-off attacks."</p>

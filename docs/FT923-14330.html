			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Withholding tax deal advances German reforms GERMANY'S taxation reform programme has advanced further with agreement on a scheme for a 30 per cent withholding tax on investment income, to take effect at the start of next year. Interbank dealings and investors classed as non-residents for tax purposes will be exempt from the new charges. The new levy, 5 percentage points higher than that originally proposed by the government last November, will be deducted at source from all investment earnings of more than DM6,000 (Pounds 2,068) a year for individuals and DM12,000 for couples. Earnings in excess of the tax-free allowances from bonds and securities traded over the counter will be taxed at 35 per cent. The new scheme is the successor to an ill-fated 10 per cent flat rate levy, imposed in 1987 and promptly withdrawn when an estimated DM80bn poured out of the country. The deal was worked out on Monday night by a parliamentary arbitration committee which was asked to mediate when the original proposal was rejected by the opposition-dominated Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament. The BVR co-operative savings banks association welcomed the deal, claiming that the allowances would mean that 80 per cent of savers would pay no tax on their interest income. The current system, which is dependent on voluntary declaration, had to be changed when it was declared unconstitutional by the courts last June. At present all investment income above DM600 for individuals and DM1,200 for couples is notionally subject to a 25 per cent charge. However, avoidance is widespread. The agreement represents the results of a year's efforts to meet the requirements of the constitutional court, minimise the impact on small savers, and at the same time prevent capital flight. The compromise also marks another step in Bonn's efforts to shuffle the components of the tax system to allow it to divert more funds from the west into the collapsed east German economy. The breakthrough came in February when the government manoeuvred through an increase in value added tax from 14 to 15 per cent, effective next January 1, together with higher thresholds for company property tax and trade profits tax. The VAT deal was expected to yield an extra DM33bn for the east over the next three years. Monday night's compromise will produce an estimated DM12bn a year, a sum which has also been committed to the five new federal states for 1993 and 1994. The German government is considering a wide range of direct and indirect taxes and levies in its attempt to plug the gaps in its medium-term financial plans, according to Mr Friedrich Bohl, senior minister in the chancellor's office. Ideas under consideration include denying certain tax concessions to companies which do not invest, special charges for 'non-investing' high-earners such as lawyers and architects, road tolls for goods traffic and increased duties on crude oil. The main aims are to supplement the flow of funds to the east and to finance restructuring of the debt-laden railway network.</p>

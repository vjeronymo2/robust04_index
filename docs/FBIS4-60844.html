			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Asia" program] </F>   [Text] The DPRK Foreign Ministry issued a statement on 28  April. In the statement, Pyongyang proposed to the United  States that they hold talks in the near future to discuss  signing a peace treaty for establishing a peace-guaranteeing  system that will substitute the present Armistice Agreement  between the two countries.    Regarding this, station commentator (Srikov) writes:    The Korean Armistice Agreement signed some 40 years ago is  still valid. On 8 July 1953, the agreement was signed on the  Korean peninsula. The war seemed to have ended, but it still  continues today. The most bloody war ghost [kajang yuhyolchogin  chonjaeng yuryong] ever since the days of World War II is  wandering there.    The DPRK Foreign Ministry's statement noted that the current  situation of the Korean peninsula and the entire world requires  the replacement of the present Armistice Agreement with a peace  treaty between Pyongyang and Washington.    We cannot help but agree to this. An armistice is different  from durable peace. The present situation, which poses a danger  of war in Korea, cannot be regarded as a normal situation. A  military conflict [kunsajok punjaeng] can take place at any  point, and it would not be limited to the Korean peninsula as it  was not some 50 years ago. Therefore, we can totally welcome  the DPRK proposal for replacing the armistice in Korea with real  peace.    However, there are many obstacles to overcome in the course  toward peace.    The commentator continues:    The United States said that it reacted negatively to this  proposal because the so-called nuclear plan of the DPRK was not  clear. (Williams), a spokesman for the U.S. Department of  State, said that the Washington-Pyongyang talks can be resumed  only when it becomes possible for the International Atomic  Energy Agency's inspection team to conduct a close inspection of  all nuclear facilities in the DPRK.    Pyongyang is also insisting on holding direct talks with  Washington, excluding the ROK.    Of course, the need to replace the armistice with real peace  in Korea has been (?discussed) since long ago because the  replacement of the Armistice Agreement with a peace treaty would  resolve a big issue in the world.</p>

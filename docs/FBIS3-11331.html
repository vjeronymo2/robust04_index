At 1330, Lieutenant Colonel Jesus Urdaneta Hernandez, Major  Pedro Emilio Alastre Lopez, Captain Wilmer Barrientos Fernandez,  Capt. Miguel Rodriguez Torres, Capt. Luis Henry Jatar, Lt. Oscar  Carrizal Flores, Lt. Florencio Porras Equezuria, and Lt. Nicolas  Tejas Arrieta were freed. The usual gestures of happiness could  be seen among friends and relatives awaiting them at the doors  of the San Carlos headquarters from where they were transferred  to their respective posts.    Only two were discharged: Lt. Urdenta Hernandez and Maj.  Alastre Lopez. Reporters waited in vain for two hours for the  announced statements by Lt. Col. Urdaneta, who decided to  quickly leave the area instead. Only 29 cases remain, and they  expect to be pardoned in the coming weeks.</p>

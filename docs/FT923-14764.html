			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Staff to keep Bank jobs after pay-offs COMPUTER workers at the Bank of England are to receive redundancy pay-offs this week of up to six figures but will continue to do the same jobs, Diane Summers writes. The Bank has entered a facilities management contract with Hoskyns, a computer-services company. A total of 41 employees who run the Bank's mainframe computer system are to be made compulsorily redundant and will immediately be employed by Hoskyns to carry out the same functions for the Bank. The Bank confirmed yesterday that in one or two cases, where there had been 'say, 25 years' service,' the payments would be 2.8 times annual salary and would run into six figures. The terms agreed for the computer staff who have been made compulsorily redundant were in line with voluntary redundancy packages offered to other staff, said the Bank. The Banking, Insurance and Finance Union, which represents 37 of the 41 computer workers, said that staff moving to Hoskyns would suffer inferior terms and conditions.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Information Minister Michel </F> Samahah in Beirut by Ashraf 'Abd-al-'Aziz in Cairo; date not  given; from the "Dialogue from Afar" program--recorded]    [Excerpts] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Can you brief us on the current  situation in southern Lebanon?    [Samahah] Tension currently prevails in southern Lebanon.  At the beginning of this interview, I want to remind everyone  of the facts of the situation, which are being ignored by  Israeli and world media. Southern Lebanon is Lebanese territory  that is occupied by Israel. The Israelis have occupied this  Lebanese territory just as they have occupied other Arab  territory in the Golan, Jordan, and Palestine. Consequently,  Lebanon is a constant victim of aggression in the south and the  western al-Biqa'. The continuation of attacks deep inside  Lebanese territory, as happened recently in the Ba'labakk area,  and the daily bombardment of Lebanese villages are a continuing  dual aggression. On one hand, there is occupation; and on the  other is the aggression against peaceful Lebanese citizens  inside the liberated areas adjacent to southern Lebanon and the  western al-Biqa'. There is tension now, following the recent  Israeli military buildup on the Israeli-Lebanese border.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] You have clearly explained the situation in  southern Lebanon and the recent Israeli military buildup on the  border. What, in your view, is the reason for Israel's  escalation of its aggression against Lebanese territory at this  particular time?    [Samahah] Israel is facing a dilemma in the negotiations. It  has reached the stage of returning their rights to the Arab  owners, whether in southern Lebanon and western al-Biqa, the  Golan, in the occupied Palestinian territory, or in Jordan.  Consequently, it is facing the bitter fact that it must give  back these territories under the pressure of world public  opinion and of the U.S. and Russian cosponsors of the talks.  This poses a predicament for the Israeli Government in dealing  with world public opinion and the cosponsors of the Madrid peace  conference. [passage omitted]    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Regarding Lebanese activity on the  international level and through the UN Security Council, can we  expect the Security Council to issue a resolution on the recent  Israeli aggression against Lebanon?    [Samahah] I hope the Security Council will continue to serve  the security of the whole UN Organization. This organization  and its Security Council have a duty to protect the rights of  states and peoples within the framework of existing  international laws. We hope that in the next few days or in the  next phase we will not again see a double standard regarding  attacks by one state on another. The Lebanese Government is  holding contacts with the Security Council members to encourage  a resolution condemning this aggression and demanding that  Israel implement Resolution 425, which is the basis on which  Lebanon has joined the comprehensive and just peace talks.

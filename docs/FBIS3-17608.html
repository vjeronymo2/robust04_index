Ivan Plyushch said to reporters in Kiev on Sunday that there  were no reasons to put off the election, scheduled for June 26.  "This hullabaloo is groundless and pointless. The election is  feared by those who don't believe they'll be elected," he said.    Kravchuk has repeatedly insisted that the presidential  election be postponed, because, he said, holding it before the  new legislature convened could lead to a confrontation in  society and paralyze authority.    Commenting on the president's statement that the next  parliament, to be elected on March 27, may not be a  "full-blooded" legislature, Plyushch said, "There are too many  specialists who have not only made an analysis but have drawn  conclusions as well." "I will refrain from making such  conclusions." "The parliament will be full-blooded," he said.</p>

The  country is on the verge of famine. If it were not for the help  from the United States, we would have real famine now," Georgian  leader Eduard Shevardnadze said.    Speaking at a business meeting at the Overseas Private  Investment Corporation in Washington on Monday, on the first day  of his two-day visit to the U.S., Shevardnadze said that the  disintegration of the Soviet Union was a painful blow to Georgia  which had been left without traditional energy and medicine  supplies. Only humanitarian aid, mostly from the U.S., keeps  300,000 Abkhazian refugees alive. The amount of such aid reached  225 million U.S. dollars in the last two years, he said.    The Georgian leader stressed that his government "firmly  follows the path of peaceful settlement" of the Abkhazian  conflict and expressed "the absolute confidence" that "positive  results" will be reached in the near future. "The threat of the  resumption of a civil war has passed," he said.    Shevardnadze assured American business people that there is  a  favourable climate for foreign investments in Georgia. "Within a  year or two there will be a change for the better. I would not  be here if I were not absolutely sure that Georgia's movement to  free markets and democracy is irreversible," he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bratislava, April 15 (CTK) -- [passage omitted]  Normalization --the period of purges after the Soviet invasion  in 1968 -- has returned to Slovakia, Jan Smolec, editor-in-chief  of the pro-Meciar REPUBLIKA says.    "What we predicted, happened. The Czechoslovakists, pro-  Hungarian elements, Slovak janissaries and certainly lots of  international lobbies are intensively strangling Slovak  freedom," the daily says. It stresses that the "initiators of  Slovak sovereignty" are being sacked, while their posts are  being occupied by opponents of sovereignty and independence.    "Everybody was shocked how rapidly the current government  started to destroy the corner stone of our fragile democracy --  the freedom of the press. They want treacherously to liquidate  the only opposition daily in Slovakia. Ostensibly because it is  published by the Slovak news agency (TA SR)," Smolec notes.    He expresses a regret that the "normalization steps and  liquidation of the daily" is happening before the eyes of the  Slovak president for whom the nationally-orientated journalists  had worked. Unfortunately, the head of state placed around  himself the sort of Slovaks who were afraid of uttering a word  about the Slovak president under the federation (Czechoslovakia)  and now they are "servilely jumping around" him. According to  Smolec, Kovac has "hesitated and speculated so much" that  Slovakia has experienced a repetition of the Victorious February  (ascendancy of the communist regime).    "These days confirm that Slovak freedom will long not  flourish. Independence is threatened. Decision-making is in the  hands of people who struggled against it. The era of  normalization, corruption and hypocrisy is evidently coming,"  stresses Smolec who predicts his expulsion from the paper as in  the days of the normalization.    "Dear readers! Hope dies last. The truth will not succumb  to fire or sword. Watch attentively the REPUBLIKA imprint. If  we are thrown out, we will raise our voice under another title,"  concludes Smolec.</p>

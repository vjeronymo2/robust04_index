After some  recreation, the former speaker is going to resume working on a  book on relations between legislative and executive powers which  he started to write in prison.    However, Zlobin denied reports that Khasbulatov intended to  settle in Chechnya permanently.    Khasbulatov, ethnic Chechen, had been elected to the  previous  Russian legislature from Russia's southern republic of Chechnya.  He was deprived of the Chechen citizenship when refused to  leave parliament after the independence-seeking republic called  back all its deputies.

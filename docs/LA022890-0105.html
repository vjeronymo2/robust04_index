			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SWEATSHOP BILL PUTS HEAT ON MANUFACTURERS  </P> <P> Assemblyman Tom Hayden plans to introduce legislation this week aimed at  cleaning up sweatshops by making garment manufacturers more responsible for the  treatment of the workers who sew their clothing.  </P> <P> "It's like a Dickens novel," the Santa Monica Democrat said of ongoing wage,  hour and child labor abuses in the Orange County and Los Angeles garment  industries. "You have primitive, 19th-Century sweatshops underpinning an  economy that is super-opulent, with the rich being in most cases completely  unaware of the source of their clothes."  </P> <P> Hayden, the chairman of the Assembly Committee on Labor and Employment, said he  would introduce the bill by Friday, the deadline for new legislation. But even  as he began drumming up support for the measure, he warned that new laws alone  would fail unless consumers and retailers begin applying conscience to their  fashion sense.  </P> <P> "If the people who care about animal rights would only add workers' rights to  their immediate agenda, you'd have quite a movement going on the West Side (of  Los Angeles)," Hayden said.  </P> <P> Officials with two garment trade groups said the state should spend enough  money to enforce existing laws before passing new ones.  </P> <P> The last round of garment industry reforms, passed in 1980, required sewing  shop owners to register with the state and pass an exam covering state labor  laws, said Joe Rodriguez, executive director of the Garment Contractors Assn.  of Southern California. The licensing fees were to have been earmarked for  enforcement, but have instead been siphoned off into the general fund,  Rodriguez said.  </P> <P> Bernie Brown, president of the Coalition of Apparel Industries of California,  said his group has supported a wide array of reform bills but warned that  over-regulation would doom the $6-billion-a-year Los Angeles apparel industry.  </P> <P> "We are trying, very desperately trying to clean up the act in our industry,"  Brown said. "(But) if indeed there's a liability act we can't live with, we'll  just move out of California."  </P> <P> In the past year, federal and state regulators have uncovered a nest of  sweatshops paying workers as little as $1 an hour to sew clothing bound for  Southern California's priciest department stores.  </P> <P> Labor inspectors found that one 7-year-old boy had spent hundreds of hours  helping his mother, a Mexican immigrant, sew designer clothing in their Santa  Ana home for wages that averaged $1.45 an hour.  </P> <P> But Brown said publicity given such dramatic cases has obscured the fact that  most apparel businesses are law-abiding.  </P> <P> Still, some officials and labor leaders say the problem with existing labor  laws is that they make it relatively simple to fine sweatshop bosses, but  nearly impossible to punish manufacturers who profit from the sweatshop system  by having their clothing sewn at rock-bottom prices.  </P> <P> Sewing shop owners complain that some manufacturers pay them so little per  garment that they cannot pay their workers the $4.25-per-hour minimum wage and  survive. But legitimate manufacturers, who may have up to 100 sewing  contractors and subcontractors scattered across Southern California, say they  haven't the means to police the labor practices of dozens of independent  businesses.  </P> <P> The U.S. Department of Labor in Santa Ana, which began a crackdown on Orange  County sweatshops last summer, has tried to attack the problem with a dual  approach: requiring sweatshop owners who underpaid workers to repay the back  wages, and using the 1938 "hot goods" law to prevent manufacturers from  shipping across state lines clothing that was made in violation of federal  labor law.  </P> <P> Since last summer, the department has filed suit against nine suspected  offenders and obtained consent judgments from four of them. As part of the  legal proceeding, the department is for the first time holding manufacturers  accountable for the abuses of their suppliers.  </P> <P> Hayden's bill would take a similar approach on the state level by strengthening  the "joint liability" provisions of state law.  </P> <P> The California law does make manufacturers liable for labor violations by their  contractors, but only if the manufacturer knew of the abuses.  </P> <P> "We want to define (liability) in such a way as to give the manufacturer an  incentive to know," Hayden said.  </P> <P> The exact wording of the liability clause was still being hammered out by  lawyers Tuesday.  </P> <P> Even if the law passes, Hayden said, "This is such an entrenched problem, and  has been going on for so many decades, that people will find ways to avoid the  letter and spirit of any law like this. So we need a broader strategy."  </P> <P> Among other things, the law should provide for disclosure of the names of  companies cited for abusive labor practices, he said.  </P> <P> "The consumer has to start asking the retailer, 'Who makes these clothes and  where are they made?' and have a sense of morality in their clothing  selection," Hayden said. "And the manufacturer has to know he'll be liable all  the way down the line for labor violations. That's the goal."  </P> <P> Brown said there is no question that a few unscrupulous manufacturers squeeze  their contractors and then turn a blind eye when the contractors underpay their  workers.  </P> <P> "They go out and shop around, and they bleed (the contractor) to the last dime  until they go out of business," Brown said. "In many cases they are taken  advantage of, there is no doubt about it."  </P></p>

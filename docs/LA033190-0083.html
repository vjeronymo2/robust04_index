			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> TURTLE FEVER;  </P> <P> PREMIERE: PARENTS TAKE THEIR CHILDREN OUT OF SCHOOL EARLY TO ATTEND VENTURA  COUNTY'S FIRST SCREENINGS OF "TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES."  </P> <P> Matt Geddes, 5, clutched a stuffed green turtle and bounced with anticipation  Friday at the prospect of seeing his two favorite heroes, Raphael and  Donatello.  </P> <P> Hardly a precocious student of Italian Renaissance art, Matt is a Ninja Turtle  fan who -- along with about two dozen other mostly preschool-age children --  showed up for the Ventura County premiere of the movie "Teenage Mutant Ninja  Turtles."  </P> <P> Matt's heroes, along with their half-shelled companions Leonardo and  Michelangelo, are crime-fighting turtles, the subject of an enormously popular  children's TV cartoon series, video games and a line of clothing.  </P> <P> The Ninja Turtle movie had its first county showing at the Oaks Mall in  Thousand Oaks Friday morning.  </P> <P> "I just like them," Matt said as he waited to enter the theater. "I like them  because they're good."  </P> <P> In Ventura County, the Ninja Turtles are expected to be so popular that some  parents said they took their children out of school early on Friday to beat the  long lines anticipated at the three theaters where the film is playing.  </P> <P> To the uninitiated, the appeal of the turtles may be elusive. Victims of a  mysterious nuclear accident, the turtles take on human characteristics and  learn martial arts from their spiritual leader, a human-sized rat named  Splinter.  </P> <P> In the movie, the fun-loving, pizza-eating green creatures live in the sewers  beneath New York City, wield martial-arts weapons, perform acrobatic stunts and  wage war against their sworn enemies, the evil underground organization The  Foot, led by The Shredder.  </P> <P> An implausible plot?  </P> <P> Not to Ninja Turtle enthusiasts such as Chad Lundahl, 5, of Thousand Oaks.  </P> <P> "I love them whether they're a cartoon or a movie," Chad said. "I like  Michelangelo because he talks like a surfer."  </P> <P> Parent Connie Angove said she took her son, Wesley, 7, out of Little Oaks  Elementary School early and brought him to the mall for an 11:45 showing.  </P> <P> "It's a family thing, and that's always worthwhile," Angove said.  </P> <P> At the Mann Buenaventura Theater in Ventura, where the movie is showing more  than 10 times a day on two screens, manager John Powers said the theater's  first showing at 11:45 a.m. Friday sold out.  </P> <P> At after-school showings Friday afternoon, children and parents were lined up  outside the theater, and more than 100 advance tickets were sold for a 7:15  p.m. showing.  </P> <P> Some parents professed ignorance of the subterranean crime fighters.  </P> <P> "My kids were discussing the names and I said, 'Who are these people?' " Fred  Lewkowitz, a tourist from New York, said as he waited for his son, Sal, 8, to  come out of the theater.  </P> <P> Ninja Turtle fans wondered whether the movie would live up to the popular  animated video features, such as "Turtles on the Half Shell."  </P> <P> Christopher McLean, 5, gave the film a good review.  </P> <P> "It was great," he said. "It was a wisecracking green team. My favorite is  Leonardo. He was awesome."  </P> <P> Parent Barbara Bojorquez predicted that her sons, Aaron, 7, and Danny, 5, would  see the movie more than once.  </P> <P> "If I didn't take them, they'd bug the life out of me. . . . I don't think this  is going to be my last time here."  </P></p>

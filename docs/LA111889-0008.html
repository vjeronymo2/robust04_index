			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATURE OF YELLOWSTONE'S FIRE  </P> <P> Like old wars, the Yellowstone forest fires of 1988 will be refought time and  time again. The more the fires are studied, along with the conditions that led  to them, the better equipped scientists and Park Service officials will be to  manage the nation's wilderness and parklands in sensible fashion. As two  experts note in the November issue of Scientific American, the most obvious  lesson of the summer of 1988 is a reaffirmation of the obvious: "that nature is  complex, subtle and not always easily controlled."  </P> <P> The authors also reached some interesting specific conclusions. William H.  Romme of Fort Lewis College and Don G. Despain, a research biologist at  Yellowstone, said the fires were more or less a natural event of the sort that  might occur every 200 to 300 years, regardless of human efforts to control  them. Their work indicates that the fires probably behaved very much like ones  that burned across the same area about 300 years ago.  </P> <P> They also rejected the theory that one reason the 1988 fires were so extensive  was that vigorous fire suppression programs had permitted the buildup of forest  cover and other fuel. While Yellowstone was established as a national park in  1872, fire control really was not very effective until almost the middle of  this century, the researchers said. If massive fires occur naturally every 200  to 400 years, they added, then 30 or 40 years of suppression was not long  enough for such quantities of fuel to accumulate. The 1988 fires came, finally,  when they did because of an unusual combination of dry, hot and windy  conditions.  </P> <P> Romme and Despain did not make specific recommendations about future fire  management programs. But their findings seem to reinforce the concept of  allowing lightning fires to burn naturally in the future. That may not prevent  another catastrophic fire two or three centuries from now, but could reduce its  severity even though the area burned each summer may be quite small.  </P> <P> The Romme-Despain study further contradicts the irate snap judgments of  politicians a year ago that the Park Service's so-called "let-burn" policy was  responsible for letting the 1988 fires get out of control. They conclude that  the natural conditions that existed in Yellowstone last year would have  overwhelmed any such human endeavor. And tourism figures this year put to rest  the fears of the same politicians that the area would suffer economically  because of the stigma of the giant burn. In fact, more tourists flocked to  Yellowstone than in almost any other year in history precisely because they  wanted to see the results of the fires and witness the magical rebirth of  Yellowstone plant life in 1989 from the ashes of 1988.  </P></p>

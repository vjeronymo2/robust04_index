His excellency was welcomed at King Khalid International  Airport by his excellency Dr. Sulayman al-Salim, the minister of  trade. [passage omitted]    On his arrival, his excellency the secretary of commerce  made  a statement in which his excellency expressed his pleasure at  visiting the Kingdom which is the first leg in a one-week tour  in the Middle East.    Here follows the statement of his excellency, the secretary  of commerce:    [Brown] [passage omitted] This week, I will also be visiting  Jordan, Egypt, Israel, and the West Bank. My mission is aimed  at encouraging economic development and commercial relations  which will help stability in this region, create economic  variety in the Arab Gulf, expand commercial relations between  the United States and Saudi Arabia, and consolidate the peace  process. [passage omitted]    The economic strategy of the Clinton administration is based  on fledgling and changing markets such as in Saudi Arabia and  the Gulf countries. We believe that these markets have got a  huge potential to develop in coming years. Moreover, it is  important to reach a wide-ranging shift toward a free trade  policy between the United States and GCC countries, whose  officials I will meet tomorrow.    There are a number of U.S. companies eager to conclude  partnerships with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries, while  these Gulf countries are aspiring to diversify their economies,  which are based on oil. The proceedings of dialogue I am to  open tomorrow will focus upon reducing the number of barriers to  build more sound commercial relations between our two countries,  reducing tariff barriers and expanding protection of cultural  heritage. All these are naturally among our priorities.    During my meetings with the Saudi leadership, I am hoping to  have talks that will strengthen commercial relations between the  United States and Saudi Arabia. [passage omitted] Thank you,  and I am now ready to hear your questions. [end Brown]    In reply to a question aircraft which Saudi Arabia was  intending to buy from the United States, his excellency Mr.  Ronald Brown indicated that during his visit to the Kingdom last  May his excellency spent a long time discussing with Saudi  Government officials commercial interests between the two  countries. His excellency said: "One of the issues raised then  was the purchase of aircraft and this issue is going to be  included in our agenda during this visit." His excellency added  that his excellency was happy with the progress achieved on the  subject. [passage omitted]    His excellency further said: "We see an enlargement of  participation in this agreement and in view of our close  relationship and strong economic and commercial links with Saudi  Arabia, we see the latter joining in." His excellency indicated  that specific questions were raised concerning the Kingdom and  his excellency expressed his confidence that these questions  would be settled. His excellency added: "These are some of the  items we will discuss during my visit." [passage omitted]    His excellency also described his previous visit to Saudi  Arabia as great and said: "This is why I returned to visit the  Kingdom after only eight months. This highlights the importance  the United States attaches to its relations with Saudi Arabia."  [passage omitted]    His excellency further said: "I believe progress has been  achieved as regards our trade relations. This has been done  with the promotion of joint solidarity projects, U.S.  investments, and improvement of trade relations between the two  countries."    In reply to a question on where U.S. companies were going to  win procurement bids for expansion and development of  telecommunications networks in the Kingdom, his excellency  pointed out that his excellency would follow up these matters  with his excellency the Saudi minister of telegraph, posts, and  telephone and his excellency the Saudi minister of commerce.  His excellency added: "Naturally, we would be pleased if U.S.  companies were successful in bids for those procurements."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, June 20 (AFP) -- The National Democratic  Coalition (Nadeco), an amalgam of pro-democracy groups in  Nigeria, condemned Monday [20 June] a "campaign of  misinformation" by the military government and stressed its  opposition to the convening of a national constitutional  conference.    In an official statement here, the Nadeco said that only  Chief Moshood Abiola could set up "a legitimate Sovereign  National Conference".    On June 11 Abiola, widely perceived as the winner of  annulled  elections held a year ago, proclaimed himself "President and  Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces of Nigeria."    The statement Monday, signed by Nadeco General Secretary Ayo  Opadokun, said that the Nigerian people "now have in place the  president they have freely elected to preside over this nation  who is now the only morally and legally competent authority to  administer the affairs of Nigeria." The constitutional  conference, planned by the government to start in Abuja next  Monday, "can never produce democracy," the Nadeco added.    The insistence of the government to go ahead with the  conference while two constitutions (1979 and 1989) remained  unused was a "pointer to its lack of programme except the  perpetuation of itself in office" and a display of  "insensitivity" of the military to the wishes of Nigerians.</p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / UK Company News: NE Industrial Props in Pounds 12.5m purchase A newly-formed property investment company has spent Pounds 12.5m on buying a portfolio of industrial property in the north-east of England and two industrial estates in Dorset. North Eastern Industrial Properties was set up by Prime Estates (Northumbria), an associate of Hunting Gate Group, a private property and construction group, Charterhouse Property Services, part of the bank, and TR Property Investment Trust, which has just bought New England Properties, a USM-quoted property company. It bought the properties from English Industrial Estates, the government funded property company, and from EP Investments, an associate of Hunting Gate Group. The investors subscribed for 4.15m preferred ordinary shares at Pounds 1 each. In addition a Pounds 9.4m loan was provided by Bayerische Hypotheken-Und Wechsel-Bank. The properties, which cover 926,000 sq ft, offer a relatively high yield of 12 per cent. Mr Jonathan Walters, group chief executive of Hunting Gate Group, considered there was potential for rental growth since the price of the buildings was below its replacement cost with rents as low as Pounds 1 per sq ft. Mr Walters said that investors in North Eastern Industrial Properties were brought together by Lazard Brothers, which acted as the placing agent. Hunting Gate Property Services, a subsidiary of Hunting Gate Group, was advising NEIP on the management of the portfolio.</p>

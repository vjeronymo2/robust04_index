			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Franco-German bid to revive Maastricht FRANCE AND Germany are expected to launch an initiative to revive the Maastricht treaty after a mini-summit in Paris today between President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The initiative will concentrate on reinforcing democratic control over EC institutions, reassuring those who fear the loss of national identity and taking in new member states. Senior German officials dismissed the suggestion that the talks might produce a formal initiative, but French officials said they expected 'a classic Franco-German move'. One French official said the meeting could help Mr John Major ahead of his proposed emergency EC summit, which is likely to be held in London on October 16, because it would address issues of particular concern to Britain. European Community foreign ministers meanwhile said they gave high priority to 'speedy and successful conclusion' of member countries' ratification of the treaty on closer economic and political union. But at their meeting in New York, Britain succeeded in preventing any commitment to a precise date for ratification. An aspect of Mr Major's proposed summit arousing the hostility of among some EC governments is his suggestion that it should consider changes within the European Monetary System. 'If you want to torpedo the EMS, you just do what the British prime minister seems to suggest', one German official said. 'I don't see how you can negotiate at a European summit, in front of 5,000 journalists, about the future of the monetary system. The markets would go wild. 'We need a summit meeting well-prepared to do some stock-taking and to agree on how to get the ratification process through. We need to answer the problems of both Denmark and the UK.' French officials deny that France and Germany might plan a slimmed-down version of economic and monetary union. Officials in Paris and Bonn stressed that the intention of Mr Kohl and Mr Mitterrand was to ease the forthcoming ratification debates in Britain and Germany, and start the process of answering Denmark's objections to the Maastricht treaty. 'The French vote (on Maastricht) should help relaunch the ratification process', Mr Mitterrand's spokesman said. He also said the two leaders would discuss ways of ensuring greater control by national governments and parliaments over the Brussels bureaucracy and the injection of more democracy. In a televised reaction to the French referendum, Mr Kohl said: 'We have to learn from the experience of the past few weeks. We also have not only to talk about possible mistakes, but to correct them.'</p>

			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISCOUNT BROKERS  </P> <P> Hurrah for Mark Alves and hundreds of others who have given the  Help-U-Sell-rate realtor an opportunity to demonstrate his professional skills  and help the homeowner keep more of his profit.  </P> <P> Realtors who call themselves "full-service" realtors are really only  six-percenters. At one time 6% was a fair commission, but that was back when  homes were selling for $20,000 -- $30,000 in the late 1960s. Times have  changed. Today homes are selling for $150,000-plus, and 6% does not justify the  commission.  </P> <P> You can sell your own homes! Just put up a sign . . . get an agreement with the  prospective buyers and take it to the nearby escrow office. They are the ones  who do all the work and see it through for you . . . not the realtor.  </P> <P> B. BARRAS  </P> <P> Westminster  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] During the NATO summit, Prime Minister Dehaene has  repeated that Belgium does not intend to outlaw the Kurdish  nationalist PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] party, but Belgium  does condemn the terrorist activities of the PKK. Dehaene had a  short talk with his Turkish colleague Ciller at the summit.    Turkey had asked Belgium to ban the PKK after the recent  Turkish-Kurdish riots in Brussels. Belgium, however, is  sticking to its own policy. Dehaene said that the government  would decide itself how to deal with problems here. He asked  the Turkish premier to solve the problems between the Turkish  Government and Kurdish minority through negotiation, and pointed  out that Belgium had solved its community problems peacefully.</p>

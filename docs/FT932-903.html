			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / International Company News: BNP warns of sharp fall in results for first half BANQUE Nationale de Paris (BNP), one of France's largest banks and a key target for privatisation by the new French government, yesterday warned of a substantial fall in net profits for the first half of the year. The bank, which recently reported a 26 per cent reduction in net profits, to FFr2.17bn (Dollars 380m), last year, said its commercial banking business was performing well. However, it said it would have to make hefty provisions on its exposure to small businesses in France and to sovereign loans. As a result, BNP anticipates a sharp slide in net profits for the first half of the year, to between FFr500m and FFr550m, against FFr1.33bn in the same period of 1992. Unless the economic situation improves, it expects the same trend to continue in the second half of this year. Despite the profits warning, BNP is still committed to privatisation. The bank, originally scheduled for sale to the private sector in the mid-1980s by the last centre-right French government, is expected to be one of the first issues in the new privatisation drive. Mr Michel Pebereau, who chaired Credit Commercial de France during its privatisation in 1987, last month replaced veteran Mr Rene Thomas as chairman of BNP with a brief to prepare the bank for sale. BNP's problems in the first half are reflected across French banking, which has been hit by the impact of the recession on demand for credit, and on the small business sector. BNP will also suffer in 1993 because of further provisions on sovereign loans; last year it was able to claw back FFr1.7bn in surplus provisions. Despite these pressures, BNP estimates net banking income will rise 6 per cent during the first half, mainly due to growth from foreign activities. It also expects a 10 per cent increase in gross operating profits. BNP is continuing its cost-cutting initiatives under Mr Pebereau. It recently launched a long-term plan to improve productivity by pruning staffing levels. The move has already triggered protests from employees. The group is also pursuing its international expansion. Until recently it was more cautious about investing outside France than other Gallic banks, notably Credit Lyonnais, the other state-controlled commercial banking group. However BNP has negotiated a cross-shareholding agreement with Germany's Dresdner Bank, whereby the two groups will take stakes of at least 10 per cent in each other to cement their existing partnership agreement. Credit Commercial de France (CCF), the French bank that Mr Pebereau left to head BNP, yesterday disclosed plans to acquire Banque de Savoie, the regional bank, in a share deal. CCF already owns 24.26 per cent of Banque de Savoie and is offering nine of its own shares for 10 of the remaining shares.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: SB in drug swap with Recordati of Italy SmithKline Beecham has revealed its first-ever product swap. The Anglo-American healthcare group is exchanging co-marketing rights for two of its medicines for development and marketing rights for a drug from Recordati, Italy's eighth-largest drugs group. SB is licensing in a series of alpha-receptor antagonists being developed by Recordati, including REC 15-2739 which is in early stage development of benign prostatic hypertrophy, a common condition in men over 50. The group will have exclusive worldwide marketing rights except in Italy, Spain, Japan, and either France or Italy. In exchange, Recordati will co-market two compounds in Italy and Spain. These are epristeride, another compound for BPH, and ropinirole, a treatment for Parkinson's disease. Both are in late stage development. In addition, Recordati will receive milestone payments during REC 15-2739's development and will manufacture the drug. The market for treatments for BPH is emerging rapidly. Last month, Abbott Laboratories received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for its drug Hytrin. It will compete directly will Merck's Proscar. Other companies with BPH compounds marketed or in development include Pfizer of the US, Synthelabo of France, and Yamanouchi and Ono of Japan. Abbott believes that of the 30m men aged over 50 in the US, 10m suffer urinary problems due to BPH. Some analysts believe the potential worldwide market for BPH drugs could reach Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7bn) a year. Mr Jean-Pierre Garnier, SB's executive vice-president pharmaceuticals, said: 'We see these compounds as being complementary to epristeride and an important addition to SB's developing urology portfolio.' Epristeride is a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor and from a different class of drugs from Recordati's medicine. Recordati is also preparing an alliance in oral healthcare with a Scandinavian company.</p>

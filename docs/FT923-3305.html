			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Travel: Japan's Alps - trekking among the gods - Christopher McCooey enjoys hot outdoor baths, staying in mountain huts and watching the sun rise while hiking in Japan's North Alps I WAS at 5,000ft and taking a bath with a stranger. 'Are you America?' he asked. 'No, I'm from England,' I said, sounding like a school master. 'Ah so,' he said, bobbing his head vigorously just above water. 'My name is Taniguchi. I am 40 years old.' Many conversations start like this in Japan even when you are in hot water, outdoors and higher than Ben Nevis. I was half-way into a 10-day walking tour through the North Alps of Japan and was enjoying the soak after a hard day. I was following in the footsteps of an English vicar who had been that way in the summer of 1894. The Rev Walter Weston had gone to Japan in 1888 as a missionary. He ended up spending three extended periods in the country and wrote four books about Japan, including the classic Mountaineering and Exploration in the Japanese Alps. He is best remembered for introducing the notion of recreational mountaineering to Japan and opening local eyes to the beauty of Japan's mountains - a noteworthy thing for a foreigner to have done, particularly as he looked at the beauties of the mountains with only one eye. For all of his long life - he died at the age of 79 in 1940, just before the outbreak of the Pacific War - Weston was blind in one eye. I asked Taniguchi san if he knew about Weston. 'Of course,' he said without hesitation. 'Father of mountaineering. There is memorial in Kamikochi.' Kamikochi, twinned with Grindelwald in Switzerland, was where I was heading, having started, like Weston, at the spa of Renge Onsen in the north of the mountain range that runs north-south through the middle of the main island of Honshu. Cars and buses can reach Renge, and the trail I was going to follow started in front of the primitive collection of wooden huts and cabins that housed the spa's indoor baths and sleeping accommodation. With my water bottle full of cold, sweet black tea, I set off after a breakfast of rice, dried seaweed, raw egg, pickles and miso soup. If that is not your idea of how to start a day in the mountains then you will have to carry your own instant coffee and porridge and a small stove on which to prepare them. Japan's mountains are steep and in the hiking season (May to October) it can get warm in the day-time. But the cool of the mountains is a relief from the sauna-hot cities. You sweat a lot, so I was grateful for a neck-towel and a wide-brimmed hat and a map that showed the trail and indicated where drinking water was available. There is luxuriant vegetation up to about 6,500ft. Above 8,000ft bare rock is usually broken into slabs and chunks by freezing and thawing and other weathering. The first peak I scaled was Shirouma, the white horse mountain. It was pretty crowded on top as the mountain is accessible by cable car from Hakuba, one of the most popular ski resorts in Japan. Almost everyone I met in the mountains greeted me with 'Konichiwa]' ('Hello]') or 'Ganbatte]' ('Keep going]'). A group of students asked me to join them for a 'memorial' photograph on the 9,620ft summit. It was the first of many such requests during my hike. Snap-happy Japanese will urge you to say 'Cheezu]' and ask you to 'pozu,' which usually means raising two fingers in a Churchillian gesture. The trails are usually well marked, and there are plenty of huts where you can get food and shelter for the night; a mattress and duvet are supplied but it is a good idea to take a sheet-style sleeping bag. Accommodation and two meals costs about Pounds 25. There are also camp-sites that charge about Pounds 2 a night. The second day's hike was the hardest. I dropped down more than 6,500ft from the exposed alpine peaks around Shirouma into a narrow valley verdant with maple, oak, beech, willow and birch. The whole valley seemed to hum and buzz with insect life in contrast to the silence of the peaks above. The map said there was a hot spring in the valley - the symbol looks like an upside-down jellyfish, steam rising from a pool. Beside the mountain hut at Babadani were some hot baths, but I walked a bit further up the valley to where I had seen steam rising from the river bank. I stripped off and felt my way into the river, finding just the right place so that my buttocks did not boil and my toes were not tortured by the ice-cold melt-water. White-rumped swifts swooshed for one last snack before roost time and a dipper and a grey wagtail bobbed and bowed before retiring. The next day I hiked along the Rurobe river valley. Much of the time the trail is an old mining track hewn out of sheer rock on the side of the gorge cut by the river. In places there are vertical drops of several hundred feet, but fixed chains and metal bridges are reassuring. I camped the night near the old mine shaft cut horizontally into the mountain, following a silver vein. From the mine it was quite a pull to reach the outdoor spring where I met Taniguchi san. The place was Senninyu - 'hermit's hot water' - named after an ascetic who lived in a cave there five centuries ago. Crossing a snow field, I thought I had encountered the hermit himself: a man wearing a traditional bamboo strip hat and a kimono of black cotton. There was a samurai's sword stuck in his belt. On his feet were tabi (socks with the big toe separated from the rest) and straw sandals called waraji. The only non-Edo era item was a pair of red Y-fronts, visible because he had hitched up his kimono to facilitate walking. He was really a salary man in disguise. He told me he hiked in the alps dressed like that 'to refresh his Japanese spirit and Japanese heart.' The good reverend would have nodded sagely if he had encountered such a hiker - Weston used to tie waraji under his hob-nailed boots to improve his grip when clambering over wet and slippery rock. In a day I reached Tateyama, just under 10,000ft; next to it is Oyama, one of the most sacred peaks in Japan. It was over-run by hordes of day-trippers who had been coached to within striking distance of the summit. There were toddlers and teenagers wearing T-shirts saying 'Records are made to be broken but TDK CDs go on for ever' and, more enigmatically, 'Regard me sexual eyes.' Their parents and grandparents were crowding into the shrine atop the peak to be blessed by the resident priest who was waving a sacred wand over them. In July and August, the peak summer season, no less than 10,000 people visit this shrine daily. It does a jangling trade, for it seems that every one of those 10,000 descends to the bus terminal with a charm that has a bell attached to it. The tens of thousands who flock to such shrines may not love the mountains in the same way as the climbers and hikers. But the fact that they risk sprained ankles and sweat-stained designer clothes is testimony to the power that mountains still exert on the Japanese. This goes back to the time (before Weston arrived) when they considered the mountains that cover two-thirds of their country to be the domain of the gods. The high spot of my hike, at 10,430ft, was Yarigatake, which Weston referred to as the Matterhorn of the East. I scrambled to the summit to watch the sunset and, 11 hours later, the sunrise. Away to the south-east, Fuji rose out of the clouds. All that remained for me was to drop down to the valley to pay my respects at the Weston memorial - a simple plaque on a shady rock with the bespectacled and dog-collared vicar looking kindly out at the mountains he loved. Details about huts and trails can be obtained from Kita Alps Hyutte Tantosake, Meibundo, Kotsukaikan-nai, 2-13 Yurakucho, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, tel: 03-3211-1023. In addition, the Japan National Tourist Organisation at 6-6 Yurakucho 1-Chome, Tokyo, tel: 03-3502-1461, produces pamphlets and short mountain hiking itineraries in English for the Kamikochi area. Any Japan Travel Bureau can make reservations for you in the mountain huts, as well as hotels and inns. Above the treeline you will never be turned away from a mountain hut if you do not have a reservation, but you may have to sleep on the floor. Make sure you have appropriate equipment and clothing for mountain hiking, particularly if you plan to climb out of the valleys and up to the peaks.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Death Among the Autumn Leaves; The </F> Disaster of a German Operation Against Arab Terrorists"]    [Text] The man, who had spent the past few hours in a  detention cell in the Duesseldorf police headquarters, was  raging like a maniac. "Idiot," he snapped at his interrogator,  "why am I sitting behind bars?"    Marwan Khreesat, 49, born in Jordan, revealed an astounding  story to the State Protection Department of the Federal Office  of Criminal Investigation (BKA). "I'm one of you," maintained  the Arab, who had been arrested as a suspected terrorist. He  lamented that arrangements had been made with the German  authorities that he would be given a chance to escape.    The criminal investigator couldn't understand this at all.  He  took the Arab's testimony, three pages' worth. Even the public  prosecutor in charge began to suspect during the subsequent  investigation that the prisoner apparently was under special  protection. In any case, the record of the interrogation ended  up shredded in the trash, thanks to a warning from West German  secret service officials. In other respects, too, the arrested  Jordanian enjoyed striking concessions. An office of the  Duesseldorf public prosecutor telephoned the German Embassy in  the Jordanian capital of Amman--Khreesat could speak with a  fellow national who was sitting there in the office of the  military attache. The latter made it very clear: "Trust the  German authorities."    Germany, in the fall of 1988, two months before the downing  of the jumbo jet over Lockerbie: Following a tip from the  Israeli secret service, Mosad, and on the basis of their own  investigations, German security officers surrounded a cell of  the Palestinian terrorist group PFLP-GC (Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine--General Command) in Neuss, near  Duesseldorf.    The Israelis reported that the PFLP-GC fighters wanted to  attack American targets in Central Europe. The Office for the  Protection of the Constitution [BfV] for the time being knew  only--according to an internal report--that the Palestinians  "were recruiting new members" in Germany.    Pulling the strings was Syrian arch terrorist Hafez Kassem  Hussein, today 48, member of the PFLP-CG Central Committee and  leader of the European network. His nom de guerre: Dalkamoni.  Officials knew that wherever he surfaced there was more going on  than mere recruiting activities: The group was planning several  bomb attacks.    In July 1988, the American cruiser Vincennes had mistakenly  shot down an Iranian Airbus over the Strait of Hormuz. All 290  passengers and crew had been killed. Arab groups swore  revenge--if possible three airplanes were to be dispatched from  the skies at the same time.    German security officials, therefore, planned a big coup  against Arab terrorists on German soil. Code name for the  operation: Operation Autumn Leaves.    Dalkamoni summoned the top specialist Khreesat, cover name  "Safi," to Neuss. The partisan of the PFLP-GC had earned a  reputation in the terrorist branch. Area of expertise: attacks  against airlines. Khreesat is suspected of having helped prepare  two attacks against jets belonging to Swissair and Israel's El  Al, in 1970 and 1972.    What Dalkamoni didn't know was that Khreesat had threefold  duties in the intelligence service and terrorist business. The  East Berlin Ministry for State Security had learned early in  October that the Arab was an agent for the West Germans--this  from a "reliable source" in the German Intelligence Service  [BND], according to a memorandum. The BND had recruited Khreesat  "with the concurrence of the Jordanian secret service" to  infiltrate PFLP commandos, for example.    But the big operation against Arab terrorism ended in a  disaster that the authorities have shrouded in silence to this  day:    --A German policeman died while defusing a PFLP bomb;    --an informant in the western services whom the BfV had  infiltrated into the Neuss group was presumably liquidated;    --a Karlsruh investigating judge released the second  informant, Khreesat, even though he was responsible for  constructing four bombs.    From the middle of October 1988 on, according to Stasi  [State  Security Service (GDR)] findings, Khreesat had become a full  player in Operation Autumn Leaves. Whenever he or Dalkamoni  telephoned, the BfV's tape recorders were running. Both men were  under constant surveillance.    On 20 October, they talked about procuring "three large  black  cans with lids," as well as "gloves" and "paste." On the  following day, they talked about "pointed buttons made of  aluminum," four of which were to be "electric." On 24 October,  according to a record," it was determined that Dalkamoni  purchased three mechanical alarm clocks and possibly one digital  alarm clock.... Next Khreesat...together with Dalkamoni bought  16 1.5-volt batteries (appliance batteries, finger thick),  diverse small switches, screws, and a large tube of Pattex."    Khreesat reported to Damascus that he had made changes in  the  "medicine," and that it "was now better and stronger than  before." What Khreesat meant was clear to the eavesdroppers:  explosives.    He told his contacts in Amman that it would be "two to three  more days" before he returned. Dalkamoni, too, called his  homeland and a liaison person in the King's Take Away restaurant  on Cyprus. The job, he said, was about finished.    From this the observers concluded that the Neuss terror duo,  Dalkamoni-Khreesat, wanted to disappear and would be replaced by  a new team--a very common practice with such operations.    Klaus Gruenewald, department chief in the Cologne BfV,  sounded the alarm: "To ward off threatening danger, an executive  intervention was imperative."    On 26 October 1988, special operation commandos of the  police  took 16 people belonging to the Neuss Palestinian unit into  temporary custody. Whole arsenals of electronic apparatus and  weapons were seized. Among those arrested was Ramzi Diab, born  in Akko, Israel, in 1959. Diab appears only incidentally in the  German Autumn Leaves papers. An official noted: "n.p.u., which  means: further personal data unknown.    But that is anything but the truth. Diab, a secret service  collaborator, had been assigned to watch Dalkamoni, which the  BfV knew--a dangerous case of double dealing. Diab is said later  to have been exposed and murdered by the PFLP-GC.    The carelessness with which German authorities carried out  Operation Autumn Leaves also cost a German policeman his life.  He had lived with this danger for over four years. On 20 March  1989, BKA Chief Commissioner Hans-Juergen Sonntag typed on his  office typewriter a kind of letter of resignation:    "Withdrawal of my willingness to serve. I hereby withdraw my  declaration to volunteer to deactivate unconventional explosive  and incendiary devices."    It seemed clear to him that his chief would have no  objections: Star athlete Sonntag, parachutist, body builder,  swimmer, and soccer player, as well as tennis partner of BKA  President Heinrich Boge. And the young man had had the prospect  of a new job for a long time: security officer at the German  Embassy in Teheran.    The last bomb that he was to disassemble took the life of  Sonntag, 35. On a special table in the basement of the office  lay a stereo tuner, which looked harmless, but which in reality  was a devilish explosive trap--a piece of Khreesat's making.    "Come on, Thomas," said Sonntag to a younger colleague,  "let's go to the lunchroom first and then get the job over with  quickly. If it explodes, we'll be in heaven." The dangerous work  had almost been completed. "It was just a matter of the last  screw," Sonntag's father knows. An accidental turn of the  screwdriver activated the firing mechanism. Sonntag survived the  tremendous explosion only a few hours. The other official was  badly injured.    Three days later, at the small cemetery in a little spot  called Erfweiler-Ehlingen, between Saarbruecken and the French  border: State funeral for Chief Commissioner Sonntag, formulaic  speeches for the good policeman who had to die in service for  his country.    No one wants to say how absurd Sonntag's death was in the  jungle of the secret services. The official died from the blast  of a bomb that the informant of another German security service  had put together. It is fitting for this tragedy that the German  judiciary did not issue a new arrest warrant for Khreesat for  the involuntary manslaughter of policeman Sonntag until the fall  of 1990, when the perpetrator was no longer in reach.    The Fifth Criminal Division of the Superior Land Court in  Frankfurt mentioned the scandal only in passing when, on 3 June  1991, after eight months of proceedings, it sentenced the  terrorists Dalkamoni and an accomplice to 15 and 12 years in  prison for other attacks:    "In October 1988, Dalkamoni asked the fellow accused, Marwan  Khreesat, an expert in the production of explosives, to come to  the Federal Republic. Khreesat was to make bombs out of radios.  These bombs were intended to cause plane crashes."    Operation Autumn Leaves ended up in the registry.</p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Construction lifts German output: Economic watch West German industrial output in January was up 0.2 per cent on January 1993, but unchanged from December. Meanwhile, revised figures for December showed a 1.4 per cent increase over the previous month, twice the increase initially reported. The results were better than expected, and pointed to stabilisation in the economy. Economists noted that manufacturing output remained weak, falling 0.5 per cent in January. The main factor behind the buoyancy of the January index was an unexpected 8.4 per cent surge in construction output. Italy recorded a surplus of L5,134bn (Pounds 2.04bn) in January on its balance of payments current account, after a L2,310bn deficit in December. The deficit in January 1993 was L765bn. Turkey's trade deficit widened to Dollars 818m (Pounds 560m) in January from Dollars 519m a year earlier. Exports totalled Dollars 1.32bn, up from Dollars 1.27bn a year earlier. Imports reached Dollars 2.1bn in September 1993, up from Dollars 1.8bn a year earlier. Belgian new car registrations in February were up 22.4 per cent on February 1993 and 11.5 per cent on January and February over the same period last year. Slovakia has introduced a 10 per cent tax on imports of many consumer goods, in a move to improve its trade balance. German car sales fell 20 per cent in 1993, to around DM190bn, while vehicle output fell a quarter to about 4m units. The collapse in sales led to 70,000 job losses last year.</p>

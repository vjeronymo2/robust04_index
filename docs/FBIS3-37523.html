As a  matter of fact, he repeated the same things he had said at a  meeting with the staff of the Minsk pharmaceutical plant on the  previous day. Also addressed at the meeting were today's most  urgent problems.    "We have lost control over our Republic." With this sad  remark, the chairman began his analysis of the current  situation. He is convinced that the lack of control will be  remedied when Belarus defines its political system (Belarus and  Tajikistan are the only former republics of the USSR not to have  done so yet), and the presidential office is instituted.  Presidential elections could be held as early as June, and if  the results are positive, the Supreme Soviet elections might be  held another three months later. The president will form a  government that will be approved by the new legislature. All  these changes should be based on a new constitution and  electoral law. As the chairman noted, the Supreme Soviet  Presidium has already drafted such a law. Should the current  Supreme Soviet be unable to adopt these documents, Mechyslaw  Hryb does not rule out the possibility of holding a referendum.  He is convinced that it is impossible to continue with the old  Constitution. The local soviet elections should complete the  political reforms in the spring of 1995. As the chairman  emphasized, the advantages of this scheme are a consistency of  reforms, no power vacuum during the various stages of the  process, and eventually a strong vertical power structure.    Although his comments on the current problems were rather  brief, they were quite specific. For example, Mechyslaw Hryb  completely supports economic union with Russia and the  unification of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems,  because he does not see any other possible way of saving our  economy and agricultural sector, which are in worse shape than  their equivalents to the east. He believes that the Supreme  Soviet and its Presidium should not dodge urgent economic  problems or pass the buck to the Cabinet of Ministers.  Regarding relations with the government, Mechyslaw Hryb  supports friendly cooperation, and believes that the  confrontation "which has been seen lately," must be halted.    Following his meeting with the kolkhoz staff, the Supreme  Soviet chairman answered the following questions from a  NARODNAYA GAZETA reporter.    [Reporter] Yesterday, you discussed supplies of  pharmaceuticals, and today you are dealing with agricultural  problems. What results can the people expect from these "spot  checks" by the new state leader?    [Hryb] It is very helpful to hear people speaking personally  about their problems -- it is easier to find one's bearings and  look for appropriate solutions. Regarding pharmaceuticals, I  have come to the conclusion that it is better to define the  groups of the most essential drugs, and concentrate our  attention on them. Unless we concentrate on developing our  pharmaceutical industry, drugs will be very expensive in  Belarus, because we are still a far way from achieving Western  standards of living.    [Reporter] Yesterday it was health care, today it is  agriculture. There are, however, more problems. What, in your  opinion, must be solved first and foremost?    [Hryb] I have already said -- we must define our political  system, no matter which direction we orient ourselves -- West,  East, South, or North. If we do not unite and restore  discipline and order, we will get nowhere. Our people do not  listen to anybody today.    [Reporter] When our paper is published on 15 February,  strikers will be gathering in Independence Square, putting  forward some very tough political demands. What would you like  to tell them?    [Hryb] I have already explained that I am generally  against strikes. I am for solving problems diplomatically. If  you have problems, let us sit down at the negotiating table and  look for solutions. Every strike is an attempt to forcibly  affect the results of talks. Of course, everybody has the right  to express their opinion, but what will a strike bring? I see  the solution as lying in the economic union and unification of  monetary systems. Will a political strike advance this? I doubt  it. On the contrary, it will push us even further away from it.  However, if the strike is held in accordance with the law, I  will have no right to ban it....    [Reporter] You do not rule out the possibility of  sitting down at the negotiating table with the strikers?    [Hryb] No, I do not. There is only one "but".... We should  respect one another. Nobody has yet called them criminals, as  they are doing, for example, with regard to the government.  Excuse me, but only a court is allowed to call someone a  criminal.    [Reporter] The proposals for political reform that you  voiced yesterday and today reflect the position of the Supreme  Soviet Presidium. Was this position unequivocal, or were other  opinions voiced?    [Hryb] The members of the Presidium were unequivocal, at  least those who participated in the meeting. We decided that we  should define our stance on all those issues -- the presidential  and early legislative elections. We should not delay them any  longer. We will try to convince the deputies to give us support.    [Reporter] There is an option of holding presidential  elections at the Supreme Soviet, not in a nationwide ballot.  What is your attitude toward this?    [Hryb] I know about this alternative, but I advocate  nationwide elections. This, though, will depend on our decision  on the political system. If we become a parliamentary republic,  the president, as everybody knows, will have to be elected at a  Supreme Soviet session -- there will be no sense in holding  nationwide elections. Nevertheless, I am for a strong,  democratically elected president, and I hope that the Supreme  Soviet will support me on this. [end Hryb]    On the eve of the meeting with the kolkhoz workers and this  interview, Mechyslaw Hryb was shown the working conditions of  milkers and machine operators, and visited a kindergarten and  high school in the village of Petkavichy.</p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Unease grows on future of monarchy TORY MPs' fears over the constitutional uncertainty created by the separation of the Prince and Princess of Wales erupted publicly yesterday with speculation that the royal couple would never become King and Queen, Ralph Atkins writes. Many Conservative MPs did not believe the princess should be Queen without a reconciliation. Some suggested the prince may renounce the throne with his son, 10-year-old Prince William, eventually succeeding the present Queen. The government again said there were no constitutional implications of the decision, which has brought fresh turmoil into the House of Windsor. Downing Street is deliberately refusing to consider 'hypothetical' scenarios  -for instance, if the couple were to divorce. That would make it difficult for Prince Charles to take over the monarch's role as head of the Church of England. Privately, cabinet ministers said it was largely up to Buckingham Palace - rather than MPs - to ensure that the arrangements were workable. Mr John Major has said there is 'no reason' why the princess should not in due course become Queen. The couple will carry out some public engagements together but it was unclear what would happen, however, if they wanted to start a relationship with a different partner. Nor is it certain how a modern monarch, under the scrutiny of the press, could have a Queen from whom he was formally separated. Mr John Bowis, Tory MP for Battersea, said: 'There has to be a coming together or I'm afraid there has to be a skipping of a generation. 'It would be absurd to have two different carriage processions going from two different parts of London to the coronation and then the King and Queen going to their own homes afterwards.' Dame Jill Knight, Tory MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, said there was 'a frisson of concern' in the Commons when Mr Major said the princess could still become Queen. 'Many people say 'well, even if we skip the Prince and Princess of Wales, we have another possible King in William'.' A great deal would also depend on public reaction, Dame Jill said.</p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / UK Company News: UES moves back into the black UES Holdings, the Rotherham-based engineering steels and forgings group in which GKN has a 39.1 per cent stake, returned to profit in the second quarter after its record Pounds 48.1m pre-tax loss for the full 1993 year. For the first half, however, UES was still in the red, and Mr Don Ford, chairman, said returns were still 'totally inadequate'. GKN's share of a much reduced first-half net loss at UES was Pounds 1m, compared with Pounds 2m for the first half of 1993 and Pounds 8m for the whole of last year. British Steel owns the rest of the company. External sales at UES rose slightly to about Pounds 300m. The trading profit was not available, but UES is trading in the black, and Mr Ford said that 'by and large, we are on a better trend than at any time in the past two or three years'. Market conditions were improving and prices were continuing to rise slowly. Recent rationalisation and cost reduction was continuing to pay off. Steel demand was quite strong, helped by better conditions in the automotive sector, which is a large user of engineering steel. UES is the dominant producer of engineering steels in the UK, and Mr Ford said its domestic market share had improved. Its forgings business had also done 'quite well'.</p>

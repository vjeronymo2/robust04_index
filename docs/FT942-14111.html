			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: AMR blames bad weather for fall AMR, parent of American Airlines, the second biggest US airline, yesterday blamed fare discounting and bad winter weather for a net loss of Dollars 7m in the first quarter, equivalent to 30 cents a share. The figure represented an improvement from the previous year's net loss of Dollars 22m, or 43 cents, but fell short of what analysts had hoped to see in the light of growth in the US economy. The shares shed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 53 1/8 in early trading. Last month, American Airlines warned its first-quarter losses would be bigger than the 24 cents a share analysts had then been predicting. This was largely because it lost Dollars 46m in February after exceptionally severe weather and low fares. Group revenues were Dollars 3.81bn, virtually unchanged from last time. However, the airline's revenues were down by 2.2 per cent. Losses were reduced because the airline also achieved a 2.6 per cent cut in operating expenses.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The MAINICH SHIMBUN conducted a nationwide poll on  Japan-U.S. relations at the end of April. According to the  results, 36 percent of the respondents said "Japan-U.S.  relations are in good shape or they are in relatively good  shape" and the figure shows a 20-percent drop from 55 percent in  the October 1991 telephone poll conducted by MAINICHI SHIMBUN.  According to the poll's results, 21 percent of those surveyed  forecast that "they [relations] will worsen in the future," far  exceeding the 13 percent who predicted, "They will be better  than now." Asked about their interest in and image of the United  States, 76 percent cited "guns and murders," whereas 41 percent  cited "freedom and democracy." Nonetheless, the results of the  recent poll showed that while people's perception of the United  States as an important nation heightened, the percentage of  those surveyed who called for repealing the Japan-U.S. Security  Treaty shrank, and the percentage of those who favored keeping  the treaty as written increased.    In the recent poll, 8 percent of those surveyed answered  that  "Japan-U.S. relations are in bad shape while 38 percent answered  "they are in relatively bad shape." In this way, 46 percent  answered that Japan-U.S. relations are not in good shape and the  percentage was an increase of 13 percentage points from 33  percent in the October 1991 telephone poll. The results of the  recent poll showed that the younger generation takes a  pessimistic view of future Japan-U.S. relations while the older  generation takes an optimistic view of them. Skilled engineers,  business mangers, and white-collar workers take a relatively  pessimistic view of future Japan-U.S. relations.    Compared with the past three polls since 1989, the results  of  the recent poll showed a decline in the percentage of those who  answered that "Japan-U.S. relations will be better than now" and  an increase in the percentage who answered "they will worsen in  the future." Almost all of the younger generation takes a  pessimistic view of future Japan-U.S. relations.    Asked about their interest in and image of the United  States,  76 percent cited "guns and murders" whereas 41 percent of them  cited "freedom and democracy." Thirty-five percent cited  "drugs," and 32 percent "racial discrimination," with 22 percent  pointing to "movies, music, culture and recreation." In this  way, the Japanese had no good image of the United States. Asked  what to do with their family members or relatives if they intend  to stay for a long time in the United States for study or other  purposes, 42 percent said "I have no position," while 41 percent  said "We oppose them staying in the United States for a long  time," with 17 percent "favoring them staying in the United  States for a long time."    Asked to comment on former Prime Minister Hosokawa who said  "no" at the February Japan-U.S. summit talks, 73 percent said  "We rate his act highly," while 23 percent said "We cannot rate  his act highly." Asked to comment on the Super 301 provision  which the United States intends to invoke to slap high duties on  imported Japanese goods, 53 percent stated, "The United States  should not invoke the provision" while 20 percent of them  stated, "U.S. invocation of the provision is inevitable."    Asked about the cause of the trade imbalance between Japan  and the United States, 17 percent of those surveyed said "Japan  is responsible for it" while 16 percent said "The United States  is mainly responsible," with 54 percent saying "We have no  position." Compared with the October 1991 telephone poll, the  results of the recent poll showed a flat line in the percentage  of those who said "Japan is responsible for it or we have no  position on it" and a drop of 16 percent from the 23 percent in  the previous poll who said "The United States is mainly  responsible for it."    Asked if the United States is an important nation for Japan  in the December 1991 poll, 22 percent of the respondents said  "The United States is the most important nation for Japan,"  while 61 percent said "The United States is one of the important  nations for Japan," with 6 percent saying, "The United States is  not such an important nation for Japan." In the recent poll,  however, 23 percent said "The United States is the most  important nation for Japan," while 66 percent said "The United  States is one of the important nations for Japan," with 5  percent saying "The United States is not such an important  nation for Japan." In this way, the results of the recent poll  showed that the Japanese perception of the U.S. importance in  Japan heightened a little.    With regard to the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, the  percentage  of those polled who favored repealing the treaty largely shrank,  and the percentage of those who favored keeping the treaty as  written largely increased compared with the October 1991  telephone poll.</p>

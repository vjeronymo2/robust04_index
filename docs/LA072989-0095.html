			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BANGERTER BROTHERS RESIGN TOP POSTS AT CARE ENTERPRISES  </P> <P> The top two executives of Care Enterprises have resigned as part of a  reorganization plan intended to bring the nursing home chain out of bankruptcy  proceedings, attorneys said Friday.  </P> <P> Twin brothers Dee Roy and Lee Roy Bangerter on Thursday began paid leaves of  absence that will last 60 days or until the court confirms the proposed  reorganization plan, said David Kupetz, an attorney representing the company.  </P> <P> After that, the plan calls for the brothers to be retained as consultants, and  each would receive a salary of $250,000 a year, which is higher than their  current $211,000 salary.  </P> <P> Lee Roy Bangerter was chief executive of the chain, while Dee Roy was chief  financial officer. Their mother, Opal Winn Bangerter, founded the chain in  1965.  </P> <P> The reorganization plan, presented Friday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los  Angeles, also would allow the company to retire its $80-million debt to  unsecured creditors by giving the creditors an 85% equity interest in the  company in the form of stock.  </P> <P> Ownership of the firm by Care's existing shareholders, including the  Bangerters, would be reduced to 15%. Peter Landsberg, attorney for the  unsecured creditors, said the plan also calls for retiring Care's $40-million  bank debt in about three years. He said the first $10 million would be paid  "fairly promptly" and may be raised from the sale of nursing homes. Other  payments, he said, will be made out of operating profits.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Millions Saved'  </P> <P> Attorneys for both the company and creditors said a settlement was reached in  part to avoid a lengthy debate over various competing reorganization proposals.  In addition, litigation was scheduled to begin Aug. 8 over a demand from the  creditors to have the management of Care Enterprises turned over to a court  trustee.  </P> <P> "We figure there will be millions of dollars saved in administrative costs by  avoiding extensive litigation over a plan and the appointment of a trustee,"  Kupetz said.  </P> <P> Care Enterprises, one of the nation's largest nursing home operators, filed for  protection from creditors in March, 1988.  </P> <P> Robert Baldwin Jr., previously chief operating officer, will serve as chief  executive until a replacement is found, Kupetz said.  </P></p>

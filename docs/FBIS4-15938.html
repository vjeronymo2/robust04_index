			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Rogachev] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 11 TASS -- Russia and the United States  have embarked on a new stage of cooperation in outer space.  During this stage interplanetary stations are to study the sun  and reach Pluto, the outermost known major planet of the solar  system. Scientific delegations on space exploration of the  United States and Russia discussed this bold idea and a number  of other projects for cooperation in the exploration of the  universe. Their meeting ended on Saturday.    Under the programme a U.S. probe will carry a Russian  optical  module to the sun. A complicated trajectory of the flight has  been charted. With the use of a highly-reliable Russian carrier  "Proton" the probe will be put on a trajectory of a flight to  Jupiter. When the probe is near Jupiter, the gravitation field  of the huge planet will turn it, and it will be directed to the  sun. Close to the sun, the Russian module will be separated and  will collect information about the solar atmosphere and surface.    Another joint flight is planned for the beginning of the  21st  century. It will be the flight to Pluto and its satellite  Charon. The main planets of the solar system, except for Pluto  and Charon, have already been studied by Russian and American  interplanetary stations. So the planned flight is of vast  scientific interest. During the flight the Russian probe will be  separated from the apparatus and will reach either Pluto or its  satellite. Experts believe much promise is offered by the idea  of using a U.S.-made small-size apparatus with new instruments  and a large-capacity Russian booster-rocket and a Russian-made  descendable probe meant for measurements in the atmosphere and  surface photography. Aside from other advantages, this  cooperation will make it possible to reach the remotest planet  of the solar system in less than ten years.    Exploration of Mars is planned to be continued. Two  spacecraft carrying Russian and American scientific equipment  are planned to be launched to Mars in 1998 and 2001.    Plans for cooperation in astronomy and astrophysics were  also  considered. Experts believe that spectro-roentgen-gamma project  will make it possible to create an orbital observatory to try  unravel space mysteries such as black holes, neutron stars,  pulsars, novas and supernovas and to study the universe. There  is also an interesting project for an orbital radio observatory,  Radioastron.    The final document of the meeting was signed by Wesley  Huntress, a chief of NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration, and Yuriy Milov, deputy general director of the  Russian Space Agency.</p>

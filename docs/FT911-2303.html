			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Beirut stirs cautiously beneath the ruins of 16 bloody years: Lara Marlowe wanders through the rubble and talks to some great survivors of a civil war that claimed 150,000 lives SIXTEEN years ago 27 Palestinians died at the hands of Christian Phalangist militiamen in the Beirut suburb of Ain El-Roumaneh. Since then, Lebanon's civil war has claimed 150,000 lives. Yet today, the utter despair of the 1989 and 1990 'Aoun wars' - when Christian leader General Michel Aoun attempted to take control of all of Lebanon - is gone, and most Lebanese say cautiously that they believe their civil war is over. Ships now queue up outside Beirut port to unload their cargo. Tens of thousands of Lebanese abroad have overwhelmed the rosters of Beirut schools with enrolments for next September. Families are reclaiming summer homes in the hills of Sofar, Aley and Chemlan, sometimes paying thousands of dollars to dislodge their militia inhabitants. Shops are being refurbished with chandeliers and marble facades. Well-to-do Moslems venturing for the first time in many years to the Vieux Quartier restaurant in Ashrafieh now comprise 20 per cent of the establishment's clientele. 'No one becomes president without passing through here,' Mr Rizkallah Akiki, the Vieux Quartier's maitre d'hotel, boasts. But if Lebanon's finest restaurant has survived, so have its ghosts. There is the table where President-elect, Mr Bashir Gemayel, sat with Mr Ariel Sharon - then Israeli defence minister - before Mr Gemayel's assassination in 1982. Mr Dany Chamoun, son of the late President Camille Chamoun, who was assassinated with his wife and sons last October, was an habitue. If you hold your restaurant bill to the light, you can still see a triangle inside a circle - the Phalangist symbol - blotted out. When President Elias Hrawi's government ordered the Phalange to pull out of Ashrafieh in December, the restaurant refused to continue paying the 5 per cent Phalangist militia tax. 'When the Christians were fighting the Christians last year, I knew the war had to end,' Mr Akiki says. 'We hit the bottom of the abyss. I know many people who died and it makes me sad. Why did it take 15 years? Why didn't this solution come sooner?' The solution is embodied in a fractious, 30-member cabinet officiating over the lurching but, none the less, real implementation of the October 1989 Taif peace accords. Mr Marwan Hamade, the minister of commerce, believes that the internal political reasons for the war no longer exist. 'Religious animosity has almost totally disappeared and has been replaced by power struggles within each community,' he said. 'Psychologically, the Lebanese are so exhausted that they have convinced themselves that whatever they have obtained from the war is enough.' He points out that economically, the country is incapable of generating a financial base to continue the war. 'The militias skimmed off everything there was to take. The Soviets won't send any more weapons to Jumblatt (the Druze leader). The Saudis won't give money to the Palestinians and the Israelis are not sending dollars to the Lebanese Forces (Phalange). Libya has stopped helping the extremists. The Iranians may still be helping the Hizbollah, but even their fervour has decreased - it's part of the general weariness,' he said. Many Lebanese believe the Gulf war helped their country. 'Because the Americans and the Syrians are close now, the Americans are putting real pressure on the Christian militias and the Syrians are putting pressure on the Moslems,' Mr Hamade said. President Hrawi's government is attempting to revive Lebanon's devastated economy. The European Community and Saudi Arabia have given at least Dollars 820m in aid and soft loans but a government study estimates the cost of reconstruction at Dollars 25bn. A quarter of Lebanon's 3.5m population emigrated to escape the war and a third of the remaining work force are unemployed. In recent years, Lebanon has suffered triple-digit inflation and the Lebanese pound has tumbled from 2.5 to the dollar in 1975, to a current rate of 940. The Lebanese government's priority has been to repair the electricity and water works destroyed in the 'Aoun wars'. Residents of Beirut now receive an average of six to 12 hours electricity each day as opposed to no electricity at all a year ago. Filling government coffers poses more of a challenge. Mr Hamade recently cut an annual Dollars 80m wheat subsidy which had encouraged Lebanese to smuggle wheat and flour abroad. Other measures include the updating of pre-devaluation customs duty. From yesterday - the latest deadline set for the disarming of all militias - the government claims it will control, and tax, all ports in Lebanon. It will also re-establish a tax on subsidised fuel, which accounted for nearly 20 per cent of government spending in 1989. Symbols of a renascent Lebanon are everywhere. Mrs Rima Shehadeh, a Sunni Moslem married to a Christian doctor, is one of the war's great survivors. For 15 years, she and her husband, Najib, clung to his family's 125-year old Ottoman stone mansion in the heart of west Beirut, moving from room to room depending on the direction of the artillery fire as the militias foughtacross their garden. Mrs Rima Shehadeh continued her interior design business, sometimes taking seven hours to cross on foot to east Beirut, a journey which now takes five minutes. When roads were closed she transported furniture for clients in vegetable carts. 'I always knew it was going to be worth it one day - if we survived physically,' Mrs Shehadeh says. This year, six Lebanese bankers have returned to Beirut and hired her to furnish their homes. A few months before her death from cancer last year, Mrs Leila El-Hoss, the wife of former prime minister Mr Selim El-Hoss and another Christian married to a Moslem, visited Rima Shehadeh's home. 'The house which is alive in a country which is dead,' she wrote in the guest book. Today that country appears to have been re-born.</p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Russia offers US arms sales deal RUSSIA is to propose to the US an 'arm sales for arms conversion' plan under which the west would grant Moscow access to its protected arms markets. The idea will be put forward next week by Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, in talks in Geneva with Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state. Mr Kozyrev, speaking to the Financial Times yesterday, said the west should go beyond providing credits, humanitarian aid and more support - 'though all of these are greatly valued' - to open up markets to weaponry and related technology. The Geneva meeting, scheduled for February 25, is the first between the two since Mr Christopher was appointed last month. Mr Kozyrev said he wanted to declare a 'fresh start' in US-Russian relations: 'We laid the foundations of a new relationship with the Bush administration, now it is important to implement these relationships in the field of conflict management, especially in Central Asia and in the Middle East, using extensively the UN Security Council.' In Mr Kozyrev's conception for new weapons markets, which he unveiled in part to the Russian parliament at the end of last week, the west would ensure that in the 'more than 100 countries' where arms trading was accepted and under no sanctions, contracts would be deliberately opened to Russian competition. Though he said no western government had openly excluded Russia from its arms markets, 'such issues are largely political,' and informal barriers had operated. In return, Russia would use the proceeds of the weapons sales 'not to boost the military industrial complex' but for civilian use, largely for conversion of military plants. 'I would say to the US and other western countries: consider as a political decision giving a place to Russia in these markets. This is the same as economic assistance, it is economic assistance. 'If we sell MiG-31s or Sukhoi-27s to someone, it is earned money and will be less humiliating for Russia. The money would be used for conversion, and (some of it) for consumer goods and new machinery. 'When the Soviet Union existed, billions were found for defence: this is a new challenge and it takes a new strategy and a new boldness; otherwise, the west will miss an historic opportunity'. Mr Kozyrev told the Russian parliament that Russia was taking part in the Abu Dhabi arms fair and was seeking contracts 'worth millions' at an event from which the Soviet Union had been excluded. However, he declared that he was concerned that some Russian arms suppliers were talking about the provision of systems 'up to and including strategic weapons'. Some of these arms suppliers were attempting to deal with countries against whom arms sanctions had been agreed, and it was only strong state control that could prevent a 'chaotic' spread of arms around the world. At the same time, only an agreement with the west to open up its markets could stop the impoverished Russians pursuing national self-interest. The former Soviet Union had been a major arms supplier, but to 'the wrong people', mainly its third world clients. 'I don't want to continue to supply the wrong people,' Mr Kozyrev added.</p>

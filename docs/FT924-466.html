			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Britons' hopes of cheap French cigarettes stubbed out BRITISH SMOKERS seeking bargain-priced cigarettes in the European single market next year will have to travel further afield than Calais or Boulogne. Savings on duty-paid cigarettes in France will be drastically reduced by the French National Assembly's agreement this week to a 30 per cent increase in tobacco prices within the next six months. The present retail price in France of international brands such as Rothmans or Marlboro is the equivalent of about Pounds 1.44p for 20, compared with Pounds 2.27p in the UK; representing a saving of slightly more than Pounds 33 on the 800 cigarettes that cross-Channel shoppers will be allowed to import for personal consumption. That is still less than half the savings that will be available to British holidaymakers on Spain's Costa Brava. With cigarettes priced at 42p for 20, they will pay Pounds 74 less than the UK price of Pounds 91 for 800. From January 18, however, French prices will be raised to Pounds 1.64 for 20, cutting the savings on 800 cigarettes to Pounds 25.20; a further price increase in May to Pounds 1.90 will reduce the savings to a mere Pounds 14.80. The French price increases, which have been welcomed by the country's health authorities, will raise FFr4.5bn (Pounds 540m) and reduce the social security budget deficit. The CGT trade union estimates that tobacco consumption will fall by up to 20 per cent and fears further job cuts. Seita, the state-owned cigarette manufacturer, has already announced the closure of three plants with the loss of 443 jobs since the introduction of curbs on tobacco advertising and smoking in public places.</p>

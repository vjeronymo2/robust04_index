			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> ZOO SEEKS ADVICE OF OUTSIDE CONSULTANT  </P> <P> Officials of the Santa Ana Zoo are seeking some outside advice as they look for  ways to improve the 38-year-old facility.  </P> <P> The Santa Ana City Council last week accepted a grant of $1,400 from the  Institute of Museum Services, a federal agency based in Washington.  </P> <P> The money will be used to hire a consultant for the zoo who will review  programs and provide some advice on long-range planning and in other areas,  said zoo director Claudia Collier.  </P> <P> "We heard about this program, and we thought it would be good to have someone  from the outside take a look at our operation and let us know where we can  improve," Collier said.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, the zoo, in the heart of Orange County at Prentice Park,  added to its displays two bald eagles, which Collier said have been a popular  attraction. There are also plans to build "Monkey Island," an  18,000-square-foot open-air exhibit that will feature the colobus monkey.  Officials hope to break ground on the project by the end of the year.  </P> <P> About 225,000 people visit the zoo each year. Collier said attendance is up 9%  from last year.  </P></p>

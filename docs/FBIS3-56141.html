			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Riga, Jan 12, BNS -- Latvian Prime Minister Valdis  Birkavs apologized to Russia for the Jan. 10 detention of two  Russian generals, speaking Tuesday [11 January] in the presence  of foreign diplomats and reporters in the Cabinet building.    Birkavs conceded that the incident harmed relations between  Latvia and Russia. Its authors were thoughtful enough to choose  the most advantageous moment for a provocation, taking into  account the coincidence of the Latvian-Russian withdrawal talks,  the NATO summit and President Bill Clinton's East European trip,  said Birkavs.    Latvia will do all it can to remove the incident's  consequences and avert similar misdeeds in the future, said the  premier.    Birkavs also acquainted the meeting with resolutions  approved  in last night's emergency session of the Latvian Cabinet.    The prime minister said that it was possible to  prognosticate  the incident but it was impossible to prevent it because of the  legislative drawbacks. Last night's resolutions at least allow  for the prosecution of the responsible persons, Birkavs said.    Latvian Foreign Minister Goergs Andrejevs said he hoped that  Russia would not draw a link between the incident and the  Latvian official policies.    Interior Minister Girts Kristovskis noted that Latvia's  military structures were "haphazardly arranged" because of  various historical and political circumstances. The National  Security Council finished to define rights and duties of armed  formations Monday, Kristovskis added.    The Russian response was "adequate to the status quo of  bilateral relations," said Birkavs. The Latvian Foreign Ministry  prepared an answer to the Russian Government on the yesterday's  conflict, Birkavs concluded.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report from north Caucasus by correspondent Andrey </F> Murtazin, including recording of remarks at news conference by  Ramazan Abdulatipov, deputy chairman of Russian Federation  Council -- from the "Novosti" newscast]    [Text] The situation in the Ossetian-Ingush conflict zone  is gradually stabilizing without any particular interference by,  and sometimes in spite of, the federal authorities. This was  the conclusion of Ramazan Abdulatipov, who recently visited the  northern Caucasus. The deputy chairman of the Federation  Council regards the main success of his mission as the agreement  signed in Beslan by the presidents of Northern Ossetia and  Ingushetia on the procedure for returning refugees and settling  them in four villages of Prigorodnyy rayon. It was there, two  years ago, that the Ossetian-Ingush conflict broke out, which  resulted in the death of over 300 people and in about 800 people  becoming refugees. In practice, Ruslan Aushev and Akhsarbek  Galazov guaranteed the safe return of the civilian population to  Prigorodnyy rayon and their living as close communities in the  villages of Chermen, Dachnoye, Dongaron, and Kurtat.    Abdulatipov said that the main problem now is the lack of  funds to build houses to replace those burned down. For  example, the republic has only received 800 million of the 90  billion roubles of capital investment planned for Ingushetia.  In order to extricate the rayon from the condition it has been  in since the war, there needs, at least, to be a clear policy on  the Caucasus which, unfortunately, is lacking at the moment.    [Abdulatipov] Policy itself, including and particularly  policy on the Caucasus, must be able to be assessed and  implemented stage by stage. Otherwise, we could go on for a  hundred years talking about this.</p>

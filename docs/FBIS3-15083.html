The orbiter will observe the sun's activity as part of the  joint Russian-Ukrainian Koronas-I project.    The project leader, member of the Russian Academy of  Sciences  Viktor Orayevskiy (director of the Institute of Earth Magnetism,  Ionosphere and Radio Wave Propagation, in Troitsk, Moscow  Region), emphasized that this was "the first cooperation project  between the Russian and Ukrainian Academies of Sciences after  the collapse of the USSR."    The orbiter will hopefully provide new insights into the  Earth-sun interaction, the sun corona and the impact the sun  activity makes on the Earth ionosphere.    Earlier space stations of this kind were named Interkosmos  and carried equipment supplied by the East European countries.    The station is expected to stay at least three years in  service.</p>

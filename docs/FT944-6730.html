			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (11): Soda ash leads to much more / Profile of ICI Pakistan Soon after arriving at Khewra, Mr Richard Banks decided that the salt mines of the Punjab would sustain a lucrative new offshoot for Imperial Chemical Industries, as the British group was then known. His 1929 excursion - overland to Marseilles, steamer to Bombay and train to Lahore - proved extremely worthwhile. The business, founded on soda ash, has grown into one of the company's most important overseas subsidiaries - boasting sales last year of Rs4.7bn. 'ICI had expansionist ideas and a number of us were selected to go foreign parts,' recalls Mr Banks, now aged 92. 'The company knew it would have to start manufacturing overseas, and it wanted to find the best sites.' By negotiating a deal to extract Khewra's salt free of tax, the ICI engineer enabled his employers to exploit cheap reserves of the basic material for soda ash, an important ingredient in products such as soap, paper and glass. He helped persuade the company to set up a manufacturing plant in what was to become Pakistan, a country where today it is a leading supplier of not just soda ash, but also polyester fibres, paints, agrochemicals and seeds, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and consumer products. Rising demand for those activities, with the exception of agrochemicals, helped lift pre-tax profits last year by 30 per cent to Rs639.5m. From its beginnings at Khewra, ICI Pakistan - in which the UK parent retains a 61 per cent holding - has become the fourth largest company on the Karachi stock exchange with fixed assets of Rs1.36bn and reserves of Rs128.6m. Mr Naseem Mirza, chairman and chief executive, says the company's strategy has not changed much since Mr Banks was dispatched from England. 'We want to grow aggressively where we have market strengths and step out into new areas.' As part of that vision, ICI Pakistan plans to spend Dollars 400m on building a chemicals plant to manufacture pure terephthalic acid, used in producing polyester fibre. The plant will have a capacity of 400,000 tonnes a year, and represents one of the country's largest-ever industrial investments. The company will also spend up to Rs4bn to expand its polyester stable fibre operations in Sheikhupura, increasing capacity by 50,000 tonnes a year, while investing a further Rs200m on a new power generation facility and Rs15m plant to manufacture calcium carbonate at Khewra. It is spending another Rs1bn to expand its soda ash capacity in Punjab by 50,000 tonnes a year, and is installing a new plant to manufacture 10,000 tonnes of sodium bicarbonate. By investing more than Rs3bn on expanding its businesses over the past 10 years, ICI Pakistan has emerged with considerable muscle in the increasingly important industrial lobby. Unlike smaller companies, it has no reservations about offering advice to the government on economic policy. In its last annual report, the company says the government must mobilise resources 'particularly to improve population control, health, education and infrastructure'. It also calls for the 'elimination of exemptions and concessions given in the past, which, according to some estimates amount to a staggering Rs18bn per annum in lost revenue'. Mr Mirza applauds government efforts to liberalise the economy and attract foreign investors, but he warns the Bhutto administration not to neglect the interests of its largest domestic companies. While welcoming the principle of tariff reductions, he adds: 'To suddenly dismantle the tariffs would be a disaster. All industry in Pakistan have been helped by (protection) barriers, so there must be help to adjust.' Before considering its latest round of investment - funded from borrowing and rights issues - the group also sought government assurances that fiscal policies would remain consistent. Mr Mirza, who has an armed guard outside his office in Karachi, wants the government to take action too on curbing violence in the city. 'This is the gateway to Pakistan and this is where everyone arrives first. We must get the law and order situation sorted out or it could create anxieties among new investors.' ICI Pakistan, however, has no such anxieties. As it prepares to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of soda ash production, Mr Mirza says it is here to stay. 'This is a good place to invest,' says the chairman. 'But as we have found out, you must have the right products and make sure that they can capture the market.'</p>

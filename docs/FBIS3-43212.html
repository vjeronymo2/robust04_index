			<p>SUMMARY                                 Recent high-level exchanges between China and Pakistan, including  a late December visit to Beijing by Pakistani Prime Minister  Benazir Bhutto, indicate that, despite its ongoing efforts to  improve relations with India, Beijing is continuing to expand its  bilateral relations with Pakistan, strengthening both economic  and military ties.                             END SUMMARY     The 27-29 December "official goodwill" visit to China by Prime  Minister Bhutto served to underscore Beijing's commitment to  Pakistan.  Meeting with Bhutto on 28 December, Premier Li Peng,  for example, reaffirmed the "importance" China attaches to its  "friendly and cooperative ties" with Pakistan (Xinhua, 28  December).  He went on to assure Bhutto of China's continued  friendship, stating that "whatever changes take place in the  world, China will remain Pakistan's trusted friend and continue  to develop good-neighborly ties" (Xinhua, 28 December 1993).  Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin also underscored Beijing's  commitment to Islamabad at his meeting with Bhutto on the 28th,  hailing the Sino-Pakistani relationship as having "stood the test  of time" as "an example" for "relations between countries with  different social systems" (Xinhua, 28 December 1993).     Focus on Economic Cooperation     Reflecting the continuing expansion of economic ties, the visit  was capped by the signing of five bilateral agreements, including  an agreement for economic and technological cooperation, an  accord extending the border trade agreement between the two  countries, road transport and water resource cooperative accords,  and an agreement to establish sister relations between Pakistan's  Punjab and China's Jiangsu provinces (Xinhua, 28 December 1993).  Calling for the further expansion of bilateral economic relations  Li, at his meeting with Bhutto, said that two countries should  "seek more ways," including more exchanges between enterprises  and setting up of more joint ventures, to "boost" their ties and  indicated that the Chinese Government was "encouraging" PRC  companies to "invest" in Pakistan (Xinhua, 28 December 1993).  During a five-day official visit to Pakistan earlier in December,  Politburo Standing Committee member Li Ruihuan had suggested that  Beijing may be planning to give more aid to Pakistan, noting in  an interview with the Pakistani press--carried by Xinhua on the  6th--that China "may provide more assistance" if China's economy  "develops at a faster pace" (Xinhua, 6 December 1993).     Military Cooperation     There are also signs that the two countries are continuing to  expand their military ties.  Reflecting this trend, Xinhua on 1  December reported that Gen. Zhang Wannian, Chief of the General  Staff of the PLA, and his host Pakistani Defense Minister Af tab  Shaban Mirani discussed the "mutual cooperation between the armed  forces" of the two countries during Zhang's visit.  In another  indication of their deepening military ties, the two sides also  signed an agreement during Zhang's visit granting Chinese  "credits" to Pakistan for the "procurement of defense equipment"  (Xinhua, 4 December 1993).

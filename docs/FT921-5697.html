			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Resignation of Lucas finance head 'a matter of personality and style' MR DAVID Hankinson, the finance director of Lucas Industries, resigned yesterday after personality clashes in the group's management team. The auto and aerospace components and applied technology group made a sparse announcement to the Stock Exchange, noting merely the resignation and promising a further statement on the appointment of Mr Hankinson's successor. The resignation has happened at a sensitive time for Lucas. Its interim figures are due at the end of the month and are expected to record break-even at best. Downturns in both the aerospace and vehicle markets have been met by a series of cost-cutting measures. The message Lucas was sending to the City last night was that the resignation would not affect its dividend policy. With the profit and loss account at break-even, the likelihood was that the interim dividend would be maintained at the 1990 and 1991 level of 2.1p. Against this background, Lucas was anxious to offer the reassurance that there was 'nothing sinister' in Mr Hankinson's resignation. What had happened 'can happen in any family or team', the group said. The resignation came 'as a matter of personality and style within the Lucas management team', the group added. Tensions in this team had evidently reached such a point that somebody had to go. The members of the team were Sir Anthony Gill, chairman and chief executive, Mr Tony Edwards, managing director of aerospace, Mr Bob Dale, managing director of automotive, Mr Brian Mason, personnel director and recently promoted to the board, Mr John Parnaby, managing director of applied technology, who is not on the board, and Mr Hankinson himself. But Mr Hankinson's departure follows a reshuffle of responsibilities. Sir Anthony's job is being split. He will remain as chairman, but Mr Edwards won the job of group managing director. Mr Hankinson, who is 52, has been finance director at Lucas for just short of three years. Previously he had been finance director at Chloride Group and at Rover Group, in each case for periods also of three years.</p>

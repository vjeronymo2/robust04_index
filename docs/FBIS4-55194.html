			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Speaking from the Office of the Slovak  Government Prime Minister, Jozef Moravcik has reacted to the  article in today's edition of REPUBLIKA. Our correspondent  Zuzana Stukovska conveyed what Moravcik said by telephone.    [Stukovska] I began this brief interview by reading the  eight-point program for cooperation between the present  government and the Hungarian coalition parties.    [Begin recording] [Moravcik] This is a very simple business.  We have agreed on the principle that would govern our  cooperation. We told each other what things we could tackle from  among the problems concerning national minorities. We expressed  all of this in the government's policy statement. This means  the content of our agreement has been reflected in the  government policy statement. Apart from the government's policy  statement there is nothing else that would bind us as far as  this business is concerned.    [Stukovska] Could one therefore say that the Hungarian  coalition has always been a certain factor that could tip the  scales and could it be said that this is also the case at  present? A question thus arises whether some of the information  published in REPUBLIKA is based on truth. One of the points of  the agreement says, for example, and I quote -- it is necessary  to halt the establishment of the so-called bilingual alternative  schools on the territory inhabited by Hungarians. Another point  says -- it envisaged that departments for minorities,  specifically for the Hungarian minority, will be established at  the ministries of education and culture. Minorities will be  able to develop their activities within these departments.    [Moravcik] Certain small organizational changes have been  made, but this is on the whole in keeping with what we want to  do in the field of education and culture and here I see no  problem. This has involved a small organizational change  designed to facilitate the work of both ministries. To impart  other dimension to it would therefore appear to me to be very  strange, almost ludicrous, I would say.    [Stukovska] What do you think of the fact that the article  has appeared precisely at this time?    [Moravcik] I do not attach a great deal of importance to  what  is published in the daily REPUBLIKA. I am used to seeing  published in this daily heaps of insults, unsubstantiated  reports, and various claims which are far from the truth.    [Stukovska] Moreover, in this instance too, the article has  been reprinted from the Hungarian press and specifically from  NEPSZABADSAG.    [Moravcik] Regarding the specifics of the article, I have  explained to you that at present there does not exist anything  apart from the government policy statement, which forms the  basic platform also for our relations with Hungarian political  parties, that would be binding for us.    [Stukovska] Have there been on the part of representatives  of  the Hungarian parties any demands for something different, that  would go beyond the government's policy statement?    [Moravcik] This applies in general. We have agreed we shall  exert a maximum possible effort in order to implement what has  been expressed in the policy statement. This will suffice for  the current period. There has been enough of this.    [Stukovska] Does this mean there have been no demands on the  part of Hungarian parties?    [Moravcik] No, no such demands have been presented and we do  not expect them. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Austrians set to see off foreign bank bid: Establishment in position to win large minority stake in Creditanstalt-Bankverein Austria's Conservative establishment looks set to prevent Creditanstalt-Bankverein from falling into foreign hands with its Sch7.2bn (Dollars 622m) bid for a large minority stake in the country's second largest bank. Mr Ferdinand Lacina, the Austrian finance minister, has promised to decide 'before summer' on completing the privatisation of the venerable bank, choosing between the consortium's bid and one by CS Holding, the financial group built around Credit Suisse. The government still holds 49 per cent of Creditanstalt's capital, 70 per cent of the voting power. Mr Lacina, a Socialist, has made no secret of his preference for CS Holding, even after the consortium's bid, saying Creditanstalt needs a strong strategic partner. But he would put the Socialist-Conservative coalition that has long shared political and economic power in Austria under severe strain if he dismissed such a large assembly of leading Conservatives. And at a time when the country is facing a referendum on joining the European Union and a national election, neither side has any interest in emphasising internal tensions. The consortium is led by EA Generali, an insurance company that is controlled in Italy but has its roots in the Austro-Hungarian empire, and by First Austrian, the large Vienna-based savings bank group. They are backed by 18 blue chip industrial companies, including crystal makers Swarovski, the motor group Porsche, the dominant brewery group Brau-Union and the building materials group Radex. Several prominent families, such as the Mayr-Melnhofs, owners of a large paper group, have put their personal prestige and money behind the offer. Moreover, by offering the going market price for half the government's shares and undertaking to back a secondary offering in the markets for the rest, the consortium has shown that it is not trying to win the bank on the cheap by playing the nationalist card. The reasons for this strong rallying of all the Conservative forces are not just political. Three years ago, the Conservatives watched helplessly as the Socialists snatched the banking industry lead from Creditanstalt by having their large Vienna savings bank group, Zentralsparkasse, take over the troubled Landerbank to create Bank Austria. Then, two months ago, Bank Austria lost patience with the Conservatives' dithering over restructuring the ownership of GiroCredit, the savings banks' central clearing organisation, and snapped it up with a knock-out bid. The result is that Bank Austria controls directly or indirectly about 60 per cent of all banking business done in the country. Meanwhile, Creditanstalt has been paralysed because of Mr Lacina's hesitation in completing its privatisation. Early this month, Mr Rainer Gut, chairman of CS, confirmed that his group was interested and Mr Lacina made clear that he would welcome a CS bid. But then Mr Gut gave a remarkably candid outline of his group's thinking to the leading Austrian news magazine, Wirtschaftswoche. Initially, CS would take a 20 to 30 per cent stake, but it would insist on first refusal of the rest of the finance ministry's shares and ultimately hoped to buy 100 per cent. Creditanstalt would retain its identity, but would adhere to CS group strategies. More important, he said CS would 'de-politicise' it. If that happened, the Conservatives would no longer have a flagship commercial bank to share the spoils of government and government influenced business. And that would further weaken the Austrian People's Party, already the minority partner in the governing coalition. Mr Lacina and other Socialists might not be disappointed if that happened, but they can hardly be surprised that the Conservatives are fighting back so vigorously.</p>

			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIALTY BOOKSTORES OFFER A DIFFERENT STORY FOR READERS;  </P> <P> LITERATURE: FROM MYSTERIES TO SCIENCE FICTION TO CHINESE-LANGUAGE BOOKS, IT  SEEMS THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY HAS SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE.  </P> <P> A lone female figure stepped onto the sidewalk, pausing to adjust her cargo of  terror: some $40 worth of suspense, mystery and horror books.  </P> <P> Armed with enough mystery treats to last through many a dark night -- "Strega"  "Rod Serling's Night Gallery Reader," "Silver Scream" and "Scare Care" -- she  moved briskly toward a waiting car.  </P> <P> Mary De Louise needn't have scurried away from her midday caper, however. Even  after her expedition to BOOK'em Mysteries, the San Gabriel Valley's newest  specialty bookstore, De Louise still had 15 minutes before she was due back on  the job at Balk's Hardware and Garden Supplies.  </P> <P> As she headed back to the workaday world, De Louise, 24, reflected on her  lunch-hour spree.  </P> <P> "I'm excited," she said. "I've never found any other place that has such a good  selection."  </P> <P> Avid readers seeking their favorite volumes have a wealth of choices in the  world of San Gabriel Valley specialty bookstores.  </P> <P> BOOK'em, which opened in South Pasadena on Oct. 5, joined a select group of  local booksellers offering tomes on everything from African-American art to  zoology.  </P> <P> Old Pasadena has the sci-fi offerings of Planet 10, and Claremont boasts  Recess, a children's bookstore featuring a little red schoolhouse for playtime.  Also in Claremont is Wild Iris, specializing in books by and about women.  </P> <P> In Covina, Pathfinder caters to devotees of Christian books, and virtually all  the books at Evergreen in Monterey Park are in Chinese. Altadena is home to the  Black and Latino Bookstore.  </P> <P> Mitchell Books, one of the oldest bookstores in Pasadena, specializes in  out-of-print and rare collections of detective and mystery novels.  </P> <P> Barry Martin, a former television producer who co-owns BOOK'em Mysteries with  Mary Riley, a Monrovia teacher, said he joined the ranks of specialty  booksellers because he was "tired of the rat race."  </P> <P> "I had always harbored this secret desire to open a bookstore and have my own  kind of venture," he said. "And being a lover of mysteries and thrillers I  decided that this was the kind of genre that we wanted to deal with."  </P> <P> BOOK'em's exposed brick wall is decorated with FBI wanted posters and a pair of  broken handcuffs supplied by the South Pasadena Police Department.  </P> <P> Its volumes are divided into separate sections, including Mysteries, Thriller,  Horror/Occult, True Crime, Suspense and Vintage.  </P> <P> Even representatives of large general bookstores believe that the profusion of  smaller, specialty establishments helps the industry.  </P> <P> "The stronger the independent bookstores are, the stronger the business  becomes," said Karen Watkins, a manager at Vroman's, in Pasadena.  </P> <P> Here are a few of the notable specialty bookstores in the San Gabriel Valley:  </P> <P> Black and Latino Bookstore  </P> <P> 1920 N.

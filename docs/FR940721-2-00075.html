Next, the housing management process begins, encompassing orientation, execution of the lease, move-in, occupancy and lease compliance. The Task Force addressed the following topics within the housing management process; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Guiding Principles for the housing management process; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The lease; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Preventing and addressing lease violations; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Unit transfers; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Retention of housing during hospitalization or residential treatment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Chapter 3_Evictions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Eviction from public or assisted housing is a very serious sanction; it not only displaces the resident, it also discontinues the subsidy that makes housing affordable to that resident. Eviction is nonetheless occasionally necessary. Experience shows that some individuals are not willing to meet the essential obligations of tenancy and must be removed in order to preserve the viability of the housing development. Given the shortage of public and assisted housing, and the difficulty of preserving this housing, the Task force also stresses the need to remove those whose conduct is destructive to the development. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An equitable eviction policy will authorize the eviction, in appropriate circumstances, of those residents whose conduct violates essential provisions of the lease, those whose conduct repeatedly violates minor provisions of the lease, and those who allow others to do so. The Task Force reviews the proper use of eviction as focusing generally on whether and how seriously the conduct in question adversely affects the housing community. In addition, the Task Force recommends that except as noted, the status, regulations, handbooks and lease provisions regarding eviction not be changed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The report addresses the following topics: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Alternatives to eviction; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Alternatives after eviction, to prevent homelessness; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Notices; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Drug abuse and drug related crime; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Criminal activity as grounds for eviction; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Former users of illegal drugs; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Fraud; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Minor crimes and off-premises criminal activity; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Public housing grievance procedure; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Residents' liability for the actions of others; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Consideration of all the facts and circumstances; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Criminal activity prior to admission; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Subsidy termination_certificate and voucher programs; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Subsidy termination_assisted housing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Chapter 4_Reasonable Accommodations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Reasonable accommodation is a creative, challenging and evolving area of disability law and practice, affecting every aspect of admissions, occupancy and evictions. The Task Force believes that, despite many uncertainties as to what is required by law, it is possible to craft sound, basic, reasonable accommodation policies and procedures which will satisfy the intent of the law without subjecting either persons with disabilities or housing providers to unintended burdens. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This chapter tackles a wide range of reasonable accommodations issues with the intention of providing guidance on the procedural elements essential to achieving compliance. Specifically, the chapter is organized as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Regulatory and case-law references that provide background on the concept of reasonable accommodation followed by brief discussion of program accessibility requirements (the self-evaluation and transition plan); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Discussion of a definition of reasonable accommodation; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Statement of principles applicable to reasonable accommodations, drawn from current law and regulation and describing both affirmative requirements and the regulatory limits placed on the implementation of the concept; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Examination of the regulatory limits that apply to accommodations (undue burdens and fundamental alterations); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Recommendations on effective implementation of reasonable accommodations;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

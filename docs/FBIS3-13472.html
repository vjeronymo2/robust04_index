Shahin] </F>   [Text] Amman--Islamists, and pan-Arab nationalists, long at  loggerheads, are unifying their ranks following last month's  attack on the Ibrahimi mosque in Hebron and the subsequent  attack on a Maronite church in Lebanon.    "The February events were not the only reason why the front,  which is a coalition of two parties, was formed but it was the  final push," said the head of the powerful Islamic Action Front  (IAF), Dr. Ishaq al-Farhan.    Earlier this week the IAF and a relatively new and obscure  political party, the National Action Front (NAF), announced that  they were "`coalition partners' resisting Zionist designs and  new world order strategies to disrupt the Middle Eastern  region." The NAF comprises mostly hardline pan-Arab  nationalists many of whom were outlawed in Jordan before  democratic reforms were introduced.    "One of our main aims," said Mr. al-Farhan, "is to make  clear  that there is no real contradiction between Islam and the  essence of Western civilisation. These are superficial  differences which are being played up by those who think they  will benefit from a confrontation."    "There is an obvious effort to blacken the face of the Arabs  and the Muslims in the world and our coalition aims at fighting  this campaign of hatred against Islam and the Arab people," he  added.    The coalition is open "to all those parties and groups which  wish to join," said an IAF member Thursday. While no clear  "strategies" to counter the "anti-Islamic and Arab propaganda"  had been drawn up as of yet, "preparatory meetings were" in the  making, according to IAF officials.    None of the NAF officials could be reached for comment.    The coalition joins the mostly secular pan-Arab activists  and  the largest Islamic party in Jordan. A source close to the  groups said that the recent attempts to smudge the "image of  Arabs in the West" had contributed to the formation of the  coalition.    "The World Trade Center affair, the unfair treatment of the  accused and the verdict against them was one of the main points  of concern, but this is one of many anti-Arab smear campaigns  that we want to counter," said the source.    The charge that two Libyans blew up a Pan-Am airliner over  Lockerbie, Scotland, the continued sanctions against Iraq, the  "media campaigns" against Arab and Muslim governments in Sudan  and Somalia, as well as recent moves by the French authorities  to curb the movement of Arabs living in France were all  mentioned as international issues that led to the forming of the  coalition, said the source close to the NAF. The NAF was the  21st party to receive official licensing in Jordan this January.</p>

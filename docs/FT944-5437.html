			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Tory faithful toast Ribena Kid: A party to mark Portillo's 10 years as an MP It was billed as the biggest Conservative party celebration since the election victory more than two years ago. More than 560 of the party faithful braved a protest against the Criminal Justice Bill and a tight cordon of policemen and cameramen around London's Alexandra Palace yesterday to join in the fun marking Mr Michael Portillo's 10th year as MP for Enfield Southgate. The loyal friends and members of Mr Portillo's constituency party had paid Pounds 30 a head for the black tie dinner and dance. A video film devoted to the life and times of the employment secretary was to be the highlight of the evening, although there were rumours last night that it had fallen victim to a bout of ministerial modesty. The video had been expected to chart his rise from an early appearance as a 'Ribena Kid' in television commercials, to his anti-Brussels speech at this year's Tory party conference. Some guests said they were there for the Christmas party of the Enfield and Southgate Conservative Association. Others admitted Mr Portillo was the real cause for celebration. Party-goer Dr Dennis Singh was one of a 20-strong contingent from Finchley, Baroness Thatcher's former constituency. 'We have come to crown the Crown Prince,' he said. 'He's an honest, sincere man and he is Thatcherite to the core, as I am. Michael Portillo will be the next prime minister.' Constituency officials, who spent several months preparing the black-tie affair, described the party as a 'fund-raising event'. Local businessmen were courted for their financial support and even sponsorship of the event, which featured an after-dinner speech by former television presenter Mr Gyles Brandreth, who is MP for Chester. Less sympathetic observers had suggested the party could become a campaign rally for the 41-year-old minister, who has been tipped as a future Tory leader. They compared last night's extravaganza to the low-key events held by other MPs. Mr John Major's 10th anniversary as MP for Huntingdon in 1989 was marked by a small party and the gift of a silver salver. Mr Jeremy Lucas from Colchester rejected suggestions that Pounds 30 was too high a price to pay for a sight of Mr Portillo. 'Unlike the Labour party two years ago, which charged Pounds 500 a ticket for a party event and made it very elitist, we have been charged just Pounds 30 a head which seems very reasonable.' The organisers had planned a surprise party for the minister. But in August, the Enfield and Southgate Conservative Association was aghast to find that details had leaked to the press.

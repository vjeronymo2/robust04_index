			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Politicians in Brazil to state wealth BRAZIL'S mounting corruption scandal yesterday claimed its most senior political figure when Mr Ibsen Pinheiro was forced to resign from the country's constitutional revision team, writes Angus Foster in Sao Paulo. President Itamar Franco also tried to restore credibility of the country's institutions yesterday by ordering that anyone in an elected or official post should reveal property and income before taking the job. The measure, which also applies to acting members of the executive, congress and judiciary, is the first time many elected and government officials will be open to scrutiny. The law is expected to come into effect soon. Mr Pinheiro, former president of Brazil's lower house of deputies and a leader of the country's biggest political party, the Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement (PMDB), has denied any involvement in the corruption scheme. The scandal is alleged to have involved up to 30 politicians and ministers in illegal fees and other payments from the government's budget.</p>

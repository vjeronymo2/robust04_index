			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Vladimir Mikh in Moscow and David Hess in Taipei] </F>   [Text] Taipei, March 22 (CNA) -- Mikhail Sergaivich  Gorbachev was the first, last and only leader of the Soviet  Union to get out of that job alive, so no one had an idea what  former Soviet leaders do in retirement. He answered his own  question by establishing the Gorbachev Fund in 1991. The fund  absorbs the millions of dollars Gorbachev earns speaking and  attending conferences, and through its activities paints a  profile of his interests and concerns.    As the Soviet Union and Gorbachev's political power crumbled  in late 1991, the international socio-economic and political  fund, better known as the Gorbachev Fund, was formed from two  other institutes: the Economic and Social Reforms Fund, headed  by Stanislav Shatalin, a well-known economist, and the Foreign  Policy Association, led by Eduard Shevarnadze, former Soviet  foreign minister.    The structure of the new fund was streamlined to concentrate  on two key areas of studies -- Russia and the Commonwealth of  Independent States (CIS) and the future of civilization, which  includes issues concerning Russia's return to Europe, the  problems of transforming formerly totalitarian societies, and  international paths to democracy.    Much of the focus is on domestic affairs, and the typical  bread-and-butter reports are devoted to general topics, like the  questionable results of "shock therapy" to establish free  markets in Russia, the deplorable state of the CIS, the  instruments of achieving social stability, and even the crisis  of traditional values and the chances for Russian liberalism.    With so much criticism of the status quo, it is no wonder  that Russian President Boris Yeltsin has felt the heat and  attacked the fund. Still, the fund denies it is deliberately  antagonistic.    "The spirit of confrontation is alien to the fund.  Everything that is being done is aimed at promoting the higher  national interests of Russia", Grigory Revenko, deputy president  of the fund said during an interview with CNA. However, he did  not deny that some of Gorbachev's remarks might sound like  bitter criticism to Yeltsin.    Revenko said all reports and papers from the fund are sent  to  government offices. "We consider it to be our noble duty,"  Revenko said, tacitly admitting the fund gets little in response  for its work.    The new institute was originally supported by the income  from  several buildings, most notably a hotel on the prestigious  Leningradskaya Prospect, which also houses the institute. But  the hotel and other sources of funding later became enmeshed in  a battle which threatened the fund's survival.    On Oct. 7th, 1992, Gorbachev refused for the second time to  appear as a witness at the hearings of the Constitutional Court  probing the "Communist Party Case." The case sought incidents  of criminal behavior in the Communist Party, which Gorbachev  headed as chairman. He refused to testify on the basis of  presidential immunity. In retaliation, President Yeltsin issued  a decree depriving the fund of all of its buildings, including  the hotel which provided the fund with its necessary financial  independence.    The next day, police picketed the building and barred  entrance to all employees with the exception of Gorbachev's  private secretary and a group of his closest aides.    Subsequently, President Yeltsin allowed the fund to lease  one  thousand square meters of the hotel building, almost two floors.  This space accommodates the fund's 130 staff members. Last  year,the fund paid 200 million rubles (US$125,000) rent.    Today, the Gorbachev Fund draws its finances from voluntary  donations from individuals and private companies, and from the  royalties and fees given to Gorbachev personally for his  lecture- tours, such as here in Taiwan, articles published in  the press and TV talk-shows and radio seminars.    "The very name Gorbachev remains, along with oil and the  space program, one of the most marketable values left in our  country," the pro-Yeltsin liberal daily IZVESTIA admitted in  1992.    Making profits is not a policy of this think-tank, Revenko,  who is also a close aide to Gorbachev, noted in his interview  with CNA. Money is still a matter of survival for the fund.  "The average pay of our staff is half that of government  clerks," he said.    And yet, a large part of the fund's activities amount to  charity and sponsorship of Russian art and culture.    The key project of the fund is focused on saving children  with leukemia. More than one million US dollars, collected  partially through donations, have been given to a Moscow clinic  for children suffering from leukemia. The donation allowed the  medical center to acquire sophisticated equipment that has  boosted the children's recovery rate to one of the best in the  world.    The Gorbachev Fund has also provided grants for other  medical  institutions in the city of Bryansk and in the Stavropol region.    The Gorbachev Fund has also given financial support to the  children's fund, founded by the Russian film director Rolan  Bykov; to the popular literary magazine "THE NEW WORLD;" and to  the publishing house producing the collective works of the  famous Russian philosopher Vladimir Vernadsky.    The fund's list of projects seems endless. It sponsored a TV  program "The Green Lamp;" and launched, in cooperation with the  fund in support of art, a monthly magazine "VIA REGIA." It  sponsors training of young Russian talent in foreign  universities.    In Moscow, the fund conducts classes for school teachers of  the northern district of Moscow, and at one time, it tutored  young specialists in political science, introducing them to the  problem of conflict management and public speaking.    Still, with all of these activities, the center of the  Gorbachev Fund remains Mikhail Sergaivich Gorbachev -- his  lectures and speeches, his conferences and his TV appearances.  This first visit to Taiwan is a part of the fund's ever  expanding concern.    "The fund is keen to establish fruitful relationships with  similar foreign funds and with research centers abroad. First  contacts with such institutions in South Korea and Taiwan were  made, and we are optimistic," Revenko told CNA.    CNA asked Revenko if there was a central set of principles  that drew together the many activities of the Gorbachev Fund.  "We continue to preach and practice the ideals to which we  pledged loyalty back in 1985, we still believe in  democratization, freedom of economic activity and glasnost."  Glasnost is the Russian word for openness and accountability,  applicable to how the triangle of government mass media and the  general public interreact.</p>

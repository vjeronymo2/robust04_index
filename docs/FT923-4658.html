			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / China's 'tired' finance minister is replaced WANG Bingqian, China's finance minister, who presided over a widening budget deficit as Beijing sought to keep sagging state industries afloat, resigned yesterday after 11 years in office, Reuter reports from Beijing. The official Xinhua news agency said Mr Wang, 67, would retain his position as a state councillor, or member of China's cabinet. The standing committee of China's rubber-stamp parliament approved his resignation, and named former vice finance minister Liu Zhongli, 57, to replace him. Senior leader Deng Xiaoping, 88, has stepped up his calls for China's old guard to step aside in favour of younger officials since he launched his latest drive for faster economic reform in January. Mr Wang was known for frank assessments of China's financial situation. From the late 1980s he repeatedly warned of the dangers inherent in funnelling billions of dollars in subsidies into inefficient state industries to preserve their role as the backbone of China's socialist economy. In his report to parliament in March, he effectively admitted that efforts to shake up state enterprises were floundering when he set the 1992 budget deficit target at Yuan20.78bn (Pounds 1.9bn). In 1991, the deficit hit Yn20.26bn, overshooting the target by Yn7.92bn. Mr Wang attributed the 1991 overrun to 'loose management, expenses for over-staffed departments, sightseeing and banquets with public funds, too many subsidies and bonuses.' He has said he sees little hope of improvement this year. China's budget deficit would be Yn58b (Pounds 5.3bn) higher under standard international measurements, which count foreign and domestic debt on the deficit side. While Wang's analysis of China's financial problems may have won him few friends in the huge state sector, it is unlikely political problems were behind his resignation, according to political analysts. Xinhua hinted he was simply tired of the job. Little is known of his replacement. Mr Liu served as vice-minister of finance in the mid-1980s and became deputy secretary-general of the State Council in 1990. The committee also removed railways minister Li Senmao, 63, 'for reasons of ill health', Xinhua said. His reign over the nation's rail transport system has seen it struggle to keep up with the demands of China's accelerating economic growth. His replacement, Han Zhubin, 60, is a long-time official in China's railways administration.</p>

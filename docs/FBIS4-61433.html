			<p>BFN     [Text] All the border violating ships which were revealed  by the naval division of the North-Eastern frontier district in  the course of the first stage of the operation Putina-94 were  Russian ones, deputy chief of the division headquarters Sergey  Sergeyev told INTERFAX.    The aim of the operation Putina-94 which was started on  April  20 is to combat illegal fishery in the Far East.    As Sergeyev said, the frontier guards have inspected 22  ships, 12 of them were Russians, eight crafts belonged to Japan,  two to North Korea. "The frontier guards exposed seven  violating ships which were sailing under the Russian flag,"  noted Sergeyev. Penalties were imposed on five ships for  violations in filling in their fishery journals and three of  them for polluting of the sea.    As many as two ships, the Sakhalin floating base  Konstitutsiya SSSR and the Primorsk transport ship Subaru,  violated the customs rules. An investigation is to be continued  on land.    In addition, the frontier guards were forced to chase one  ship, the Nakhodka trawler Stal which disobeyed the order to  stop. When the inspection group came aboard the trawler, it  failed to find any violations. "It was just instinct on the  part of the Stal's captain -- if you are chased, then run away.  He received a warning from the frontier guards," said Sergeyev.    In general as many as 20 Russian and four foreign ships were  caught in the course of the Putina-94 operation, Commander of  the Pacific Frontier District Major General Vitaliy Sedykh  declared at a press conference devoted to the conclusion of the  first stage of the operation and staged on Friday in Vladivostok.    According to Sedykh, as many as 700 ships were found in  Russia's economic zone, including more than 200 foreign ships.  The frontier guards have inspected more than 100 Russian and 20  foreign ships which appeared to be Japanese fishing boats. The  captains of three fishing boats made violations in compiling  permission cards for the fishery of sea products in the Russian  economic zone and were deprived of them.    On April 22 a Japanese fishing boat Elyu-Maru-86 violated  the  rules near the Southern Kurils by not passing one of the  checking points. A penalty of 15,385 dollars was imposed on the  crew.    Ships assigned to the Pacific Fleet, fish protection bodies  Primorrybvoda and Sakhrybvoda, employees of the Federal  Counterintelligence Service and of the Far Eastern Customs  Department participated in the operation along with the frontier  guards of the Pacific frontier district.    Tracking devices to monitor the situation in this region  were  used in this operation.</p>

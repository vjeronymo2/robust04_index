			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: Strong backing for global concept - International The Asian Development Bank's announcement last week that it intends to raise one-quarter of its Dollars 2.8bn borrowing programme for fiscal 1994 through its first offering of global bonds is a huge publicity coup for the investment banks which have been actively promoting the global bond concept. The ADB's endorsement of the global bond market is all the more significant because of its close identification with the dragon bond market, which it helped to set up more than three years ago in an effort to develop the capital markets in Asia. By their very nature, the dragon bond and global bond markets appear to be mutually exclusive. Dragon bonds are targeted at non-Japanese investors in Asia but global bonds are designed to be sold to investors across the world at a single world price. More importantly, perhaps, investors associate the global bond market with liquidity and 24-hour trading, qualities which the dragon bond market has not yet achieved since the issues to date have been relatively small and infrequent. But by deciding to go global, the ADB has effectively thrown its weight behind those who believe the trend towards a global capital market is irreversible and that over time, regional markets will become redundant. Global bonds have come a long way since the World Bank launched the first issue in 1989 as part of its successful drive to bring the yield spreads on its bonds down to levels enjoyed by US federal agencies. Global bonds can now be issued in a wide range of currencies and maturities and appear to have retained their liquidity in the secondary market to a greater degree than Eurobond issues of similar sizes. Several sovereign issuers, notably Italy, have issued global bonds in order to access the large pool of domestic investors in the US at about half the cost of issuing bonds in the Yankee market - the US domestic bond market for foreign issuers. The reduction in fees has come about as a result of flexibility on the part of the US Securities and Exchange Commission in order to encourage more borrowers to make shelf registrations. Borrowers now only have to pay fees on the bonds which have been sold into the US and on the lead managers' estimates on what proportion of the whole issue will flow back into the US. 'Many issuers now have to ask themselves why they are not issuing global bonds,' says Mr David Karat, managing director at Salomon Brothers, one of the earliest promoters of the global bond market. Indeed, an increasing number of familiar names in the Eurobond market are queueing to tap the global bond market. L-Bank, the recently re-named LKB Baden-Wurttemberg, is about to embark on an international roadshow to gauge investor interest in a global bond offering denominated either in dollars or D-Marks. Ms Gertraud Foos-Olsson, deputy director of L-Bank's international funding division, says that, depending on market conditions, L-Bank could raise Dollars 1.5bn to Dollars 2bn or the equivalent in D-Marks in the global bond market by the second week in March. 'Our funding strategy is to offer investors big, liquid issues,' says Ms Foos-Olsson. She adds that the global bond market makes sense for frequent issuers - L-Bank intends to raise Dollars 10bn this year compared with Dollars 6.7bn last year - since they can often get better pricing than in the Eurobond market. Officials at Salomon Brothers say the next stage in the global bond market's development is to open up to a wider range of issuers, a move which has not been welcomed by syndicate managers who would prefer to preserve the global bond market's exclusivity. 'One would not want to bastardise the concept,' says one syndicate manager. Nevertheless, the successful global bond offering by Argentina late last year has encouraged other emerging market issuers to take the plunge. Turkey and Hungary have both announced their intention to tap the global bond market in the near future. Indeed, investors might be more inclined to buy paper issued by sub-investment grade credits if they are in the form of liquid, global bonds because of the greater likelihood that trading in the bonds will not dry up in the secondary market. At the same time, there are moves to try to reduce the market's perceived minimum size for a successful global bond offering from Dollars 1bn to around Dollars 500m. This would enable issuers with smaller borrowing requirements to take advantage of the lower funding costs offered by the global bond market.</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: New trust has eyes set on European smaller companies Providence Capitol and James Capel are launching an indexed investment trust specialising in European smaller companies. The Fairbairn European Smaller Companies Index Trust has already raised Pounds 47m and is seeking to increase this to up to Pounds 65m via an offer for subscription. The trust will track the James Capel European Smaller Companies Index, which covers 17 countries from Austria to Turkey and includes 1,000 stocks. Providence Capitol, as investment manager, will buy a portfolio of 350 securities selected by James Capel to replicate the performance of the index. This is the first in a series of indexed investment trusts which Providence Capitol hopes to launch. The managers believe that this is a good time to buy European smaller companies. In both the US and the UK, smaller company shares have recently outperformed their larger brethren as economies have shown signs of recovery. In Europe, smaller companies have underperformed since the start of 1991 as continental economies moved into recession. With interest rates falling, European economies should recover and smaller company shares start to outperform. Shares are being offered at 100p, with a minimum investment of Pounds 2,000. The trust will have a seven year life which can be extended at the shareholder's option. The trust qualifies for personal equity plan status although no specific plan is linked to it.</p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Jury convicts Virani of BCCI fraud Mr Nazmudin Virani, the former property entrepreneur, was convicted at the Old Bailey yesterday of seven counts of fraud relating to his business dealings with the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International. The jury found Mr Virani guilty on one count of false accounting and six of furnishing false information to Price Waterhouse, the BCCI auditors, in order to help artificially boost the bank's profits by about Pounds 11m. Mr Virani will be sentenced on May 11. However, concern he might abscond led the judge to refuse bail and order him to be remanded in custody. Mr Justice Hutchison warned Mr Virani that the offences of which he had been convicted were sufficiently serious that a prison sentence 'appears inevitable'. The charges carry a maximum term of seven years' imprisonment. The conviction marks the third successful prosecution for the Serious Fraud Office over the BCCI scandal. Mr Syed Ali Akbar, a former head of BCCI's treasury division, and Mr Mohammed Baqi, a former head of Attock Oil, a company owned by BCCI, have already been convicted after the SFO's investigation. The jury acquitted Mr Virani on single charges of conspiracy to defraud, theft and furnishing false information. It was unable to reach verdicts on a further four counts of furnishing false information. These charges will not now be proceeded with. At the heart of the fraud committed by Mr Virani was what the prosecution described as a 'you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours' relationship with Mr Mohammed Haque, the head of BCCI's property division, who fled to Pakistan. As BCCI's financial troubles deepened in the late 1980s, Mr Virani signed a series of bogus audit confirmations which misled the auditors and inflated the bank's profits. In return, BCCI gave Mr Virani cash payments totalling Pounds 1.6m and played a substantial role in the expansion of Control Securities, the property company Mr Virani headed from 1985 until his arrest. Mr Virani's conviction ends a meteoric business career which began after he was expelled from Uganda in 1972 by President Idi Amin. The growth of the Virani Group property empire and his stewardship of Control Securities were two successes that led to his being named Asian businessman of the year in 1990.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Political Talk" column by Shih Chun-yu (2457 0689 3768): </F> "Common Interest Is the Crux of Sino-U.S. Relations"]    [Text]China and United the States Are Still  Deadlocked on the Human Rights Issue    After winding up his trip to Beijing, U.S. Secretary of  State  Warren Christopher left Beijing to visit Russia. During his  short visit to China, Christopher again applied pressure on the  human rights issue, but China remained tough. Will the United  States "wield" the "magic wand" of denying China most-favored  nation [MFN] status? It seems unlikely, or we can say that both  parties will always set store by their common interests and not  come to a rupture.    Chinese leaders have pointed out on many occasions:  Sino-U.S. relations have never been based on common ideology  and values, but on common interests. This is a pertinent  remark. Since Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger visited China  more than two decades ago, and since the 4 June incident, there  have been frequent "cold wars" in Sino-U.S. relations, but never  have they fallen out with each other. In the final analysis,  this is because the common interests of the two countries, which  still servs as a basis, have never changed.    Although the two countries have differing views on the human  rights issue, China is still ready to discuss it with the United  States on the basis of equality in order to increase  understanding. It is known to everyone that China gradually is  improving human rights, but the United States has no reason  whatsoever to pressure China into accepting a U.S.-style concept  of human rights.  <H3>  A Japanese Newspaper Attacks the United States for Applying  Pressure on China </H3>   ASAHI SHIMBUN carried an editorial on 15 March. From some of  its unbiased remarks on this issue, it is not difficult to see  where the rights and wrongs lie. The paper says: "Japan is  very much concerned about what China will become. China is now  Japan's second-largest trading partner, while Japan is China's  largest. If China is thrown into chaos, Japan will be  tremendously affected. Therefore, Japan does not want to see a  deterioration of relations between China and the United States,  both of which are nations friendly to Japan." The paper added:  "China holds that, as far as developing countries are  concerned, 'the rights to survival and development are the basis  of human rights.' This argument is not hard to understand. The  U.S. practice of forcing China to make concessions on the issues  of democratization and human rights is too impatient and is  disgusting."    Moreover, the paper also has said something to China. It  says: "Respect for human rights is a world trend. As the  economy develops, it is also natural that people are pressing  growing political demands. If China wants to have long-term  stability, it needs to attach importance to democratization and  human rights."    Let us look at the following fact: The Chinese and U.S.  foreign ministers reached a five-point agreement in their talks.  It includes a memorandum on prison labor products signed  between the two parties. If the United States makes a request,  it can go to a suspected prison within 60 days to investigate  whether prison labor products are still exported. These, of  course, are part of the steps China has taken to improve human  rights.  A Huge Chinese Delegation Will Go to the United States Next  Month [subhead]    China's democratization must be developed gradually; it  cannot be copied from Western practice. This is China's  national condition, and it will not waver on this. As the  people's living standards improve and as education is  popularized on a larger scale, democratization and reform of the  political structure naturally will advanced simultaneously.  However, in the course of such major reforms as the market  economy, there must be an appropriate degree of macroregulation  and control in terms of stability, development, and the  deepening of reform. Otherwise, if society were to be thrown  into chaos, a large country with a population of 1.2 billion  would not be able to sustain it. A case in point is the failure  of Russia and Eastern Europe in their overdrastic  democratization and democratic reform.    Based on their common economic interests, it is advantageous  to both China and the United States to expand economic  cooperation and exchange. China will dispatch a high-ranking  200-man delegation to the United States next month to discuss  economic cooperation in 800 industrial and agricultural  projects. This is beneficial to the rapidly recovering U.S.  economy and to China's construction. Barring ulterior motives,  we really cannot see any benefit that can be derived from  exerting pressure on China, which leads to losses to both  parties.</p>

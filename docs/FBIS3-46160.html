It is believed that so long as both sides observe strictly the  principles on which the two countries established diplomatic  ties and the relevant principles in the joint communique, the  prospects for the development of Sino-French relations will be  very good.    At the ministry press conference, Wu Jianmin said in a  comment on the current status and prospects of Sino-French  relations: Today is the 30th anniversary of the establishment  of Sino-French diplomatic ties. It was a historic decision made  Mao Zedong and General De Gaulle. For most of the last 30  years, the two countries achieved highly fruitful cooperation in  various areas, though Sino-French relations did suffer serious  setbacks. The two governments, after consultations, issued a  joint communique, which opened a new page in bilateral ties.    Wu Jianmin told reporters that Philippe de Gaulle, son of  General de Gaulle, was among the persons who visited China with  French envoy Peyrefitte.</p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Rise in non-EU exports sought The government aims to increase the proportion of exports that go to countries outside the European Union as part of its strategy for stimulating domestic growth. Ministers want to increase non-EU exports to more than 50 per cent of the total before the next general election, due by 1997. They are keen to promote British exports to relatively fast-growing economies in Asia and Latin America. Mr Richard Needham, trade minister, is due to leave for India on Sunday, at the head of a party of more than 80 business executives in what the Department of Trade and Industry is billing as its biggest-ever trade mission. Official figures indicate that the government is well on the way to achieving its target. In the eight months to August exports to the EU amounted to Pounds 46.3bn, or 52.6 per cent of the total. This compared with Pounds 63.9bn (52.7 per cent) in 1993 and Pounds 58.9bn (57 per cent) in 1991. Last October non-EU exports of Pounds 5.28bn marginally outstripped exports to EU countries, at Pounds 5.26bn. This was the first month in which this had happened for more than three years. Next year's expected enlargement of the EU may make the target more challenging than it appears. The way is clear for four European countries - Sweden, Norway, Finland and Austria - to join the EU in January.</p>

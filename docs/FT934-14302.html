			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Cash mountain haunts banks WHEN Mr Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds Bank, argues that something is one of 'the biggest destroyers of shareholder value' in his bank, one might expect him to be taking steps to get rid of it. The trouble is that the culprit is something that most people regard as retail banks' most staple product - cash. Mr Pitman's remarks at a conference - held this month by De La Rue, the banknote printers, to discuss the costs of cash - indicate the size of the problem for banks. The associated Boston Consulting Group study estimated that cash distribution now costs the equivalent of 25 per cent of banks' branch network costs. The study is the first time for 20 years that the workings of the British cash-handling system have been exposed. The costs break down into two forms: the physical expense of moving notes and coins around, and the interest forgone by people, businesses and banks in holding rather than investing cash. Individuals' Pounds 800m cost is calculated as forgone interest on the Pounds 10.1bn cash they hold at any one time. This Pounds 10.1bn - Pounds 460 per household - is higher than the stocks held by other participants: businesses hold Pounds 5.1bn, while bank branches hold only Pounds 3.1bn and building society branches a mere Pounds 300m in total. The only way individuals could gain such interest would be not to use cash, a distant prospect despite the growth in credit and debit cards. Those with most steps at their disposal are the banks, which incur only Pounds 300m in lost interest on their cash holdings but pay a further Pounds 1.9bn a year to move cash around. A comparison with a 1973 study by the banks' Association for Payment and Clearing Services shows that banks have made matters worse for themselves by increasing access to cash. Banking cash transactions per year have fallen in value from Pounds 180bn to Pounds 120bn, yet the number has risen from 650m to 1.6bn. The costs are even higher in France and Germany, in the latter case probably because there has been less expansion of the use of credit and debit cards which have staunched some of the growth in cash in the UK. This suggests that banks can devise ways of altering the UK system, and so reduce their own costs. The Boston Consulting study argues that banks can reduce costs by cutting the number of cash withdrawals through branches, and by managing their stocks of cash more efficiently to avoid lost interest on excess stocks. One Spanish bank is estimated to have saved 35 per cent on cash costs by improved management. However, the study suggests that banks also have motives to try to develop new means of taking cash out of the banking system. One alternative to cash now being considered is the use of 'smart cards' that can hold a nominal cash amount. These could be used at retailers with the appropriate counter technology.</p>

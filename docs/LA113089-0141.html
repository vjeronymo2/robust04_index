			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COMMUNITY COLLEGE STAFF, TEACHERS TO GET  RAISES  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Community College District on Wednesday approved pay raises of  8% for its teachers and from 8% to 12% for clerical, maintenance and other  workers.  </P> <P> The increases will be retroactive to the start of the school year. They will  boost the pay of full-time faculty members to between $25,231 and $50,058,  depending on experience, education and position, officials said.  </P> <P> Board of Trustees President Lindsay Conner said he was delighted that the  agreements were reached without a strike. But trustee Hal Garvin, the lone vote  against the raises, warned that the nine-college system could soon face a  debilitating budget crunch.  </P> <P> "It pains me very much to vote against faculty pay raises because they are not  overpaid. But I thought 6% would be stretching it as much as possible," Garvin  said. Conner said cutbacks in administrative costs would help finance the  agreements.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov  has returned from his trip connected with the Middle East  settlement. Ivanov handed Yasir 'Arafat a personal message from  the Russian president expressing Russia's firm intention to  contribute to the achievement of all-encompassing peace and  security in the Middle East. Here is correspondent Aleksandr  Peslyak with the details:    [Peslyak] After the Hebron tragedy, the situation in the  Middle East has sharply deteriorated. In order to prevent an  escalation of violence and promote a resumption of the  negotiating process, on the instructions of the Russian  president our diplomat has spent three days shuttling between  Tel Aviv and Tunis holding talks with 'Arafat, Rabin, and Peres.    [Begin Ivanov recording] We discussed in particular the need  to adopt an urgent UN Security Council resolution, which would  condemn the crime committed and which would also be aimed at  promoting a resumption of the negotiating process. [end  recording]    [Peslyak] Also, Ivanov believes, it is important to ensure  an  international presence in the region, and an active role on the  part of the cosponsors of the process, the United States and  Russia. Apart from anything else, it is precisely the impetus  from outside that will help the Palestinians and Israelis to sit  down again at the negotiating table, because the shock from a  breakdown in the document, which was 90 percent agreed, which  could have been implemented in mid-April, is too great, and  there are no direct contacts between the sides. But joint  actions by Washington and Moscow do not preclude independent  efforts by each one of them. Tomorrow, Ivanov is having a  meeting with envoys from Israel and the Arab countries, and  today he had a conversation with the U.S. ambassador.</p>

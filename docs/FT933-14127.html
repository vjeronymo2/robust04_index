			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report COPPER prices staged a substantial recovery yesterday after sustaining heavy falls earlier in the week. Dealers attributed the rise, which lifted the three months position at the London Metal Exchange by Dollars 43 to Dollars 1,921.50 at the close, mainly to technical factors, notably Far Eastern options buying and tightness around the three months delivery period. But they saw little in the way of fundamental demand to sustain the market and thought it could be 'riding for a fall' when the tightness wore off. ALUMINIUM also rallied, the three months price closing Dollars 27.25 up at Dollars 1,203.50 a tonne, aided by spill-over sentiment from copper and expectations of strong support below Dollars 1,200. At the London Commodity Exchange robusta COFFEE prices edged lower in nervous conditions as traders waited to see if frost warnings in Brazil would be justified. After London's close New York's arabica coffee market continued to decline. COCOA values were firmer at the LCE on trade buying in London and speculative buying in New York. The September price closed at Pounds 759 a tonne, up Pounds 11 on the day. Compiled from Reuters</p>

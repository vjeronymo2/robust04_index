			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FASHION;  </P> <P> TOP DESIGNERS FLAUNT FLAG, CREATE FLAP  </P> <P> In a synchronized burst of patriotism, several top designers made the American  flag a theme in their fall collections. But just as the clothes are being  delivered to stores this week, the recent Supreme Court ruling that protects  flag burning as a legal form of free speech has turned Old Glory into a  political hot potato.  </P> <P> Legal experts gather for hearings on Capitol Hill while designer Ralph Lauren  poses in his new Polo ad, wearing a sweater with stars and stripes emblazoned  on the front.  </P> <P> Marc Jacobs, who designs the Perry Ellis collection, is showing his flag-motif  fashions in Chicago this week, with a high flying, $2,400 cashmere shawl as the  centerpiece. There are more stars and stripes on his pink-and-white, sequined  evening dresses.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, avant-garde designers Bruno Duluc and Douglas Thompson  introduced flag images in their red, white and blue "election collection," of  stretchy fabric shaped by wires and hoops.  </P> <P> With so many Americans fired up about flag burning, where does that leave flag  wearing?  </P> <P> "Caught in a double standard," says ABC newsman Sam Donaldson, who recently  discussed the issue on "This Week With David Brinkley."  </P> <P> "The super patriots think the flag is a sacred symbol of our country and  believe it should be inviolate. By their standards, wearing it is a  desecration."  </P> <P> But the right to use the flag in protest is also protected by the First  Amendment, which is also inviolate. This side of the argument, Donaldson says,  has more than a few experts agreeing: "The issue is a can of worms."  </P> <P> He adds: "As distasteful and repugnant as flag burning is, I think the Supreme  Court was correct in its decision."  </P> <P> Some argue that where you wear the flag is significant. Across your heart, as  in Lauren's sweater, doesn't seem like a desecration. Across the fanny of your  faded blue jeans does, to many people.  </P> <P> "The difference between what is political and what is patriotic is one of  degrees," Donaldson notes.  </P> <P> For designer Marc Jacobs, the stars and stripes are an artistic expression.  </P> <P> "Marc used the flag from a Jasper Johns painting," explains the designer's  spokeswoman, Laura O'Brien. In her opinion, "It's an art piece, not a national  symbol."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Slings and Arrows  </P> <P> So far, retailers aren't showing any signs of political hedging.  </P> <P> Bergdorf Goodman will fill the New York store windows with Marc Jacobs'  flag-waving clothes next week.  </P> <P> Hiding behind the "art" label, however, isn't likely to shelter Jacobs from the  slings and arrows of some patriots. It's a lesson Chicago-based artist Scott  Tyler learned last winter when he placed an American flag on the floor at the  Art Institute of Chicago's student show. The uproar by veterans was deafening.  </P> <P> Duluc, a native of France, and Thompson, his American partner, say they  consider the flag a dynamic design with a very positive image. They fashioned  it into surreal-shaped garments in bold shades of red, white and blue for  patriotic reasons.  </P> <P> "We wanted a futuristic image of Miss Liberty," Duluc said. "It made sense to  use the symbol of freedom."  </P> <P> Unlike the '60s when designers worked the flag into fashion as a political  protest, designers now are flaunting the image with old-fashioned pride. It is  too soon in the season to predict whether consumers will buy the idea.  </P></p>

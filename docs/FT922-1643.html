			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / How To Spend It: Attention paid to bike with no chain IT IS mildly pleasant for a middle-aged man to become a centre of attention among the golden youth that promenade in Covent Garden on a mid-summer morning, writes Max Wilkinson. The object of their curiosity was a bicycle (pictured above) with no chain, which I was test-riding near Muji, the retailer which is importing it from Japan. The verdict? Well, it certainly gets them chattering. One American student, who picked it up and spun the back wheel critically, pronounced the direct drive through a lightweight axle and gears, 'pretty impressive'. The mechanism seemed well made, and transmitted the power of the pedals efficiently. But in spite of this, the clean look and its exemplary lightness, I did not much like this bike. It comes in only one frame size (490mm or 19.3 inches), which for a six-footer like me, gives an awkward pedalling angle, with the handlebars too near the seat. The gearing ratio is rather low (fine for uphill but tedious on the flat or down). The gears are old fashioned three-speed, rather than the more efficient chain shift; and for Pounds 650, I would expect a pair of mudguards. Round the corner at Covent Garden Cycles I could choose from a range of mountain style 25 speed bicycles with custom-built frames in exactly the right size for Pounds 400 or less. And for a mere Pounds 438 at Bike UK in the YHA shop a block away, I could have bought a truly beautiful 14 speed lightweight racer/tourer - better looking, faster, more comfortable and two thirds of the price of the Muji talkabout. But if you do not mind the price, hate dirty chains, care little for bicycle geometry and enjoy being stopped in the street, by all means try a Muji.</p>

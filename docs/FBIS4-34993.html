			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "RPC Television News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The 2d District Attorney's Office has to rule  whether to uphold the provisional release granted to defendant  Eduardo Herrera Hassan, his lawyer has explained.    The 7th Court House, presided over by Judge Nilsa de  Gonzalez, on 23 June granted the provisional release of Eduardo  Herrera, who along with 16 other servicemen was charged on one  count of sedition. According to Herrera's defense lawyer, his  client was not released, because the prosecutor appealed the  judge's decision.    [Begin recording] [Defense Lawyer Hector Zavala] The judge  issued a pretrial statement saying she can only try Mr. Herrera  for an offense that carries a sentence of less than two years  for the offense of sedition. This ruling, or as the file  states, denies, as President Guillermo Endara has charged, my  client tried to topple him on 5 December 1990. The ruling  states there is no evidence to prove there was an attempt to  topple the government at that time. [end recording]    Lawyer Hector Zavala made the request for a provisional  release in late April. In her decision, the judge agreed to  grant a provisional release until the trial is held, but she  forbad Herrera to leave the country and ordered him to appear  before that court every month.    The 2nd Court of Justice will have to decide whether to  uphold or revoke the release. If revoked, the final step would  be to appeal to the Supreme Court of Justice. Eduardo Herrera  is also charged for his involvement in terrorist acts of  Operation Let Us Kill Fatty [Asesinar Al Gordito, in reference  to President Endara] in Chiriqui Province and for evading  justice.</p>

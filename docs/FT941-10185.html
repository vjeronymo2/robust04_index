			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: Dividend cut at Genbel Investments Genbel Investments, the investment and securities trading group unbundled last year from mining house Gencor, has reported a 30 per cent jump in pre-tax income to R179m (Dollars 52m) in the six months to December 31. However, the company made a R80m provision for the possible loss in value of its stake the Oryx gold mine and aluminium producer Alusaf. The provision set attributable profit back to R77m from R138m. The fall in earnings to 18 cents from 22 cents a share was accompanied by a 33 per cent lower interim dividend of 10 cents. A spokesman said Genbel had made good progress in recent months in establishing its enlarged 'investment trust business' with R1bn borrowings used to buy R717m worth of equities and gilts, plus a R270m futures exposure.</p>

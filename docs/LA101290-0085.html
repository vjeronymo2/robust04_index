During the 1950s, he played the drums in a local group  called the Tone Deaf Five. He was named Citizen of the Year in 1956 by the  Burbank Board of Realtors.  </P> <P> He retired from dentistry in 1970. An avid boat racer and member of the Bahia  Corinthian Yacht Club in Newport Beach, he participated for 12 consecutive  years in the Newport Beach-to-Ensenada, Mexico, yacht race during the 1960s and  1970s.  </P> <P> He is survived by his wife of 48 years, Ione Brandon; a daughter, Debra Brandon  of Chatsworth; a brother, Dr. Frank Brandon of Philadelphia, Pa.; and two  grandsons.  </P> <P> A memorial service is scheduled for 4 p.m. Sunday at the First United Methodist  Church, 700 N.

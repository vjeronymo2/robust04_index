			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc Rorer doubles profits RHONE-POULENC Rorer, the Franco-US pharmaceuticals group, has reported more than doubled profits for 1991, its first full year since formation, writes William Dawkins in Paris. The group - created in 1990 when Rhone-Poulenc, the French state-owned chemicals producer, took control of Rorer of the US - made Dollars 326.1m net income in 1991, against a pro-forma Dollars 145m in the previous year. Sales rose by 5.8 per cent, to Dollars 3.82bn from Dollars 3.61bn, but the group pointed out that the underlying rise, adjusting for exchange rate changes and disposals, came out at 13 per cent. Sales growth was strongest in the US, France and Germany. Turnover benefited from the successful launches of three drugs: Vasten, a cholesterol lowering product; Zoltum for ulcers; and Nasacort, for allergic nasal complaints. Rhone-Poulenc Rorer's profits were also helped by a Dollars 22.1m exceptional gain from the sale of non-strategic businesses, plus a fall in interest charges, to Dollars 159.2m from Dollars 189.2m in 1990, due to a fall in the volume and in the cost of debts. Earnings rose to Dollars 2.37 per share from Dollars 1.08 in 1990.</p>

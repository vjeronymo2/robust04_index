			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Peace move rejected by Croats and Serbs THE Yugoslav state presidency's attempt to avert a civil war between Croatia and Serbia threatened to collapse yesterday following growing criticism from the republics' political parties. There was no sign that Croats or Serbs were planning to hand over their arms to either the republic or federal authorities as ordered after an agreement was hammered out by the country's collective presidency on Thursday. A statement from Croatia's main opposition parties said: 'Croatia is at war, and the defence of the republic is the duty of all it citizens. The authorities must use all means to defend the republic.' In Serbia Mr Mirko Jovic, head of the Serbian National Defence, an ultra-nationalist opposition party, called on volunteers to fight to defend Serbs in Croatia. He said Serbs would 'not recognise any decisions made by Yugoslavia's puppet presidency'. The agreement ordered the disarming of citizens and the demobilisation of Croatia's police reservists in areas of ethnic turmoil in the western republic. The accord also gave the federal army and police authority over the predominantly Serbian province of Krajina, which has declared independence from Croatia. Croats regard the army as pro-Serbian and have criticised the presidency's decision to give the military sweeping powers. Yesterday's statement by Croatia's 12 opposition parties said the presidency's plan 'threatens the sovereignty and integrity of the republic.' It also called for the resignation of Mr Stipe Mesic, Croatia's representative to the eight-member state presidency. Mr Mesic, a moderate, is scheduled to become federal president next Wednesday as part of the annual rotation among the republics of the post. Serb extremists and army hardliners have wanted to prevent him from assuming the presidency. Mr Frane Golem, the foreign minister of Croatia, said in an interview in Austria and reported in Vjesnik, Croatia's newspaper: 'We (Croats) are ready to fight, to use any occasion to become independent.' Western diplomats are pessimistic about the prospects for any long-term peace between Croats and the Serbian minority in the western republic in which 18 people were killed in clashes last week.

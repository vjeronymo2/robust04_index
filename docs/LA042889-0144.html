			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NAVY PLAN FOR CONTROL OF MISSILE WARHEADS ASSAILED  </P> <P> In the first sign of a looming interservice conflict, the Navy has put forward  a plan that would give it control over more than four-fifths of the ballistic  missile warheads permitted under the strategic arms reduction treaty being  negotiated with the Soviet Union, eight Democratic congressmen concerned with  military issues charged Thursday.  </P> <P> The treaty is intended to reduce the total number of nuclear warheads permitted  in the United States and Soviet strategic arsenals, and the legislators, led by  House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.), expressed concern  that the Navy's proposal would allocate too many warheads to submarines.  </P> <P> This would leave too few warheads for land-based missiles and thereby upset the  balance in the "triad" of land-based, submarine-based and bomber forces, they  told President Bush in a letter released Thursday.  </P> <P> Aspin and the other congressmen also complained that the Navy's plan "seems  incompatible with the current arms control framework." They called on the White  House to come up with a coherent strategy for allocating the warheads that  serves U.S. strategic military needs and does not conflict with the proposed  treaty.  </P> <P> "Under scenarios proposed to Congress," the letter said, "the Navy would retain  over 4,000 strategic warheads" in its missile submarines. START, the Strategic  Arms Reduction Talks, will permit a total of 4,900 missile warheads (as well as  about 1,100 bomber-carried nuclear weapons), which leaves only 900 missile  warheads for the Air Force.  </P> <P> Although starting earlier than expected, a battle royal between the Air Force  and Navy has been long expected over the issue of how to divide up the smaller  nuclear "pie" that will exist after the treaty is concluded. Its aim is to  reduce these weapons by 50% in the mid-1990s.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Numbers at Present  </P> <P> At present, the Navy's submarine missiles carry about 6,700 warheads and the  Air Force has 2,350 warheads on its land-based missiles.  </P> <P> Simply cutting each of those forces by 50% is not feasible, in part because the  Navy has been building its submarines bigger.  </P></p>

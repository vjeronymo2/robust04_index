			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar plunges on trade data THE DOLLAR was under a harsh spotlight yesterday, falling against most key currencies on the back of disappointing durable goods figures. New orders for US durable goods fell by 2.4 per cent in May, after April's 1.9 per cent rise. Economists had been forecasting a further increase of 0.3 per cent. The dollar had already been weak in thin, early trading, with dealers focusing on their chart indicators to predict that it was likely to have trouble holding above a support level of DM1.5550. A technical analyst at a Scandinavian Bank in London said: 'We are extremely bearish for the dollar; the long-term market is bearish, the short-term is bearish - (only) the medium-term is bullish, supported by a trend line.' The pessimism was borne out and, after the disappointing figures, as well as news that the figure for unfilled orders had worsened for nine months in a row, the dollar fell through the February low of DM1.5562. It closed in London at DM1.5520, the lowest since January, and fell further in New York to end at DM1.5495. The D-Mark continued to be supported by the unexpectedly high German money supply growth figure announced on Tuesday. However, the dollar was also weaker against sterling and even the yen, in spite of a renewed fall by the Japanese stock market. The move increased wariness among a number of dealers that a US interest rate cut was likely to be on the agenda in the meeting next week of the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee. Dealers added that pressure was likely to be increased by a railway strike in the US which could lead to losses of millions of dollars in fresh fruit and vegetables. In response to the dollar's slide, the White House said the decline in durable goods orders did not undercut the prospects of economic recovery but added that lower interest rates would be justified. The German currency was firmer against other EMS currencies, partly as a lingering result of the higher than expected money supply growth figure announced on Tuesday. The D-Mark rose against the French franc in spite of another big French trade surplus in May. It also edged higher against the lira and rose against the pound. Sterling languished at the bottom of the ERM, with virtually no buying. It dipped against the D-Mark to DM2.915 from DM2.917, but gained more than a cent to Dollars 1.878 in terms of the dollar. Sterling's index was stable throughout the day but edged ahead at the close to 93.1. The pound finished in New York at Dollars 1.8795. In East Europe, Hungary abandoned its upbeat economic outlook for 1992 and devalued the forint by 1.6 per cent.</p>

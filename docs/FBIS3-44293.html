			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 3 (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng  predicted that in the year 1994, China will expand its relations  with foreign countries, make "marked progress" in improving its  relations with the European countries and achieve "fresh  progress" in Sino-U.S. ties.    In an interview with XINHUA over the weekend, Premier Li  analyzed the international situation and spoke on China's  relations with other countries and its policies towards Hong  Kong, Macao and Taiwan.    He noted that in 1994, the third year following the end of  the Cold War, the international situation would go towards  relaxation, with the world moving more rapidly to  multi-polarization.    But on the other side, he warned, there are still many  destabilizing factors in the world, and the two main themes,  peace and development, remain unsettled.    He continued that in today's turbulent world, Asia, and east  Asia in particular, remains relatively stable and its economy is  growing continuously.    He described this phenomenon as "an important feature of the  world situation today" and predicted that east Asia will  continue to improve its standing and have a greater influence on  the whole world in the new year.    Li was also confident that China will improve its  international standing and further expand its relations  world-wide in 1994.    He believed that China will make marked improvement in its  relations with the European countries as a group.    The Sino-U.S. summit in Seattle last November provided a  good  opportunity for the improvement of bilateral ties, Li said,  adding that it is possible that such ties will see new  development in the new year.    "Facts show that there exist wide-ranging common interests  between China and the Western countries, which form the basis  for improving Sino-Western relations," Li stressed.    The premier said that 1994 brings China nearer to recovering  its sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao.    No matter what happens, he said, the Chinese Government has  the ability to restore its sovereignty over Hong Kong as  scheduled, uphold the "one country, two systems" policy and the  Basic Law for Hong Kong and maintain long-term stability and  prosperity in Hong Kong.    Hong Kong and Macao are more closely connected with the  mainland economically, he noted, adding that the continuous  economic development in the mainland will ensure increasing  prosperity in Hong Kong and Macao.    Premier Li continued that the peaceful reunification of  China  is the general trend of historical development and a popular  wish of all the Chinese people.    The attempt by some people to create "two Chinas," or "one  China, one Taiwan," or "one country, two governments," runs  counter to the development of history and to the fundamental  interests and wishes of the people on the mainland and in  Taiwan, Li said.    He called on the Taiwan authorities to place the interests  of  the Chinese nation above everything else and do more practical  things for the reunification and prosperity of the motherland.    In conclusion, Premier Li urged all the Chinese in Taiwan,  Hong Kong, Macao, the Overseas Chinese and those Chinese  residing abroad to work for the prosperity of the Chinese nation.</p>

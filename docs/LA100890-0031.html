			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : MEDIA;  </P> <P> SOME WINNERS, SOME LOSERS IN RADIO RATINGS GAME  </P> <P> The Arbitron ratings released last week for the summer quarter brought local  radio stations the usual grab bag of good news and bad news, glaring signs and  mixed signals. There were few bombshells, but the ratings provided plenty of  fodder for industry professionals to seriously discuss over their morning  coffee.  </P> <P> Popular topics of conversation included:  </P> <P> * The KFMB-FM (B100) morning team of Jeff Elliott and Jerry St. James may not  have come up with an original routine since David Letterman went on the air --  and they certainly don't make anybody laugh as much as they make themselves  laugh -- but they are undoubtedly dominating morning radio. Backed by a series  of television commercials, "Jeff and Jer" posted a 9.5 rating share among  listeners 12 and over and an impressive 11.8 share in the key 25-54 age group.  </P> <P> The book also makes it clear that Mike Berger and Jeff Prescott, who made a  much trumpeted "defection" from KGB-FM (101.5) to XTRA-FM (91X) last year, are  having little impact at their new station. Berger and Prescott posted a 3.9  share, ranking them eighth in the 12-plus category.  </P> <P> The much ballyhooed husband-wife team of Ron Stevens and Joy Grdnic has had  similar uninspiring results at KKYY-FM (Y95). The duo was unable to muster  anything better than a 3.0 share in the 25-54 category.  </P> <P> * Overall, KKLQ (Q106) continued its remarkable string of ratings victories  with its incessantly perky Top 40 dance music. In a business where consistency  is a rarity, Q106 won the 12-plus category for the 12th consecutive rating  period with a 9.1 share.  </P> <P> However, XHTZ-FM (Z90), which switched its format last year with an eye toward  competing against Q106, showed signs that it is moving toward the realm of  respectability with a 2.9 share in the 12-plus category, up from a 1.9 in the  spring.  </P> <P> B100 had a strong book overall, placing second in 12-plus category with a 6.6  share, and first among listeners age 25-54 with an 8.5 share.  </P> <P> The country format of KSON, simulcast on AM (1240) and FM (97.3), is clearly  more than a ratings fluke. Although it slipped slightly from its strong spring  showing, KSON still placed third in the 12-plus category with a 6.5 share, and  second in age 25-54 with an 8.4. It will be interesting to see whether KSON can  maintain its momentum now that morning personality Jack Diamond has left.  </P> <P> * A year ago, KJQY-FM (Sunny 103) "repositioned" its music programming to  directly compete against KYXY-FM (96.5) for the "easy listening" audience. The  summer book shows KJQY making steady improvement, increasing from a 4.4 in the  spring to a 5.2 rating share among listeners 12 and over, while KYXY slipped  from a 3.7 to a 3.0.  </P> <P> "It's a 15 round fight and I've been in a whole lot of 15 round fights," said  KYXY General Manager Jim Price. "They won round one, but I've always been  standing there in the 15th."  </P> <P> Sunny 103 was heavily promoted on television during the ratings period. KYXY  has counterattacked with its own television ad campaign, which didn't begin  until the end of the ratings period.  </P> <P> * For the second consecutive summer, KGB-FM (101.5) took a ratings dive. KGB's  album-oriented rock managed only a 4.9 among listeners 12 and over, down from a  7.1 in the spring. KGB's main competition, 91X and KSDO-FM (Classic 103),  didn't make large gains, so it's not like another station is stealing KGB's  audience.  </P> <P> "I don't know why it happens in the summer," program director Ted Edwards said.  </P> <P> Edwards emphasized that the Birch survey, which uses different methodology than  Arbitron, showed KGB in second, behind Q106. But there is little doubt that  once-powerful KGB has lost something of its ratings supremacy.  </P> <P> In the last year, KGB has been reacting to the new competition of Classic 103  by "reemphasizing" classic rock 'n' roll. Speculation in the industry suggests  that the emphasis on classic rock may have hurt KGB's overall ratings.  </P> <P> "If that were true, then the Birch (rating) would have fallen too," Edwards  said.  </P> <P> Television is an inexact medium. Words and phrases flippantly tossed about as  part of the conversational approach can be extremely damaging. Last week  Charger linebacker Billy Ray Smith confronted Channel 10 sports guy Larry  Sacknoff during a weekly on-air segment over the use of one word.  </P> <P> Smith was upset that Sacknoff refered to Charger lineman Joe Phillip's  companion the night he was attacked as his "girlfriend." Smith demanded an  apology. Sacknoff refused.  </P> <P> Beyond the titillating aspects of the argument -- oh, my, how will this affect  Sacknoff's relationship with Smith's wife, Channel 10 co-anchor Kimberly Hunt?  -- there is the very real issue of Channel 10 labeling the married Phillips as  a philanderer.  </P> <P> Sacknoff says the term "girlfriend" was used in the copy given him, which is  the proverbial passing of the buck. He and Channel 10 executives say they stick  to the accuracy of the word, but they changed to "female companion" in later  broadcasts.  </P> <P> "We certainly didn't set out to hurt Joe Phillips or his wife," Sacknoff said.  "Our sources said she was a girlfriend."  </P> <P> Even though he is paid to appear on Channel 10 on a weekly basis, Smith was  certainly justified in complaining, since he is paid to represent the Chargers'  viewpoint. It's too bad Sacknoff was not better prepared to answer his charges  and to discuss the very real issues involved. Television doesn't have the same  mechanism to correct errors as newspapers.  </P> <P> "If we made a mistake, and I told this to Larry, it was that we didn't  attribute (the term girlfriend) to sources," news director Paul Sands said.  </P> <P> The 7-year-old monthly San Diego Executive magazine is out with a new design  and expanded form, the result of a $500,000 influx of capital from Alfred  Gooding, the industrialist brother of editor Margaret Gooding.  </P> <P> The mag claims a "controlled circulation" of 23,000, which basically means the  magazine is free, but only to the right type of reader -- in this case  "business owners who make more than $300,000 in annual sales," according to  publisher Mary Ann Czerwinski.  </P> <P> The new and improved magazine also includes a new "editorial advisory board,"  which includes such San Diego business promoters as Dan Pegg of the San Diego  Economic Development Corp. and Dal Watkins of the Convention &amp; Visitor's  Bureau.  </P> <P> Though some may look at the new board and wonder if the magazine is going to  become a cheerleader for the local business community, Czerwinski said the  group will only advise the magazine, and keep it focused on the "people, trends  and issues" in San Diego.  </P></p>

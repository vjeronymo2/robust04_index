			<p>BFN     [Text] Xining, April 17 (XINHUA) -- Pat Berndt, mayor of  the City of Yakima, Washington State, has concluded a four-day  visit to Xining, capital of China's hinterland province of  Qinghai.    Berndt, who is leading a delegation from Yakima, is the  first  U.S. mayor that Qinghai has ever received. Xining was  designated an open city by the State Council in 1992.    The visitors had discussions with local leading officials on  Yakima and Xining becoming friendship cities and explored  possibilities for the two sides to cooperate in animal  husbandry, education and tourism.    Berndt told XINHUA that Qinghai is very rich in natural  resources and the cooperation holds big potentials for the two  sides.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by the organizing committee for preparing for and </F> conducting 1 May measures: "The 1 May Holiday Will Always Remain  with You"]    [Text] The FITUR [Federation of Independent Trade  Unions of Russia] appeals to trade union organizations and  workers of the country.    1 May is approaching--a day of workers' solidarity and  protection of the rights of workers.    We are celebrating it in a difficult period in the life of  the country. The broad masses of people are concerned about the  unstable socioeconomic and political situation, the cataclysmic  decline of production, and the growing unemployment. Voices of  protest against the impoverishment of immense segments of the  population and the grossest violations of the constitutional  rights of people related to failure to pay wages for many  months, the curtailment of social programs, and the outbreak of  crime--these voices are becoming ever louder.    The president, the parliament, the government, and various  sociopolitical forces are calling for Russia to achieve  universal civil accord as the main condition for the country's  emergence from the deep economic and social crisis, in the name  of stable movement toward a better life for us.    Trade unions of the FITUR support the idea of civil peace as  the only way of avoiding a national catastrophe. We are  convinced that the real path to this accord is an immediate and  effective solution to the most critical social problems.    Based on the growing mass demands of the workers, we  consider  it necessary to adopt emergency measures which should provide  for:    --an end to the decline of production through changing  the tax policy, supporting the domestic entrepreneur, and  solving problems of mutual nonpayments;    --a guarantee of full and prompt payment of wages with  indexation according to the indebtedness;    --the adoption of a state employment program that  prevents the threat of mass unemployment;    --security for citizens on a firm legislative basis.    We call for the trade union organizations, labor  collectives, and all workers to support these demands.    Through active participation in the 1 May measures we  will demonstrate the unity and solidarity of working people in  their fight for their rights!</p>

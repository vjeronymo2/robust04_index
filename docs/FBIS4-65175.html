			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- The Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD] expects a "considerable number" of Christian Democratic  Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] delegates to vote for  SPD candidate Johannes Rau in the upcoming presidential  elections. This has been indicated by relevant messages from  CDU/CSU delegates, mainly from the new laender, SPD Manager  Guenter Verheugen told journalists in Bonn on Tuesday [10 May].    He ruled out any tactical maneuvers by the SPD in the  Federal  Assembly votes. The Social Democrats will vote for Rau all the  way through. Speculations that the SPD will vote for the Free  Democratic Party candidate Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher in the third  round are unfounded, [Verheugen said].</p>

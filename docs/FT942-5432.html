			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo speculation With no signs of the emergence of a much-hoped for counter bidder for Lasmo, many short-term speculators were said by dealers to have sold their Lasmo shares although many others had paid a premium to marketmakers in order to roll over holdings into the new account. 'There are no signs of a third party as yet and the hot money is beginning to flow out of Lasmo,' said one marketmaker. Lasmo shares closed 2 easier at 142p. The implied value of the bid is now 19 per cent below the original value of the offer from Enterprise Oil. Adding to the discomfort of Lasmo speculators holding on for either a counter offer or increased terms from Enterprise Oil was another slide in the latter's shares which dropped 11 more to 382p. Enterprise have fallen sharply since they launched the bid for Lasmo and were additionally weakened yesterday by a 'sell' note from Nomura, the Japanese-owned stockbroker. Mr Steve Turner at Nomura said Enterprise's current offer is 'unlikely to succeed unless it is sweetened by an element of cash.' He added 'In the event that Enterprise is successful it is likely to involve significant indigestion as the new shares hit the market and would dilute earnings.' A number of the big US investment banks were said to have been aggressive buyers of the UK banks on the basis that the sector has been oversold this year. The heaviest action in the sector was via a big switching operation, said to have been carried out by one of the US investment banks, involving Abbey National and TSB, with the latter on the sell end of the deal. TSB shares have underperformed the rest of the banks since reaching a peak 289p at the end of January this year. At the close TSB were 5 weaker at 203 1/2 p after turnover of 8.6m shares, while Abbey were always in demand and settled 6 up at 416p with 4.9m shares traded. Smith New Court slipped 2 to 352p but were buoyant earlier in the week as dealers picked up hints of bumper preliminary profits later this month. There were also stories that the securities house will move into the market after its results to buy in its own shares in order to pay expected big bonuses to its staff in shares. Commercial Union was the centre of attention in composites with the shares unsettled by the reemergence of stories that the group could be considering a bid for Group Victoire, part of the Suez group of companies in France. Dealers said rumours of a CU bid for Victoire had circulated in the market several times during the past year and were generally sceptical of the story. CU shares settled 3 off at 532p. Other composites continued to respond to the recent spate of buy recommendations. General Accident rose 9 to 587p and Royals 6 to 265p. The recovery in Eurotunnel was again evident, with the fully-paid shares surging 27 to 363p. The shares were the second worst performers in the mid-cap 250 in May. The new nil-paid shares, which started trading on Thursday, rose 17 to 60p. Alfred McAlpine new nil-paids opened at 28p premium but quickly fell away, eventually closing at 16p premium with the McAlpine family interests rumoured to have sold their entitlement, some 2.3m shares. McAlpine 'old' ended the session at 219p ex-rights. Barcom shares more than halved, closing 30 down at 24p after the interim loss. Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals group, dropped 13 to 543p, after 539p, following the finance director's resignation. Granada remained weak as worries continued over the group's acquisition ambitions. The shares fell 8 to 494p. The company declared its interest in taking control of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees at its results this week. The latter's shares were again subject to strong buying interest, closing 9 ahead at 309p. In a strong property sector, Great Portland improved 4 to 200p after announcing a Pounds 58.5m deal. A rise of 1 1/2 in Cadbury Schweppes to 456 1/2 p was helped by a buy note from Strauss Turnbull. The astonishing bull run by food retailer Greggs continued, with the shares gaining a further 38 yesterday to 918p. Since acquiring the Bakers Oven chain from Associated British Foods just over a week ago, the shares have risen 15 per cent. Dealers reported stock on offer in Shoprite and the shares slid 9 to 82p. The stock has remained friendless since a profits warning a week ago. There was another leap forward in Euro Disney following the news earlier this week that a Saudi Arabian prince is to buy a stake of up to 25 per cent in the theme park operator. The shares jumped 21 to 386p. A positive recommendation from SG Warburg was said to have helped Scottish and Newcastle, up 6 at 516p.</p>

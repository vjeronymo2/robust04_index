			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Brazil ruling on assets freeze THE Brazilian government has won an important legal reprieve with a decision by the Supreme Court last night to suspend regional court rulings to liberate money seized in a national assets freeze 13 months ago, writes Christina Lamb in Rio de Janeiro. The freeze is seen by the government as a crucial part of its anti-inflation programme. Apparently heeding dire government warnings that a release of the Dollars 27bn still frozen would cause an explosion in the inflation rate, the president of the Supreme Court said to free the money could 'damage the government's economic policy and provoke economic chaos.' Yesterday's ruling came in response to a government appeal against a decision by the court in Sao Paulo.</p>

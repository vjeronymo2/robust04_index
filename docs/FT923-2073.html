			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Industrialists dream of 80s boom re-run THE extraordinary upheaval in the UK government's economic policy has left British industrialists more pleased than they care to admit. A week ago, they were broadly united in their public support for the principles of strong sterling and tight money. Never mind the damage to their profits and balance sheets: the principle of defeating inflation had to be upheld. They have now been suddenly presented with the traditional British answer to their problems: a devalued currency. It is likely they have difficulty containing their relief, whatever they say in public. Investors agree, judging by the surge in the stock market since devaluation was announced. The hope is that UK industry might enjoy a re-run of what happened a decade ago, when a period of excessive monetary discipline in the early years of the first Thatcher administration was followed by devaluation and plummeting interest rates. It is worth recalling a few statistics. In early 1981, base rates stood at 17 per cent and sterling stood at Dollars 2.44 and DM5.06. Within two years, sterling fell by 40 per cent against the dollar and 30 per cent against the D-Mark. Base rates fell to 10.5 per cent. Industry's profits doubled and dividends rose by 60 per cent. The 1980s boom was under way. How far those conditions can be reproduced is debatable. In the early 1980s, many of the UK's most important trading partners were coming out of recession rather than slipping deeper into it. The UK's budget deficit was under control and the trade balance was in surplus. Perhaps most important, British industry was emerging from a traumatic but ultimately beneficial period of de-manning and rationalisation. Nevertheless, there is room for optimism. Mr Richard Freeman, chief economist at Imperial Chemical Industries, says: 'There will be a surge in corporate profitability, especially for exporters. Companies will use that to rebuild their balance sheets. I wouldn't entirely agree that companies are working from a more efficient base this time round. There is still quite a lot of scope for improved productivity, which is why I expect unemployment to keep rising for quite some time.' Mr Sushil Wadhwani, an economist with the merchant bank Goldman Sachs, agrees: 'There is still scope for cost-cutting. Months ago, we were asking our analysts why their earnings forecasts were so high. They told us it was because companies had all been telling them about the efficiency improvements they can still make.' Mr Sudhir Janankar, deputy director of economic affairs with the Confederation of British Industry, says: 'Companies have been taking some pretty tough decisions. Corporate profits have been falling much more slowly in the past six months than in the year before. Companies have applied the lessons they learnt in the early 1980s and have been quicker to react to difficult conditions.' A more optimistic assessment again comes from Ms Ann Robinson, head of policy at the Institute of Directors: 'Industry's position is far better than 10 years ago. We hadn't had the supply-side revolution then, business wasn't so well invested and we hadn't had the privatisations. 'Since then, the UK industrial base may have been eroded, but what is left is very good. There are companies now that are world beaters and their profits might rise considerably,' Ms Robinson said:'An excellent example is British Airways, compared with Lufthansa. And British Steel. 'There are a lot of problems with the service sectors, such as the banks. But banks in Britain are still a lot more efficient than they are in Germany or Italy.' No one really expects a bounce in profits like that of a decade ago. 'It's almost inconceivable,' Mr Wadhwani says.</p>

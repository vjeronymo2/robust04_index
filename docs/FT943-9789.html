			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Where there are necks there is money - Tim Burt reports on Tie Rack's airports-based international growth plan Swiss rail commuters are about to get a taste of British retailing. Tie Rack, the specialist neckwear and fashion business, is opening a store at the Hauptbahnhof in Zurich - marking another stage of its international expansion plan. The retailer, which calls itself the 'smallest multinational in town', predicts steady demand at the city railway station for products ranging from fancy silk boxer shorts to all manner of neckwear. Its confidence is based on a tried and tested format. Tie Rack opened its first station store at Bank, on the London Underground, 12 years ago. Since then it has exported the concept to 14 countries. Regarding travellers as a captive market, the group has opened shops at rail hubs, 15 international airports and - most recently - on four ferries operated by DFDS, the Scandinavian shipping line. It has also opened a third outlet at Dallas-Fort Worth airport and plans shops at stations serving the Channel tunnel. Complementing its 243 high street outlets, the 64 transport-linked shops have become an integral part of the group's growth, which was underlined earlier this year when it announced a 31 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 6.67m on turnover ahead 17 per cent at Pounds 78.2m. For Mr Roy Bishko, the chairman who founded Tie Rack in 1981 and floated it six years later, the results represent a triumph of concept shopping over niche retailing. Indeed, niche is almost a banned word at the company's west London headquarters, where the buying and merchandise departments overflow with non-core products such as jewellery, scarves, silk clothing, underwear and accessories. 'If Tie Rack was a single product company, we would have long since passed away,' says Mr Bishko. 'I have spent my time all these years building up the range of products that Tie Rack sells so that we would not be dependent on one single item.' He blames such dependence for the collapse of copy-cat retailers such as Sock Shop, Blouse House, Tooth Booth and Shave Shop. Arguing forcefully that his business is a broadly-based international concern, he adds: 'Niche is a swear word in my opinion and, at best, it has a derogatory connotation.' Tie Rack's product range may have protected it from the worst effects of recession and volatile consumer spending, but even the irrepressible Mr Bishko sounded a note of caution in his recent results statement. He hinted that sales could decline marginally this year amid worsening trading conditions in some of Tie Rack's key European markets. Although new shops are said to be performing strongly, the shares have fallen almost 10 per cent since the results were announced and closed yesterday at 141p. Mr Bishko shrugs off the muted City reaction, and ponders whether the company's trading statement was 'perhaps too honest for the market'. Claiming also that cash generation was more important than the share price, he predicted that increased sales - enhanced by some 30 new stores due to open this year, half of them overseas - could lift net cash balances from Pounds 11.2m to more than Pounds 13m. His unbridled optimism is tempered only by the admission that one market has not been kind to the company - North America. The group was almost undone by a poorly controlled US expansion plan which left it with losses, expensive stores in the wrong places, and hefty rationalisation charges. Losses in the US last year climbed from Pounds 58,000 to Pounds 482,000 as the group closed unprofitable shops and made significant write-downs. But Mr Bishko, who wears a watch permanently set to Eastern Standard Time, refuses to regard the market as an Achilles' heel and points instead to lucrative new outlets at airports in Pittsburg, Denver and Dallas. New shops may offset problems in cities such as New York and Atlanta. But Tie Rack's success probably owes more to improved quality and innovation, which last year helped it bring out 1,000 new tie and 500 new scarf designs. It also depends on low overheads at overseas outlets, which are supplied directly from the group's London headquarters. Mr Bishko may be the 'ideas man' acclaimed for that progress, but it is doubtful he would have succeeded had it not been for the conservative influence of Mr Nigel McGinley, the chief executive recruited from Argyll in 1989. He oversaw the group's 1991 rights issue, raising Pounds 3.2m to strengthen the balance sheet, and imposed the stock and cost controls necessary to withstand the recession. He is the antithesis of Mr Bishko's effervescence. While the chairman talks of expansion and landlords who are 'thrilled' to have Tie Rack on their property, Mr McGinley forecasts more US closures and an uncertain recovery. 'Several of our overseas markets are in recession, and in the UK tax increases may well hit people's spending power,' he adds. Some City analysts regard him as the company's saviour. 'He screwed down the costs and improved the cashflow,' according to one analyst. 'I don't know where the company would be without him.' Mr McGinley's caution has proved an ideal foil to Mr Bishko, and their double act has ensured Tie Rack's growth. Despite their different styles, both are committed to further expansion in airports, where turnover is estimated at more than Pounds 1,000 per sq ft, and to exploiting new markets in east Asia. The group has identified 50 airports where it would like to establish a presence, and has also begun considering a move into China from Hong Kong, where it has a franchise operation with Watson's, a retail division of Hutchison Whampoa. Hailing the group's prospects, Mr Bishko says: 'As long as people have necks, there will be a pretty big market out there.'</p>

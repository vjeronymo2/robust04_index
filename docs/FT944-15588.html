			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Farmland reform boost for tenants Legislation ending security of tenure for new agricultural tenants should immediately free nearly 1m acres of farmland for rent for periods of five years or more, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said yesterday. The institution said this would represent almost 10 per cent of the rented sector in England and Wales, which is paralysed by landowners' unwillingness to risk losing control of their land. Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, said last week that a bill reviving freely negotiated contracts between farm landlords and tenants would be introduced early in the parliamentary session which opens next month. Mr Martin Lowry of the institution said a survey of 148 rural chartered surveyors in the summer showed that the legislation would bene-fit the entire agricultural sector. He said: 'More farms to rent will allow new blood, some of it from a non-agricultural background, into the industry, bringing on a fresh genera-tion of entrepreneurial farmers.' Under the 1986 Agricultural Holdings Act any tenancy longer than two years entitles the tenant to stay for life. This has led landowners to resort to a variety of short-term arrangements covering about a quarter of all tenanted land. Mr Lowry said such deals were 'time-consuming, complex and don't lead to well-farmed land'. The government is pursuing new legislation after industry-wide agreement that change is needed. But concern has been expressed in some quarters that landowners will opt for short-term leases. Mr Lowry said this fear should be allayed by the survey's findings that 61 per cent of new rentals would be for 10 years or more.</p>

			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading TRADING volumes continued to fall away in London stock index markets yesterday as investors took a calmer view of the week's events in Russia, writes Terry Byland. After moving within a range of 18 points, the December contract on the FT-SE Index closed at 3,035, a 27 point premium to the cash market but only about 3 points to the Fair Value, cash and carrying costs, premium. Salomon International was believed to have been a large seller of the December contract, selling about 1,000 contracts out of the day's total business of 7,595; earlier this week, daily turnover topped 15,000 contracts. Traded options had a brisk session, recording 36,996 contracts against 28,690, with the FT-SE contract active at 14,891 contracts. The Euro FT-SE option recorded 2,580 deals. Individual share contracts also had an active day, with Glaxo (4,358 contracts) still responding to President Clinton's healthcare proposals. Amstrad, the computer manufacturer, saw 3,398 contracts traded.</p>

			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: SA bank ahead 16% pre-tax Amalgamated Banks of South Africa, the biggest and most troubled of South Africa's leading banking groups, has reported a 16.6 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to R610.7m (Dollars 173m) for the six months to the end of September, up from R523.9m for the same period last year. Net interest income rose 8.2 per cent to R1.98bn from R1.83bn, while the provision for bad and doubtful loans dropped 6 per cent to R262.7m from R279.4m. However, attributable income rose only 10.7 per cent to R337.9m from R305.3m, largely due to a 21.5 per cent rise in tax paid, to R280.5m from R262.7m previously. Loans rose 12.5 per cent to R75.2bn from R66.9bn, reflecting an improvement in the core banking sector. This helped boost total assets to R91.4bn from R84.3bn, a rise of 8.4 per cent. However, the share of associated companies' retained income dropped sharply to R7.7m from R12.3m, largely because of continued difficulties in the short-term insurance market. Earnings per share rose 10.7 per cent to 59.7 cents from 54 cents, but the dividend was only increased 8.8 per cent to 18.5 cents. This means the payout is covered 3.2 times, consistent with the group's goal of a consistent dividend cover of three times. Although the results continue to lag ABSA's main competitors, analysts say they represent a significant improvement on the last two years, when rivals gained market share from ABSA as it struggled to integrate its constituent parts following mergers in 1991 and 1992. Foschini, the South African clothing and jewellery retailer, has announced a 26.2 per cent rise in attributable earnings to R67.2m for the six months to the end of September, up from R53.29m previously. Pre-tax income also rose by 26.2 per cent to R111.5m from R88.3m, reflecting a 28.5 per cent rise in turnover.</p>

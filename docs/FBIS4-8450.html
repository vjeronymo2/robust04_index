			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 13 Apr (MTI) -- The Hungarian Foreign  Ministry has not received any new proposals from Romania on the  debated issues of the Hungarian-Romanian basic treaty, foreign  affairs spokesman Janos Herman told MTI today, challenging a  press statement from his Romanian colleague, Mircea Geoana. In  the statement, Geoana mentioned Romania's recent efforts to  advance bilateral talks on the issue.    Herman agreed that a treaty is in the interest of both  sides,  but declined to predict any deadlines for reaching an agreement.    Romanian senior officials had said that they expected an  agreement on the debated issues, i.e. on the inviolability of  borders and the question of minorities, before June 1.    The Hungarian spokesman said there had been certain hints in  the statement suggesting that the elaboration of the treaty  could be based on formulas given by NATO, the U.S. and some  Western European countries.    Herman said that while the Hungarian side had not received  any such formulas relating to the treaty, Hungary has, in a  broader sense, accepted suggestions from NATO and the U.S., for  instance, by signing the Partnership for Peace agreement.</p>

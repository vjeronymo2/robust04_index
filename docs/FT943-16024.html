			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / International Company News: Mandarin Oriental may quit HK SE  -The group will keep its Asian commitment The board of the Mandarin Oriental hotel group is likely this autumn to decide to stop trading its shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange. In May, the group took over the management of the Ritz in London, its first foray into Europe, and it is looking for other European hotels. Mr Robert Riley, Mandarin Oriental managing director, insists that neither of these moves suggested the group was planning to reduce its commitment to Asia before China resumed sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997. Mandarin Oriental's headquarters will remain in Hong Kong after 1997, he says. While the group wants to expand in Europe and elsewhere, it expects the bulk of its business to remain in Asia. Mr Riley says he is looking for opportunities in China. If, as seems probable, the group does delist its Hong Kong shares, it will merely be following the lead of Jardine Matheson, which owns 51.5 per cent of Mandarin Oriental. Jardine announced in March it would cease trading its shares in Hong Kong at the end of this year. It had been unable to persuade the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission to give up its regulatory control, and allow Jardine to be supervised by the authorities in Bermuda, where it is incorporated. Mandarin Oriental is also incorporated in Bermuda, and, like Jardine, has its primary stock exchange listing in London. Mr Riley says: 'Jardine's statement said that they are familiar with the legislative process and tradition of Great Britain. We will have similar considerations. That doesn't have any impact on our commitment to Hong Kong, China and Asia.' Nevertheless, the group, founded in Hong Kong in 1963, is energetically expanding beyond its Asian base. It runs 10 hotels in Asia and one in San Francisco; it will operate a luxury hotel being developed in Mexico City; and the group would like other hotels in western European cities to complement the Ritz. Mr Riley says, however, that there are limits to how much the group wants to expand outside Asia. It is not keen, for example, to run hotels in eastern Europe, because these would be too difficult to manage from Hong Kong. He says: 'We can tackle the emerging markets in Asia with more confidence than those in eastern Europe.' The group last year signed an agreement to help restore the Majapahit hotel, a historic property in Surabaya, Indonesia, which it will run when it reopens in 1995. It has also taken a 25 per cent interest in a new Mandarin Oriental in Kuala Lumpur, which is expected to open in 1997. Despite its experience of the region, however, the Asian market, apart from Hong Kong, has not proved easy for Mandarin Oriental over the past few years. Group pre-tax profits last year were USDollars 48m, slightly lower than the 1992 figure of Dollars 48.1m and well down on the Dollars 61.4m the group earned in 1989. Hong Kong, where the group runs the Mandarin Oriental and the Excelsior, enjoyed an increase in room rates and occupancy. The group's performance in Hong Kong was boosted by an increase in visitors to the territory, while the supply of rooms remained static. But strong competition elsewhere in Asia resulted in occupancy falling in Manila and Bangkok and although occupancy rose in Jakarta and Singapore, room rates fell. Mr Riley says that there are signs of European and Japanese visitors coming back to Bangkok, although business has not returned to the level of four years ago. The market in Singapore also appears to have stabilised and visitor numbers and likely to boosted by a new convention centre, which is due to opened there next year. In Jakarta and Manila, however, the group still faces stiff competition, he says.</p>

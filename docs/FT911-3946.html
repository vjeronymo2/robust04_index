			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / Sun Alliance lends Aldington Pounds 500,000 SUN ALLIANCE insurance company, the UK's biggest household insurer, will disclose in its annual report and accounts today that it has given an interest-free loan, estimated at Pounds 500,000, to Lord Aldington, its former chairman. The loan is to cover the legal costs of his nine-week libel case against Count Nikolai Tolstoy in 1989. The directors justify the decision on the grounds that the case arose from his duties as the company's chairman. Earlier this month Sun Alliance reported a 1990 loss of Pounds 181m due to claims arising from bad weather and the recession. The loan to Lord Aldington is repayable if he recovers costs. The legal bill has been estimated at Pounds 500,000 plus other expenses of about Pounds 100,000. The company says that Mr Nigel Watts, a Kent property developer and a co-defendant in the libel action, had claimed that Sun Alliance wrongly refused to pay a Pounds 50,000 accident policy after his brother-in-law died in 1975. At the trial Lord Aldington's counsel said there had been a 'disgraceful campaign' to force Sun Alliance to reverse its decision over the insurance claim. The court was told Mr Watts had circulated 10,000 copies of a pamphlet, written by Count Tolstoy, attacking Lord Aldington's war record. It alleged that as a senior officer in Austria at the end of the Second World War he repatriated thousands of Cossacks and anti-Tito Yugoslavs to the Communists knowing they faced torture and death. At the end of the trial Lord Aldington, a former deputy chairman of the Conservative party, was awarded record Pounds 1.5m damages plus costs but neither Count Tolstoy nor Mr Watts were able to pay that sum.</p>

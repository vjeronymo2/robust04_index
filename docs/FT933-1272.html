			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: Italian banks prepare for privatisation - A financial transformation starting to take place WITHIN a matter of months, three of Italy's biggest banks should either be fully privatised or have a significant share of their capital floating on the stock market. The deals, involving Banca Commerciale Italiana and Credito Italiano, two big banks owned by the IRI state holding company, and Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, a state-controlled financial services group, are visible signs of the transformation now taking place within Italian finance. To be successful, the three deals will have to create popular demand at a time when bank shares are suffering from sharply higher bad debt provisions. Potential investors will also have to be persuaded they will not end up as unprotected minorities in companies where decision-making is dominated by a hard core of institutional and industrial interests. To some extent this is a less likely scenario at IMI than at the two IRI-controlled banks. Based in Rome, IMI's main activity is long-term industrial lending, from which it has expanded into securities trading, fund management, insurance and retail banking. The group last week reported a net profit of L284bn for the first half of 1993: this is more than some bigger banks make in a full year. Though earnings have been overshadowed by a long-running court case involving a L900bn claim by the heirs of a former client, the bank is in sound financial shape. The government's decision to float an opening tranche of about 20 per cent in IMI was based more on expediency than ideology after painfully-long negotiations on a sale to a group of big savings banks led by Milan's Cariplo failed earlier this year. A flotation also represented a last option for IRI's controlling stake in Credito Italiano since alternative informal soundings by Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank, failed to identify a trade buyer or suitable pool of foreign and domestic institutions willing to buy the bank. Slightly bigger than Credito Italiano, its near neighbour in the heart of Milan's financial district, BCI's strength lies in commercial lending. By contrast, both banks have been relatively late converts to wide-scale retail banking, once left to regional savings institutions, and have spent heavily in the past three years extending their branch networks. Investment in new branches affected earnings at both banks last year. Profits were also hit by heavy write-downs on securities and higher loan loss provisions. This year's outlook is for continuing pressure on earnings, though buoyant income on securities trading should compensate partly for what are expected to be much bigger loan provisions. Given the weakness of the sector, analysts doubt there will be a stampede to buy shares in any of the three banks about to be offered, although BCI is expected to generate most interest. However, one crucial factor may change matters. Italy's prime minister, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, shares the determination of his predecessor, Mr Giuliano Amato, to sell off state assets. The difference is that Mr Ciampi seems much more disposed to use the stock market to do so. Mr Ciampi has put public share offerings at the top of his government's agenda. The fact that the Milan bourse has been Europe's best performer this year has provided an additional head of steam. However, there is at least one wild card in the pack. Many analysts believe Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank, is determined to gain control of BCI. According to Milan banking legend, Mediobanca has for years nursed the hope of creating a northern Italian financial powerhouse combining the talents of BCI and Mediobanca. Mediobanca's strength in financial services would be reinforced by having powerful institutions such as the big Generali insurance group and the Fiat-controlled Gemina investment concern as core shareholders, along with some of northern Italy's leading private-sector industrialists. There is also an element of self-interest behind such ambitions. The privatisation of IRI's stakes in Credito Italiano and BCI could put Mediobanca's own future into doubt. Mediobanca' independence has until recently been assured by a complex shareholding arrangement in which control is held by Credito Italiano and BCI, along with Banca di Roma. The rest of its shares are either floating or owned by a core of friendly private-sector institutions. While Banca di Roma has indicated that it does not intend to change its relationship with Mediobanca, the privatisation of Credito Italiano and BCI could conceivably mark any number of new turning points.</p>

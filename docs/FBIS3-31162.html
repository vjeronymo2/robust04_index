			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Warsaw, Feb. 9 -- According to head of the Party of  Christian Democrats (PCHD) Pawel Laczkowski, the coalition of  the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) and the Polish Peasant Party  (PSL) is rather durable. Laczkowski said on Wednesday he did  not expect the coalition to break up soon, although he was not  sure whether it could survive four years.    He explained that by relative durability he meant the  ability  to adopt budget and to cope with local government elections. He  did not expect any crack to take place this year as too many  parties were waiting as alternative candidates, for instance,  the Confederation for an Independent Poland (KPN).    The PCHD leader believes that internal shifting took place  in  the coalition and that Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak emerged  strengthened from the dispute. He would get even stronger if  Henryk Chmielak (first deputy finance minister) were appointed  as finance minister.    Laczkowski added that another major crack, for instance over  the agrarian policy, could take place, but he did not see major  threats to the coalition's relative durability.</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Technology: Japanese digger holed up in UK Deep in the Northumberland hills earlier this winter a delivery driver complained bitterly to the manager of a quarry about the rough treatment meted out to a mysterious wheeled excavator. The excavator, whose identifying marks had all been removed for testing, had been manufactured down the road at Komatsu UK (KUK) in Birtley. Its abuse was in a good cause, marking the end of an intensive two-year exercise in technology transfer that had produced the first Japanese construction equipment model to have been designed, engineered and built outside Japan. 'For our lads, it's the first exposure to this kind of activity,' says Mick Higgs, KUK's design manager. The project is the culmination of a steady development in KUK's design expertise since the plant began production in 1987. For Clive Morton, KUK's first employee and now director of personnel and administration, it has illustrated an essential point about technology transfer - it is hard work. 'It sounds all very grand,' he says. 'But really it's all about day-to-day effort and concentrating on making things work. It's not somebody wafting in, throwing concepts on the table and wafting out again.' Komatsu had always intended that Birtley would progressively become an autonomous European plant. From the beginning it had a small design team, adapting Komatsu's machines to different requirements and regulations in 16 national European markets and also ensuring 'buildability'. Here, says Morton, KUK went through some elementary lessons about differing approaches in Japanese and UK drawing offices. The Japanese tendency was to leave as much information on a drawing as possible, including all the design changes, whereas the UK approach was to throw away discarded versions and concentrate on the final one. The next stage involved KUK's designers in Komatsu's Dash 5 model programme, with the Birtley team influencing the design at an early stage to ensure it would not hit problems in Europe. A Finnish distributor, for example, complained that the grab handles on the door were too small for drivers wearing thick gloves to grip. The latest stage involves designing an entire machine that is aimed particularly at a gap in the European market and its biggest constituent part, Germany. It has been a testing experience for both the parent company and the KUK design team, now expanded from an original 10 to 40 and linked to eight plants in Japan via a Pounds 1m Cad system. For Komatsu, maintaining its reputation has been paramount, says Toshitaka Suketomo, KUK managing director, and the Birtley development team has followed the same procedure that the parent company uses. The process differs from western approaches by delaying the crucial decision to build or not to build until completion of a sequence of approvals to move from one stage to the next. The advantage, says Morton, is that it helps isolate a problem that ought to be fixed before the production decision is taken. On the other hand, some of the UK employees - keen to know whether their designs would ever become reality - found the idea difficult to accept. Inevitably the team made mistakes, but were in close touch with Japan for guidance and also with Japanese colleagues seconded to the project. This is one reason, says Higgs, why the team is keen to have another go. Already, design work is continuing on a smaller (13 tonne) and larger (20 tonne) version of the new PW170-5 machine, although KUK will not say when they will be launched. The original 17-tonne machine, smartened up and its identity restored, was unveiled this week at the Bauma construction equipment exhibition in Munich. Both Morton and Suketomo are keeping their feet on the ground about the process but two years from start to finish is a creditable debut.</p>

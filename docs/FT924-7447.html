			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / German 'wise men' warn on solidarity pact: Independent economic advisers say Chancellor Kohl's planned accord with unions and employers could prove counter-productive THE GERMAN government's independent economic advisers yesterday warned Chancellor Helmut Kohl that his planned 'solidarity pact' between government, trade unions and employers could prove counter-productive in reviving economic growth. In a comprehensive and largely gloomy assessment of the challenges facing the country, the so-called 'five wise men' called for a coherent plan of budget savings, and severe restraint on wages, as preconditions for economic recovery. They denounced the current arguments between the political parties, unions and employers on a fair distribution of the burden of unification costs to finance east German recovery, and called instead for total concentration on how to promote economic growth. 'The danger is looming that the economy will fall into a recession,' they said. 'Two years after German unification, pessimism is spreading in both halves of the country.' The coming year would provide the German economy with its 'first great test,' they added. Forecasting zero growth in gross national product for 1993, but some recovery in the second half of the year, the five leading economists also warned that Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, was still being over-optimistic in his budget revenue forecasts. They predicted a growing public sector deficit for the next four years, instead of the gradual reduction forecast by the Finance Ministry. The proposal likely to attract the greatest attention in Germany is a plan for a 7 per cent tax surcharge, to be levied on all income and corporate tax-payers, to provide DM25bn in subsidies for employment measures in east Germany. The surcharge, to be gradually run down over five years as the eastern economy recovers, would be a fairer way of paying for the subsidies than the existing 2 per cent levy on unemployment insurance contributions, the wise men argue. Only registered employers pay the latter, thus excluding all public sector employees and the self-employed. Their report brought immediate but predictable calls from the Social Democrat opposition for Mr Waigel to resign. The report was widely welcomed by German industry, but criticised by the unions for its stress on wage restraint. Its criticism of the planned 'solidarity pact' comes at an embarrassing moment for Mr Kohl, who hopes to agree a deal by the end of the year, and yesterday had important talks with civil service union leaders. The wise men warned that such an ambition could arouse excessive expectations from the public, and failure of the talks would have a far more negative effect than it should. 'The danger lies in the spectacular character of a solidarity pact,' they said. 'The more the importance of the pact is stressed in public, the greater will be the expectations, and all the worse will be the disappointment if it finally fails.' It was far more important that the government should independently draw up a coherent savings plan, and the unions recognise the need for wage restraint. Only then would the Bundesbank be given the room for manoeuvre to lower its interest rates, and thereby open the way for economic recovery. 'The steady reduction of net borrowing is imperative, if the danger of destabilisation through growing public sector debt is to be avoided,' they said. 'The task is urgent: it is to rebuild public confidence in the solidity of the state finances through a credible savings strategy.' While forecasting a higher Bundesbank money supply target for 1993 - with a central goal of 6.5 per cent growth in the broad M3 measure of money supply  -the wise men warned: 'As desirable as a clear interest rate cut might be in the present economic situation, it can only happen if reliable indicators show that inflation is slowing down.' Ironically, the report - forecasting a slower inflation rate of some 3.5 per cent next year - came out on the same day that new figures showed a fifth successive monthly decline in wholesale prices. The federal statistics office reported a 0.1 per cent decline in October, and a 1.6 per cent drop year-on-year against October, 1991. The report suggests that Mr Waigel's forecast of a reduced public sector deficit, falling from DM120bn (Pounds 49.5bn) this year to DM66bn (Pounds 27.2bn) by 1996, is over-optimistic, based on an unlikely 6 per cent nominal growth rate of GNP. Instead, with GNP growth rates rising gradually from 3.5 to 5 per cent by 1996, the deficit will increase from DM120bn to DM136bn in that time, they say.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 FORECASTS FOR THE GERMAN ECONOMY, 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                OECD       Economic        Five wise                               (July)     institutes          men                                           (October)       (November)                              W      E    W        E       W        E GNP growth*                2.3    9.0  0.5      7.0     0.0      7.0 Unemployment**             6.1   17.0  6.5     16.5     7.0     17.0 Consumer price rise*       3.5    8.0  3.5      8.5     3.5      9.0 Capital investment*        2.8   13.7  2.5      6.0    -0.5     12.0 Exports*                   5.1   15.0  1.0      3.0     1.5        - Imports*                   5.2    7.0  2.0      2.5     0.0        -  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * % change over 1992. **Average annual rate  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

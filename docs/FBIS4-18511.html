			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Michael J. Inacker: "Defense Ministry Examines </F> Concept for New Helicopter and Tank Transporter"]    [Text] Bonn -- The Bonn Defense Ministry is currently  considering the purchase of a warship that is unlike any sailing  under German flag now or in the past. It is a combined command,  medical, and logistics ship for crisis operations that can be  used as a troop transporter at the same time and can also carry  six to 10 helicopters.    These considerations have been triggered by the experience  of  the Bundeswehr during its Somalia mission. For last month's  withdrawal of the 1,300 troops, the Defense Ministry had to use  a frigate equipped for naval battle and a supply ship that had  to move up within firing range of possible snipers at the  Mogadishu jetty in order to pick up the troops.    Following this experience, Bundeswehr General Inspector  Klaus  Naumann asked the Navy to do a study into costs, efficiency, and  feasibility of a special ship that combines the multiple  functions needed in crisis operations, which have not been  required by the Bundeswehr so far.    According to Naumann, the question is "whether and how the  Navy can provide platforms for command, transport, supply, and  medical care to support operations involving various sections of  the forces." WELT AM SONNTAG has been informed that the Navy  has already presented its first proposals.    At 15,000 to 20,000 tonnes displacement, the ship would be  the biggest one in the Navy. In their considerations, the  German planners are using as a model an existing project of the  Dutch Navy for an "amphibious transport ship" that is to be put  into operation in 1996.    The German planners in the Defense Ministry think that the  ship, based on the Dutch model, would have the following  features:    -- Besides a crew of 150 soldiers, the ship should provide  room for a battalion-strength Bundeswehr contingent (600 to 800  troops), including vehicles and supplies.    -- It should also carry a medical unit with a capacity of  100  beds -- also to be used for humanitarian relief missions.    -- Furthermore, it should contain a command unit that allows  contact to be maintained with Germany and a unit operating on  shore.    -- A big flight deck with a hangar is required for picking  up  land forces. Six to 10 medium-sized transport helicopters of  the NH-90 type could be positioned there. CH-53 type Army  helicopters could also land on the deck.    -- For picking up land forces at sea, the commando ship  would  also carry several landing boats.    According to the Dutch plans, such a ship must have some  1,500 cubic meters of cargo space, holding 30 tanks of the Leo-2  type (two tank companies), or 60 "Marder" armored combat  vehicles.    In view of these requirements, such a ship would have to be  at least 160 meters long and 25 meters wide.    The Dutch Navy has estimated the cost of its ship at some  230  million German marks.</p>

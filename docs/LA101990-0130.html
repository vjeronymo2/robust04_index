			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN;  </P> <P> TRUSTEES QUESTION USE OF SCHOOL FUNDS  </P> <P> The two incumbents in the Tustin Unified School District race said they were  surprised to learn how the district has spent some of the money from the sale  of closed school sites.  </P> <P> Incumbents Gloria Tuchman and Jane Bauer said they believed the district could  use the funds only for refurbishing schools.  </P> <P> But former superintendent and school board candidate Maurice Ross told the  audience at a candidates' forum that some of the $12 million generated by the  school site sales was used to buy computers.  </P> <P> "My concern was not that we did it," Bauer said. "Because if it was spent, it  was for something we needed. What I'm concerned about is that the expenditure  was made without the board being told about it."  </P> <P> Paul Fisher, business manager for the district, said $50,000 to $60,000 of the  school sale fund was spent on computers last year.  </P> <P> Ross, who resigned as superintendent last year after citing philosophical  differences with school board members, said the board was told how the money  was spent.  </P> <P> "That's ridiculous. They have to vote on everything. The computers were Jane  (Bauer)'s pet project. I don't see how in the world she wouldn't know," said  Ross, who criticized the computer purchases because the district had pledged to  spend the funds on refurbishing schools.  </P> <P> Bauer said she asked questions but was never told the money was being spent on  computers. "That was typical of the way Dr. Ross worked," she said. "Board  members were not informed about what was going on, even when they asked  questions." SHANNON SANDS  </P></p>

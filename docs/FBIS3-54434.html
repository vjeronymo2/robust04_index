His visit marked the beginning of a new stage in  Iran's diplomatic mediation effort to establish peace between  Azerbaijan and Armenia.    President Levon Ter-Petrosyan and the Armenian foreign  minister received Banki in Yerevan. He conveyed President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani and Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati's  messages to the Armenian officials. They explained the Islamic  Republic of Iran's position on regional issues, particularly on  the clashes between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and reemphasized  Iran's hope that a political solution will be found to the  problem.    Banki later left Yerevan for Baku to hold talks with  Azerbaijani officials. He met President Aliyev and the  Azerbaijani foreign minister and briefed them on his talks in  Yerevan and the latest visit of Ambassador Vladimir Kazimirov,  President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy on Karabakh, to Tehran.  Banki's talks in Yerevan and Baku indicate Iran's wish to  contribute to the effort to find a political solution to the war  between Azerbaijan and Armenia. [10-second break in transmission]    The war has resulted in the occupation of a large part of  Azerbaijan's territory. The fighting has harmed the  humanitarian forces and resources in other fields on the two  sides. And it has put economic, political, and social pressures  on Azerbaijan and Armenia. These fields should have helped  Azerbaijan and Armenia to strengthen their independence and  complete their restructuring. Under the existing conditions, the  war must immediately end before it assumes an international  nature. The two countries' military forces must withdraw to  their recognized borders in accordance with agreements,  including that which was signed in Tehran in 1993. Azerbaijan  and Armenia must hold talks to resolve their disputes. That was  the objective behind Banki's visit to Baku and Yerevan.    Iran will maintain its mediation effort to realize that  objective.</p>

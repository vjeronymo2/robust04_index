			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Coventry (5): Cost and access a spur for inward moves - The National Grid is among companies which have moved their operations to the Midlands city OFFICIALS AT Coventry City Council realised they would have to diversify the city's economy in the early 1980s. The recession of 1979-81 had been traumatic for Coventry, with around 53,000 jobs lost by 1982, compared with the mid-70s. Over this period, the dominant industries - car-making and related engineering - cut back their activities. In 1980, 46 per cent of the workforce was employed in manufacturing of some kind, most of in the automotive industry: it became obvious too that many of the jobs lost were not going to reappear when the economic cycle turned favourable. An economic development unit at the city council was formed in 1986, and from 1987 different kinds of companies began to move to Coventry. Equity and law Life Assurance Company had already moved some of its operations to Coventry in 1974, but the company, had been very much a lone beacon in the financial services sector. Coventry was seen as a manufacturing city, with the necessary related services being carried out in nearby Birmingham. The absence of a white collar culture meant that very little B1 industrial/office space was available for high technology or financial services companies. The situation began to change with the founding in 1982 of the University of Warwick Science Park, a 45-acre site owned by the university and developed jointly by the university and the city council. Today there are 65 companies, many of them high technology concerns, employing more than 1,100 people on the park. Another development, Westwood Business Park, was brought on stream in 1986. This 100-acre site which is close to the science park provided the breakthrough the city needed. Again, it was developed by the city council, but this time in conjunction with private sector developers. It has proved attractive to financial services companies: Barclays Bank, which now employs 850 people in Coventry, and RSA Examinations Board, which employs 130 people are two well known service companies which have moved operations to the park. The city council estimates that, in all, 157 companies have moved part or all of their operations to Coventry since 1987, creating 10,570 new jobs. This has meant that the percentage employed in manufacturing has dropped to 35 per cent. On the science park, some of the high-technology companies include Sun Microsystems, Buehler International, Telemecanique and Olivetti. Other companies which have relocated to Coventry include the National Grid employing 800 people at a new headquarters building; Midland Bank, which has established a regional data headquarters, and employs 250 people, the Department of Transport which has a regional administration unit involved in motorway widening, and which employs 130 people, and Mortgages plc, a financial services group, which employs 158. A successful diversification is thus clearly under way for a variety of reasons. The city does qualify for some government assistance as an intermediate development area, but it has not had new town or urban development status, and has not received large government grants to prime the pump for developers. The cheap cost of Coventry has, however, been a factor. In the late 1980s rents for offices were as low as Pounds 7 a sq ft compared with Pounds 15 for Birmingham. There was also an abundance of skilled labour following redundancies at car plants. Mr Myles Mackie, the investment and policy adviser at the city council, feels the accessibility of Coventry has also been important. He says, 'I know every town looking for investment claims it is the centre of England, but Coventry really is: we are the closest part of the Midlands to London - it's only an hour and 20 minutes by train. We're close to the motorways, but there is good internal access. The ring road actually works and there is little congestion in the city centre, unlike big cities, such as Birmingham.' But also important has been the ability of the local authority to provide the right kind of accommodation. The RSA Examination Board when it wanted to move out of London in 1988 appointed agents to find a new site. They found premises in Nottingham and Derby, but they were unsuitable because they were on industrial estates next to companies manufacturing. The Board wanted a clean business-like environment and the Westwood estate fitted the bill. Costs have risen since the late 1980s, and B1 business premises would now cost around Pounds 13 a sq ft., but this is still competitive with other relocation towns such as Milton Keynes, Peterborough and even Telford; 12 other industrial estates apart from the science park and the Westwood business park are open for business, representing several hundreds of acres of B1 space.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salah Budaywi] </F>   [Text] Diplomatic sources in Cairo have revealed that  secret negotiations have been going on between Washington and  Damascus since February toward reaching an agreement on a  working paper prepared by Washington on its concepts for  building what it called confidence among the three parties. The  paper emphasizes the fate of the Palestinian and Iranian  organizations and of other extremist movements such as the  Kurdish Workers Party.    During the meetings over the past few weeks, the United  States reviewed a list prepared by the CIA of hundreds of  leaders and members it claimed to be terrorists. It asked  Damascus to define its stance on these members either by  deporting them from Syria, arresting some of them, or handing  over others to Western countries on terrorist charges that go  back to the mid sixties.    The U.S. Congress asked the U.S. Administration to apply  pressure on Syria to normalize ties with the Zionists in return  for striking Syria off the list of countries supporting  terrorism and to hand over several leaders of organizations  labelled extremist to stand trial in U.S. federal courts,  including Ahmad Jibril, Abu-Nidal, and approximately 70 other  Palestinians.</p>

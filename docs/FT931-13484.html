			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Summers has thorny task of revitalising G7 HE is undoubtedly clever, forceful and articulate, but is he a natural diplomat? That is the question likely to be asked about Mr Lawrence Summers, named this week as under-secretary for international affairs at the US Treasury - the post held in the Bush administration by Mr David Mulford. At the Treasury, Mr Summers is likely to have prime responsibility in two crucial areas - economic policy co-ordination between the Group of Seven leading industrial countries and support for economic reform in the former Soviet republics. His new boss, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, has emphasised his desire to revitalise the G7. The delicate task is likely to fall to Mr Summers, who will spend a lot of time in coming months jetting between Bonn, Tokyo and London in search of a common approach to economic problems. The potential for conflict is considerable. The US badly wants other G7 powers to shore up its still fragile recovery by stimulating their own economies. Mr Summers is likely to argue that countries like Germany, should put less stress on fighting inflation and more on promoting growth and jobs. Mr Summers moves to the Treasury from the World Bank where he was serving as chief economist, on leave from his economics chair at Harvard University. He has long coveted a top Washington job, having served as economic adviser in the abortive 1988 Democratic presidential campaign. He initially set his sights on the chairmanship of President Bill Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers traditionally the top job for academic economists. That job went however to Ms Laura Tyson, an expert in trade and industrial policy at the University of California. But if confirmed by the Senate, Mr Summers may find the Treasury international post a sweet consolation prize. He will be intimately involved in day-to-day policymaking; the CEA, by contrast is an advisory body with no direct line responsibility. Nobody doubts Mr Summers' intellectual abilities. He received tenure at Harvard at the age of 28 and became a prolific author of academic papers in diverse fields, including tax theory (he is a trenchant supporter of investment tax credits), unemployment and the efficiency of financial markets. Some joke that he has economics in his blood: two of his uncles, Paul Samuelson and Kenneth Arrow, are Nobel laureates in economics. His parents are both economists. Mr Summers' stint at the World Bank, however, was not without controversy. Unusually for an academic, Mr Summers speaks with an assurance bordering on arrogance; he has an almost Thatcherite lack of self-doubt. Although he arrived at the bank with little prior experience of the third world, he lost no time in speaking out on controversial issues. His worst error at the World Bank was an insensitively written memo that appeared to advocate the dumping of toxic waste in less developed countries. According to him the memo was intended to spark internal debate, not a policy recommendation. It infuriated environmentalists and may have cost him a cabinet post in the Clinton administration. At the Treasury, similar mistakes of judgment could have far worse consequences.</p>

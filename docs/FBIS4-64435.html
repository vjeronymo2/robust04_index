			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Japan/Italy: Berlusconi Meets </F> Hata"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 3 -- Italy's premier-designate  Silvio Berlusconi had a half-hour informal meeting this evening  with Japan's new premier Tsutomu Hata, at the request of the  latter, "to say hello and get to know each other," Berlusconi's  spokesman said.    Japanese sources explained their premier's wish by recalling  the importance he places on the July Naples G-7 summit -- the  reason why he chose Italy to start a European tour which will  take him to Paris (tomorrow), Bonn and Brussels.    Separately, the premier-designate had talks with Italy's  Ambassador to the United States Boris Banchieri on U.S.  President Bill Clinton's June 2-3 visit to Italy.</p>

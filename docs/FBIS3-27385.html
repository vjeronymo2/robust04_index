This is the general principle  for guiding the 1994 financial work as set forth at the regional  financial work conference on 27 January. Qian Fenyong and Song  Zhimin, leaders of the region, attended the conference. Song  Zhimin gave a speech at the conference.    According to the financial work principles as set forth at  the national financial work conference and in line with actual  regional conditions, the regional financial department should  carry out its work in line with the following work priorities:    Strictly control aggregate credits. The state-owned  commercial banks should engage in the management of the  proportions of assets and liabilities according to the amounts  of loans, control the targets for the management of the  proportions of liabilities, and check on legal persons, that are  mainly regarded as a unit. Policy-lending banks should strictly  handle the defined policy-lending business. In regard to the  management of credits, the policy- lending banks should carry  out the principle of "planned management, credits for fixed  targets, management on the premise of maintenance of capital,  and self-balance;" and grant loans according to the state-fixed  targets. Except for the temporary use of capital, the central  bank must not offer funds. It is necessary to cut the  relationship between policy-lending loans and the basic currency  of the central bank, carry out the management of the proportions  of assets and liabilities among the non-banking financial  organizations according to different actual conditions, continue  to strictly control the aggregate foreign exchange loans, and  simultaneously readjust the proportions of the foreign exchange  structure and the property structure.    Try every possible means to increase bank savings and strive  to expand credit resources. All banks and urban and rural  credit cooperatives should continue to adopt various kinds of  positive measures to organize and assimilate bank savings,  strive to increase both urban and rural savings deposits over  1993, and increase at least 5 billion yuan of savings deposits  this year. The situation that enterprises registered a negative  increase in savings deposits should be changed. We should exert  efforts to improve service to assimilate savings deposit but  must not adopt the improper means, such as wantonly and  perfunctorily raising interest rates to attract savings  deposits. Various levels of people's banks and specialized  banks should strengthen the management and examination of  interest rates. Those violating regulations governing the  management of interest rates should sternly be investigated and  handled. At the time of firmly organizing forces to increase  savings deposits, we should exert great efforts to flexibly use  existing credits and increase usable capital.    Optimize the structure of loans and ensure the supply of  capital for key items. When assimilating savings deposits and  flexibly using existing capital, we should use the newly  increased portion of loans to meet the needs of key projects for  the region's economic development. We should positively support  agricultural and livestock production, ensure the supply of  funds for purchasing farm and livestock products, and positively  support the development of energy resources and transportation  service and the production of major raw materials for industrial  use. It is necessary to support the supply of funds for state  key construction projects; the development of high value-added  products, readily marketable products, and the industries and  products with high capability to create foreign exchange; the  supply of the funds for the state-owned large and medium-sized  enterprises with good economic results and the foreign export  trade enterprises; and the implementation of the  support-the-poor plan in the Eighth Five-Year Plan period.  Enterprises should be guided to enter markets and join  competition. We should concentrate funds and select a group of  town and township enterprises and key projects to accelerate  their technological transformation. To ensure the fulfillment  of the above targets, we should continue to carry out the  principle of supporting the good, controlling the bad, and  having both guarantee and control.    Continuously consolidate the financial order and  realistically strengthen supervision and control over financial  work. Last year, the region made positive achievements in  straightening out financial order. On the basis of the  achievements made last year, this year, we should continue to  expand achievements. It is necessary to continuously implement  the regulations on consolidating financial order as stipulated  last year. It is necessary to resolutely ferret out inter-bank  loans that were granted in violation of regulations. Loans that  cannot be withdrawn should clearly be investigated and the  responsible persons should be called to account. Economic  entities run by the banks themselves should be separated from  the banks. Under the unified leadership of the local party  committees and governments, the people's banks at various levels  should conscientiously and resolutely eliminate the problems of  arbitrarily collecting funds.    Positively support enterprises to transform the managerial  mechanisms and to conscientiously return the credits to the  banks. The financial departments should adopt a positive  attitude to help enterprises change their managerial mechanisms  and engage in reform and also pay attention to analyzing and  grasping the new situation and new problems cropping up in the  course of replacing the old system with the new in an effort to  avoid losing state credits and assets.    Strictly control loans for fixed assets. It is necessary to  continuously carry out mandatory plans for granting loans for  fixed assets. No one is allowed to grant loans for fixed assets  without approvals. People's banks at various levels should  strengthen the examination and auditing of loans for fixed  assets. Banking units and leaders of units that violate  policies should be called to account.</p>

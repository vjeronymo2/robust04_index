			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Observer: Cruiser bruiser Argentina has a new constitution today, which, as well as giving president Carlos Menem the chance of remaining in power for another four years, removes the old requirement that the president must be a Roman Catholic. It also bans discrimination of practically every shade and nuance. Someone should tell Antonio Quarracino, the Catholic archbishop of Buenos Aires. The bishop has little time for homosexuals, and uses his weekly television programme to air his less than politically correct opinions. Quarracino has just called for the creation of 'a zone where all the gays and lesbians can live with their laws, their television and even their own constitution, where they can live in a sort of separate country with great freedom. In this way we will clean an ignoble stain from the face of society'.</p>

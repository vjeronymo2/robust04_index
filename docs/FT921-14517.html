			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Bush moves away from short-term fix option PRESIDENT George Bush will focus on long-term growth measures in his State of the Union address to Congress later this month, an event viewed as a critical launch-pad for his 1992 re-election campaign. A White House statement suggested that Mr Bush was leaning away from proposals for a giveaway income tax cut for the middle class, and favoured measures such as an investment tax credit and capital gains tax cuts to stimulate the economy. Other options being considered are tax credits for first-time home buyers as well as tax relief to help people buy health insurance. These proposals would be paid for partly by cuts in defence spending. As well as opening his re-election campaign, the address, to be delivered on January 28, is also a chance for Mr Bush to rebound from his record low approval rating among voters. Mr Marlin Fitzwater, White House press spokesman, said Mr Bush was close to wrapping up the key decisions on an economic growth package. This would be accompanied by general proposals for health care reform. 'The president intends to have a long-term growth and investment package, it will be designed . . . as a stimulus for the economy and to ensure long-term growth,' he said. Mr Bush's proposals would be along the lines of 'long-term growth and investment, what creates jobs, what protects people's homes, what protects the interest rates they have'. Last week, Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, again cautioned against the dangers of a fiscal 'quick fix' which would increase the federal budget deficit, already expected to exceed Dollars 350bn (Pounds 195bn) this year. Mr Greenspan also said in Congressional testimony that the American public was mainly concerned about poor long-term prospects. Another factor influencing Mr Bush is that several prominent Democrats, including Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the early front-runner in the Democratic presidential race, have called for a modest tax cut for the middle class as a short-term fix for the economy. Mr Fitzwater attacked the Democrat proposals. These ideas 'deserve a lot of criticism', he said. US retailers suffer, Page 6 Editorial Comment, Page 18</p>

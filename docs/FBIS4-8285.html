			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, April 11 -- U.S. Deputy Secretary of State  Strobe Talbott told a Monday press conference, summing up his  official visit to Poland, that the American administration  supports Polish reforms and will back the introduction of Polish  goods to Western markets. He said that the United States are  proud of their contribution to Poland's success and stressed  that they are the biggest foreign investor in Poland.    Talbott disclosed that apart from issues related to economy  his talks focused on Poland's efforts to enter the European  security structures. The American politician added that the  "Partnership for Peace" programme is a way leading to NATO but  added that the date of Poland's admittance into the organization  remains an open question.    Talbott expressed the conviction that Poland appreciated the  significance of her participation in the "Partnership for Peace"  programme. He explained that the programme aims at stepping up  Poland's integration with NATO and that the creation of  mechanisms allowing for the transition from the era of divisions  and competition to the era of integration and cooperation  remains at the foundation of the programme.    Talbott recalled that Poland's security and independence of  other countries of eastern and central Europe are of special  significance for the United States. He stressed that the  American administration was of the opinion that there can be no  spheres of influence in this part of Europe and the countries in  this region should maintain equal-footing relations,  irrespective of their potential.</p>

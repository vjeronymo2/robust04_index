			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Varshava Maksimova] </F>   [Text] Today Professor Krustyu Petkov, leader of the  Confederation of Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria [KNSB],  met with the leadership of the Bulgarian Economic Chamber [BSK].  Both sides expressed the view that the present government has  finally changed over to an antisocial stance.    After the meeting, Krustyu Petkov stated that since the  Berov  cabinet is illegitimate and it is impossible to conduct a  serious dialogue with it, he will resort to an unusual approach  for our country, namely, for the trade unions and employers to  hold bilateral talks on topical problems. He said that tomorrow  it is likely that the two sides -- the KNSB and BSK -- will sign  a document in which they will call upon other social partners to  join them.    This afternoon the KNSB Executive Committee held a session  to  discuss the draft project that the Council of Ministers has  submitted for compensating incomes during the second quarter  that, in his words, was like throwing dust in the eyes of the  trade unions and the discontented population.    During the next few days, the KNSB will also discuss  specific  forms for applying trade union pressure, including boycotting  the payment of bills for thermal and electric power, with the  aim of unblocking the accord reached on income policy from the  beginning of the year.</p>

			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Survey of Saxony (2): Industry battles to catch up - Past economic mismanagement carries a high price tag IN THE centre of Dresden, a big yellow sign proclaims that the war-bombed ruins of the Taschenberg Palace, now a gaping baroque facade, are to be turned into a luxury hotel. An hour along the motorway, in Chemnitz, the remnants of a demolished chemical factory are being removed to make way for a new business park. Piles of scrap machinery lie next to a neat red brick building which will be retained as a link with the past. Further west, the cathedral in Zwickau - near to the site where Volkswagen is building a big car plant - is covered in scaffolding. At one end of the dark, vaulted interior, restorers put back a gilded female figure on the high 15th century altar. Across the road, Horten, the West German store group, has installed itself in modern premises. Jeans and T-shirts are on sale in an old, unpainted building nearby. Signs of regeneration such as these abound in Saxony, the state in eastern Germany which once led the country in industrialisation. It was here that the world's first mechanical cloth-weaving looms, portable typewriters, and single-lens reflex cameras were made. Chemnitz and Zwickau were important centres of the pre-war car industry; the four-ring emblem of Audi (a VW subsidiary) represents the four Saxon companies that merged to form the carmaker. Long before that, the state had prospered from silver mining in the Erz mountains. But while Saxony can look back to a rich economic and cultural past, linking up with that tradition after more than 40 years of central planning is proving costly and traumatic. Few local companies can survive in their pre-unification form, if at all, a notable exception being Meissen, the renowned porcelain manufacturer. As in the rest of East Germany, industry in Saxony was subordinated to the ruthless demands of communist planners. Production targets came before environmental needs, selling to eastern Europe took precedence over satisfying local consumers, and industrial concentration supplanted diversity. The sorry results are plain to see. Industry lagged well behind western standards of innovation, technology, and productivity as output was forced ahead and investment neglected. With the coming of the D-Mark, the unsuitability of many products for western markets and the unrealistic cost basis of East German industry were ruthlessly exposed. The collapse of Comecon was a further blow. Among the hardest hit sectors have been textiles, electrical and electronic goods, iron, steel, and metalworking, timber and plastics processing, and engineering. Because Saxony accounted for a third of East Germany's industrial output, the state is paying the price for economic mismanagement. While unemployment is below eastern Germany's average, at about 14 per cent or 326,000 people, a further 101,000 are in temporary job creation schemes, 150,000 are being retrained, and 122,000 are on short time. Many more have simply retired early. Investment to create new jobs is flowing in, but it will take years before Saxon industry catches up with the west. Along the way, though, the state will obtain some of the world's most modern facilities. Apart from big corporate investors such as VW, Siemens, Bosch, MAN, Linde, Quelle, and Degussa from Germany and Philips (Netherlands), Enso-Gutzeit (Finland), the Swiss-Swedish ABB, Tarmac (UK), Coca-Cola, and Philip Morris (US) from abroad, there is a high volume of spending on new infrastructure. By the end of the century, some DM15bn will have been spent on telecommunications in Saxony. Last year, DM1.8bn went on roads and DM2.5bn on the rail system, with DM2.75bn being spent this and next year on the energy network. Large sums are going on the refurbishment and reconstruction of public buildings and facilities. 'Saxony had the telecoms and traffic infrastructure of 1939,' says Mr Rudiger Thiele, state secretary at Saxony's economics ministry. Large though the flow of new business investment may be - some DM50bn, including future spending commitments - it lags behind the region's needs. Officials would like more foreign investment. 'Foreign companies can't ignore east Germany and Saxony,' says Mr Walter Rogg, chief executive of the Saxony Economic Development Corporation. 'Lots of companies are waiting to see how things develop. The infrastructure will be better later, but financial incentives will not be so generous and the best workers will have been taken.' Mr Helmut Wotte, head of the Dresden branch of the Treuhand, the East German privatisation agency, agrees. 'We need a more international touch in our investments. Some companies, like the Japanese, want hard and fast information; they are only interested in companies they can assess under their own standards.' Yet companies in Saxony have not reached the stage at which this is possible. Hence it is mostly German companies, motivated by both national and business considerations, which have taken the investment plunge. It is not only in manufacturing, construction and services where this has occurred. They were also quick to snap up opportunities in the food and drink sector, where investment in breweries, dairies, slaughterhouses and other facilities is likely to total about DM3bn. Saxony's beer and wine, at least, will survive the transition to the free market.</p>

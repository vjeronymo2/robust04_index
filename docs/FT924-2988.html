			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / World Trade News: European chemicals have 'last chance' EUROPE'S petrochemical industry has one last chance to rationalise itself to avoid a disorderly and disastrous restructuring during the next down-cycle, Mr Michael Bennett, a director at the consultants Arthur D. Little, warned yesterday. He said at the FT's petrochemical conference in London that the European industry had to rationalise to make itself globally competitive. The main threat to European producers remains Asian output, which is set to increase rapidly. Mr Mohammed Al-Kathiri, general manager of Sabic Marketing in Europe, said that by the year 2000 34 per cent of petrochemical demand would be in the Asia-Pacific region, 28 per cent in western Europe and 24 per cent in the US. Mr Pramote Chaiyavech, technical director of Thailand's National Petrochemical Corp, who called on European companies to invest in the region, predicted annual south-east Asian ethylene production would increase from 915,000 tonnes a year in 1992 to 2.4bn by the end of the decade. The region has benefited from advantageous gas feed stocks. North-east Asian capacity was expanding faster than regional demand, but might be saved by rapid growth in China, the region's largest potential market, Mr Al-Kathiri said. This could suck in capacity from Korea and the Middle East. New 'star' petrochemical products included methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and PTA, said Mr Reynaldo Ortiz, petrochemical division manager at International Finance Corp. He warned that markets for other overnight wonders had quickly suffered from overcapacity. Public trust in the industry had fallen steeply over the past decade, warned Mr James Lindhelm, chairman of Burson-Marsteller Europe. The industry had to improve its environmental performance.</p>

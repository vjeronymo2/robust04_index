			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Hurd tells Tories to unite over Europe Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday appealed to Conservative MPs to put aside deep divisions about Europe before the elections for the European parliament. Mr Hurd, who chairs a committee drawing up the Conservative manifesto for the June 9 elections, said the party must show 'conviction and unity' to the voters. He said the manifesto, which the party is expected to publish next month, would offer a 'positive and distinctive' approach based on the strength of the member states. Mr Hurd told West Oxfordshire Conservatives that there was 'a strong and healthy instinct' among Tory MPs 'not to scratch at the old wounds but to look to the future'. He said: 'Building on the economic recovery which becomes clearer every day, we must show that conviction and that unity to the voters.' Mr David Hunt, the pro-European employment secretary, was among several cabinet ministers yesterday who warned that a Labour victory in the elections would lead to more European Union intervention in the UK. Mr John Major, the prime minister, told party workers in London that he was 'confident' about the future. 'If the polls were to be believed, I would have lost the last general election,' he said.</p>

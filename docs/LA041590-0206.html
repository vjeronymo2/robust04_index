			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE OF THE SPOON  </P> <P> Designers are rethinking the traditional look of knife, fork and spoon. New  cutlery pieces range from sleekly sculptural to playful: spoons shaped like  colored fish with checkerboard tails, and knives like sinuously curving bars of  silver.  </P> <P> High-priced styles are still fashioned of traditional silver and gold, but less  expensive cutlery is now made of aluminum, brass, wrought iron and plastic.  </P> <P> Many of today's cutlery designers come from a fashion or jewelry background and  describe their flatware as "functional sculpture." Izabel Lam, who creates  undulating bronze and silver cutlery, apprenticed with fashion designers  Geoffrey Beene and Calvin Klein. "A knife and fork must fit snugly into the  hand. It's just like designing clothes -- they both must fit the moving body,"  she explains.  </P> <P> But what about washing these miniature sculptures? Kirsten Hawthorne, a painter  and photographer turned flatware artist, swears that her utensils of sterling,  gold plate and sandblasted plexiglass are dishwasher-safe. But some of these  avant-garde creations cost up to $110 apiece; it may be prudent to wash this  new cutlery the old-fashioned way.  </P></p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Forte leaps 62% to Pounds 60m Forte yesterday announced interim pre-tax profits ahead 62 per cent from Pounds 37m to Pounds 60m and issued its most optimistic assessment of future prospects in years. Mr Rocco Forte, the hotel and restaurant group's chairman, said profits so far in the second half were well ahead of last year. Mr Forte warned, however, that UK consumer confidence was still fragile and that there was little sign of a 'feelgood factor'. Much of the group's profit improvement was the result of an increase in corporate spending. Forte's increase in half-year profits, which were above City expectations, comes at the end of a highly successful month. In the past fortnight Forte has defeated its French rival Accor to win control of Meridien, the international hotel chain owned by Air France. It has also been granted a formal say in the management of the Savoy group, in which it holds a majority of shares but a minority of votes. Sales from continuing operations were up 7 per cent to Pounds 859m in the six months to July 31. The interim dividend was 2.75p, the same as last year, on earnings per share up 75 per cent to 4.9p. Dividend cover was 1.7, compared with 1 a year ago. Mr Forte said, however, it was right to maintain the dividend at the halfway stage. He said: 'We are in a recovery situation. Our dividend cover is not where it should be.' Profits from the worldwide hotels business rose 47 per cent to Pounds 66m (Pounds 45m) on sales up 8 per cent to Pounds 494m (Pounds 457m). London hotels performed particularly strongly, with occupancies up 8 percentage points on last year. Achieved average room rates - the amount actually paid by guests rather than the hotels' official rates - rose 6 per cent. Provincial hotels in the UK enjoyed a 6 point rise in occupancy, although average achieved room rate fell 1 per cent. In continental Europe occupancies rose 7 points but achieved room rates fell 4 per cent. Forte's restaurants saw profits rise 13 per cent to Pounds 35m (Pounds 31m) on sales up 3 per cent to Pounds 322m (Pounds 313m). The number of meals served at Little Chef, Happy Eater and Welcome Break fell slightly because of the weakness of leisure spending, the hot summer and disruption from roadworks. Average amounts spent rose, however. Improvements to the Relais restaurant chain in France resulted in an increase in profits despite a fall in traffic on French autoroutes. See Lex</p>

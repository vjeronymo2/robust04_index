			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Pacific nations hail era of unity Leaders of Pacific rim countries set out a vision of economic partnership at the weekend which they said would give the Asia Pacific region a new voice in world affairs and would spearhead global growth in the 21st century. Although they stopped far short of establishing a formal economic community, the leaders from the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation grouping indicated gathering momentum by agreeing to meet next year in Jakarta. They also called a meeting of finance ministers to discuss macroeconomic developments and capital flows. The heads of government of the US, Japan, China, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Brunei, with ministers from Taiwan and Hong Kong, met for six hours in a replica Indian log longhouse on Blake Island, near Seattle. The leaders issued a 'vision statement' that steered clear of the many bilateral issues dividing Apec members and contained few specific commitments. However, it said: 'Our economies are moving toward interdependence and there is a growing sense of community among us.' The region, they noted, accounts for 40 per cent of the world's population and 50 per cent of its gross national product. The statement's vagueness underlined the nervousness of Asian countries about creating new formal structures for co-operation, and particularly about agreeing to anything that might be interpreted as submitting to US domination. The leaders were emphatic that they were not trying to establish an exclusive trade bloc and that they were determined to win a strengthened General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

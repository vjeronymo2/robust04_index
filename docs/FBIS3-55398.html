			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By BELINFORM correspondent Vladimir Glod for TASS] </F>   [Text] Minsk, 6 Jan -- In an exclusive interview with a  BELINFORM correspondent, Belarus Supreme Soviet Chairman  Stanislaw Shushkevich confirmed the report distributed by TASS  channels about his forthcoming meeting with Russian President  Boris Yeltsin.    The speaker of the Belarusian parliament said the meeting  will take place next week. During the meeting, the two sides  will adjust their positions before the forthcoming arrival in  Moscow and Minsk of U.S. President Bill Clinton and will also  discuss a wide range of problems of Belarusian-Russian  relations. Stanislaw Shushkevich said that at the meeting with  Boris Yeltsin "I will put forward not my own personal point of  view but the united opinion of the members of the Presidium of  the Supreme Soviet, who have thoroughly studied the proposals  put forward by the government and the National Bank of Belarus."    Stanislaw Shushkevich said the statement of the heads of  governments of Belarus and Russia, which was signed yesterday  but which has not yet been supplemented by the signing of  documents specifying the mechanism for its implementation, is  more like a declaration of intent.    Concerning Bill Clinton's forthcoming visit to Minsk, the  head of the Belarusian parliament noted that the talks between  the Belarusian and U.S. sides "will be conceptual." "If we  resolve conceptually such problems as disarmament, conversion,  and the monetary question, then the subsequent signing of the  relevant documents will be essentially a technical task."    Stanislaw Shushkevich said he was very surprised to read in  the media that Belarusian government head Vyachaslaw Kebich said  that he "expects Belarus to be able to join NATO after Russia  joins." The speaker explained that all of Belarus's most  important documents specify its policy of neutrality and of not  adhering to any blocs. "We have a totally different foreign  policy doctrine centered on neutrality," Stanislaw Shushkevich  said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Geir Salvesen report: "War of Nerves Over Agriculture"] </F>   [Text] Brussels -- "Disheartening," Trade Minister Grete  Knudsen said of the latest EU [European Union] proposal on  agricultural support. Now the war of nerves will begin.    Norway is pursuing a tough negotiating line in the final  spurt of the EU negotiations. Yesterday Trade Minister Grete  Knudsen refused to agree to a proposal from the EU to the effect  that only regions north of the 62d parallel should enjoy  additional agricultural support. She made it clear that the  whole of Norway must be covered by any such arrangement.    Briefly, the EU's proposal is that the Nordic countries can  give additional agricultural support to the regions north of the  62d parallel and only in rare cases elsewhere.    For Norway this would mean that only the regions north of  Maloy in the west and Femunden in the east would be considered  to have such difficult conditions affecting cultivation that  they can be given lasting support arrangements. Another  criteria is that the regions that qualify for support must have  fewer than eight inhabitants per square kilometer.    During yesterday's relatively short negotiating meeting, it  emerged that the EU had adopted the 62d parallel because in its  fisheries policy Norway has defined northern regions through the  use of this line of latitude.    However, in the view of the Norwegian negotiators these two  things have nothing to do with each other. There are a number  of regions in southern Norway that also have extremely difficult  growing conditions.    Grete Knudsen told the EU representatives that Norway is  remaining firm on a system of support that is based on the  number of growing days -- that is, the number of days every year  when there is enough sun and warmth for agricultural produce to  grow. One hundred and ninety growing days or less has been  proposed as the limit.    Finnish Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto said that Finland  would ideally like to have everything north of the 60th parallel  defined as Nordic agriculture, and 180 growing days as the  limit. Norway and Finland are coordinating their policies in  this area.    Nor is Knudsen satisfied with the EU's latest initiative in  the field of regional policy, even though we are here probably  much closer to a negotiated agreement.    The EU has proposed that the four northernmost provinces in  Norway -- Finnmark, Troms, Nordland, and Nord-Trondelag --  should receive regional support from the EU's structural fund.    The EU wants to introduce a completely new target category  for regional support for the three Nordic countries. The  so-called Objective 6 category will be in addition to the five  categories the EU already has today.    Ideally, Finland and Norway would like the countries to be  covered by the Objective 1 classification that is the EU's main  tool for support for regions where people have an annual income  lower than the EU average. In practice support is given to  areas where the average income is less than 80 percent of the EU  average, and Norway takes the view that this is why this  classification should be used.    "If Objective 6 embraces the same as we want -- Objective 1  -- then it makes no difference what it is called," Grete Knudsen  said.    Like her Nordic counterparts, she will now take a closer  look  at the effect this will have on Norway, but the prospect is for  a 10-percent-lower level of support with Objective 6 than  Objective 1 would have given.    The EU is proposing a 175 million ECU -- around 1.5 billion  kroner -- framework for regional support in the Nordic area.  Norway would probably receive around one-third of this money.    Negotiations have not even started on the most difficult  problems in the agricultural sector -- such as the demand for  introduction of EU prices for agricultural produce from day one  of membership. These problems are being saved up until the  upcoming "superweekend," but the fronts seem deadlocked. Here  Norway is standing shoulder to shoulder with Finland and Austria.</p>

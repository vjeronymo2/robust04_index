			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Clydesdale Gp defers introduction CLYDESDALE Group, the Glasgow-based electrical goods retailer, has postponed the Stock Exchange flotation scheduled for later this month. It said that profits, though showing a substantial increase, were below expectations. Operating profits in the year to April 3 1993 were Pounds 5.62m, compared with Pounds 4.4m in the previous 14 months. But it had forecast operating profits of about Pounds 7m, and that was included in a report on the company by NatWest Securities, its broker. Group sales were Pounds 141m, a 27 per cent rise on the Pounds 111m of 1991-92. A direct year-on-year comparison showed growth of 42 per cent. Clydesdale said current trading and expansion strategies had proved successful in a poor economic climate and it was well placed for an upturn in consumer confidence. It had made a good start to the current year and was optimistic about the outturn for the year as a whole. The company wants to float on the basis of better profit figures, which could mean waiting a year. The flotation would have raised Pounds 30m in new money to wipe out most of its borrowing and to finance further expansion in England. It had been expected to value the company at about Pounds 80m.</p>

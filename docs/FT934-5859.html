			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: New issues The Pounds 3bn of new issues which the equity market has swallowed this year is causing some tummy rumbles. With institutional investors grumbling about poor quality issues and the ambitious prices, sponsors would be wise to defer remaining flotations until next year. The looming Budget and recent wobbles in the equity market have proved unsettling, while the glutted market has produced some disappointing take-ups. The collapse of Swithland Group soon after its attempted float marks the mood of the times. Another deterrent to investors has been the poor stagging opportunities on new issues. The book-building techniques used for bigger flotations have enabled vendors to achieve high prices, but disillusion quickly spreads if a company's performance disappoints. Next year's crop of possible big flotations, including William Hill and House of Fraser, may have to be more keenly priced. The absence of trade buyers this year should perhaps also induce a mood of caution. That, though, may reflect the different risk calculations between fund managers and industrialists. Money managers, who view the world in terms of relative performance, can afford to chance their arm provided their peers all bet the same. Industrial managers are driven by absolute standards and must be sure of better odds. Just one mistake will cost them dear. That said, if the present cycle follows previous patterns - and recent US experience - the wave of flotations may well be followed by a rise in corporate mergers and acquisitions. Indeed, for those brave enough to dare, it might be the perfect time for leveraged buy - outs. With borrowing costs at their lowest for a generation and the economy swinging upwards, there could be high rewards for those with enough gall to persuade the banks to lend them money.</p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPERA REVIEW;  </P> <P> ODDBALL TRIPLE BILL IN LONG BEACH  </P> <P> By now, 11 years after its inaugural production, Long Beach Opera seems to have  carved for itself a place in the national scene. And that place is unique.  </P> <P> What, for instance, could be comparable to the oddball triple bill impresario  Michael Milenski is presenting this week, in place of the originally promised  (now rescheduled) "Pelleas et Melisande"?  </P> <P> This three-part program, now showing in Center Theater at the Long Beach  Convention Center, offers Pergolesi's frothy intermezzo from 1737, "Livietta  and Tracollo," Stravinsky's non-sung entertainment, "The Soldier's Tale" (1918)  and Mark McGurty's recent, dramatic scena, "The Anatole Cycle."  </P> <P> Not a real opera in the bunch, but a fascinating evening in the operatic  theater, nonetheless.  </P> <P> As staged resourcefully by Nancy Keystone and Brian Kulick and conducted  vibrantly by Richard Cordova, these pieces worked, dramatically and musically,  and gave deep pleasures at the opening Saturday night.  </P> <P> With orchestras of four players, seven players and a single pianist,  respectively, they also made aural sense in the 750-seat opera house Milenski  likes to use -- though the last one, "The Anatole Cycle," was actually written  for a sizable instrumental ensemble. The sound there -- even as valiantly  played by pianist Vicki Ray -- had to disappoint for its lack of color and  weight.  </P> <P> Still, McGurty's wrenching cantata for baritone, narrator and orchestra on  poems of grief by Stephane Mallarme, made a strong impact. Written after the  death of the composer's friend, conductor Thomas Michalak, the half-hour piece  probes the nature of loss and its attendant furies.  </P> <P> Peter Van Derick, singing in French (Milenski and McGurty wisely eschewed an  English translation of the baritone part), gave a powerful, faceted and  touching performance of the half-hour work. He was assisted ably by actress  Camille Ameen and pianist Ray.  </P> <P> Another impressive baritone, Matthew Lau, dominated the chamber-size  performance of Pergolesi's "Livietta and Tracollo," given in the English  versions of Goldovsky and Cordova.  </P> <P> With soprano Mary Paul, Lau carried out Keystone's clever but unobtrusive  staging smoothly and gave full value to the composer's demanding and rangey  vocal writing. They were helped in no small way by actors Scott Wade, Teresa  Jones and Michael Rivkin.  </P> <P> Kulick's pointed, surrealistic staging and the tight, no-nonsense choreography  of Larry Hyman meshed successfully in the Stravinsky work, which was designed,  as were the other pieces, by Mark Wendland (scenery), Christine Dougherty  (costumes) and Kathy Pryzgoda (lighting).  </P> <P> Ned Bellamy proved a charismatic Devil, Brent Hinkley a three-dimensional  Soldier and Ameen the well-spoken Narrator in this vivid reconsideration of  Stravinsky's piece. Christine Kellogg and Aimee Levine (the Devil's assistants)  and Naomi Goldberg (Princess) assisted, effortlessly.  </P> <P> The triple bill will be repeated Wednesday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m.  </P></p>

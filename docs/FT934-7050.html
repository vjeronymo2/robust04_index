			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Opera conductors, oui bus conductors, non: Michael Skapinker tests the new airport bus in Paris Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris has its own way of adding to the disorientation of a traveller arriving in an unfamiliar city. Getting to the city centre by rail involves a ride first on an airport bus to the nearby RER suburban railway station. Then follows a battle to figure out how the RER connects with the Metro underground system, for French railway maps lack the clean-lined simplicity of their UK counterparts. Hence the attraction of the new Roissy Bus service from the airport to the Paris Opera in the centre of the city. The advantage of this service, which leaves the airport every 15 minutes, is that you use only one mode of transport. At FFr30 each way, it also costs less than taking a taxi. However, the experience of a recent one-day trip to Paris from London suggests that the bus is best avoided. The vagaries of the city's traffic make the service too unreliable for anyone with appointments to keep and flights to catch. My journey from Charles de Gaulle began at 11.35am. Despite repeated warnings of imminent traffic snarl-ups on lighted signs above the motorway, the bus kept moving. The only incident was a near collision with a car - shrugged off by both parties without any swearing or hooting. We arrived at the Opera at 12.18 pm - total journey time 43 minutes. The relatively painless ride resulted in a decision to take the bus back to the airport, leaving the Opera at 6pm. With a British Airways flight back to London at 7.30pm, it was cutting it a little fine, but I assumed there would be less traffic on the way back than there had been at mid-day on my way in. This was a mistake. The traffic leaving the city was so heavy that I finally arrived at the airport at 7.15pm - tight for time and only just able to get on to the flight. So it will be back to the railway in future. The same journey by RER and Metro costs FFr39.50 and should take about 40 minutes. Understanding that system may requires a little concentration but it has the advantage of being reliable - provided no industrial action is taking place.</p>

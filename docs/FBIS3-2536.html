			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Feature" by correspondent Lou Wanghao (2869 2598 4110) and </F> reporter Zheng Qingdong (6774 1987 2639): "Jiakexi! (Good)  Yakudu! (Good) -- An Account of a Midnight Meeting Among  Minority People's Deputies"]    [Text] Beijing, 8 Mar (XINHUA) -- This was a spontaneous  gathering. This is a vivid portrayal of great national unity.    At 2300 [1400 GMT] on 7 March, a happy atmosphere filled the  hall on the first floor of the Jingxi Hotel. A dozen people's  deputies dressed in minority costumes gathered in the hall,  singing happily, laughing heartily, and exchanging views on the  old days and new happenings. Although they were of different  nationalities and had language problems, they shook hands  warmly; they shared the same views; their smiles were full of  warmth; they exchanged greetings....    After arriving in Beijing, the minority deputies of the  delegation representing the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region  were very happy to learn that the delegation from Tibet  Autonomous Region was also staying in the same hotel. Someone  contacted the Tibet delegation. By now the Tibet delegation,  which had just arrived in Beijing after a tiring journey, was  well rested. Upon learning that the fraternal deputies from the  Xinjiang delegation wished to meet them, members of the Tibet  delegation joyfully jumped out of bed, dressed in their best  national costumes, and rushed downstairs to meet the deputies of  the Xinjiang delegation.    Some deputies of the Tibet and Xinjiang delegations knew  each  other while some met for the first time. However, when the  deputies of Uygur and Kirgiz nationalities from Xinjiang, who  were wearing little flower hats and white felt hats, met with  the Tibetan deputies wearing Tibetan costumes, it was especially  warm like relatives meeting one another.    "Zhaxidele!" (Tibetan for may your wishes come true)    "Jiakexi!" (Kirgiz for how are you)    Laughter, greetings, and chats continued, and the deputies  were very excited. The atmosphere was very warm. In groups of  three or five, they talked about the past, discussing reform and  changes.    Speaking most enthusiastically were [Ashanbaike Tuerdi],  head  of the Kizilsu Kirgiz Autonomous Prefecture, and  [Luosangjiangchun], head of the Nagu Prefectural Administrative  Office. As they came from a pastoral area, they talked  ceaselessly about reform and economic development in their  respective areas.    Deputy [Luosangjiangchun] said: "In the past few years, as a  result of carrying out reform in Tibet's pastoral areas, animal  husbandry has developed rapidly, thus raising herdsmen's living  standard by a big margin. In 1993, per-capita income of Tibet's  herdsmen topped 700 yuan, and each herdsman owned an average of  50 head of livestock. This situation means the people feel  secure; there is social stability; there is national unity; and  there is economic development."    After hearing this story, Deputy [Ashanbaike Tuerdi] said:  "Good! Good!" Continuing speaking, he said: "There are more  than 100,000 Kirgiz people in our prefecture. Although our  development is not as rapid as yours, the people's living  conditions have improved tremendously in recent years. Taking  advantage of geographical position, we have increased our income  considerably by developing border trade and enlivening the  market."    [Luosangjiangchun] said happily: "All of us have witnessed  changes. It is really good!"    They continued talking, but no words could describe their  joy  and happiness. They agreed they should learn from each other,  advance together, strengthen unity, and prosper together.    These words by Amudun Niyaz, Uygur nationality deputy from  Xinjiang, reflected the common desire of the deputies of various  nationalities: "National unity, social stability, and economic  development -- this constitutes the foundation for the  prosperity of the Chinese nation. If we can do this, the living  conditions of minority nationalities will, like the rest of the  country, improve year by year, and the days ahead will become  sweeter and sweeter!"</p>

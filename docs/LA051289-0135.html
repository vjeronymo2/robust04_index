			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Eric Vanderarden of Belgium continued his surge toward the lead, winning two  stages of the Tour de Trump bicycle race.  </P> <P> Vanderaerden, who began the day in third place, 2:09 behind overall leader Dag  Otto Lauritzen, rode conservatively through much of the 97-mile Charlottesville  to Richmond Road Race before using his teammates' drafting help to win the  sixth stage in 3 hours 21 minutes 29 seconds.  </P> <P> Vanderaerden also won the night nine-mile Richmond Individual Time Trial in  18:47 and trails Lauritzen, a former Norwegian police officer and military  officer, by one minute with three stages left.  </P> <P> "Maybe it's too much to make up," said Vanderaerden, who has gained nearly  three minutes on the leader in the last five days with four victories and one  second-place finish. "But I must think positive and maybe I can catch him."  </P> <P> Conserving energy, Vanderaerden rode in the back of the main field and then  followed several of his teammates on the second of two 3.5-mile laps in the  financial district of the state capital. As he had done three previous times,  Vanderaerden outsprinted the field for the win.  </P> <P> Michael Zanoli of the Netherlands finished second in the road race, and Soviet  amateur Viatcheslav Ekimov was third. In the time trial, Ekimov was second in  18:54, followed by Kent Bostick of Corrales, N.M, in 18:56.  </P> <P> Lauritzen finished sixth and 12th.  </P></p>

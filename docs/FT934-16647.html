			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / International Company News: Congress holds key to Telebras sale - Privatisation hinges on abolition of monopoly FOREIGN investors have played a central role in making Telebras, Brazil's state-owned telecommunications holding company, the flagship of the Sao Paulo stock exchange. They will be keenly watching the expected Congressional debate over whether to abolish the state's constitutionally-guaranteed monopoly over the sector  -an essential first step towards privatisation. Telebras often accounts for more than half the trading on the Sao Paulo stock market, whose market capitalisation last month topped Dollars 100bn for the first time. The government owns more than 50 per cent of voting shares, which make up one-third of total capital. Mr Stephen Rose, of London stockbrokers Stephen Rose and Partners, says 24 per cent of the company is held by the government and more than a quarter by foreign investors. The debate over the state monopoly - part of the constitutional revision process beginning tomorrow - will take place in a climate of uncertainty for Telebras. A scandal revolving around an alleged extortion attempt by the company's former finance director prompted the board to suspend international capital markets operations. A Y10bn Eurobond was cancelled, while a planned Dollars 150m Eurobond and a share offering of up to Dollars 500m in American depositary receipts (ADRs) were put on hold. Some analysts now expect that the group's ambitious Dollars 3.5bn investment programme for 1993 will have to be slowed as cash flow is channelled into paying 1992 dividends. A survey by the Brazilian Institute of Political Studies suggests that the elimination of the monopoly might be an uphill battle. In the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house, 45 per cent of legislators questioned said it was 'extremely' or 'very' important for the government to operate directly in telecommunications, compared with 35 per cent who said it was 'not very necessary' or 'unnecessary'. 'Except for cellular telephones, the sector will probably remain a state mono-poly . . . this being a strategic sector,' predicted Mr Humberto Lucena, president of the Senate. Pro-privatisation forces have not lost hope, however. 'It will be a difficult fight, but there are already groups in Congress working on this,' said Mr Renato Johnsson, a leading advocate of privatisation. Those in favour of privatisation may be aided by the bribery scandal. A Salomon Brothers report predicted that the scandal would strengthen the pro-privatisation lobby. It added that the episode could also bolster the case of those who defend a US-style regional break-up over a unitary sale of the Telebras conglomerate, with its 27 regional and one long-distance subsidiaries. Leading subsidiaries 'have longed to escape from the control of the holding company', said the Salomon report. In spite of the controversy, Telebras shares have remained above Dollars 30 for a 1,000-share lot, up from about Dollars 18 at the start of the year. The stock had gained steadily since the government announced early this year that it would permit real increases in fees, reversing initial indications that prices would be held down in order to fight inflation. This was reflected in Telebras' recent results, which showed net profits of USDollars 1.23bn for the first eight months of the year compared with Dollars 431m in the same 1992 period. However, the tumult could hurt investment plans. Until the recent suspensions of its planned operations, Telebras had successfully tapped capital markets. 'We'll easily pass our investment goal of Dollars 3.5bn this year,' the company predicted in August, adding that it was also ahead of its target for the installation of new lines. The proposed ADR offering was part of Telebras' search to fund investments to increase the number of telephone lines to 11.7m from 10.5m by the end of this year, with a goal of 15m by 1995. Brazil has 6.8 lines per 100 inhabitants, lagging Argentina (11.8) and Uruguay (13.9). If there is any slowdown in investment for 1993, analysts say, it will only be evident during the final months of the year, as dividend outlays and suspended capital market operations take their toll. Meanwhile, the closure of access to new finance is strengthening the arguments of those who favour privatisation. 'We have to recognise that the state doesn't have the resources,' said Mr Johnsson.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 14 SAPA -- The international  mediation effort has struck "insurmountable problems,"  Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer said on Thursday  [14 April] after meeting mediator Henry Kissinger.    Mr Meyer said that as far as government was concerned the  mediation could continue, but the problems surrounding the terms  of reference "will cause this current effort not to continue".    Asked whether the mediation, which was intended to resolve  outstanding constitutional difficulties between the African  National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party would be  abandoned, Mr Meyer said: "On the basis of them accepting that  there is no clarity on the terms of refence that is  unfortunately the position".    Mr Meyer said the divisive issue was not which particular  terms of reference would be used by the mediators, but the issue  of the election date.    He said the ANC believed there was no linkage between the  election date and mediation, while the IFP [Inkatha Freedom  Party] argued that there was a linkage.    He said government's position was that the elections should  go ahead as scheduled.    The mediators were due to address the media at 1PM on their  plans.    IFP negotiator Ben Ngubane said he was still hopeful that  the  mediation could go ahead. Another IFP negotiator said government  was prepared to go back to the original terms of reference that  did not mention the election date but that this still had to be  cleared with the ANC.    ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa was due to meet the  mediators at Thursday lunchtime.    However, Mr Meyer said the issue was not what document was  used but how mediation would affect the election date. "The  election date is fixed and we are proceeding on that basis," he  said.    He said it was "very unfortunate" that the mediators had  come  to South Africa when there was no agreement on the terms of  reference. He said Dr Kissinger had taken the "correct position"  in saying that the mediation did not include negotiations on the  election date.    He said the government was still prepared to involve itself  in mediation and in other attempts to resolve problems with the  IFP and with the Zulu king.</p>

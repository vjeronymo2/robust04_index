			<p>The     central press has been publishing articles discussing the  political, social and economic ramifications of a Russian-Belarusian  monetary union.  Economic experts, journalists and officials are  debating the pros and cons of such a union in articles appearing in  a variety of sources.      No Consensus in Belarus      Belarusian Radicals Call for a Strike      KRASNAYA ZVEZDA published an article by Valeriy Kovalev entitled  "An Ordinary Meeting Instead of a Strike Took Place in the  Belarusian Capital."  Kovalev reported that a group of deputies from  the opposition Belarusian National Front issued a statement claiming  that a Belarusian-Russian monetary union would cause "the  destruction of the Belarusian economy and the Belarusian state."  The deputies called on their countrymen to engage in a "national  liberation struggle" and to participate in a demonstration demanding  removal of Kebich's government, dissolution of the Supreme Soviet,  and early presidential elections.  However, only about 1,000 people  attended the rally in Minsk's central square, which led Kovalev to  observe that "hardly anyone will be successful in coming to power in  Belarus under the banner of fervent Russophobia." (Moscow KRASNAYA  ZVEZDA in Russian 16 Feb 94 p 3)      Belarusian Deputy Favors Union      Henadz Kazlow, coordinator of the "Belarus" faction in the  Supreme Soviet, in an interview responded to a question about a  monetary union, noting that despite attempts to "foil" the agreement  he believed "in the pragmatism of practical politicians who drafted  this agreement," and added that "an economic union is already being  discussed quite seriously.  There is no other way out."  (Minsk  ZVYAZDA in Belarusian 23 Feb 94 pp 1, 3)      Some Belarusians and Russians Agree      Belarusian and Russian Enterpreneurs Appeal for Union      The business-oriented paper DELOVOY MIR carried on page 1 an  "Appeal from the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs  and the Belorussian (Belarusian) Scientific-Industrial Association  to the Governments of Russia and Belorussia."  The appeal, signed by  Russian Union chairman A.I. Volskiy and president of the Belorussian  Association M.F. Lavrinovich, pointed out that the time is ripe for  integrating the monetary systems of the two republics and noted that  possible temporary expenses due to unifying the monetary systems  are commensurably small in comparison with the benefits from  regulating economic and cooperative ties, broadening the market and  increasing incomes from the development of production."  The two  organizations called upon their respective governments to "take this  decisive and necessary step" which would benefit both "the economic  situation and the population's standard of living." (Moscow DELOVOY  MIR in Russian 25 Feb 94 p 1)      Economists Emphasize Benefits of a Monetary Union      The same issue of DELOVOY MIR ran an article by two candidates of  economic science, Vladimir Safronov of Moscow and Aleksandr Yarosh  of Minsk.  In their article, entitled "Russia and Belarus:  There  are no Losers," they provided a number of statistics to prove that  negative influences on either state's economy would be negligible.  A model developed by Belarusian and Russian economists showed that  in the former USSR Belarus provided one-tenth of all interrepublic  imports and delivered almost one-fourth of its products to the other  republics.  At the same time, its dependence on economic ties with  other republics was among the highest.  If a Belarus-Russia monetary  union also includes unified economic relations with the other  republics, according to the model, Russian national income would  grow 1.9 percent and Belarusian 7.9 percent.  "Thus," the economists  stated, "the results of the calculations prove that negative  consequences for both states are insignificant."  They concluded  that "unification of the monetary-credit systems of Russia and  Belarus provide more positive than negative results.  The course  toward reintegrating Russia and Belarus and creating an economic  union answers their long-range state interests." (Moscow DELOVOY MIR  in Russian 25 Feb 94 p 4)      Bones of Contention      Only Premiers Can Resolve These Two Issues      In an article entitled "Moscow-Minsk:  Will the Ruble Zone  Expand?,"  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA correspondent Aleksandr Shinkin  reported the Belarusian leadership's recognition that "the economic  stability of the republic is scarcely possible without Russia."  He  added that both former Supreme Council speakers Shushkevich and  current leader of parliament Hryb "have advocated the unification of  the monetary systems."  Shinkin cited Chernomyrdin, who "considers  that there are two questions which can be resolved only at the level  of the premiers of the two states."  Prices for energy and the  exchange rate between Russian and Belarusian rubles were the two  issues.  Quoting a Russian Ministry of Economics staffer, Shinkin  reported that the supporters of a monetary union were divided  between those who favored "meeting Belarus' demands halfway" while  the other group was "insisting essentially upon a single budget."  (Moscow ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA in Russian 17 Feb 94 p 6)      Belarusian Demands Continue to Increase      On 26 February SEGODNYA published an article by Yelena  Kolokoltseva entitled "Belorussia (Belarus) is Insisting on Cheap  Gas from Russia."  Despite an agreement on lowering the price for a  tonne of gas from 80 to 55 dollars, Kolokoltseva cited a Russian  official who said that "Belorussia's appetites keep on growing."  Belarus's demands were strengthened "by threats to impose tariffs on  the transit of Russian energy sources through Belorussian  territory."  Belarus's goal, Kolokoltseva stated, was "to receive  cheap energy resources and guarantee the sale to Russia of products  which cannot compete in Western markets."  She concluded that it is  only Russian Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko who "can  explain to the Russian leadership the financial consequences for the  Russian economy of the unification of the Belorussian and Russian  monetary systems.  The question is whether he wants to do so."  (Moscow SEGODNYA in Russian 26 Feb 94 p 2)      Areas of Disagreement      A SEGODNYA commentary by Aleksandr Bekker, entitled "Belorussia  (Belarus) is Getting Russian Rubles but Does Not Want to Give Up  Sovereignty," cited Deputy Russian Finance Minster Andrey Kazmin who  identified three basic areas of disagreement between Russia and  Belarus: Budget functions during the transition period; the status  of Belarus' National Bank, which would lose its right of money  emission; and prices for energy.  Bekker stated that "the course of  negotiations in Moscow show that Belorussia is not in the mood to  part with important attributes of national sovereignty--its own  budget and national bank--and these aspects will probably be used by  the Belorussian parliamentary opposition."  He added that "it is  indicative, that even without having agreed with Russia on the size  of the current year's budget deficit, the Belorussian parliament  (went ahead and) allotted R2.8 trillion to its farmers for the  sowing." (Moscow SEGODNYA in Russian 1 Mar 94 p 2)      Kebich Remains Optimistic      A Valentin Zhdanko report on the 18 March closed meeting of the  Belarusian parliament, entitled "Vyacheslav Kebich Does Not Abandon  His Dream about Single Ruble Zone.  Belarusian Prime Minister Bets  on Russian Parliament," appeared in SEGODNYA.  Zhdanko quoted  Kebich's accusation that "Mr. Tulin, deputy Central Bank chairman,  and Mr. Kazmin, deputy finance minister, and some others revised the  documents, a procedure that has entirely distorted the original  draft treaty that was to be signed."  Minsk rejected as unacceptable  demands that the "two countries' budgets be merged and that the  Belarusian National Bank be stripped of its independence."  According to Zhdanko, however, Kebich remained optimistic and he  cited a telephone conversation between him and Russian Prime  Minister Chernomyrdin:  "The Russian leaders have expressed their  political will and unequivocal desire to sign the document about  setting up a money union as early as this month."  Zhdanko added  that in the upcoming talks with Nikolay Gonchar, Russian Federation  Council Financial Committee chairman, "any unification of the two  countries' budgets or infringement on the BNB's rights will not even  be mentioned..." (Moscow SEGODNYA in Russian 19 Mar 94 p 1)      Disadvantages for Russia and Belarus      In March NOVOYE VREMYA ran an article by Yelena Vishnevskaya  entitled "How Russia and Belorussia (Belarus) Will Combine and  Divide Money."  Vishnevskaya cited some objections to a monetary  union from Boris Fedorov, former Finance Minister and currently head  of the Duma commission on monetary and credit policy.  She quoted  Fedorov's statement that "pseudointegrated constructions cannot be  viable" and his opinion that "nowhere and never has there been nor  can there be a unified currency and two emission banks."  Vishnevskaya then went on to refute some of Fedorov's assertions,  stating, among other things, that "the National Bank of Belorussia  does not have the right of currency emission."  However, she  admitted that a monetary union might be disadvantageous for Russia,  citing a one-trillion ruble price tag for settling Belorussia's  debts to Russian energy suppliers.  She concluded that "in the  future the expenditures can be justified--in an inviolable union oil  and gas extracting enterprises can be erected precisely on  Belorussian territory while relying on raw materials from Russia.  If Russia wants to change from a raw material appendage of the  Western economy into an exporter of at least semi-finished products  it must build plants on its own territory, but this is not cheaper  than including Belorussia in the ruble monetary system." (Moscow  NOVOYE VREMYA in Russian No 10, (signed to press 5 Mar 94) pp 12-13)      Monetary Union May Cost Belarus Too Much     IZVESTIYA correspondent Aleksandr Starikevich and economist  Nikodim Dubalevich described what Belarus might lose from a monetary  union in an article entitled "Unification of Monetary Systems is  Dangerous for Belarus Too."  The authors pointed out that those in  favor of monetary unification foresee two basic benefits--lower  prices for Russian raw materials, specifically energy, and lower  prices for Belarusian products and thus greater sales in Russia.  But, the authors said,  "there is no economic or political  substantiation for these two hopes."  The problem arises in  determining the exchange rate, where an exchange rate of one to one  means in practice a revaluation of the Belarusian ruble in relation  to the Russian ruble and, as a consequence, a sharp increase in the  prices of Belarusian output....In addition, the unification of  monetary systems means the loss of some state sovereignty."  The  authors claimed that "this step is based not on economic but on  political considerations"  and accused the Kebich government of  being unable to work independently and using monetary union as "its  only salvation...." (Moscow IZVESTIYA in Russian 11 Mar 94 p 2)      Fedorov Says Russia Will Pay For Union      Former Russian Finance Minister and current Duma Deputy Boris  Fedorov expressed his opinion about a monetary union in an IZVESTIYA  article entitled "Cart Before the Horse: Merging the Belarusian and  Russian Monetary Systems."  Fedorov called the merger of the two  currencies a "mutant" which would be unlikely to survive for even a  short while because "the compatibility necessary between the  economic and political systems is lacking."  He added that they,  meaning the political leaders of both countries, "intend to carry  out the merger at Russians' expense" because the terms demanded by  the Belarusians "will ultimately cause inflation to rise."  Fedorov  believed that political reunification must come before economic  unification.  Any price that must be paid then "will be a conscious  price paid for the reunification of fraternal peoples, which will  ultimately also yield economic results."

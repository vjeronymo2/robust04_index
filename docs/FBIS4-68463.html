			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview by B. Polishchuk with A. Pavlenko, assistant head </F> of the concern "Ukragrotekhservis"; place and date not given:  "Fuel: From Emergency to Emergency"]    [Text]    [Polishchuk] Anatoliy Andriyovych, because of the  government's nonpayment of charges for production, farms could  not get ready for spring in an adequate way, in particular to  obtain the necessary amount of fuel and lubricants. A very tense  situation developed. The government is trying to salvage things  in an emergency fashion and has forced "Ukragrotekhservis" to be  the fireman, so to speak. What has already been done?    [Pavlenko] To ensure spring field work under state contract,  we have to supply to the villages 800,000 tonnes of gasoline and  1,200,000 tonnes of sunflower oil. As of 29 March, 89,000 and  350,000 tonnes, respectively, had been sent to farms.    [Polishchuk] Is this not too little?    [Pavlenko] The situation is not the best, but it is also not  the worst. In Ukraine, there are still 600,000 tonnes of fuel at  terminals. In a few days, 100,000 tonnes are expected from  commercial structures. Chiefly, this is diesel fuel. The problem  is to collect it in time and get it to the locations. The  February-March schedule for supplying gasoline and sunflower oil  will be achieved at 90 and 72 percent, respectively.    [Polishchuk] And the April schedule?    [Pavlenko] There is hope that we will manage it. In  Feodosiya  and Odessa, tankers are being unloaded. Every day up to 20,000  tonnes of fuel arrive at the terminals, by rail. There is an  agreement with Azerbaijan to supply it as exchange.    [Polishchuk] On what principles do the farms pay for fuel?    [Pavlenko] As was indicated in the government decree on  supplying fuel, this is done by fixed prices: gasoline--4,150  karbovantsi per liter, and sunflower oil--3,900 karbovantsi.    [Polishchuk] How is the distribution of the fuel going, by  regions?    [Pavlenko] First of all, it has gone to the southern  oblasts,  where the work in the fields got going first. Now we are  equalizing the situation in the other oblasts.    [Polishchuk] And how about lubricants?    [Pavlenko] There are problems. The issue is that their  acquisition, as for gasoline and sunflower oil, has to be  foreseen with funds allotted under state contract.  Unfortunately, this was not done. Also, there is too little  lubricating material. In Khersonska oblast, on a number of  farms, because of dust storms, it became necessary to replace  the lubricants in the tractors urgently. We are looking for a  way out of this situation. We have already purchased 3,500  tonnes of lubricants in Kremenchug. We got small amounts in  Russia and at the Drohobych research plant, with their help, we  will get more than 2,000 tonnes of base lubricants. An agreement  has been made for Russia to supply 3,000 tonnes of lubricants in  April. In this way, there will be enough in April.    [Polishchuk] It is a long road for the fuel and lubricants  from the terminals and ports to the farms. Is there a mutual  understanding between "Ukragrotekhservis" and the railroad?    [Pavlenko] We are still talking. An agreement with the  railroad has been made. All losses in transporting the fuel go  to a separate account for "Ukragrotekhservis." So, we have  direct payments, which eases the situation of the farms. There  are also certain complications. In particular, the old railroad  statute, signed over thirty years ago, contributes to them. On  account of this, the cisterns for fuel are not sealed. This  leads to its being stolen on the road. There are many cases,  where one quantity of sunflower oil or gasoline is indicated on  the bill of lading, but on the spot it is indicated that some  hundredweights are not in the cistern.    [Polishchuk] And are hands not being warmed by fuel allotted  to the village, along the chain far from the terminal or  cistern? It is being provided to the farms more cheaply. It is  enough to let a certain quantity of fuel go through commercial  structures and, without raising a finger, to get a few stray  pennies.    [Pavlenko] We do not know about such cases. In fact, fuel  goes by a long chain: oblast to rayon to farm. Maybe someone  yields to temptation. But this fuel has a destination, under  state contract, and every liter should be accounted for.    [Polishchuk] Your prognosis: will we not fail in a great  extent of the spring work, through the supplying to the villages  of fuel and lubricant materials?    [Pavlenko] I do not think so. I am more worried about the  time when feed preparation and taking care of the planting  begin. And we all have to now start thinking about this in  advance, and not live from emergency to emergency.    P.S. After A. Pavlenko gave the interview and went urgently  on a mission, we found out some quite telling information. It  turns out, that a number of regions, including southern ones,  where the work in the fields has gotten going more, were  supplied with fuel as though it were precious droplets, at the  same time that the Khmelnytskyy region was "inundated." For the  last 20 days, 13,124 tonnes of sunflower oil and 3,232 tonnes of  gasoline have come here, the most in Ukraine, and more than the  Zaporizka, Luhanska, and Cherkaska oblasts combined. Is V.  Bortnyk, the chief of the board of the "Ukragrotekhservis"  concern, in this way "greasing" his own voters in the  Khmelnytskyy region and winning the deputy's mandate?</p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / International Company News: Apple slashes prices in US APPLE Computer slashed US prices for its Macintosh personal computers by up to 36 per cent yesterday in a bid to increase its share of the market and keep pace with rapidly falling prices in the IBM-compatible segment. 'This year Apple has seen solid gains in market share, unit share and overall revenue growth while many of our competitors have struggled to maintain their position,' said Mr Bob Puette, president of Apple's US division. 'We intend to continue our offensive posture by attracting new customers through aggressive pricing,' he added. The sharpest price reductions are on low-end desktop versions of the Macintosh. Apple lowered the price of its entry level Macintosh Classic II , for example from Dollars 1,699 to Dollars 1,079. Prices on other models were lowered by 11 to 35 per cent. Apple did not, however, reduce prices on its Powerbook portable computers. The prices published by Apple are 'suggested retail prices' but in practice actual 'street' prices are substantially lower. Even before these price cuts the Macintosh Classic II, for example, was selling at CompUSA, the largest US computer superstore chain, for under Dollars 1,000. Industry analysts noted that Apple's price reductions follow those of several competitors and that Apple needed to act to keep its computer prices competitive. Apple said recently its strategy of going after increased market share by lowering prices would probably reduce gross profit margins to below 40 per cent of net sales in fiscal 1993. Although yesterday's price cuts apply only in the US, the company generally keeps international prices to within 10 to 15 per cent above those in the US. Taking currency fluctuations into account, price reductions in Europe will probably be smaller than in the US.</p>

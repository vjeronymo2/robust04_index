			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY ROUNDUP: HOH'S TRADING SYMBOL REVISED OVER FUNDING  </P> <P> HOH Water Technology in Newbury Park said its stock trading symbol was changed  by the National Assn. of Securities Dealers to indicate that HOH fails to meet  the NASD's minimum capital requirements.  </P> <P> HOH's securities trade on the over-the-counter market, which is governed by the  NASD.  </P> <P> But HOH, which is developing a water-filtration system for the housing and  industrial markets, said it will again meet the NASD's conditions because the  Economic Development Bank for Puerto Rico recently approved a $2-million  financing plan for it. The company's main factory is planned to open in Puerto  Rico.  </P> <P> The change resulted in the NASD adding a "C" to HOH's trading symbols. Its  common stock's symbol is HOHIC. HOH's units, which consist of common shares and  warrants, have the new symbol HOHUC, and the warrants alone are HOHWC.  </P> <P> The "C" indicates that the NASD believes that the company's capital might soon  be increased to the NASD's minimum requirements and that the NASD has granted  HOH an exemption from its typical practice of dropping an under-capitalized  stock from its listings.  </P></p>

This session of the theoretical study class  will mainly study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping. More than 40 leading cadres from the democratic  parties' central committees, vice chairmen of the ACFIC, and  nonparty figures who hold leading positions in various  provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under  the central government, as well as leading nonparty figures from  various ministries, commissions, and bureaus directly under the  State Council, participated in the study class.    Hu Jintao, who is a member of the Standing Committee of the  Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and also a member  of the CPC Secretariat and president of the Central Party  School, extended his warm congratulations on the opening of the  study class. He said: The theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics put forward by Comrade Deng Xiaoping  constitutes contemporary Marxism in China. It is also the  spiritual pillar and scientific guidance that guide us on our  continuing triumphant march forward and the theoretical  foundation of the CPC basic line in the new period. Only if we  have a deep understanding and a good command of the theory can  we comprehensively and correctly understand and implement the  party's basic line, and only by constantly consolidating the  theoretical firmness can we constantly heighten our  consciousness toward implementing the basic line.    Hu Jintao said: The nineties is an important historical  period for our national development and national rejuvenation.  Currently, the overall situation in our country is good, being  characterized by economic development, political stability,  national unity, and social progress. The international  situation is also relatively favorable for us to further deepen  the reform, open wider to the outside world, and concentrate our  efforts to further improve our economy. We are facing a rare  historic opportunity for reform and development. The key to  deepening reform lies in seizing opportunities to accelerate the  reform. The "Decisions on Some Issues Concerning the  Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic System" adopted at  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee  symbolizes the fact that our economic restructuring has embarked  upon a new stage that combines pushing forward as a whole with  making breakthroughs in key areas. The current year will  witness our making the biggest strides in reform since it was  introduced over a decade ago. It may also be considered an  extremely crucial year in the process of China's reform and  development; and the task is extremely arduous and heavy. In  the course of our moving forward, we will inevitably encounter  many complicated situations and problems that we have never  encountered before. Only if we have a good command of the  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, a  grasp of the essence of emancipating the mind and seeking truth  from facts, as well as a grasp of the scientific attitudes and  creative spirit as demonstrated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping in his  application of the Marxist stand, concept, and method to study  new situations and to solve new problems, will we be able to  unify our thought, have a correct grasp of the relationship  between stability, reform, and development; be able to deal  properly with the various social conflicts, to prevent  one-sidedness and to avoid making blunders; and only then can we  enhance our ability and level for taking control of the overall  situation and the socialist market economy, as well as can we  guarantee the smooth progress of reform, opening to the outside  world, and the modernization drive.    Hu Jintao said: The multiparty cooperation under the  leadership of the CPC and political consultation system is our  country's basic political system; it represents one of the  principal bases of socialist democracy and constitutes an  important component of socialism with Chinese characteristics.  This political system which is created and developed in light  of China's national situation, after having been subjected to  trials in all types of weather, has manifested its tremendous  vitality. Practice has proved that the various democratic  parties participating in political affairs in sincere  cooperation with the CPC are close comrades in arms of the CPC  who have gone through thick and thin together in the same boat  over a long period of time. They constitute a formidable force  in our patriotic united front; it is also an important force in  safeguarding stability and unity in our country, in promoting  socialist modernization, and in pushing forward the great  undertaking of reunification of the motherland in accordance  with the principle of "peaceful reunification and one country,  two systems."    He said: A common undertaking, a common goal, and a common  task call for a common ideological foundation. Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics is not only a crystallization of the collective  wisdom of the CPC but also is a crystallization of the  collective wisdom of the people of all nationalities in our  country, including those from the various democratic parties,  the ACFIC, and figures without party affiliation. It  constitutes not only the most valuable spiritual wealth of the  CPC, but also the most valuable spiritual wealth of the people  of all nationalities in China, including members of the various  democratic parties and the ACFIC and nonparty figures. It  represents a source of strength for stimulating not only the  unremitting struggle of the CPC but also the avowed struggle of  the people of all nationalities in the country, including  members of the various democratic parties and the ACFIC and  nonparty figures. In the new historical period, only if we  study well Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics and form a consensus and enhance  unity on the basis of a new ideology can we better uphold and  perfect the multiparty cooperation under the leadership of the  CPC and the political consultation system, fortify and expand  the patriotic united front, and unswervingly implement the basic  principle of "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision, showing  utter devotion to each other, and the sharing of weal and woe"  on a common political foundation, as well as fully bring into  play and enhance the democratic party's role in political  consultation and democratic supervision, thereby pushing forward  the building of a socialist democracy.    Hu Jintao said: In the main, this study class will study  Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, and  at the same time it will closely combine the study of the theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics with the  study and appreciation of the "decisions" made by the Third  Plenary of the 14th CPC Central Committee. I suggest that in  the course of your study, all of you should earnestly study the  original work, strive to grasp its spiritual essence, carry  forward the fine style of correlating theory with practice, and  put into practice what you have learned, as well as strive to  earnestly organize study, integrating independent thinking with  drawing on collective wisdom and absorbing all useful ideas, and  freely speak out and express your own views, consult with one  another on an equal footing, and learn from each other's strong  points to make up one's deficiencies, thereby raising the  overall standard of study and discussions.    Lei Jieqiong, chairperson of the China Association for  Promoting Democracy, spoke on behalf of the central committees  of the various democratic parties and the ACFIC. She said:  Conducting this theoretical study class for the leading cadres  of the democratic parties, the ACFIC, and nonparty figures  constitutes an important measure for enhancing the  self-improvement of the democratic parties and is of great  significance to giving impetus to members of the various  democratic parties and the ACFIC, as well as nonparty figures,  to further study and master Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and to  strengthening the ideological and theoretical building among the  democratic parties and the ACFIC. It will also have a  far-reaching impact on efforts to meet the needs of the current  situation and the needs of the united front work, as well as on  efforts to further uphold and perfect the multiparty cooperation  under the leadership of the CPC and the political consultation  system. She said that through the present study, participants  will certainly further improve their theoretical standards and  leadership ability and do a better job.    Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the National Committee of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and head of  the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee,  also spoke at the opening ceremony.    Also present at the opening ceremony of the study class  were:  Fei Xiaotong, chairman of the China Democratic League Central  Committee; nonparty figure Cheng Siyuan; Lu Jiaxi, chairman of  the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party Central  Committee; Li Peiyao, chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of  the Chinese Kuomintang Central Committee; Wu Jieping, chairman  of the Jiusan (3 September) Society Central Committee; Cai  Zimin, chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government Central  Committee; Wan Guoquan, executive vice chairman of the China  Democratic National Construction Central Committee; Yang Jike,  executive vice chairman of the China Zhi Gong Dang (Party for  the Public Interest) Central Committee; Jing Shuping, vice  chairman of the ACFIC; as well as leading comrades including  Zheng Bijian, Zhao Zongnai, Wang Jialiu, Jiang Minkuan, Liu  Yandong, and Liu Shengyu from the Organization Department, the  Propaganda Department, the United Front Work Department, and the  Party School of the CPC Central Committee.</p>

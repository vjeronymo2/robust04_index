			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROBLEMS NAG AT PARK PARTHENIA'S SUCCESS  </P> <P> For Guadalupe Aguilar, life in the Bryant-Vanalden area of Northridge has  vastly improved since the city of Los Angeles began an unprecedented project  three years ago to rid the mostly poor Latino neighborhood of crime and  unsightly conditions.  </P> <P> "For us, this apartment is magnificent. It's clean and beautiful," she said  from her comfortable, newly carpeted and freshly painted unit. "We are happy."  </P> <P> But for her neighbor, Oscar Torres, and perhaps as many as 150 others, city  promises of safe, decent housing are unfulfilled, interviews with city  officials and more than 30 tenants has found.  </P> <P> Torres lives in an unheated, roach-infested unit. His carpet is tattered and  severe bathroom plumbing problems have so rotted his floors that they squish  like a wet sponge when he walks on them. His oven does not work.  </P> <P> "A lot was promised to us, but in reality there has been little for me," said  Torres, 45, a landscape worker. "Look at my apartment. For me it has been  lies."  </P> <P> City officials say the $25-million redevelopment project -- the largest of it  kind undertaken by the city -- is nearly complete. They describe it, in  general, as a success and see it as a model for crime-ridden, run-down areas in  other parts of the city.  </P> <P> Crime is down. Streets are cleaner. A new coat of paint covers the exterior of  the once graffiti-marred cluster of 60 apartment buildings, which has been  renamed Park Parthenia. And hundreds of poor immigrant families live in decent  housing -- paying less rent to boot.  </P> <P> But when pressed, city officials concede that poor conditions remain in some  units. Walter Clarke, rehabilitation manager for the Community Development  Department, said all violations of health and safety codes will be corrected  after the city does its final inspection of the project.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Disparities Remain  </P> <P> Clarke acknowledged that even if those violations are resolved, disparities  will remain in living conditions because the city and developer underestimated  the amount of work necessary and have nearly run out of rehabilitation money.  </P> <P> The project was approved by the City Council and Mayor Tom Bradley in November,  1986. Its purpose was to transform the blighted three-block stretch of  apartment buildings into a well-groomed development that would be more in  keeping with the fashionable Northridge community that surrounds it.  </P> <P> Originally, Councilman Hal Bernson, in whose district the project is located,  had proposed cleaning up the area by making it easier to evict the  predominantly low-income Latino tenants so that a "new class of tenants" could  be brought in. He abandoned the proposal because of a threatened veto by  Bradley and intense protests from civil rights groups.  </P> <P> A second plan, eventually approved, provided developer Devinder Vadehra with  $20.6 million from tax-exempt bonds and a $4.8-million loan to buy and fix up  453 apartments in the neighborhood.  </P> <P> To date all but 19 of the 453 apartments have been renovated, according to a  spokeswoman for the developer, and work is beginning on the remaining units.  </P> <P> "If we have ever done anything positive in the housing area in this city, this  is it," Bernson said. "We took an terrible situation, and we turned it around."  </P> <P> In 1985, the area accounted for nearly one third of drug-related arrests in the  Los Angeles Police Department's Devonshire Division. In 1988, the area had only  57 of the 1,505 drug-related arrests in the division.  </P> <P> John McClure, principal of Napa Street Elementary School next to the project,  said the redevelopment has "gotten rid of the drugs and the violence that used  to take place out in front of our school. There is not the fear element that  many residents dealt with previously."  </P> <P> Jeri Jackola, who has lived in the area for 30 years agreed that  Bryant-Vanalden "has been cleaned up considerably. But I still think there is  more work that needs to be done. I'd like to see the greenbelt," referring to a  landscape plan that officials said was scrapped for lack of money.  </P> <P> A city official who worked closely on the project said he likes some of the  results but believes "the price was disproportionately high, economically. I  think the social price was, too. I don't like the feeling that we took  somebody's neighborhood and destroyed it," said the official, who requested  anonymity.  </P> <P> Strict rules have been established for residents. For instance, children are  prohibited from playing in public areas such as courtyards and hallways.  Pushcart vendors are banned.  </P> <P> Also, the turnover among tenants ended many longtime friendships. "Most of my  neighbors, my friends are gone," said Angela Arragon, 54, a 10-year resident  who is happy with the improvements to her apartment. "There is no more  community here."  </P> <P> There are now about 1,600 tenants in the 453 apartments, down from an estimated  4,000 in 1985, when city officials found families doubling and tripling up.  </P> <P> About two-thirds of the apartments are occupied by residents receiving federal  Section 8 rent subsidies, under which they pay 30% of their income toward rent  and the government picks up the remainder.  </P> <P> "Before we needed two other families to pay" the $650 monthly rent for a  three-bedroom apartment, said Carmen Chavez, 33. The mother of four who works  as a housekeeper said she now pays $193 of her own money for a two-bedroom  unit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Opinions Differ  </P> <P> "It is a good feeling for me to be able to pay all my bills every month,"  Chavez said. "And it is better for the children to sleep in their own room."  </P> <P> But many tenants have a different view of the project. They complain that  repeated requests for repairs and improvements have gone unanswered.  </P> <P> Those tenants are living in apartments without such basic necessities as  working heaters and stoves. Besides walls and floors rotted by plumbing  problems, some apartments have tattered carpets and kitchen floors that are  worn to cement foundations.  </P> <P> The number of apartments with poor conditions could not be determined. A random  check of 30 units by The Times found 17 with apparent code violations. In every  case the tenant had not sought a rent subsidy, which meant the apartment did  not have to pass strict inspections by federal housing officials.  </P> <P> The quality of work is poorer in many of the 150 units rented to unsubsidized  tenants because those apartments were given lower priority in the  redevelopment, Clarke said.  </P> <P> Top priority went to units the developer hoped would attract middle-class  tenants or to units that would house tenants with rent subsidies, he said.  Rent-subsidized tenants received apartments upgraded with such items as new  appliances, carpet and kitchen floors because they had to pass "a higher  standard of inspection by housing authorities," he said.  </P> <P> A major contributing factor, city officials said, was that the city and  developer had underestimated the amount of work required and did not have  enough money to improve all units equally.  </P> <P> "We never intended to turn it into a Leisure World," said Ralph Esparza,  director of the Community Development Department's housing division. "It's  basically safe, decent and affordable housing. That was our objective."  </P></p>

It turns out the FSK had information about the  fact that a so-called version of a coup under preparation in  Russia would be published in a range of newspapers.  Incidentally, the fullest version of the version was published  today in KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA. Further, the FSK told the Russian  leadership about it in advance. The FSK, together with the  Interior Ministry and the Procuracy-General, are looking for  those who set up this provocation.</p>

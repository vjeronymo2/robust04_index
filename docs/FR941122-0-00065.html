			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 25:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nearly every one of the 39 issues addressed in the public scoping process and review of the draft EIS were again discussed, questioned, or disagreed with during public comment about the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Service has reviewed public concern about the accuracy of its early responses to issues raised in the draft and final EIS and which were also raised by persons commenting on the proposed rule. At this time, the information provided during the public comment period on the proposed rule does not provide sufficient data or cause for the Service to significantly change any of its earlier findings which were published in the final EIS regarding the issues of: Amending the Endangered Species Act, wolves as a missing component of the ecosystem, humane treatment of wolves, enjoying wolves, regulated public take, cost of the program, state, tribal, and federal authority, viable population, travel corridors, range requirements, control strategies, illegal killing, compensation, delisting, need for public education, spiritual and cultural significance, social and cultural environment, recovery areas, ungulate populations, hunter harvest, domestic livestock, land use, visitor use, economics, wolves not native to Yellowstone, wolf rights, federal subsides, human health and safety, predators and scavengers, other endangered species, other plants, invertebrates, fish, reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals, diseases and parasites, private property rights, wolf recovery in other areas, existing wolves in Idaho and Yellowstone, existing wolves in northwestern Montana, wolf subspecies, wolf/dog/coyote hybridization, and the need for research (Service 1994a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service adjusted the experimental population boundaries to exclude any portion of known wolf pack territories in an effort to reduce the likelihood that any naturally dispersing breeding groups of wolves would fall under the proposed experimental rule regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above, and using the best scientific and commercial data available, in accordance with 50 CFR 17.81, the Service finds that releasing wolves into Yellowstone National Park constitutes reintroduction into a high-priority site and will further advance conservation and recovery of this species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> National Environmental Policy Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A Final Environmental Impact Statement under the National Environmental Policy Act is available to the public (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). This rule is an implementation of the proposed action and does not require revision of the EIS statement on the reintroduction of gray wolves to Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Required Determinations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule was reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). Based on the information discussed in this rule concerning public projects and private activities within the experimental population area, significant economic impacts will not result from this action. Also, no direct costs, enforcement costs, information collection, or recordkeeping requirements are imposed on small entities by this action and the rule contains no recordkeeping requirements, as defined in the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). This rule does not require federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612 because it would not have any significant federalism effects as described in the order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

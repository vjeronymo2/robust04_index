			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "In the Mafia's `Sights'"] </F>   [Text] A Novosibirsk couple have ended up on the operating  table as a result of a grenade thrown through their apartment  window on the night of 31 May. The injured couple are widely  known in the city: Yekaterina Zhabotinskaya is head of the  Central Bank of Russia's chief branch in Novosibirsk Oblast.  Vladimir Zhabotinskiy is deputy director of a firm. According  to information from the hospital, both sustained multiple  wounds. Following operations, there are no fears for their lives.    Criminal proceedings have been instituted and an  investigation is under way.    This attempt continues the chain of crimes connected with  leaders of the local branch of the Central Bank. Its former  chief, Vasiliy Cheplakov, has twice found himself in the  criminals' "sights." He was doused with acid, then shot, but  luckily the bullet missed.    "I know full well that I will be the criminals' next victim,  because I am not convenient for a lot of people," Nikolay  Beloslyudtsev, deputy chief of the Central Bank branch, said in  an interview with ITAR-TASS. He expressed strong indignation  over the fact that the two attempts on Cheplakov's life remain  unsolved. In his opinion, "the law-enforcement organs are  dozing."</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei edges ahead as Kuala Lumpur advances 2.2% Arbitrage buying lifted share prices after the yen fell slightly against the dollar, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average rose 177.63 to 20,718.04 after a low of 20,565.41, and a high of 20,780.26 in the last 20 minutes of trading, gaining strength in the afternoon session on bargain hunting and arbitrage buying. Volume totalled 292.8m shares against 314m. Some foreign investors were seen taking profits, while financial institutions and investment trusts were the main buyers of the day. However, many investors remained on the sidelines, due to lingering uncertainty over the course of the yen. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 9.99 to 1,664.52 and the Nikkei 300 gained 1.66 to 302.47. Advances led declines by 767 to 271 with 143 unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.87 to 1,352.11. Buying centred around shares linked to the consumption recovery, and oil exploration in Vietnam. Buy-backs of export oriented, high-technology stocks which had been sold off due to the high yen also supported the index. Mitsui, the most active issue of the day, rose Y38 to Y880 on its resource development in Vietnam. Marubeni, another trading house, closed Y13 higher at Y550. However, Mitsubishi Oil, whose discovery of a second oil well in Vietnam triggered the recent interest in the theme, fell Y20 to Y1,180 on profit taking. Department store shares were bought actively on hopes of an increase in consumer spending. Tokyu Department Store rose Y54 to Y829 and Daimaru gained Y32 to Y893. Some banks were weaker in spite of arbitrage buying. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y10 to Y3,180 and Sumitomo Bank declined Y20 to Y2,030. Electricals were higher. Sony gained Y200 to Y6,060 and Hitachi rose Y10 to Y1,020. Car electronics makers were stronger on reports that the government will push for car navigation systems. Kenwood gained Y32 to Y955 and Alpine Electronics added Y90 to Y2,300. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 192.58 to 23,148.41 in volume of 35.1m shares. Roundup Pacific Rim markets turned in mixed performances. KUALA LUMPUR saw foreign demand for Malaysian blue-chip stocks, which sent the composite index 2.2 per cent up through the psychological 1,000-point level. The index finished 21.23 higher at 1,010.80. Tenaga Nasional and United Engineers each jumped 70 cents to MDollars 14.0 and MDollars 10.90 respectively while Telekom Malaysia firmed 60 cents to MDollars 19.50. MANILA rose sharply at the close, spurred by PLDT's rebound in New York and bargain-hunting in other issues. The composite added 47.07 or 1.9 per cent to 2,557.83 as PLDT climbed 3.2 per cent to 1,440 pesos after jumping Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 55 1/8 on Wall Street. SYDNEY advanced 1.5 per cent, through the psychologically important 2,000 barrier in volatile trade, lured higher by a rally on the futures market. The All Ordinaries index closed 29.1 firmer at 2,007.7. Brokers said rumours of a large institutional investor doing some portfolio buying also gave the market impetus. BHP put on 50 cents or 2.8 per cent to Dollars 17.94 amid speculation that it was about to embark on a major offshore takeover. HONG KONG stepped back after the strong rally of the previous two days, surrendering sharp early gains to profit-takers. The Hang Seng index fell 20.63 to at 8,808.28, after an early peak of 8,944.31 in turnover that was little changed at HKDollars 3.84bn. TAIPEI's early gains were reversed by late profit-taking amid worries that the central bank might tighten monetary policy next week. The weighted index fell 13.62 to 6,304.61, off a 6,392.88 high. WELLINGTON shrugged off political uncertainty to close slightly firmer, although late selling trimmed the rise. The resignation of Ms Ruth Richardson, the government MP and former finance minister, raised the prospect of a snap election. The NZSE-40 capital index closed up 3.58 at 1974.1 in turnover of Dollars 42.3m. BOMBAY was lower as buying eased on the last day of account in specified shares amid rumours that bourse officials might levy a 20 per cent margin on cash shares. The BSE 30-share index lost 37.89 to 4,093.63. SEOUL extended early losses which stemmed from profit-taking in most sectors and the composite index fell 3.26 to 958.71. Recently strong smaller-capitalised shares lost momentum after the Securities Supervisory Board said it would crack down on stock price manipulations. SINGAPORE was little changed but the broad market's tone was improved with pockets of buying seen among blue chips. The Straits Times Industrials index closed 5.85 higher at 2,189.78, with banks, properties and most shipyards in demand.</p>

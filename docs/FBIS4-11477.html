			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 26 Apr (EFE) -- The affiliation of the  United Labor Federation (CUT) to the International Conference of  Free Trade Union Organizations (ICFTUO), which was decided on 23  April by a CUT special congress and rejected by the Communists,  has created a serious internal conflict.    The crisis has emerged at a time when the CUT is negotiating  with the government a 15 percent basic salary readjustment that  would raise that salary to 52,000 pesos ($103 approximately),  and could lead to a union division.    CUT Vice President Antonio Martinez, a Socialist, reiterated  today his accusations against the Communist union leaders, whom  he accused of promoting an internal crisis.    Martinez said that the Communists can leave the CUT if they  don't feel loyalty and respect for the organization, which is  the only central federation in the country with a membership of  500,000 workers -- that is, 10 percent of the work force.    The Communist leaders, who represent about 90,000 militants,  rejected in the special congress the incorporation of the CUT  into the ICFTUO, which is of social democratic trend.    Meanwhile, the environment for celebrating labor day on 1  May  appears cloudy, and union leaders are not discarding the  possibility of disturbances occurring during the main ceremony,  which is held every year but this time will not be attended by  President Eduardo Frei.</p>

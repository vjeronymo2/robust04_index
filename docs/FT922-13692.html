			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Arts: Dog-days with Clodion and Bonington - Exhibitions in Paris To call Clodion the Fragonard of French sculpture is hardly original, but it helps. For Clodion, now the subject of his first major exhibition at the Louvre in Paris (until 29 June), is well known in France but not much elsewhere - certainly nothing like so well as such painters as Fragonard and Hubert Robert. The dates fit rather neatly. Fragonard was born in 1732 and died in 1806. Claude Michel, alias Clodion or 'little Claude', was born in Nancy in 1738, one of 10 children: he died at Paris in 1814. As a matter of course, both young men studied in Rome. Neither became a full master of the French Academy, but both did very nicely all the same out of private patrons. And that was perhaps hardly surprising, given that Fragonard and Clodion were each masters of the erotic. Still admired - although considerably less rich after the Revolution - aged Clodion had his design for a fountain of nymphs at the Carrousel rejected by Napoleon himself, on grounds that it was 'too indecent'. But if the Emperor had his scruples, generations of French art-lovers admired Clodion's style anacreontique which, translated, refers to his light-as-air, exquisitely seductive ladies from Arcadia. Before the Revolution, bankers and financiers were particular patrons of Clodion. But even in 1900, gentlemen looking for a delicious little bronze would thumb through the catalogue of Thiebault &amp; Fils and find dozens of copies after Clodion and his imitators. 'A last grace-note of douceur de vivre,' Michael Levey called Clodion. Unfamiliar the name may be, but British visitors to this attractive and beautifully-lit exhibition will surely find Clodion striking a chord of memory. It may be that, like me, you thought him author of the outrageous little terracotta statuette called 'La Gimblette' in the Musee des Arts Decoratifs. Not so, according to this exhibition; it was an imitator who borrowed this wicked design from Fragonard. A naked girl lies on her back with her feet in the air, holding up her pet dog who hangs there, snout pointing towards her. To increase the poor brute's sense of vertigo and frustration, she holds out a gimblette, a kind of biscuit-with-a-hole. If this is how ladies of the Empire regularly played with their dogs, no wonder Clodion was asked to design neo-classical mausolea for mutts who, we may suppose, died of over-excitement. The most notable features of the Louvre exhibition are examples of Clodion's monumental work, such as the large marble sculpture of St Cecilia from Rouen cathedral and his statue of Montesquieu, and the stucco friezes from his architectural decorations. The former leave me cold; how much more sharply etched and graceful St Cecilia is in clay, which Clodion had the most uncanny skill in modelling. His partnership with the architect Alexandre-Theodore Brogniart, produced large, delightfully frivolous scenes from Ovid and Virgil for the new houses of the seriously wealthy and, in the case of Baron de Besenval, lubricious. Lent by the Metropolitan in New York are two friezes of Bacchanalian babies made for the elegant home the Prince de built for his daughter. But she, a reluctant deb, looked coldly on the decorations, took the veil, and became an abbess. * * * A retrospective exhibition, Richard Parkes Bonington: 1802-28 at the Petit Palais (closed on Mondays), continues until 17 May. Sponsored by United Technologies Corporation, it has travelled from the Yale Center for British Art, and contains over 160 paintings and watercolours. Bonington's tragically short career is unusual in two main respects: he not only fascinated, but taught, his French contemporaries something, and he managed to die from sunstroke contracted after sketching in Normandy. This popular exhibition is very nearly a complete delight, and the more interesting for including paintings by Bonington's admirers, and above all Delacroix. Looking at their twin recreations of a jewel-bright Renaissance past and the lure of the East, is a vision of high Romanticism's high noon. But what an astonishing decision to hang the work of an artist with such exquisite colour sense against walls of intense scarlet, blue, emerald, and purple. Painful throughout, the colour-clash reached a crescendo in the last room where the purple met the gold frames and brilliant turquoise skies of Bonington's Venice. No serious devotee of Bonington will want to miss the catalogue, although at FF300 it makes our British ones seem modest indeed.</p>

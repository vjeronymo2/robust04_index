			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Washington Charts Jordanian School </F> Curricula; the U.S. Ambassador Urges Jordanian Educationists To  Expedite Change of Curricula]    [Excerpt] AL-MAJD has learned that the Ministry of  Education is currently implementing a U.S. project for Jordanian  curricula, particularly in the subjects of national education,  science, and mathematics.    Reliable sources told AL-MAJD that the ministry is currently  changing these curricula in accordance with a U.S. cultural  project. The ministry's curricula director has visited  Washington to bring U.S. experts specialized in preparing  scholastic textbooks. The head of the American Information  Center prepared secondary school vocational education programs  as well as training programs for secondary stage teachers.    U.S. Ambassador to Jordan Wesley Egan and U.S. Cultural  Attache Jonathan Rice visited the Ministry of Education. They  met with educational leaders, who reviewed their accomplishments  in cooperating with the U.S. cultural project and how they  brought a U.S. expert to modify the social and national  education textbooks for the primary stage and hold two workshops  for English language teachers, supervised by a U.S. expert.    The leading educationists thanked the U.S. Administration  for  the "facilities" extended by the American Information Center in  issues of politics and society. The U.S. ambassador, in turn,  thanked the ministry's educational leaders for their  coordination and cooperation efforts to implement the U.S.  cultural program and asked them to continue their implementation  the "Humphrey" program for studies in the field of education  planning.

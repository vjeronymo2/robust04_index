			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / International Company News: News Corp share inquiry The News Corp preference share saga moved on yesterday when the International Securities Market Association (Isma), the Eurobond market's trade association, said it was investigating the matter with the Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Luxembourg stock exchanges, on which the shares are listed. The dispute between News Corp, the media, film and publishing group controlled by Mr Rupert Murdoch, and the bondholders erupted earlier this month when News Corp said they were not entitled to around Pounds 15m (Dollars 21.9m) worth of shares in Royal Doulton, the fine china manufacturer demerged last year from Pearson, owner of the Financial Times. The decision contradicted a notice issued by News Corp in December which said that holders of its preference shares, exchangeable for shares which News Corp held in Pearson, would also get Royal Doulton shares when exercising their exchange right. Isma said the events gave rise to serious investor protection issues. They also raised the question as to whether the standards expected of borrowers accessing the international securities market had been properly met.</p>

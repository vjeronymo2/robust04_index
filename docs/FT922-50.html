			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Expenditure watchdog ready to bite more heels - The Commons public accounts committee PARLIAMENTARY scrutiny of the executive is rapidly disappearing, complained Mr Harry Barnes, Labour MP for Derbyshire North East, in the Commons last week. The left-winger was principally bemoaning the delay in re-establishing departmental select committees. Protracted horse-trading through 'the usual channels' - Westminster jargon for the whips' offices - has held up the reappearance of parliament's most effective tools for monitoring the executive since MPs reassembled in May. Government departments have, meanwhile, set about their business untroubled by this particular form of scrutiny - to the irritation of backbenchers like Mr Barnes. But though parliament's departmental monitoring tools are still gathering dust in Westminster's potting shed, its powerful government spending watchdog is once again up and barking. The all-party public accounts committee quietly resumed public hearings this month, summoning senior civil servants to answer questions on crime in London and the purchase of X-ray equipment in Northern Ireland. Committee chairman Mr Robert Sheldon, the Labour MP for Ashton-under-Lyne and a former Treasury minister, is now extremely experienced in the role, having held it since 1983. No fewer than seven of his 15-member team are new, however. An eighth, Mr Denzil Davies - a colleague of Mr Sheldon's in the Labour Treasury team of the late 1970s - joined earlier this year. Of the 'new boys', it is safe to say Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, will have comfortably the worst attendance record. By tradition, the government's lone representative on the committee attends only the first meeting following his appointment, although he receives minutes and papers. In the weeks leading up to parliament's summer recess, the PAC has scrutinised the sale of the regional electricity boards, community pharmacists and Britain's coastal defences, often in front of standing-room-only audiences. Already a handful of permanent secretaries - the highest rank in the civil service - have been summoned to appear before it. These include Sir Peter Gregson who holds the position at the department of trade and industry and must harbour vivid memories of a previous appearance over the secret Pounds 38m 'sweetener' deal struck with British Aerospace when it purchased Rover Group. One newly-appointed committee member last week expressed astonishment at the forthrightness with which his colleagues hauled one distinguished witness over the coals. Tomorrow it will be the turn of Sir Michael Checkland, the BBC's director-general, to face the PAC's music when the BBC World Service is the subject on the agenda. A hint of the areas on which questioning is likely to concentrate is provided by the NAO report which called on the World Service to improve its efficiency.</p>

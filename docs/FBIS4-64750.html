			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "340,000 Troops Are Sufficient in </F> Times of Peace"]    [Text] With his paper on the future development and  structure of the German Army, Defense Minister Volker Ruehe  (Christian Democratic Union -- CDU) has made the Bundeswehr  subject to public and controversial debates. Shortly after the  paper was published, it was strongly criticized by his own  party. A coalition working group will now deal with the matter.  The following is the paper describing the new tasks and the  number of troops required.    I. Introduction    The changing security conditions and Germany's increasing  international responsibility influence the Bundeswehr's role,  task, structure, and equipment.    In view of the fundamentally changing security situation and  the limited resources available, we have to define the  capacities and objectives of the Armed Forces that Germany has  and wants to keep and adapt them in such a way that they can  fulfill their tasks in the future.    The government's 1994 white book is the planning structure  for the future of the forces. The planning guideline is the  necessary link between the white book and Bundeswehr planning.  It defines specific basic figures for the forces' strength in  times of peace and defense, as well as their structure and the  size of crisis-reaction forces. It lays down the necessary  number of regular soldiers and conscripts for the future  Bundeswehr and defines the duration of basic military service  under the future framework conditions. It sets goals for  optimizing the forces and their operation -- this should achieve  a better relation between costs and investments. Finally,  planning aims at maintaining the necessary connection between  crisis-reaction forces and the main defense forces.    II. The Changing Strategic Framework Conditions    An analysis of the current situation shows that the  conditions for European, especially German, security have  undergone basic changes in three respects:    -- Germany is no longer a frontline state, but it is  surrounded by allies and friendly partners;    -- Germany is no longer within the reach of an adversary  that  is capable of large-scale strategic operations;    -- at the same time, the danger of regional crises and  conflicts in and outside Europe is increasing, which also  affects Germany's security.    The possible joint defense of German territory with the  allies remains a necessity. Yet, conflicts are unlikely in  Central Europe, and they are only imagineable if developments  change completely. What is much more likely are crises and  conflicts in other parts of Europe, which we must limit to a  region, tackle together with the other allies, and thus keep  away from Germany.    The Bundeswehr today is best prepared for the most unlikely,  if not the most dangerous, event, but it is least prepared for  the most likely new tasks. This makes it necessary to adjust  our forces to the future tasks.    Germany needs    -- Forces for ground defense that can be withdrawn in times  of peace and are thus more dependent on mobilization,    -- and forces for crises, which will be fully present in  times of peace, ready to act, can be moved easily, and whose  professionalism enables them to be used for a whole range of  crisis operations.    III. Tasks and Strength of the Forces    Due to Germany's geographical situation, a special  contribution to the main defense forces in Central Europe is a  decisive factor for Germany's influence in the alliance. Main  defense forces that can be mobilized are the basis for national  defense and a crucial element of Germany's importance in a  central task within NATO, namely collective defense.  <H5>  Main Defense Forces </H5>   The main defense forces have to    -- provide the necessary conditions in times of peace for  full defense capacities to be reached in the event of a crisis,    -- safeguard an increase in forces through mobilization in a  crisis,    -- defend NATO territory together with the alliance  partners.    The present strategic situation allows a significant cut in  national defense forces. The militarily usable warning time in  the event of a major aggression suggests that parts of the main  defense forces should be released of the operation order in  times of peace and their full training for operations should be  moved to times of a crisis.    For this reason, the main defense forces within the existing  divisions of the Army, Air Force, and the Navy are to be  structured differently from the crisis-reaction forces in terms  of presence, training, equipment, operation, and supply.    The main defense forces are structured in such a way as to  maintain their combat strength envisaged for defense. Their  full readiness for action will, however, only be achieved  through gradual mobilization and intensive training within the  militarily usable preparation time.    These measures aim at two things -- first, at allowing an  increase in the number of crisis-reaction forces, and second, at  achieving an overall structure that allows flexibility within  the given security situation. The necessary connection between  main defense and crisis-reaction forces is also safeguarded by  the units of the Army forming a continual supply of forces that  become available on a step-by-step basis.    The defense system that is based on conscripts and  reservists  has to safeguard that the forces can be increased to a defense  strength of 650,000-700,000 troops. Intensive crisis training  within a scheme of gradual mobilization shall provide full  defense capacities within approximately four months. These  conditions can be achieved by means of a strictly organized  10-month basic military service.  <H5>  Crisis-Reaction Forces </H5>   The crisis-reaction forces will have the following tasks:    -- in national defense, to deter potential attackers and  thus  prevent conflicts through immediately possible action;    -- to contribute to crisis management and conflict  prevention, as well as defense in NATO and the Western European  Union [WEU],    -- to carry out missions from humanitarian measures to  military operations under the UN Charter for the United Nations  and the CSCE.    In order to fulfill these tasks, the capacity to use forces  up to a maximum size of a division and appropriate contingents  of the Air Force and Navy is appropriate and sufficient. To  achieve this, the following forces, which can be used quickly  and can be moved to other locations, must be maintained:    -- In the Army -- as the German contribution to the NATO  reaction forces and Eurocorps, a total of five mechanized and  light air-movable brigades. This number is complemented by the  necessary combat support and supply troops, as well as the  German part of the German-French brigade;    -- In the Air Force -- six flying squadrons for air attacks,  air defense, reconnaissance, and nuclear support missions, as  well as two mixed ground-controlled air defense units, as well  as two or three air transport squadrons and a helicopter unit  for rescue operations;    -- In the Navy, two ocean-going operation groups consisting  of two to three ships each, the appropriate components for  explosives defense and underwater warfare, floating control and  supply components, a squadron of naval fighter aircraft, naval  reconnaissance planes, rescue helicopters, and a company of  frogmen.    The necessary availability and professionalism of the  crisis-reaction forces require that they consist mainly of  regular soldiers. Conscripts may serve in the crisis-reaction  forces, if on starting service they declare their willingness to  be available for all crisis-reaction missions. In order to be  able to serve in such missions, it will usually be necessary for  conscripts to serve for at least 12 months.    Regarding the duration of basic military service, this opens  up the possibility to choose between serving at least 10 months  or a voluntary 12-month mission-oriented service.  <H5>  Basic Military Organization </H5>   In order to control the Armed Forces, support their  operation, enable training and supply functions, for  civilian-military cooperation, and for support to the allies, a  basic military organization is required.    IV. Conclusions for Bundeswehr Size and Structure  <H5>  Staffing </H5>   The correlation between crisis-reaction forces and main  defense forces, the correlation between conscription and equity  in conscription, and the correlation between presence and  mobilization result in a peacetime force of the Bundeswehr of  some 340,000 troops. It consists of    -- some 200,000 regular soldiers and soldiers on a  fixed-term  contract,    -- up to 135,000 conscripts, with a 10-month service;    -- and approximately 3,000 military training grounds.    135,000 posts for conscripts at a service term of 10 months  means that up to 155,000 conscripts can start their service  every year.    As a result of cutting back in military staff, the number of  civilian personnel can also be reduced accordingly; the former  target figure of 151,300 for the year 2000 can now be cut to  under 140,000.    This plan is based on the following assumptions:    -- that, as in the past, the number of fit conscripts is  used  to the fullest extent;    -- that, with basic military service being cut to 10 months,  there will be no compensatory time off for soldiers doing basic  service;    -- that career prospects of the 370-personnel model are  maintained, and finally,    -- that the forces' structures allow for a peacetime  strength  of 370,000, if required; this also enables the internationally  agreed upper limit of 370,000 to be achieved by partial  mobilizations.    Personnel cuts to reduce operating costs and changing of  structures will lead to the stationing of troops being  reexamined. Regional availability of personnel, training  opportunities, infrastructure, and profitability of the  individual facilities play a role in that, as does the quality  of life for the Bundeswehr troops and their families. It is  obvious that consequences for the stationing can only be worked  out in the course of the planning process and can only be  implemented over the next few years.  <H5>  Rationalization </H5>   The Bundeswehr is short of funds right now. That is why the  gap between its tasks and funds has to be closed; financial  leeway is necessary for restructuring the Bundeswehr.    This is the only way to make the urgently necessary  investment toward suitable and modern equipment for the  crisis-reaction forces, while, at the same time, maintaining a  minimum degree of a competitive and efficient arms industry as  part of Germany's security precautions.    The profits derived from rationalizations and reduction of  personnel costs due to cutting back the forces' peacetime  strength must remain allocated to the defense budget. Only in  this way will it be possible to increase the investment portion  and find the original investment necessary for initiating the  rationalizations.    The planning guideline can, however, only be put into  practice if the 1995 ceiling of 47.5 billion marks remains  unaltered in the medium term and individual plan No. 14 is  increased again as of 1997.    V. Summary    The envisaged reduction of the Bundeswehr's peacetime  strength and the further development of the forces' capacities  and structures constitute a moderate intervention in terms of  quantity -- which is necessary with a view to the somewhat  crisis-prone situation, and is, quite rightly, expected by our  citizens and the alliance.    In terms of quality, the comprehensive adjustment to new  tasks and structural reforms is a fundamental change that will  give our forces a new but also more up-to-date look.    The approach described above preserves the defense power in  alliances on the basis of forces that can be mobilized, while at  the same time increasing Germany's political capacity to act  within NATO, WEU, and the United Nations due to its ability to  act quickly and in solidarity in times of crises.</p>

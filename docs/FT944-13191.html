			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / UK Company News: APV issues statement to stabilise shares APV, the producer of food manufacturing equipment, responded yesterday to the recent volatility in its share price by reiterating that a restructuring of the group was being planned. In an unusual move, APV issued a short statement that gave no new information about the company or its financial position. 'It is just intended to pacify the market and calm things down,' APV said. The company had said last month, when it announced interim results, that an unspecified charge would be taken in the second half to cover further restructuring in its liquid foods division. The planned restructuring - for which analysts' estimates range from Pounds 10m to Pounds 40m - has heightened City nervousness about APV and turnover in its shares has been heavy. The shares closed 2p lower yesterday at 61 1/2 p, equalling their low point for the year. They were 118 1/2 p before the interim results statement when the company also announced it was halving its interim dividend and facing increasing pressure on profit margins. On Monday the company had to deny a weekend report that it was in danger of breaching banking covenants. It then said that, on current projections, it expected to stay within its covenants, but declined to detail what they were. APV has committed itself to announcing details of the restructuring by the end of December. Yesterday it would say only that, when the scope and size of the restructuring was known and approved by the board, full details would be announced to the Stock Exchange. Last week, the company ousted Mr Clive Strowger, its chief executive, following pressure from institutional shareholders. Mr Neil French, finance director, is acting as chief executive.</p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: Lautenbach takes early retirement from IBM ONE of IBM's top four executives, Mr Terry R. Lautenbach, said last night that he would retire early, AP-DJ reports. He is at present a senior vice-president of the computer-maker, and one of four members of IBM's management committee, its top policy-setting body. Mr Lautenbach, aged 54, said he had made it known for some time that he wanted to retire when he turns 55 next August. He said he decided to bring forward he move up his departure to November 30, in part because the company's cost-cutting programme, which he helped oversee, was going better than expected. His departure is not expected to have any impact on possible successors to IBM's chairman Mr John F. Akers, who plans to retire when he turns 60 in two years' time.</p>

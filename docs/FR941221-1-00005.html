			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Similarly, if rework of the midspar fitting lugs or spring beam aft lugs described in Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54A2152, dated December 23, 1992, or Revision 1, dated July 15, 1993,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> has not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  been accomplished, but all other modifications referenced by paragraph I.D.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> have <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  been accomplished, then the rework should be done in accordance with Revision 2 of that alert service bulletin. Operators of these airplanes that have already reworked the midspar fitting lugs or spring beam aft lugs in accordance with the original issue or Revision 1 of that alert service bulletin can receive an extension of the compliance time to 56 months, provided that ultrasonic inspections are performed (to detect cracking of the inboard and outboard midspar fitting lugs or spring beam aft lugs of each strut) within 2,500 landings or 3 years since accomplishment of the rework, whichever occurs earlier, in accordance with Revision 2 of Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54A2152, dated September 16, 1993. For these airplanes, repetitive inspections would be required at intervals not to exceed 500 landings for inboard struts and 1,000 landings for outboard struts. The FAA has approved Revision 2 of this alert service bulletin as an alternative method of compliance to accomplish the requirements of AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;07, amendment 39&hyph;8678 (58 FR 45827, August 31, 1993), which references Revision 1 and the original issue of that alert service bulletin as the appropriate sources of service information to perform this ultrasonic inspection. The FAA acknowledges that this compliance time is earlier than that required by AD 93&hyph;17&hyph;07; however, performance of this inspection would defer modification of the nacelle strut and wing structure until 56 months after the effective date of this AD for these airplanes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA points out that all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been included in this notice to clarify this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Cost Estimate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are approximately 600 Model 747 series airplanes equipped with Pratt &amp; Whitney Model JT9D series engines (excluding Model JT9D&hyph;70 engines) of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 146 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed modification may take as many as 7,700 to 8,892 work hours to accomplish, depending upon the configuration of the airplane. The manufacturer would incur the cost of labor, on a pro-rated basis, with 20 years being the expected life of these airplanes. The total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is based on the median age for the fleet of Model 747 series airplanes equipped with Pratt &amp; Whitney Model JT9D series engines, which is estimated to be 15 years. The average labor rate is estimated to be $60 per work hour. Required parts would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to the operator. Based on these figures, the cost impact of this proposal on U.S. operators is estimated to be between $50,589,000 ($346,500 per airplane) and $58,420,440 ($400,140 per airplane).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This cost impact figure does not reflect the cost of the terminating actions described in the service bulletins listed in paragraph I.C., Table 2, ``Prior or Concurrent Service Bulletins,'' on page 13 of Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;54A2159, dated November 3, 1994, that are proposed to be accomplished prior to or concurrently with the modification of the nacelle strut and wing structure. Since some operators may have accomplished certain modifications on some or all of the airplanes in its fleet, while other operators may not have accomplished any of the modifications on any of the airplanes in its fleet, the FAA is unable to provide a reasonable estimate of the cost of accomplishing the terminating actions described in the service bulletins listed in Table 2 of the Boeing alert service bulletin. As indicated earlier in this preamble, the FAA invites comments specifically on the overall economic aspects of this proposed rule. Any data received via public comments to this notice will aid the FAA in developing an accurate accounting of the cost impact of the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA recognizes that the obligation to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition is vital, but sometimes expensive. Because AD's require specific actions to address specific unsafe conditions, they appear to impose costs that would not otherwise be borne by operators. However, because of the general obligation of operators to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition, this appearance is deceptive. Attributing those costs solely to the issuance of this AD is unrealistic because, in the interest of maintaining safe aircraft, prudent operators would accomplish the required actions even if they were not required to do so by the AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A full cost-benefit analysis has not been accomplished for this proposed AD. As a matter of law, in order to be airworthy, an aircraft must conform to its type design and be in a condition for safe operation. The type design is approved only after the FAA makes a determination that it complies with all applicable airworthiness requirements. In adopting and maintaining those requirements, the FAA has already made the determination that they establish a level of safety that is cost-beneficial. When the FAA, as in this proposed AD, makes a finding of an unsafe condition, this means that the original cost-beneficial level of safety is no longer being achieved and that the proposed actions are necessary to restore that level of safety. Because this level of safety has already been determined to be cost-beneficial, a full cost-benefit analysis for this proposed AD would be redundant and unnecessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, May 13 (XINHUA) -- Foreign ministers from  the United States, Russia and five European Union (EU) member  countries today urged the warring parties in Bosnia to stop  fighting and resume negotiations to seek a political solution to  the Bosnia crisis.    The foreign ministers were holding here a meeting on the  Bosnia crisis, which ended today. The five EU nations are  France, Britain, Germany, Belgium and Greece.    A statement issued after hours of talks here this afternoon  urged the three warring parties -- Serbs, Muslims and Croats --  to reach a four-month truce and resume talks unconditionally  within two weeks.    The cessation agreement should include separation of the  warring armed forces, withdrawal of heavy weapons and  supervision of the proposed ceasefire by UN peacekeepers, it  said.    It stressed that the division of Bosnian land should be  based  on the proposal put forward by the EU -- 51 percent to the  Bosnian Croat-Muslim Federation and 49 percent to Bosnian Serbs.    The statement said it backs bosnia in continuing to exist as  a country which will define in the constitution relations  between the Bosnian Serbs and the Croat-Muslim Federation.    It ruled out any possibility of lifting international  sanctions against Yugoslavia before a peaceful settlement of the  Bosnia crisis.    Any attempt to make the lifting of sanctions a precondition  for resumption of talks is unacceptable, it noted, adding that  only after the peace plans are implemented, can phased lifting  of sanctions be considered.    The co-chairmen of the international conference on the  former  Yugoslavia, Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, were also  invited to the Geneva meeting.    Speaking at a press conference following the meeting, U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher said that the  international conference on the former Yugoslavia will continue  to play an important role.    He admitted that major obstacles remain toward the  settlement  of the Bosnia issue.    French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe agreed with Christopher  and added that France will have to consider troops withdrawal  from Bosnia if all parties refuse any peace proposal.    Talking about the arms embargo on Bosnia, Christopher said  the United States hopes to see the embargo still observed. The  U.S. Senate voted Thursday to urge the government to cancel its  arms embargo on Bosnia.    Commenting on the Geneva meeting, Yugoslav Deputy Prime  Minister Zeljko Simic [name as received], who is attending an  international seminar on the Bosnia issue in Spain, told Radio  Belgrade today that without active participation by all the  Bosnian warring parties, it is impossible to settle the Bosnia  crisis.    He said the Bosnia crisis has become a serious threat to  peace in the whole of Europe.    "It is impossible to resolve the Bosnia issue without active  participation by the three warring parties in Bosnia, without  equal treatment, without the removal of dual standards and  without participation by Yugoslavia," he stressed.</p>

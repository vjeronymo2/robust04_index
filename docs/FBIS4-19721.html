			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Belgian Defense Minister Leo </F> Delcroix by Ann Bats and Laurent Panneels in Brussels; date not  given: "A Rest Period of a Couple Months Is Welcome Now"]    [Text] Brussels -- "The Blue Helmets who were killed in  Rwanda could do nothing more but hand over their weapons. Two  of them were lying on the ground with the barrel of a loaded gun  pressed against their heads."    That is what Defense Minister Leo Delcroix said in an  exclusive interview with this newspaper. "Anyone else would  have done the same thing if their colleagues' lives were  threatened in this way."    "In the future, whenever we are asked to undertake UN  missions, we will first lay down a number of conditions."  Before things get to that stage, however, Delcroix wants a  period for all the parties involved to reflect on things. "I am  not, however, one of those people who says that it would be  better for us to stop all UN operations."    "For the time being, I am suggesting that we calm things  down. In the fall we can once again consider the situation. Our  military personnel really need this rest period, both physically  and emotionally, and to see their families."    [HET LAATSTE NIEUWS] In terms of their morale, are the Blue  Helmets fully prepared for their mission?    [Delcroix] Naturally it is hard for one to be prepared for  things such as what recently happened. Who could be prepared  for that kind of massacre? Generally speaking, our people have  the right preparation. That is also one of the reasons why our  military personnel are so often asked [to participate].  Psychological support improves every year. Of course, it is  not yet at its optimal level. A lot can still be done, but  compared to many other countries, our people are well prepared.    [HET LAATSTE NIEUWS] Yet, some people are saying that only  highly specialized military personnel should be called in for UN  operations.    [Delcroix] I do not oppose looking into that kind of  project,  or having our country join in eventually. It is somewhat easier  in theory than in practice. I am indeed prepared to look into  it, as long as a concrete project can be put proposed.  Personally, I think it is better to draw on all of our manpower  in accordance with the situation when it comes to deploying  military personnel. To date, some 12,000 Belgian military  personnel have taken part in UN operations. The experience they  have gained is of inestimable value. This is a lot more than  "joy-riding in Leopoldsburg," where you know the scenery. I do  not wish to ridicule the existing exercises, but there is an  enormous gap between them and practical experience as a Blue  Helmet. In recent weeks, some people have advocated putting a  number of military personnel on standby at a base somewhere in  Africa. I definitely want to look into this, but account must  be taken of the budgetary consequences. We are not France. I  shy away from overly theoretical approaches.    [HET LAATSTE NIEUWS] Does the rigid UN decisionmaking  structure fit in with the flexible approach expected of the  military?    [Delcroix] Security from one area to the next cannot be  judged from New York. This calls for a more flexible mandate  with greater powers for the military commander on site. In  addition, the military logistics in New York must be reinforced.  I am not calling for a top-heavy structure, but there must be a  little military planning. At present, too much of this is left  up to civilians. With all due respect to the diplomats, when  military operations are involved, then it is the military men  who must make the decisions and draw up the plans. For example,  after Yugoslavia, we ourselves had to drag along a lot of  equipment. For the first half of the year, we just sat in the  open air. This clearly demonstrated to me that the diplomats  are not the most appropriate people for organizing these kinds  of military operations. Major influence from the military  apparatus in New York is essential.    [HET LAATSTE NIEUWS] Is everyone at the United Nations  ready to learn lessons from previous operations?    [Delcroix] We will have to wait and see. But it is clear  that any further UN participation by us is only possible subject  to strict conditions. After the events in Rwanda and the  heroism shown by our soldiers there, we are obliged to state  that the United Nations must learn lessons from these  experiences. I believe that people will listen to us, not the  least because we have shown in the past our own readiness to  listen to others.    [HET LAATSTE NIEUWS] You attach strict conditions to any  future UN participation. Does this also mean changes for the  Blue Helmets at present in the former Yugoslavia?    [Delcroix] We certainly do not want any abrupt change. The  view I have just presented must, however, gradually be applied  there too. A few months ago, we substantially increased our  arms there at our own initiative. We informed the United  Nations that we would be bringing in these heavier weapons. I  also added that if the United Nations refused to allow this, it  would pose a problem for us. The United Nations, no doubt  reluctantly, accepted this.    [HET LAATSTE NIEUWS] What do you think about Professor Suy's  remark that the Blue Helmets should not have handed over their  weapons?    [Delcroix] Such a statement is hasty and unprofessional. Let  the military make the judgment. I first want to read the  military reports of what exactly happened. Only then can you  judge in what circumstances the Blue Helmets handed over their  weapons. If, as I have been told, they stood there with rifles  aimed at the heads of two of their colleagues, I do not know  what else they could have done. People should be careful about  what they say about it now. I first want to know the exact  circumstances. My initial impression is that the 10 soldiers  and the military commander acted correctly, both in military and  in human terms.    [HET LAATSTE NIEUWS] Yet again the Belgian Army has had to  evacuate compatriots from Africa. Do you find it responsible,  once things calm down a little in Rwanda, for Belgians who are  perfectly aware of the dangers to return?    [Delcroix] Wherever there is a high concentration of  compatriots who are in need, then even if the Belgian Army has  been there 17 times before, it will still go back an 18th time.  I feel that something snapped with this event. What is  happening now is not an "everyday" evacuation exercise. This is  not just one of many. Over the coming weeks and months there is  also a need to reflect on our future policy, including  cooperation policy. We cannot now say: The incident is over  and we will start again where we left off. That is no good. It  is not only at the military level that we must learn from  experience, but also at the level of cooperation and foreign  policy. We cannot simply continue as if nothing had happened.  It has also shaken some of my own beliefs. But we have put a  lot of money and effort into setting up this cooperation. When  you now see what it has brought, it is not so easy to swallow.  Furthermore, over recent years in parliament we had succeeded  in bringing a different attitude with respect to military  cooperation. Five or 10 years ago, this cooperation was still  seen as something exceptional. Now even the Greens see the  virtues of this cooperation. A different mentality had grown  up. After what has happened over recent days you cannot fail,  however, to ask questions, even if it is with pain in your  heart. In this area too, reflection is necessary. I do not  want to choose in the short term between two extremes. Before  taking any far-reaching decisions about African policy as a  whole, we must see of what we are capable. That will ensure  that we do not take on more than we can handle.</p>

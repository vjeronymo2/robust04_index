			<p>Democracy   <F P=102>   PY0504220094 La Paz Radio Fides Network in Spanish 1700 GMT  5 Apr 94 </F>  <F P=103> PY0504220094 </F> <F P=104>  La Paz Radio Fides Network </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] Fernando Cajias, a leader of the Movement of the  Revolutionary Left, MIR, has accused the U.S. Government of  plotting to destroy social democracy--not just in Bolivia, but  in the whole world.    [Begin Cajias recording] The point is that now the cold war  is over and communism has fallen to pieces, social democracy is  the only rival for the liberals. I believe there is an  international plan to eliminate social democracy worldwide. [end  recording]    As far as Bolivia is concerned, Cajias claimed the anti-MIR  campaign linking his party to drug traffickers--which is being  orchestrated by the current Bolivian Administration and the U.S.  Embassy in Bolivia--has succeeded in removing from [former  President] Jaime Paz Zamora his status as a national leader.    [Begin recording] [Cajias] As you probably know, a survey  was  done at the end of last year. It showed that Jaime Paz Zamora  was regaining popularity. Thus, it was the right time to take  advantage of circumstances and prevent this from happening. We  are perfectly aware mistakes have been made, as the president of  the party personally acknowledged. These mistakes have cost us  dearly but we will not give up politics.    [Unidentified reporter] Will the MIR survive as it is or  will  it have to be reborn?    [Cajias] I believe this has thwarted many hopes, many people  have ceased to believe in us, and even our militants are greatly  demoralized. It would be worse, however, to abandon all our  hopes. [end recording]    Asked about drug trafficker Isaac Chavarria's latest  disclosures, Cajias answered that the next stage of the  investigation--during which those he has accused will  testify--will show who were actually involved in trafficking.</p>

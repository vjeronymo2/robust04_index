			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marielle Court: "Youth Job Training Contract To </F> Be Replaced by New Law"]    [Text] Back to square one! While the CIP [Job Training  Contract] has not been officially suspended, Employment Minister  Michel Giraud, speaking yesterday to the parliamentary committee  on the five-year law, announced that "new legislative measures"  on employment will be adopted.    The minister stated that the aim is "to reconsider the job  training contract. We are envisaging adopting a different  approach which can only come through parliamentary debate."  Shortly before this, Charles Million, president of the  Rhone-Alpes regional council, and Michel Pericard, president of  the Assembly's Social Committee, had both asked for a new  employment law, the latter stressing that "only a law can undo a  law."    Michel Bon has continued to consult with trade union  organizations in drafting the proposal which will then serve as  the basis for the law. On several occasions, the director  general of the ANPE [National Employment Agency] has repeated:  "At the moment, I am listening," and has refused to comment  further. The CFDT [French Democratic Confederation of Labor],  however, stated at the end of the meeting "that it will not  accept a new measure that forces young people to pay a job  entrance fee," and said that it was "completely opposed to the  ANPE-youth project: There is no reason to apply a measure that  would discriminate against young people."    The CGC [General Confederation of Executives] was dancing to  the same tune, asking for a "contract for the integration of  young people into the labor market," as was the CFTC [French  Confederation of Christian Workers], which considers it  essential that "we avoid any confusion between training and the  activity of integration."    At the end of the day -- when Michel Bon was meeting with  the  employers' organizations -- a certain degree of unanimity  seemed, in any event, to have been reached among the social  partners, recalling that they had signed a document proposing  "contracts for guidance, adaptation, and qualification," and  increasing exemptions on social charges for employing young  people.</p>

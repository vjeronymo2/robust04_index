			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Small companies are losing heart, CBI says OPTIMISM AMONG small businesses has fallen in the past four months, according to a Confederation of British Industry report published yesterday. The report mirrors the falling production, weakening orders and further job losses predicted in last week's CBI survey of big companies. Exports are the only positive sign in a bleak outlook, with companies expecting a slight increase in foreign orders over the next four months. The survey of more than 800 smaller manufacturers says spending on machinery and innovation is falling and training schemes have been cut. Mr Richard Brucciani, chairman of the CBI's smaller business committee, said it was 'critical' to boost investment. 'Otherwise smaller UK manufacturers will not remain competitive in international markets and capture the business which is necessary to increase the country's employment and wealth,' he said.</p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Irish government set to fall as coalition partners resign posts THE IRISH government is expected to fall today after the Progressive Democrats, until now junior partners in the coalition, resigned their ministerial posts and made clear they would support a 'no confidence' motion proposed by the opposition Labour party. Ms Mary Harney, a Progressive Democrat (PD) deputy who quit as junior minister for the environment, said yesterday: 'The country needs an election. The government has broken down.' She said the six PD deputies would vote with the opposition. The two senior PD ministers in the cabinet - Mr Des O'Malley, industry minister and PD leader, and Mr Bobby Molloy, energy minister - informed Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, of their resignation from the government last night after a PD parliamentary group meeting which had been convened to discuss the coalition crisis. Fianna Fail, the senior coalition partner with 77 seats, will not be able to muster an overall majority in the 166-seat Dail (parliament) and will therefore fall. Mr Reynolds is expected to ask President Mary Robinson to dissolve the Dail this evening. A general election must then be held within 30 days. Two dates are being considered - November 26 or December 3. The elections and a controversial abortion referendum are likely to be held on the same date. The crisis began last week when Mr Reynolds accused Mr O'Malley of being dishonest in the evidence Mr O'Malley had given to a parliamentary inquiry into the country's beef industry earlier this year. Mr O'Malley had criticised Mr Reynolds' actions as industry minister in 1987 and 1988 in supporting beef sales to Iraq which he claimed had exposed the Irish taxpayer to unnecessary risks. The PDs called on Mr Reynolds to withdraw the accusation. He refused, precipitating the split in the coalition. Mr Reynolds told his party yesterday he intended to lead it to victory with an overall majority. Most opinion polls indicate, however, that an absolute majority will continue to elude it. Mr Reynolds' future within the party is likely to be called into question. Some backbenchers warned earlier this week that they felt an election had been precipitated unnecessarily by Mr Reynolds and that if the party lost seats in the election, a search for a new leader might begin. Mr Reynolds has been Fianna Fail leader and prime minister only since February after he ousted Mr Charles Haughey in an internal party coup. In the past few days the two main opposition parties, Fine Gael and Labour, have ruled out entering into a coalition with Fianna Fail after the election so long as Mr Reynolds remains leader, as have the PDs and the socialist Democratic Left party. Labour is reluctant to join a coalition with Fine Gael, because of its unhappy experience in such a coalition in 1982-87. It could therefore prove difficult to piece together a stable government after the election without big compromises or a further general election to break the possible deadlock.</p>

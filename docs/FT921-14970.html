			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Delay over BR sell-off proposals denied MINISTERS yesterday insisted that a white paper paving the way for the privatisation of British Rail would appear before the general election in spite of a Cabinet split over the form it should take, Richard Tomkins writes. Weekend reports speculated that the difficulties of resolving ministerial differences might cause an indefinite postponement of the white paper in favour of a manifesto pledge. Even so, the Department of Transport was yesterday sticking to its promise that a white paper would appear by the end of January or, at the latest, in early February. Ministers are united in their belief that British Rail should not enter the private sector in its present form as a large, unwieldy monopoly but are at odds over how it should be broken up. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, believes it should be split along the lines of its existing business sectors while Mr John Major, the prime minister, is said to favour a regional division. Other ministers believe the ownership of the tracks and trains should be separated. Sir Bob Reid, Page 28</p>

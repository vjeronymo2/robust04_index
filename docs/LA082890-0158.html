			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> NOTRE DAME HAS EUROPE TV DEAL  </P> <P> Notre Dame, the first school to negotiate its own television contract with a  major network, is taking its act to European television.  </P> <P> The Fighting Irish have reached a tentative agreement to have their football  games televised in six European countries for three years, beginning this  season.  </P> <P> The deal, terms of which were not disclosed, will allow London-based  Screensport to use the feeds from Irish games being televised in the United  States, said Notre Dame Sports Information Director John Heisler. Screensport  is an all-sports satellite channel that reaches most of northern Europe.  </P> <P> In February, the Irish, whose television rights were held by ABC and ESPN,  broke from the 64-team College Football Assn. to sign a five-year,  $37.5-million contract with NBC. NBC will have exclusive television rights to  Notre Dame's home games for five seasons beginning in 1991.  </P></p>

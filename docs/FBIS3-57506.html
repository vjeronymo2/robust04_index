Let Us Give It to Germany"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Gauffin] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, in  your book, "The Last Drive South," are you describing a security  system or a new Russian empire? What would you prefer for the  Baltic states, the Caucasus, and Central Asia -- a Russian  military presence or annexation?    [Zhirinovskiy] Events in the Transcaucasus show that,  without  Russia, those peoples will always fight each other -- Armenia  against Azerbaijan, Georgia against Abkhazia, Ossetia, and so  forth. This will happen everywhere along Russia's southern  borders -- Uzbeks, Kazakhs, and Tajiks will fight each other.  But I say that there will not be a Russian military presence in  these areas. All we can do is sell weapons. If they want to  buy them, they can do so only in Russia.    [Gauffin] Are you not afraid that Russia risks a  multiplication of situations such as that in Afghanistan?    [Zhirinovskiy] Have you ever wondered what Afghanistan is  like now? It is a country without a government, where one gang  fights another, where one city fights another. This is the  future of Central Asia. After 30-40 years the roads in those  lands will be in ruins, there will be no energy, transport will  have ground to a halt, and hospitals will not function. The  entire region will plunge into the abyss. Then Iran and Turkey  will intervene. It will be hell. Then, after a further 20-30  years, they will plead with Russia to return to guarantee  stability. This, especially with regard to the psychological  factor.    [Gauffin] So what do you intend to do?    [Zhirinovskiy] From Moscow we can force those small nations  to stop fighting. Since they are aware of the strength of  Russia's industry and Armed Forces, they must stop the  destruction. Together with the international community, they  will ask us for help. We will examine the possibility of  halting the disaster, but only if they pay us. Otherwise, we  will leave those regions to slide downhill, as is now happening  in the Transcaucasus and Tajikistan.    [Gauffin] How far would you go in defending the Russian  minorities living in the former Soviet states -- Estonia, for  instance?    [Zhirinovskiy] First, all Russians living outside their  homeland must be granted dual nationality. Then we will defend  them, mainly by means of economic instruments. For instance, if  the Russians were forced to leave the Baltic states and were  thus to lose their property, then the value of their lost assets  will be included in the price of the goods that we sell to those  states.    [Gauffin] Do you really believe that you can implement such  a  policy to defend Russians living outside their homeland?    [Zhirinovskiy] Yes. Let us take Estonia as an example. If  the Russians do not obtain the right to vote in that country, we  will implement an economic blockade. And without Russia's  sources of energy and infrastructures, Estonia will be  completely annihilated as a state. This is why we will never  use military force, but will use the force of law and the  economy, instead, to protect Russians' interests.    [Gauffin] In an interview published by NAZIONALZEITUNG --  one  of the German neo-Nazi organs -- you said that the Oder-Neisse  line, the present border between Poland and Germany, is not  history's final word. Could you describe what you consider the  legitimate borders in the center of our continent?    [Zhirinovskiy] Let us start with Estonia. There are Russians  living there. This territory must therefore be included within  Russia's borders. Estonia must be assigned to the Leningrad  District. But Tallinn, the country's present capital, should  remain a kind of city republic, like Luxembourg, Monaco, or  Liechtenstein. The rest of Estonian territory belongs to Russia.    [Gauffin] Carry on, Mr. Zhirinovskiy...    [Zhirinovskiy] In Latvia over half the population is  Russian.  In Riga only 35 percent of the population are Latvians. So the  whole of Latvia must go to Russia.    [Gauffin] What else?    [Zhirinovskiy] Lithuania, with its capital, Kaunas  (Lithuania's present capital is Vilnius; Kaunas was the  country's capital until World War II -- L'ESPRESSO editor's  note), and with the cities of Panevezys and Siauliai, will form  a small Lithuanian State. All the rest is Russia's.    [Gauffin] What should be done with Koeningsberg  [Kaliningrad], [philosopher] Immanuel Kant's home town?    [Zhirinovskiy] Koeningsberg is part of Russia. Some day we  may return it to Germany. We would like to give back to the  West whatever the West wants.    [Gauffin] Where should Poland be situated?    [Zhirinovskiy] Gdansk, Wroclaw, and Sczeczin, which used to  be part of Prussia, belong to Germany. And if Poland wants Lvov  (now in Ukraine, but in Poland until 1939 -- L'ESPRESSO editor's  note), we may even accept its request. This, to compensate the  Poles for its losses. It will be Russia's gift to the West.  But eastern Ukraine is entirely Russia's. The same applies to  Moldova and Belarus.    [Gauffin] Let us consider Slovakia...    [Zhirinovskiy] Some day, perhaps, Slovakia will want to  become part of Russia. The Czech Republic, however, will go to  Germany. Austria and little Slovenia should unite. The future  Germany-Austria-Slovenia will have to have access to the  Adriatic. This is the German people's will. Thus the Germans  will have well-founded historical borders to the east and south.    [Gauffin] Let us return for a moment to the countries that  are currently part of the CIS.    [Zhirinovskiy] Our problem lies to the south. Throughout its  history Kazakhstan has never had a role as an independent state.  The whole of Kazakhstan is nothing but southern Siberia.  Alma-Ata used to be called Vernyy (which means "loyal" in  Russian), never Almaty (which means "father of the apple" in  Kazakh), its present official name.    [Gauffin] What would you do with other neighboring Asian  countries?    [Zhirinovskiy] Kyrgyzstan, which used to belong to China,  must go to Russia. There has never existed a state called  "Kyrgyzstan." As for the rest, there are no problems of any kind  with Mongolia, China, Japan, and India.    [Gauffin] In conclusion, Mr. Zhirinovskiy, are you aiming to  create a Russian-German axis, a continental axis to set against  NATO's influence?    [Zhirinovskiy] Let me explain to you how I see the future.  Some day there will be a greater Germany and a new Russia,  which will reach an agreement with India. India has 1 billion  inhabitants. We have 300 million. So, together with Germany  and India, we would total more or less 2 billion people. Then  the world will take whatever form we want. India and Russia  together will neutralize China in Asia. With Germany, Russia  can neutralize Europe.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Whirlpool improves 55% to Dollars 62m WHIRLPOOL, the world's biggest maker of large domestic appliances, yesterday posted an unexpectedly strong 55 per cent improvement in fourth-quarter net profits to Dollars 62m, or 87 cents a share, from Dollars 40m, or 58 cents, in 1991. The company, which fully owns the former Philips appliance business in Europe, saw revenues rise 8 per cent to Dollars 1.84bn from Dollars 1.71bn. Whirlpool's earnings before taxes and other items were 39 per cent higher at Dollars 104m against Dollars 75m. Shares in Whirlpool climbed Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 51 5/8 , a 52-week high. For the full year, Whirlpool net income rose 20 per cent to Dollars 205m, or Dollars 2.90, on revenues which grew 8 per cent to Dollars 7.3bn. In 1991, the company earned Dollars 170m, or Dollars 2.45, on revenues of Dollars 6.76bn. Mr David Whitwam, chair man and chief executive, said all three of the company's regional home-appliance seg ments had a record year in 1992. In North America, revenues, operating margin and earnings increased significantly, helped by a 7 per cent rise in industry-wide shipments in the region. Industry shipments are expected to rise another 3 per cent to 4 per cent this year. Analysts were impressed by the company's performance in a difficult European market. Whirlpool said its shipments in Europe improved, in spite of industry trends towards lower shipments. Whirlpool's overseas divi sion, posted profits in Latin America in spite of an equity loss of 14 cents a share in Brazil, against earnings of 4 cents a share in 1991. The company realised a small equity profit in the second half of 1992 from its Brazilian affiliates through cuts in operating costs and a rise in market share.</p>

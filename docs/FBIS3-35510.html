			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Muslim worshipers rioted on Temple Mount  following Friday prayers and army forces are now dispersing the  rioters. The Muslim worshipers first congregated near the  Mahkama [court] building and hurled stones at the media,  wounding a camerawoman. Stones were also thrown at the Western  Wall compound and the Jewish worshipers were evacuated. Our  correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that four policemen were  lightly wounded in the Temple Mount riots.    There was also a riot near the Nabulus Gate by Muslims who  had left Temple Mount prayers. They threw stones and bottles at  the police forces and some of them were detained. Our  correspondent Mira Amsalem reports that thousands of worshipers  who left Temple Mount are now standing around the Nabulus Gate  compound and refuse to disperse. Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert  set up an emergency headquarters in coordination with the  security forces.    In Kefar Sava, a man was attacked with an ax, apparently by  an Arab. He was transferred in very grave condition to Me'ir  Hospital. The perpetrator escaped. Our correspondent Yafa Glick  reports that the attacked man's revolver was taken from him.  The police set up roadblocks and detained residents from the  territories for questioning. [passage omitted]    Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that during the clashes  with the residents of the territories, a border policeman and  three policemen were wounded.    Since the morning, there have been violent incidents and  riots in many locations in the territories. Shots were fired at  Israeli vehicles, and there were many stonings of Israeli  vehicles by Arabs. In the wake of those incidents, the IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] imposed a curfew on Hebron and the  Bethlehem area, and a closure on the Gaza Strip, but the IDF is  trying to avoid unnecessary confrontations with the local Arab  population. The IDF spokesman announced that the IDF has been  beefed up in the territories.</p>

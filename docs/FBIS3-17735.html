Only one deputy was elected to the Simferopol, the  Ukrainian parliament. According to information from the Central  Electoral Commission of Crimea, valid elections for the  Republic's Supreme Council have been held in 64 of the 66  constituencies. They were invalid in Yevpatoriya and Yalta  constituencies, where fewer than 50 percent of the electorate  turned up. Six deputies were elected in the first round of the  territorial electoral districts, three of them in Kerch. All  elected deputies are supporters of the "Rossiya" bloc. As  Viktor Alsufyev, chairman of the Central Electoral Commission of  Crimea said on 28 March, the overwhelming majority of candidates  who went through to the second round also belong to the  "Rossiya" bloc.    According to preliminary reports, at the proportional  elections (14 seats out of a total of 99) the "Rossiya" bloc won  65.7 percent; the Communist Party of Crimea, 10.9 percent; the  Party for the Economic Revival of Crimea, 7 percent; the Union  in Support of the Republic of Crimea, 3 percent; and the Crimean  Party of Social Guarantees, 2.8 percent. In Sevastopol the  elections were invalid in several districts. However, one  deputy, Serhiy Shuryha, who is the owner of the Kondratyevskyy  trading house, was elected in the first round. Figures for the  national districts are still being computed. Members of the  Central Electoral Commission of Crimea are forecasting with  considerable conviction that more than 10 of the 14 seats will  be occupied by representatives of the kurultay of the Crimean  Tatar people.

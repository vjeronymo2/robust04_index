A vice foreign minister of the ROK, speaking to reporters  yesterday, said that because the missile threat from the North  is very real, the ROK hopes to strengthen the U.S.-ROK joint  defense capability by the deployment of Scud [as heard]  missiles. The foreign ministry official said that the missiles  to be deployed in the ROK will not be purchased by Seoul but  that they will only augment the arms equipment in the U.S.  military base.    An ROK military figure said that the plan on the deployment  of missiles was proposed by the U.S. side and that the ROK is  worried that this step might provoke [chagugul chuge toelkkabwa]  North Korea [choson].    A U.S. official on 25 January had said that the demand for  the deployment of the missiles in the ROK had been made by the  commander of the U.S. Forces in the ROK. The U.S. official  stressed that the United States does not intend to provoke North  Korea by the deployment of the missiles in the ROK or to use the  Scud [as heard] missiles as a leverage for the nuclear arms  negotiation between the United States and Korea.</p>

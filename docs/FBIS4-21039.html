			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Maynayev] </F>   [Text] Bishkek, 31 March -- Kyrgyzstan has become the first  Central Asian country allocated funds from the UN International  Narcotics Control program.    Lieutenant Colonel Aleksandr Zelichenko, chairman of the  State Commission for Narcotics Control, said today that $450,000  were allocated for the 1994-95 period. They will be used for  providing equipment for sub-units engaged in fighting drug  trafficking and for training specialists.    Zelichenko claimed that international organizations are not  only giving a fitting assessment of the Kyrgyz anti-drug  services, but have also outlined a number of measures that will  permit the republic to become integrated in the worldwide  struggle against drug dealers.    Today this is necessary: via Gornyy Badakhshan and  Kyrgyzstan  drugs from Afghanistan have started spreading across the CIS  republics. Via Russia, Afghan opium and marijuana wind up in  Western Europe. This year Kyrgyzstan will be able to reach the  Kara-Korum highway via China, which will enable Kyrgyz freight  to get to the coast of the Indian Ocean, into India, Pakistan,  and other countries of this region. But specialists claim that,  together with economic advantages, the republic will become the  object of drug dealers' close attention. Using the new route,  they will be able to transport narcotics in both  directions--into Asia and into Europe. It is this which is  compelling Kyrgyzstan's law enforcement bodies to attach special  importance to stepping up the fight against drug trafficking.</p>

Ja'ja' told AFP on the telephone that around 100 soldiers  were deployed around the militia's fortified headquarters in  Ghidras, north of Beirut, where he also lives, for no apparent  reason.    "One unit took up position outside one of the three  entrances  to the building and began searching people going in and out," he  said.    "About 30 minutes later a second unit was posted outside the  second entrance and then a third group of soldiers demanded to  go inside the building but my bodyguards prevented them," he  added.    The building was still surrounded several hours later.    "I don't know the reason for these measures. There has been  no incident," Ja'ja' added.    Last month, he said that the Syrian-backed Lebanese  government was to blame for a bomb attack in a church on  February 27 that killed nine people and wounded 55 others.    "The Lebanese government is responsible for this crime. It  is the duty of the state to protect its citizens," he said.    "The Lebanese people have been greatly deceived because they  have realised that the security the authorities promised to  restore is still a mirage," complained Ja'ja'.    His militia was disbanded along with others after Lebanon's  1975-1990 war.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Santiago Radio Cooperativa in Spanish at  1100 GMT on 13 April reports during its regular newscast that  Planning Minister Luis Maira Aguirre announced the creation of  the Social Inter-Ministerial Commission, Comision Social  Inter-Ministerial, that will be headed by President Eduardo Frei  and coordinated by Maira. The health, education, housing,  labor, justice, finance, and agriculture ministers and the  Women's Service director also will be members of the commission  that will be in charge of maximizing the government effort to  fight poverty. The commission will focus its attention on  specific regional programs such as those related to  mini-enterprises, indigenous communities, infants, handicapped  people, and specific government programs that must be reviewed.  Maira said the initiative will not entail new taxes but rather  a rationalization of the public effort and better distribution  of expenditures.</p>

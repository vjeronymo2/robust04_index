Adm. William J. Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff, was at Paramount to do a cameo in "Cheers," and asked to visit the  nearby set of "Star Trek: The Next Generation." Knowing when he was outranked,  the head man of the Enterprise, Capt. Jean Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart),  graciously relinquished his chair to the admiral during the brief visit.

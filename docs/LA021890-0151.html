			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CRAWFORD'S SPREE NOT ENOUGH TO KEEP VENTURA FROM TITLE  </P> <P> When Ventura and Moorpark colleges tipped off Saturday, a share of the Northern  Division title of the Western State Conference hung in the balance.  </P> <P> Sam Crawford, Moorpark's 5-foot-9 freshman guard, proved equal to the  challenge, scoring a school-record 49 points. Unfortunately that wasn't enough  as Moorpark wound up on the short end of a 104-89 score.  </P> <P> Crawford, a Westchester High product, connected on 16 of 23 attempts from the  field and converted 15 of 17 free throws, accounting for more than half of the  Raiders' points. But six players scored in double figures for Ventura (25-9,  11-3 in conference play) to more than offset Crawford's scintillating  performance.  </P> <P> Crawford broke Larry DeLaittre's long-standing record of 46 points set in  1967-68, the Raiders' first season of basketball.  </P> <P> "I played the game as hard as I could and I had a very good night", Crawford  said. "The game is about winning though, and we didn't win tonight, so the  record doesn't mean anything to me. I'm very disappointed in this loss."  </P> <P> With a win, Moorpark (21-10, 9-5), which last won a title in 1980-81, could  have gained a share of the WSC title with Ventura.  </P> <P> The Raiders jumped to a 9-4 lead and maintained an advantage through the first  10 minutes by shooting 53% from the field. But Ventura solved the Raider  defense and went on a 19-5 run in the next 10 minutes. By halftime, the Pirates  led, 44-35.  </P> <P> "They just outplayed us, it was that simple," Moorpark Coach Al Nordquist said.  "They broke our defense and they hit the threes (three-point baskets) whenever  we would make a run at them."  </P> <P> Ventura won its fifth consecutive title behind the play of 6-foot-6 center  Lester Neal, who scoreds 24 points and had 10 rebounds. Forward Chris Hantgin  added 17 points.  </P> <P> "We have a deeper bench than Moorpark and we just kept coming at them with  fresh men," Ventura Coach Phil Matthews said. "That was a key to the win. Al  just doesn't have the depth on the bench that we do."  </P> <P> Raider center Greg Taylor had 15 points and grabbed 11 rebounds and forward  Roger Thomas added 11 points.  </P> <P> With a second-place finish in the Northern Division, Moorpark is almost assured  of a playoff berth. Pairings will be announced Monday.  </P></p>

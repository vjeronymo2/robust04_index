Delivering his government work report at the second session  of the Eighth National People's Congress, Li said that British  colonial rule in Hong Kong is coming to an end and that no force  can stop that.    The day is drawing near when China will resume its exercise  of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao, he said. As it has  been doing all along, the Chinese Government will go on  preparing for a smooth transition and smooth transfer of  government in both places, in accordance with the Basic Law of  the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the Basic Law of  the Macao Special Administrative Region and relevant resolutions  of the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee,  the premier said.    Li noted China and Portugal have cooperated well on the  question of Macao. However, talks between the representatives  of the Chinese Government and the British Government on  arrangements for 1994/1995 elections in Hong Kong have  terminated, a consequence for which the British side must bear  full responsibility.    In accordance with the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region and the decision of the Standing Committee  of the National People's Congress, he said, the preliminary  working committee for the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong  Special Administrative Region has begun its work. Li urged the  preliminary working committee to unite with Hong Kong  compatriots on the broadest basis and do good preparatory work  for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and its first  government and legislature.    In the part of his report subtitled "Promoting the Peaceful  Reunification of the Motherland," Li said China shall follow  unswervingly the principle of "peaceful reunification and one  country, two systems."    After reviewing the progress of relations between the two  sides across the Taiwan Straits, Li Peng said, "we maintain that  differences between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits should  be settled through increased contacts and consultations."    "It is the common aspiration of all the Chinese people to  achieve peaceful reunification of the motherland, any act or  attempted act of secession, no matter in what form, will be in  vain," he said.    Li Peng said, "we place high hopes on the Taiwan authorities  and still higher hopes on the people of Taiwan. We hope the  Taiwan side will attach great importance to the overall  interests of the nation and join us in developing relations  across the straits and working for peaceful reunification."</p>

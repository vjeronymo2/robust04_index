			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / This Week: FT guide to crime in the US How bad a problem is crime in the US? Opinion polls show more than 20 per cent of those questioned now rate crime as the most serious issue facing the country, more than any other issue. Foreigners share that view; the British Foreign Office issues the same kind of travel warning for Miami that it gives for countries in the midst of civil war. Since the homicide rate in the US is now seven times that of Canada and 20 times Germany's, there is good reason for feeling that way. After all, homicide is now the number three cause of death among elementary and middle school children, and a child is 15 times more likely to die from gunfire in the US than in Northern Ireland. Is it getting worse? In the mind of the public, there is no question. Polls show people are twice as afraid of being murdered as they were just one year ago. But criminologists at the Justice Department say the most reliable statistics indicate that the total number of crimes has fallen from a peak between 1975 and 1982, while violent crime rates have stayed largely the same. Around 32 people per 1,000 households are victims of violent crime in any given year, they say. But the level of violence against specific groups such as teenagers and blacks has risen sharply in recent years. How much of the problem has to do with drugs? The total drug arrest rate has climbed over the last decade from 256 per 100,000 inhabitants to 435 per 100,000, and within that total the rate of arrests for the sale of heroine or cocaine has increased more than eightfold. The rate of drug arrests increases in line with the size of the city, to 1,031 per 100,000 in cities with more than 250,000 inhabitants. And Department of Justice surveys show that two-thirds of all those arrested test positive for some kind of drug. What is the federal government trying to do about it? According to Congressman Charles Schumer, head of the House of Representatives crime committee, left wingers want all prevention and no punishment, while right wingers want all punishment and no prevention. But last month Congress finally passed a crime bill that tries to combine punishment, prevention and gun control. Over six years the bill will provide Dollars 8.8bn to hire up to 100,000 new police officers, Dollars 7.9bn to build prisons and Dollars 6.9bn to pay for social programmes intended to reduce crime, such as drug rehabilitation and improvements to lighting in city parks. It would also ban the manufacture or possession of guns classified as assault weapons and impose tougher sentences for certain crimes: the death penalty for dozens of new federal offences, such as the murder of law enforcement officials, and a mandatory life sentence for a third violent felony. Will it work? Probably not. Crime is overwhelmingly a state and local responsibility, and most federal action on the issue is largely political posturing. Money for more police officers could help some beleaguered local governments, though the cities with the worst murder rates, such as Detroit and Washington, already have some of the largest police forces in proportion to their populations. The assault gun ban will not touch handguns, which account for 83 per cent of all violent crimes involving firearms. Some prevention programmes have proved their worth at a local level, but it is always difficult to duplicate them nationwide. And many local officials doubt whether Congress will actually find the cash to fulfil the bill's promises. What about the tougher sentences? It is traditional to include lots of new death penalties in crime legislation, but mostly these are exotic offences such as the murder of a federal poultry inspector. The death penalty is mostly inflicted for murder, which is a state offence. The federal government last carried out an execution in 1963, for kidnapping. Mandatory life sentences for repeated violent offenders could prevent some crimes committed by released prisoners, like the murder of Polly Klaas in California. But some officials worry that it could simply fill up the prisons with elderly criminals, and force them to release other prisoners early because they don't have enough money to build all the new jails they need. If more executions and more people in prison were the answer, then the US would already be one of the safest places in the world. It is virtually alone in the western world in its insistance on capital punishment; its prison population, with 519 people jailed for every 100,000 citizens, is five times that of other industrialised nations and matched only by Russia's.</p>

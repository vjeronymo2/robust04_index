			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sakigake (Harbinger) representative </F> Masayoshi Takemura by unidentified NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN  correspondent; place and date not given]    [Text] [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] You and Tomiichi Murayama,  chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], agreed  to cooperate with each other. Do you think it is possible for  you to take unified actions with the SDPJ?    [Takemura] I am not that optimistic. I do not think we will  immediately form a unified faction or start official policy  meetings. However, since we are in a similar position, we felt  that we are close to each other and that we need to cooperate.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] You are clearly standing against  Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa.    [Takemura] I am not willing to take a stand against Ozawa.  I simply could not agree with his way of thinking. I am sure  he will change more and more. Therefore, I will not assume a  presumptuous stand by saying that I am anti-Ozawa.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Sakigake is viewed as a "liberal"  force that confronts the "new liberals," including Ozawa.    [Takemura] Ozawa explained that his liberalism is "new  liberalism that gives consideration to the weak." If he really  means it, then I affirmatively accept it.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the disputes  being created over the political world's reorganization?    [Takemura] Constitutional, diplomatic, and security issues  are foundations. We need to coordinate while listening to each  party's opinions. Political technique is another important  essence that needs to be considered. As I look back at the  experiences I had during the Hosokawa administration, I think we  should not form a coalition unless we are willing to accept  mutual differences. It is necessary for us to attach importance  to cooperation with parties we think we can reach fundamental  agreements in such areas as forming decision-making rules.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the Hata  administration?    [Takemura] In his policy speech, the prime minister said  that "the ideology of the Constitution became ever more  important." Immediately after his inauguration, however, he  referred to the right of collective self-defense. I think the  series of remarks made by the chief cabinet secretary, the  foreign minister, and the Defense Agency director general  reflect the true nature of the current administration. I have a  strong feeling of physical disorder.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The people's attention is focused on  the timing of the lower house's dissolution, and whether a  general election will be held under a system of multiseat  constituencies or a mixture of single-seat constituencies and a  proportional representation system.    [Takemura] I am trying not to think about Diet dissolution.  I think it is reasonable to have the next election under the  system that is a mixture of single-seat constituencies and  proportional representation. However, I do not mean to deny the  prime minister's constitutional right to dissolve the Diet.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] When do you think the bill for  redrawing [House of Representatives] electoral districts will be  approved?    [Takemura] We need a certain number of days for  deliberation. It is possible that it may not be passed smoothly  if the government or parties get involved. I think we should  quietly deal with the issue as if we were waiting for a Supreme  Court decision. We have to avoid creating confusion by hinting  at the possibility of Diet dissolution.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How are you going to fight the next  general election?    [Takemura] On the basis of the assumption that the next  election will be held under the system that is a mixture of  single-seat constituencies and a proportional representation  system, we would like to seek wide-ranging cooperation with  parties and political forces. We want to give backing to as  many fine candidates as possible.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How do you think Japan should deal  with the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear arms  development?    [Takemura] The United States and the ROK are having  discussions [with the DPRK] more patiently than Japan thinks.  For some reason, however, debates are being held in Japan on  the assumption of launching an economic or naval blockade. I  have an impression that Japan is too hasty. It is very  dangerous.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How are you going to reform the tax  system?    [Takemura] I am of the opinion that apart from the ruling  parties' discussions, we need to have discussions only within  Sakigake or with the SDPJ and some members of the Japan New  Party. We need to reduce taxes. I think all parties are  beginning to understand that a tax hike is inevitable too  [sentence as published].</p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Renault valued at Pounds 5bn for launch of partial sell-off The French government will today launch the partial privatisation of Renault, the motor group that is one of the most attractive assets in the country's public sector and a former bastion of union power. Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, gave a guideline price of between FFr163 and FFr178 per share for institutional investors, valuing the company at FFr39bn to FFr42.5bn (Pounds 4.7bn to Pounds 5.1bn). The price range, which officials described as non-binding, is below many market estimates which have been between FFr42bn and FFr45bn. Mr Alphandery described the partial privatisation, which is expected within the next month, as an important step for the motor group and for French financial markets. The issue is being aimed mainly at individual investors, who will be able to make non-binding applications for shares from today. Mr Alphandery said the government planned to sell about 60 per cent of the shares to individuals, but the proportion could be increased to two-thirds if demand was strong. Previous issues in the French government's privatisation programme have seen shares clawed back from institutional investors following strong subscriptions by individuals. Industry observers in Paris predicted that Renault would also see keen interest. 'It is a household name and seems likely to be fairly priced,' said a motor industry analyst at a French merchant bank. He added that Renault, which achieved profits of FF1.07bn last year and forecasts a strong increase in 1994, was one of the few motor groups to remain in profit during the recession in the industry in 1992 and 1993. Mr Alphandery stressed that the company would remain in French hands and that the government, which holds 80 per cent of Renault's shares, would retain a 51 per cent stake. 'Privatisation is not on the agenda,' he said. As part of the operation, Volvo of Sweden, Renault's former partner in an aborted merger, will sell between 8 per cent and 12 per cent of the French company's shares. It holds 20 per cent. Mr Alphandery said foreign shareholders would be welcome. However, a UK retail broker said that foreign individuals might find it hard to obtain shares. Lex, Page 22 French stocks, Page 43</p>

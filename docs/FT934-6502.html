			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zinc prices forecast to rise sharply Efforts being made by European zinc producers to co-ordinate capacity cuts would result in one or two smelters closing by the end of next year and this would almost certainly cause a fast price rise to about 60 cents a lb, more than one third above today's level, according to Mr Jean-Pierre Rodier, chairman of Union Miniere, the Belgian group that is the world's biggest zinc producer. He was speaking at a symposium organised by the Belgian Non-Ferrous Metals Federation where another speaker, Mr Philip Crowson, chief economist at the RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining company, was highly critical of the so-called zinc smelter 'shut down' proposals. European producers decided early this month to press ahead rapidly with the scheme, which aims to eliminate substantial over-capacity by the permanent closure of one or two smelters, the cost of which would be paid for by the industry as a whole. Mr Crowson hit out against the scheme by suggesting: 'Agreements to close down European smelters, always assuming any are concluded, will have but a limited impact if they are not accompanied by a standstill on offsetting investments elsewhere. Mr Rodier agreed that market forces would eventually curb overcapacity, but that would take time and have brutal social consequences. 'And it might not be the worst zinc smelters that close - just those where the shareholders are fed up with investing in zinc.'  -----------------------------------------------              LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS              (As at Monday's close)  ----------------------------------------------- tonnes  ----------------------------------------------- Alumunium +16,075  to  2,368,300 Alumunium alloy             +100  to     49,000 Copper                    -1,075  to    584,750 Lead  575  to    297,825 Nickel                      +174  to    118,188 Zinc                   +3,850  to    854,575 Tin                          -30  to     19,410 ------------------------------------------------</p>

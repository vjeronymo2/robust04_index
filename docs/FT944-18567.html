			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / UK Company News: KPMG expects record year for flotations Despite record numbers of issues being pulled and a disturbing level of profit warnings from recent candidates, 1994 is still set to break records for flotations, according to KPMG Peat Marwick. According to the latest statistics from the accountancy group, there were 182 flotations in the first nine months of the year, marginally higher than the 180 issues launched in 1993. So far this year, KPMG estimates that a total of Pounds 7.8bn has been raised from new issues, and it expects that a pick-up in activity before the November budget should put the final tally comfortably ahead of the 1986 record of Pounds 9bn. This has happened in a year when offerings from Nottingham Group, Aerostructures Hamble, McDonnell Douglas Information Systems, and United Carriers have all followed upbeat share offers with profits warnings. Mr Neil Austin, head of new issues at KPMG Corporate Finance, claims that 'those investors who have had their fingers burnt will be particularly wary when looking at the new issues they are now being offered'. 'It is not difficult to see that some companies and their advisers will be facing an uphill struggle to convince investors that they are of a suitable size and quality to join the main stock market.' Some issuers have already given up the fight. London Capital Holdings was the first large issue to be pulled this year. It is not expected to recover from the shock, with Citibank considered more likely to sell off the properties. The downturn in the stock market since late August has exacerbated concern at the recent statements from Aerostructures Hamble and MDIS. The combined effect has sparked the likely postponement of offers for carton manufacturer Boxes, pizza chain Bright Reasons, and newsagents Martin Retail. Mr Austin said there were some others that had also been added to the danger list. A higher number of companies have been forced to radically cut back their target for capital raising. Pre-marketing exercises have been followed by advisers radically scaling back price expectations in an attempt to relieve the current institutional indigestion. Games Workshop cut back its target capital raising from Pounds 20m to Pounds 12m when it announced its pricing last Friday, and others will follow. As Mr Austin said: 'It is getting to the stage of the economic cycle where a trade sale is becoming a meaningful alternative to flotation for people who need an exit within the next six to nine months.'</p>

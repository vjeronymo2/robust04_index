			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dominique Baudis, head of the majority's </F> "Union" list, by Thierry Portes; place and date not given:  "Inventing a Model for the European Union"]    [Excerpt] [Portes] What do you think is the reason behind  voter indifference to the campaign, as indicated by opinion  polls?    [Baudis] Europe is too remote an issue for many French  citizens, who feel that this election has nothing to offer them.  This is a paradoxical attitude: They bemoan the lack of  democracy within the European institutions, and when they are  offered a major opportunity to shape these institutions, half of  them hesitate to go and vote. I would like our fellow citizens  to be aware of the importance of the 12 June vote, a one-round  election, if I may point out. Aware and responsible citizens,  this is what I hope for, because if we want a European  Parliament that pulls its weight vis-a-vis the European  Commission and its bureaucracy, people must vote on 12 June,  Euro-MP's must be given the legitimacy of the vote.    [Portes] If the French seem less interested in the election  of 12 June than in the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, is  this not because politicians themselves are more interested in  the presidential election?    [Baudis] Indeed, I note that at least five candidates are  leading a list in the perspective of the next presidential  election, and not with a view to defending their conception of  Europe. [Socialist Party Secretary General] Michel Rocard and  [National Front leader] Jean-Marie Le Pen have declared  themselves as presidential candidates. As for Jean-Pierre  Chevenement [former defense minister], Philippe de Villiers  [majority's anti-Maastricht list], and Bernard Tapie [Left  Radical Movement], they have obviously been dreaming about the  Elysee [office of the president].    [Portes] In your own coalition, several people have also had  the impending presidential election in mind.    [Baudis] I am not in the running and neither is anyone else  on my list. We have only one goal: We want our list, which is  the list of the majority and is supported by every single UDF  [French Democratic Union] and RPR [Rally for the Republic]  official to come in first on 12 June, so as to give as much  weight as possible to the majority's European views in the  European Parliament.    [Portes] Does not the quarrel between supporters and  opponents of the Maastricht Treaty still underscore the European  debate, both among the Right and the Left?    [Portes] This is a thing of the past, and one does not  integrate Europe while looking back. The referendum took place  in 1992, and the Maastricht Treaty came into force last  November. Why reenact a two-year-old debate? Those who  envision doing so probably oppose European integration.    As for our team, it is open, as is France. It includes  yesterday's Maastricht supporters and opponents, united around  Europe and in agreement on today's challenges and tomorrow's  objectives. One excellent feature of the Maastricht Treaty is  that it provides its a review in 1996.    Therefore, as soon as the election is over, we shall prepare  the changes needed to make Europe more democratic, closer to its  citizens, less technocratic, and to improve its decisionmaking  capabilities, among other things as a result of the future  integration of Austria and the Scandinavian countries.

			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BICYCLING BACKWARDS  </P> <P> I cannot believe the stupidity of ABC! During the final round of the British  Open golf tournament, the announcers named the winner of the Tour de France  bicycle race.  </P> <P> Even though I knew the afternoon telecast would not be live, it would have  seemed that way if I didn't know the outcome.  </P> <P> The announcement was even more unbelievable when one considers that ABC was  going to be the network telecasting the Tour de France later that day. Nice  going, ABC!  </P> <P> Alice Hill, Huntington Beach  </P></p>

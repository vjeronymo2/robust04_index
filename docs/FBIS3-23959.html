			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> ["Proposal for the Government and President of the Russian </F> Federation Concerning Urgent Measures To Overcome the Financial  Crisis of Manufacturing Enterprises" under the rubric "The  Nonpayment Crisis": "Businessmen Want To Work for the Benefit of  Russia"]    [Text]    1. An economic program and a strategy for structural changes  in the economy that are coordinated with manufacturers should be  developed and released, with priorities pointed out and  effective ways for their support and development outlined,  including those in the area of conversion.    2. The country's problem of nonpayments, which is rooted in  the failure of the state to honor its obligations to pay  industrial and agricultural enterprises for products, should be  solved.    The state's debt to defense enterprises, the agrarian  sector,  and the spheres financed from the budget should be settled.    An amnesty should be implemented for the status as of 1993  with regard to arrears in the payment of interest for the use of  bank credit and in penalties of all types for delays in  compulsory payments.    3. In 1994, the upper limit of all types of taxes actually  paid and other compulsory payments made by manufacturers of  goods should be restricted to a level not exceeding 35 percent  of the actual generated profits.    The rate of tax on property should be restricted to a volume  of no more than 0.1 percent of the book value, with depreciation  factored in.    4. Funds allocated by manufacturers to replenish their  proprietary working capital should be exempted from taxation in  1994 without any restrictions or qualifications; to this end,  manufacturers should also be granted the right to interest-free  tax credit with a repayment term of 24 months.    5. All funds actually allocated as investment in production  should be exempted from taxation in 1994 without any  restrictions or qualifications.    6. A special bank investment rate shall be set at a level  not  to exceed one-third of the discount rate of the Central Bank on  loans used for housing construction.    7. The standard duration of postal transit in the processing  of payments by banks should be established.    The sender and recipient banks should be charged with  monitoring the duration of payment processing and should be  granted the right to debit from the guilty parties without  acceptance, for the benefit of the sender enterprise, fines for  delaying payments in the amount of two times the discount rate  of the Central Bank of Russia, on the basis of the registration  dates of payment documents.    8. Export duties on raw-material commodities should be set  in  1994 at levels equalizing domestic and world prices.    Import duties on goods should be set in 1994 at levels  which,  on one hand, ensure reasonable priority for domestic  manufacturers of similar goods while, on the other hand,  destroying monopolies on the domestic market.    Technical equipment and subcontracted parts imported for the  purpose of manufacturing competitive products should be exempted  from customs duties on imports.    9. Temporary state regulation of prices for primary energy  resources should be introduced, ensuring financial support for  extractive enterprises at the initial stages out of funds  especially created to this end, gradually reducing subsidies as  the economy is restructured.    10. The thoughtlessly destroyed economic relations with  republics that belonged to the Soviet Union should be restored,  and artificial barriers in the path of the movement of  merchandise and money should be removed.</p>

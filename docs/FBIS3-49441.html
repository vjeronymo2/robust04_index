			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 11 January carries in  its regular 15-minute newscast several reports on the fighting  in the republic.    Reporting on the situation in Sarajevo this morning, the  studio announcer says that "the general alarm has been sounded  in the city. Just after 0900 the [Serb] enemy artillery shelled  the city center. As we have learned from the state hospital,  two lightly and two seriously wounded citizens have so far been  brought in, while, according to incomplete information, a number  of wounded have been brought into the Kosevo hospital. We again  warn the citizens of the capital to observe all the  self-protection measures envisaged by the general alarm."    The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 3d Corps describes the situation  in central Bosnia yesterday, adding that "the fighting increased  the number of killed members of the Vitez HVO so far which,  according to the official information issued yesterday by the  HVO operative area of central Bosnia, amounts to 1,504 killed  fighters over the last six months."    In his report from Zavidovici, Viktor Boban says that  yesterday was a "relatively quiet day, with sporadic fire from  both aggressors [the Serbs and HVO]. A convoy of the  aggressor's vehicles was spotted moving last night from the  direction of (Globanica) to the fronts on the left bank of the  Bosna River. This morning the enemy is occasionally firing with  small arms in the Smajlbasici and (Brasljevine) areas."    Hamiz Deronjic reports from Brcko that "last night the  [Serb]  enemy fired with antiaircraft guns and machine guns along the  entire front line. Earlier in the evening the aggressor shelled  (Poderice) with 82-mm mortars, and some 10 82-mm mortars were  also fired at Jagodnjak. The Lipovac defense lines were pounded  all night with 120-mm mortars. The aggressor also reinforced  his lines with men and equipment on this front last night."</p>

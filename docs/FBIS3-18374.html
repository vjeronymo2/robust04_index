			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Waste Disposal, Railroads, Post, </F> Banks -- Strike Chaos as of Today"]    [Excerpts] Now OeTV [Public Sector, Transportation, and  Traffic Trade Union] Chairwoman Monika Wulf-Mathies (51) is also  taking up the strike hammer -- two days of warning strikes,  which will affect us all. [passage omitted] Yesterday  Chancellor Kohl and Foreign Minister Kinkel, Free Democratic  Party of Germany [FDP], warned against strikes.    Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt (FDP) told BILD: "I warn  against destroying the nascent upswing through strikes and  against deliberately trampling on the sprouting plant of  economic development. Strike means a stop to the economic  upswing and many thousands of unemployed at short notice. I  appeal to the partners to the wage negotiations: You must  finally approach each other and agree on flexible contracts,  tailor-made for the different branches, regions, and problems of  the companies. Think about the fact that we are all sitting in  the same boat. I tell the helmsmen of the employers and trade  unions: Either we want to reach the shore together or we will  all sink."</p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Dismissal notices received About 100 employees of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television are due to have received dismissal notices by this morning because of their refusal to accept new cost-saving terms and conditions, Chris Tighe writes. The 100 will lose their jobs unless they give their acceptance by October 21. Members of the National Union of Journalists and the broadcasting union Bectu at Tyne Tees Television, the YTTV subsidiary covering north-east England, voted yesterday to oppose the terms. Yesterday Mr John Calvert, Tyne Tees TV managing director, said the company had held off issuing notices in the hope that a meeting of NUJ and Bectu members, due last night, would result in agreement. If that were not forthcoming, he expected dismissal notices to be issued today. The new terms would replace premium pay for overtime with flat-rate payments. Unions say this would mean some employees' earnings dropping by up to 40 per cent. The management said that about half its 600 Yorkshire-based employees had now accepted the terms unconditionally - a claim rejected by the unions.</p>

Therefore, residents must be included in the planning and implementation of this program. The HA shall develop a process that assures that RC/RMC/RO representatives and residents are fully briefed and have an opportunity to comment on the proposed content of the HA's application in response to this NOFA. The HA shall give full consideration to the comments and concerns of the residents. The process shall include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Informing residents of the selected developments regarding the preparation of the application, and providing for residents to assist in the development of the application, as appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Once a draft application has been prepared, the HA shall make a copy available for reading in the management office; provide copies of the draft to any resident organization representing the residents of the development(s) involved; and provide adequate opportunity for comment by the residents of the development and their representative organizations prior to making the application final. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Provide to any resident organization representing the development a summary of the resident comments and its response to them, and notify residents of the development(s) that this summary and response are available for reading in the management office. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) After HUD approval of a grant, notify residents of the development, and any representative organizations of approval, of the grant; notify the residents of the availability of the HUD approved implementation schedule in the management office for reading; and develop a system to facilitate a regular resident role in all aspects of program implementation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Training/Employment/Contracting of HA Residents. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (a) Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701u) (Section 3) requires that programs of direct financial assistance administered by HUD provide, to the greatest extent feasible, opportunities for job training and employment to lower income residents in connection with projects in their neighborhoods. For purposes of training and employment, the HA may offer opportunities to Section 3 residents in the following priority: (i) Residents of the housing development for which the assistance is being provided; (ii) residents who reside within a project area as defined in 24 CFR 135.15 and who reside in developments managed by the HA that is expending the assistance; and (iii) other residents of the Section 3 area. Therefore, at a minimum each HA and each of its contractors and subcontractors receiving funds under this program shall make best efforts to employ HA residents to provide services and renovation or conversion work. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) For purposes of the requirements under Section 3, a best effort means that the HA shall: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Attempt to recruit HA residents from the appropriate areas through local advertising media, signs placed at the proposed FIC project site, and community organizations and public or private institutions operating within the development area.

If the HA is unable to employ residents determined to be qualified, those residents shall be listed for the first available openings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Davis-Bacon Requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  All laborers and mechanics employed by contractors or the HA in renovation or conversion (including combining of units) on the premises of the HA development to accommodate the provision of supportive services under this program shall be paid not less than the wages prevailing in the locality, as predetermined by the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a_276a&hyph;5).

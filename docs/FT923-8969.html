			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Iraq bars inspection teams from ministries IRAQ yesterday stepped up its political challenge to the United Nations in general and US President George Bush in particular by warning that it would not tolerate further inspections of Baghdad ministries by teams of UN inspectors. The US immediately denounced the statement. Mr Bush pledged that Washington would guarantee UN inspectors access to suspected Iraqi weapons sites, saying: 'United Nations resolutions will be honoured in full.' Mr Marlin Fitzwater, White House spokesman, added that military planning had already been undertaken to ensure the enforcement of such resolutions. Oil prices rose on fears that the US might eventually use force against Iraq. Mr Hamed Youssef Hammadi, Iraq's information minister, said his government rejected any new attempt to enter ministries because the aim was to 'hurt Iraq's sovereignty and independence'. A UN inspection team seeking evidence of Iraq's nuclear and chemical weapons programme was denied entry to the agriculture ministry for 18 days last month in defiance of Security Council resolutions. On gaining access to the building, inspectors found nothing relating to Iraq's weapons programme and President Saddam Hussein claimed Mr Bush had been politically humiliated. Iraqi officials were jubilant that the UN team had been delayed for so long and that Americans in the team did not search the building. Mr Hammadi said yesterday: 'The entering of ministries or the headquarters of ministries will not be agreed to. This is one thing. As far as other places are concerned the inspection teams can visit any place in the country. We want to end this silly chapter as soon as possible.' A new 22-strong UN team is preparing to leave Bahrain for Baghdad. Mr Rolf Ekeus, who heads the UN effort to destroy all Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, last week told Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, that there would be a swift reaction if Baghdad again tried to block inspection. In New York, Mr Michael Newlin, deputy head of the UN inspection commission, said the new probe of Iraq's major weapons capability would start on schedule tomorrow. A senior UN official said inspectors would not hesitate to enter a ministerial building if they suspected it contained relevant material. The statement by Mr Hammadi keeps the issue high on the US political agenda as Mr Bush prepares for the Republican convention on August 17. The Iraqi leader boasted of his part in the political downfall of Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Baghdad radio has been promising similar treatment for Mr Bush.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 2 May (PL) -- Today, Cuban Deputy Foreign  Minister Isabel Allende said the number one priority of her  country's government is to have the embargo lifted. She said  the embargo imposed by the U.S. Government violates  international law.    During a meeting with 142 U.S. citizens here visiting as  members of the 25th contingent of the Venceremos Brigade,  Allende said: "Voting against the embargo means voting for  adherence to international law."    Allende explained Cuban diplomacy's main goals and  underscored the Cuban Government's efforts to survive despite  the crisis, adapting to new global realities while keeping the  achievement of the past 35 years in sight.    Referrring to the people's right to free education and  health, a home, and defense of national sovereignty and  independence, she said: "Cuba must adapt itself to the world,  seek ways to survive. We must and will change but while  preserving the basic achievements of socialism."    Pointing out the negative effects of U.S.'s coercive  measures, she said nine out of 10 business deals with foreign  enterprises fail because of Washington's pressures. But she  sounded optimistic because the embargo has been rejected twice  by the United Nations.    In this connection, the deputy minister said another of  Cuba's priorities is stimulating foreign investment, not for  business' sake alone but to help spread a true image of the  local situation so as to offer incentives and guarantees to  foreign investors.    She also said Cuba saw the effects of the embargo alleviated  by the country's ties with the now defunct Socialist bloc and  the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, ever since 1989 Cuba has lost  three-fourths of its most important markets and outside sources  of financing, to all of which is added the aggravation of the  embargo via the Torricelli amendment.    Among the Foreign Ministry's most immediate goals, Allende  mentioned working so Cuba can never again be accused of human  rights violations. To this end, the issue must be  depoliticized. It is necessary to show that the embargo is the  first and foremost violator of human rights.    Attention to emigration, agreed upon during the recent  conference between the government and expatriates, is another  priority, designed to depoliticize ties with this sector,  keeping it separate from disagreement with the United States.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 13 TASS -- "The Russian Foreign  Ministry is not planning to close down the Russian Embassy in  Rwanda for the time being," Leonid Safonov, head of the Africa  Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, told ITAR-TASS  today. He also said that the staff members of the Russian  Embassy and of the "Aeroflot" office, who were evacuated  together with their families from Rwanda to Burundi, would  return to Moscow on April 15. Only the ambassador and 2 or 3  members of the embassy will remain in Kigali.    Twenty-two Russian citizens were evacuated from Rwanda on  April 12. The Russian Foreign Ministry decided not to risk the  lives of its representatives there. The Russian ambassador in  Rwanda was instructed to get in touch with Russian women,  married to Rwanda citizens and wishing to leave the country.  "However, most of them preferred to stay in Rwanda," Safonov  stated. There are now 15 such Russian women in Rwanda. There  are also 10 Russian employees of the United Nations in the  country.</p>

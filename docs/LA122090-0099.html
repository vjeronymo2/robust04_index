			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: WEST HOLLYWOOD;  </P> <P> SOVIET JEWS FORMING GROUP  </P> <P> Leaders of Soviet Jewish organizations from the United States, Israel and the  Soviet Union met over the weekend at the World Conference of Soviet Jewish  Solidarity.  </P> <P> In sessions held at Plummer Park, delegates from various cities in the United  States formed a national group to be known as the American Union of Russian  Jewish Organizations and Communities that they hope will help them influence  the decision-making process on immigration and resettlement issues.  </P> <P> Delegates from the American group will meet again in Moscow in January with  representatives of the Soviet-based Va'ad organization and Israel's Soviet  Zionist Forum for more discussions on forming a worldwide group, according to a  statement issued after the meeting.  </P> <P> "Our challenge is to get governments and Jewish federations to change their  policy toward us from paternalism to partnership. It's a basic human principle  to want to determine your own fate, and that is what we are seeking," said Roma  Spektor, a Soviet delegate.  </P></p>

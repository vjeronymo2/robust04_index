			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / The Markets: Stop worrying and love the boom - Wall Street The US economy keeps moving along at an impressive clip, but Wall Street remains as unsure as ever in the face of the economic recovery and does not know whether to love it or loathe it. This week, the markets passed the first four days in an uneasy limbo, with traders and investors spending too much of their time worrying about what Friday's third quarter gross domestic product report would say about the pace of economic growth, and what it would mean for monetary policy and interest rates, and not enough time concentrating on the positive fundamentals underpinning share prices - such as robust corporate earnings. When the GDP report came out just before the markets opened yesterday, the news seemed bad. Bad, that is, to anyone worried about excessive economic growth. According to the Commerce department, GDP rose 3.4 per cent in the third quarter, a slowdown from the 4.1 per cent growth rate of the second quarter, but still considerably stronger than Wall Street had been expecting. Forecasts had ranged from GDP growth of 2.8 per cent to 3.0 per cent. The fact that the economy was growing faster than anticipated triggered some early selling of bonds, on the assumption that the data only increased the chances that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates when its policy-making committee next gathered in mid-November. Although share prices did not fall on the news, they did not rise either, and no one in the stock market was particularly enthralled at the prospect of yet more rate increases. Consistency, however, has never been one of the markets' stronger points. Within half an hour of the opening bell yesterday, sentiment appeared to have turned round completely. Bonds began rallying, in the process sending the yield on the benchmark 30-year back below 8 per cent. (On Monday, the 30-year yield closed above 8 per cent for the first time in two and a half years, triggering an avalanche of feverish commentary heralding the end of the world as everyone knew it.) Stocks took off on an even more improbable flight. By 11am, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up more than 40 points. The roots of this remarkable comeback were hidden in the text of the third quarter GDP report. Although the headline figure of 3.4 per cent growth was disturbing, bond traders and analysts liked what they saw elsewhere in the data. The implicit price deflator, a closely-watched inflation indicator, rose by only 1.6 per cent in the quarter, down from 2.9 per cent in the previous period. Another inflation measure, the fixed weight index, rose 2.7 per cent, which was also considerably less than expected. Then there was the data on inventories, which showed that companies rushed to stock their shelves in the third quarter to meet unexpectedly strong consumer demand. Analysts said the subsequent big jump in inventories - the largest since 1984 - should be offset in the fourth quarter when businesses, their warehouses likely overflowing with stock, place fewer orders for manufactured goods. There were other, less compelling, statistics in the third quarter GDP release which also reassured the markets that the economy was not quite as buoyant as it seemed, but the clear message from the markets was that overall, the report was nothing like as unwelcome as it first seemed. That did not mean, however, that everyone could stop worrying about another imminent Fed rate increase (following the markets these days requires a mind as agile as a gazelle). No, there was nothing in the GDP data to suggest the Fed will not decide to tighten policy again at its open market committee meeting on November 15. But there were enough encouraging nuggets of information in the figures to suggest that the next Fed rate rise may be the last for some time. The Fed would like to see the economic growth rate reduced to a less potentially inflationary 2.5 per cent. Assuming that the Fed puts up the federal rounds rate next month by another half a percentage point (this is the consensus among analysts on Wall Streets), the central bank will have raised short-term rates this year from below 3 per cent to 5.25 per cent. Over the same period, long-term interest rates will have risen from 6.3 per cent to about 8 per cent. According to the optimists who bought stocks and bonds yesterday, these increases should have tightened credit conditions sufficiently to slow the economy over the next year to a growth rate with which the Fed feels comfortable - say, 2.5 per cent. It is a neat scenario, too neat perhaps. But it at least gives Wall Street some reason for optimism as it enters what could be a long, cold winter. Monday 3855.30 - 36.00 Tuesday 3850.59 - 04.71 Wednesday 3848.23 - 02.36 Thursday 3875.15+ 26.92 Friday 3930.66+ 55.51</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kim Myong-chol] </F>   [Text] Seoul, Jan. 18 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  had received reports on their 1994 operating programs from 11 of  his government's 27 ministries and agencies as of Tuesday, and  all 11 are economic ministries.    Kim asked his ministers with economic portfolios to report  first as the focus of his policy in 1994 is revitalizing the  economy through increased international competitiveness of  Korean products, and he wanted to hear about the plans to  achieve this goal before anything else, according to Chongwadae  [presidential office] officials.    He also wanted to relieve the economic ministries of the  burden of new year presidential reports as soon as possible so  that they can quickly start work preparing for  internationalization and market opening.    Kim questioned working-level officials, as well as  ministers,  to see if they knew their jobs in a phenomenon unseen in new  year presidential briefings in the past, where the president  heard the report and then issued instructions without any give  and take. [sentence as received]    Pollution of the Naktong River interfered with the 11  economic briefings and left the administration dumbfounded.    Kim was frustrated in his desire to finish receiving new  year  reports from all government ministries and agencies by the end  of January as he had to divert much attention to the issue.    He told the cabinet to look into the cause of the pollution  and work out a comprehensive plan to keep all rivers, especially  those that supply tap water, free of pollution.    "The issue has resulted from the failure of past governments  to take proper anti-pollution measures for the five biggest  rivers, including the Naktong," he said. "The present civilian  government must not gloss over the issue but seek a fundamental  solution of it to win the people's trust."    Receiving the reports, Kim stressed five points -- measures  against financial market opening, privatization of state-run  enterprises, industrial peace, rural development, and  deregulation of economic activities for increased exports.    To cope with the liberalization of financial services, he  said, the functions of supervisory institutions such as the  Office of Bank Supervision, the Securities Supervisory Board and  the Insurance Supervisory Board should be reformed to help  financial institutions increase their competitiveness against  foreign rivals.    On the privatization program, Kim said state-run enterprises  that can be better operated by private hands, including  state-run telecommunications firms, should be privatized for  better market competitiveness.    But he stressed most the need for labor-management  cooperation and industrial peace. In the Labor Ministry's  briefing Jan. 13, he pointed to the need for labor and  management to recognize that they are in the same boat in this  era of boundless international competition and said: "The defeat  in this competition means not only the end of the business for  management but also the loss of livelihood for labor."    Kim appears to have a firm belief that annual labor disputes  serve only to hinder the effort to revitalize the economy.    With the Trade, Industry and Energy, and Agriculture,  Forestry and Fisheries Ministries he stressed the need for  measures to help corporations increase capital investment, to  ease foreign trade rules for increased exports and to develop  agriculture as a competitive and viable industry.    It is but midway through the briefings, however, and thus  too  soon to evaluate the course as a whole.    Distinct differences from the past are evident though. While  Kim is using the sessions as an opportunity for dialogue with  working-level officials on policy, the officials are using them  to express their opinions on the pressing issues facing the  country.</p>

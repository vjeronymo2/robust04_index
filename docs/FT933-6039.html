			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / International Company News: Asbestos claims hit US insurers THIRD-QUARTER results of two US insurance groups, Chubb and CNA Financial Corp, will suffer as a result of an agreement on settling certain claims related to asbestos products manufactured by the Fibreboard Corp. As a result of the accord, Chubb yesterday warned that it would post a loss in the third quarter after taking an after-tax charge of Dollars 358m relating to the settlement. However, the company expects to report a net profit for the first nine months of 1993 and for the full year. The expected quarterly loss, which works through at Dollars 3.95 a share, would follow the company's announcement of second-quarter net income of Dollars 168.5m or Dollars 1.89 a share. For the first half, Chubb posted net income of Dollars 294.3m, or Dollars 3.31. CNA Financial, which is 83 per cent-owned by Loews Corporation, said it would take a Dollars 325m after-tax charge, or Dollars 5.26 a share, in the third quarter because of asbestos-related claims. Loews, in turn, warned that the agreement would reduce its third-quarter earnings by about Dollars 270m, or Dollars 4.17. In last year's third quarter, Loews, which also owns Lorillard, which markets tobacco products, posted net income of Dollars 128.6m, or Dollars 1.98. The figure included a Dollars 109.7m charge relating to claims at CNA from damage caused by Hurricane Andrew. Chubb said it was boosting its reserves for Fibreboard claims by Dollars 675m, to Dollars 1.25bn.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By P.C. Tang and Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] The Hague, April 15 (CNA) -- The Unrepresented  Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) will support Taiwan's  bid to join the United Nations, UNPO Secretary-General M.C. Van  Walt Van Praag said Friday [15 April].    The Hague-based organization has a wealth of experience in  lobbying the United Nations and maintains close relations with  some Western countries. "We can use our special ties and  experience to help Taiwan win a UN seat," Van Praag told CNA.    The UNPO can also mobilize the world news media to support  Taiwan's UN bid, he noted.    Taiwan has been kept out of the world body since Beijing  assumed the UN China seat in 1971.    Van Praag said UNPO may discuss detailed measures to help  boost Taiwan's UN bid during its April 18 round table session.    However, Van Praag, a lawyer and an international law  expert,  said the UNPO cannot sue Beijing in the International Court of  Justice for blocking Taiwan's entry to the UN.    "Only UN members or affiliate organizations can file  lawsuits  in the world court," explained Van Praag. "Although the UNPO is  recognized by the UN as a non-governmental organization, it is  not a UN affiliate," he noted.    Van Praag, who is also legal advisor to Tibetan spiritual  leader the Dalai Lama, was commenting on a proposal by four  Taiwan legislators that the UNPO sue Beijing in the world court  on behalf of Taiwan.    The four -- Parris Chang, Stella Chen, Chen Tze-nan of the  Democratic Progressive Party and Tsai Chung-han of the ruling  Kuomintang -- arrived here Friday to attend the UNPO round table  session.    Parris Chang, chairman of the UNPO Steering Committee, will  chair the meeting, which will discuss the prevention of  international conflict in the post-Cold War world.    The two-day conference will bring together more than 200  delegates from 36 UNPO members, the United Nations, the UN high  commissioner for refugees, and other major international  organizations. Senior officials from the Dutch Foreign Ministry  and several European countries will also attend the meeting.    The UNPO, an alternative United Nations, was founded in the  Netherlands in February 1991 to help ethnic minorities and  peoples which are not represented in the UN and other major  world organizations.</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: Monsanto advance matches forecasts Monsanto, the US chemicals group, matched market expectations with steady annual earnings growth in the final quarter as cost-cutting took effect and sales edged ahead by less than 1 per cent. Leaving aside one-off items, fourth-quarter net income was Dollars 46m, or 39 cents a share, up from Dollars 12m, or 9 cents, the year before. Sales were Dollars 17m higher, at Dollars 1.88bn. In the latest period, the company reported an after-tax gain of 16 cents a share from a one-off reduction in working capital inventories, and a 6 cents a share charge to cover the sale or withdrawal of some products. The latest figures reflect sales growth in chemicals, pharmaceuticals and agricultural products, offset by a Dollars 50m decline in sales of NutraSweet, to Dollars 188m. Leaving aside one-off charges in both periods, the pharmaceuticals business consolidated its return to operating profitability, achieved in the previous quarter, with operating income of Dollars 25m. The chemicals division made operating profits of Dollars 55m, up from Dollars 26m, largely as a result of cost-cutting. For the year, before all non-recurring items, net income was Dollars 460m, or Dollars 3.82 a share, up from Dollars 346m or Dollars 2.81 in 1992. On Wall Street, Monsanto's stock fell Dollars 1 7/8 to close at Dollars 78 1/8 as profit-taking brought it down from its high for the previous 12 months.</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Top congressman hunts for way out of scandal Lawyers for congressman Dan Rostenkowski were reported yesterday to be trying to negotiate a legal bargain under which the powerful chairman of the House ways and means committee might plead guilty to misdemeanour offences relating to the House post office scandal unearthed in 1991. Mr Robert Bennett, the congressman's lawyer who is also representing President Bill Clinton in the civil sexual harassment suit brought by Ms Paula Jones, declined to comment yesterday. So did Ms Janet Reno, the attorney general. The outcome of the legal bargaining could have a sizeable impact on the fate of healthcare reform in Congress. Mr Rostenkowski's committee is an important drafting panel and the chairman is committed to bringing a bill to the floor of the House. Were felony charges to be brought, Mr Rostenkowski would be forced, under the rules of the House Democratic party caucus, to step aside as chairman until the case is resolved. A misdemeanour indictment involves no such automatic removal, although there would undoubtedly be calls for him to resign his post. Next in seniority on ways and means is congressman Sam Gibbons of Florida, who believes in universal health insurance coverage, but along the lines of the Canadian 'single payer' system which has been explicitly rejected by the Clinton administration. He also has nothing like Mr Rostenkowski's legendary powers of political persuasion. At a session of the 39-member committee on Wednesday, Mr Rostenkowski described his mission in typically blunt terms. 'I will do whatever I need to to get at least 20 votes on this committee' - the minimum number needed for a bill to reach the floor of the House. Last month, Mr Eric Holder, the federal attorney in Washington, sent to the justice department a draft indictment of Mr Rostenkowski. Details of the proposed indictment have never been made public. But last year Mr Robert Rota, the former House postmaster, pleaded guilty to misdemeanour embezzlement charges and implicated Mr Rostenkowski in the scheme to disguise theft by post office cashiers as payments for the purchases of stamps by the congressman. Since then, Mr Rosentowski's offices and campaign accounts in Washington and his Chicago district have also been investigated. He has continued to insist on his innocence of all charges.</p>

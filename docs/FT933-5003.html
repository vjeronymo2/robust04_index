			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Observer: Last waltz When Paul Keating drops by Balmoral in the middle of this month, his purpose is to let Queen Elizabeth know, doubtless in his ever-diplomatic way, that his country wishes to, er, dispense with her services. Should there be a lapse in the conversation, Her Majesty might, however, care to point out to the Australian prime minister just how difficult it would be to cast off all ties with the old country. When the Ozzies revert to their unofficial national anthem - Waltzing Matilda - they will still be singing to the music of an 18th-century army recruitment song, which originated in Rochester, Kent. Devised for the Duke of Marlborough's campaigns in the war of the Spanish succession, its opening words roll along to the same old tune: 'And come, be a soldier with Marlborough and me . . .' Taken down under by the convicts, it was left to 'Banjo' Patterson to swap the lyrics. Or so says Jonathan Marcus, the BBC World Service's defence correspondent, who has just started a 10-part history of warfare, From Hoplite to Harrier.</p>

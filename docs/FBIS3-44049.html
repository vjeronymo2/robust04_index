Speaking at Rustenburg during  his election campaign visit to the Western Transvaal, President  de Klerk said the East Rand was faced, not only with a security  problem, but with a socioeconomic issue. The solution had to  make provision for a socioeconomic upliftment program. He said  consultations were still being held with the ANC [African  National Congress] and the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] on the  multiparty plan.    President de Klerk said he was not worried about Mr. Nelson  Mandela's personal attacks on him because they were not based on  fact, but that it did concern him that somebody of Mr. Mandela's  status acted so irresponsibly. He said Mr. Mandela was making  personal attacks on him instead of condemning the activities of  the Self-Defense Units on the East Rand.    President de Klerk said the election was not centered on  freedom, because South Africans were already free, but that it  suited the opposition to talk about freedom as they did not have  a real message for the future.    He said right-wingers had no justification for threats of  war. The CP [Conservative Party] had lost two referendums and  two elections and would have to accept the majority decision.</p>

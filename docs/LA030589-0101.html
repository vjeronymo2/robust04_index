			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: THEY'LL PRAISE THE LORD AND PASS THE CONTRACEPTION  </P> <P>  -- Lyn Paleo of the San Francisco AIDS Foundation doffs her hat to Roman  Catholic school nuns for their frank and open discussion on the use of condoms  to fight the deadly disease. Paleo says that while most people try to avoid  talking about the C-word, as she refers to condoms, Catholic schools are  playing an important educational role. "The nuns tell us: 'You tell them  everything they need to know, whatever you need to say,' " Paleo said of the  foundation teams that visit the high schools. "One nun said: 'We preach 364  days a year about abstinence. You tell them what they need to know for the  other day in case our preaching hasn't worked.' " Paleo added: "Condoms and  condom use are the true cornerstones of preventing the transmission of the AIDS  virus." But, she said, selling the idea is another matter.  </P> <P>  -- For now, rock star Madonna's new video doesn't stand a prayer of being  shown on Italian television. Charges by the conservative Roman Catholic group  Famiglia Domani that the video, "Like a Prayer," is blasphemous have led  state-run RAI television to cancel plans to show the video on the program  "Notte Rock" (Rock Night) this week. In the video, the singer witnesses an  assault on a girl, and a black man is wrongly accused. Wearing a slip, Madonna  enters a church, where she stands before a statue of a black saint. The face is  that of the accused man. Madonna, moved by the statue-come-to-life, develops  bleeding hands similar to the wounds of the crucified Jesus. She kisses the  statue and tells the police the accused man is not guilty. Madonna's Italian  record company, WEA, said it will temporarily suspend TV distribution of the  video.  </P> <P>  -- Wait no more. A mere $1,720 will buy a rare find these days: Samuel  Beckett's latest novella, entitled "Stirrings Still." Only 200 signed copies of  the 83-year-old Nobel Prize-winning author's work are being printed in London  right now, but a mass-market edition should be in U.S. stores in a couple of  years. The book by the author of "Waiting for Godot" is a meditation on old age  that one reviewer lauded as "another of Beckett's nihilistic mantras, best  mumbled aloud." A sample: "A clock afar struck the hours and half-hours. The  same as when among others Darly once died and left him. Strokes now clear as if  carried by a wind now faint on the still air. Cries afar now faint now clear.  Head on hands half hoping when the hour struck that the half-hour would not and  half fearing that it would not. Similarly when the half-hour struck. Similarly  when the cries a moment ceased. Or merely wondering. Or merely waiting. Waiting  to hear." JAMES MARNELL  </P></p>

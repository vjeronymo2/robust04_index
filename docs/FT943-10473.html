			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Lira gains on D-Mark The strengthening Italian lira yesterday breached the L1,000 level against the D-Mark as fears of political instability receded, writes Philip Gawith. Although the conflict of interest arising from Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's interest in the Fininvest media group remains unresolved, the market appears to have been comforted by his public address on Tuesday. The pledge by Mr Umberto Bossi, the Northern league leader, that he would not bring down the government also bolstered sentiment. The lira closed in London at L998.8 per D-Mark from L1,003 on Tuesday. Elsewhere in Europe, the peseta slipped slightly to Pta102.1 against the D-Mark, from Pta101.8, after the Bank of Spain cut its key money rate by 15 basis points to 7.35 per cent. Amid generally quiet trading conditions on the foreign exchanges, the dollar continued its firmer showing against the yen, again finishing above Y100 in London. It closed at Y100.175 from Y100.415, and in New York it ended at Y100.275. The pound was little affected by the Bank of England's latest inflation report. The trade weighted sterling index was unchanged at 79.3, with the pound closing at DM2.4317 from DM2.4346. The Australian dollar came under pressure after it became clear that a near term rise in interest rates was unlikely. It ended at USDollars 0.732 from Dollars 0.7357, but remains above its 1994 upper trading range of Dollars 0.73. It looks possible that the worst may be over for the lira in the short term with both houses of parliament due to go on holiday at the weekend. Mr Giorgio Radaelli, international economist at Lehman Brothers in London, said the August-September period should be a better one for Italian assets. 'The absence of potential political setbacks improves the chances of lira assets doing well because the fundamentals are very good by pan-European standards,' he added. Recent history, said Mr Radaelli, shows that the third quarter of the year tends to be the best for lira assets. Strong tourism receipts is the main reason for this. Commenting on the lowering of rates in Spain, Mr Radaelli said it was not unexpected. The Bank of Spain showed in the first quarter that it was prepared to lower rates faster than the Bundesbank. The poor economic situation in the country, where unemployment is over 20 per cent, is also a stimulus to ease policy. The government still maintains a say in the setting of rates, and the high level of private sector debt in the country means that a rate cut move has wide repercussions. Mr Radaelli said the central bank's willingness to lower rates had probably also been encouraged by recent evidence of increased wage flexibility. Improved labour market efficiency provided greater leeway in monetary policy. The Lehman analyst said that the likelihood of further opportunistic rate cuts led him to predict a 3 to 5 per cent fall in the value of the peseta over the next 6 to 12 months. The dollar ignored reports of a 0.2 per cent rise in the US government's June index of leading economic indicators and a 0.8 per cent gain in July factory orders. It firmed slightly in New York after the release of the Federal Reserve's beige book, which reported solid economic growth, with scattered signs of growth slowing. Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW, said one factor accounting for renewed dollar strength was changes in hedging ratios. For those Japanese investors who felt that the dollar might have bottomed out, it made sense to unwind hedging positions taken out as a precaution against a rising yen. In the period August - December 1993, the yen fell by about 14 per cent against the dollar, despite no big changes in the trade surplus or capital flows. Changes in hedging strategies lay behind this move. UK money market rates maintained their steady tone, with three-month LIBOR trading again at 5 9/16 per cent. Although interest rate sentiment is more positive than at the end of last week, the market remains nervous. This was encouraged by the slightly bearish tone of media coverage of the Bank's quarterly inflation report. Although many analysts found the report encouraging, most newspaper headlines predicted that rates would rise within the next few months. A further hint that no rate rise is imminent came with the Bank's announcement that the interest rate on two and five-week repo and secured loan facilities, commencing today, would be unchanged at 5 5/32 per cent. The total amount to be provided to the market will be Pounds 3.682bn. In its daily operations the Bank gave late assistance of about Pounds 455m. Earlier it had provided Pounds 86m assistance at established rates, compared to a forecast Pounds 950m shortage. Short sterling futures traded reasonable volumes, but price movements were fairly small. The December contract saw 38,622 lots dealt to finish unchanged at 93.43. Overnight money traded in the 4 3/4 to 7 per cent range.</p>

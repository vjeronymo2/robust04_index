			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Virgin wins union battle in France THE British-owned Virgin megastores opened in France yesterday, following another victory in their battle to trade on Sundays. A Paris tribunal on Saturday rejected a complaint by the CGT, the French union organisation, which demanded Virgin's Paris and provincial stores be closed for the day under the country's 1906 Sunday trading law. The tribunal said the complaint 'could not be upheld in its current form'. The dispute arose after the government refused to renew a one-year 'derogation' which had allowed Virgin to open its megastores on Sunday. Virgin is appealing against the decision. There are signs that, faced with rising unemployment, the French government may have sympathy with their cause. Mr Michel Giraud, the employment minister, said last week that he 'was not hostile to an eventual reopening on the condition that it created jobs'. Last Friday Mr Patrick Zelnick, the chief executive of Virgin France, sought to convince the minister on this score, presenting a five-year plan for the training and recruitment of about 1,000 people. Virgin says that its Paris megastore receives about 20 per cent of its weekly sales on Sunday and that permission to trade on that day would allow it to maintain staff levels in Paris and to open more stores in provincial cities. The CGT, however, continues to resist Virgin's bid for Sunday trading. Citing the support of the nation's small shopkeepers, the union's Paris branch has called for the public authorities to 'take all the necessary actions to ensure respect of the law'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Mangosuthu  Buthelezi says that he will not serve in a government of  national unity even if his party wins enough votes. Dr.  Buthelezi said at an election rally near Piet Retief in the  Eastern Transvaal that the IFP's struggle for freedom had just  begun.    Dr. Buthelezi also warned that if the ANC-SACP [South  African  Communist Party] alliance gained more than 50 percent support in  the election, it could scrap the present interim constitution.  He said that a bleak future would await South Africa because  federalism, the kwaZulu-Natal region, and other provincial  powers would disappear.</p>

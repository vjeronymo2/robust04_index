			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- The key indexes of  economic indicators remained well below the boom-or-bust line of  50 percent in December, showing that Japan's economy still  remains in a slump, the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said  Tuesday [22 February].    The coincident indicator, which represents the current state  of the economy, was well below the 50 percent line for the third  straight month at 25.0 percent, following a preliminary reading  of 20 percent in the previous two months.    The leading indicator, which projects economic conditions a  few months ahead, was at 36.4 percent, below the 50 percent line  for the eighth month in a row.    Preliminary figures were 41.7 percent for November and 33.3  percent for October.    The index for raw material inventories was down 2.2 percent,  falling to the negative side for the first time in two months  with the rise in electrical machinery and chemical-related goods  shipments.    Machinery orders slipped to the minus side for the first  time  in two months.    The Nikkei commodity index was up 0.7 percent, showing  positive growth for the first time in 10 months due to the  smaller drop in nonferrous metal prices.    The rest of the components in the leading indicator remained  on the minus side.    In the coincident indicator, the only change was that the  department store sales index was flat compared with the negative  side it was on in November.    This was attributed mainly to a smaller decline in sales of  menswear.    Electricity consumption and the index for commercial sales  continued on an uptrend.    The rest of the components such as industrial production,  were on the minus side.    The lagging indicator for December was zero percent,  unchanged from the preliminary zero percent the previous month.    An official at the EPA said that although the general  picture  is sluggish, some signs in the individual components point to  hopes of a slight recovery.    He noted that among the leading indicator components,  employment is picking up in the construction industry due to the  demand in public works, and that the floor space of new  constructions shows a slight increase.    The housing sector could begin to pick up now that the  government has decided to ease housing loan terms in its  economic package, the official said.    "I think the figures for January will be better, perhaps  even  reaching the 50 percent level," he said. "But there's really no  knowing what will happen with the possibility of the yen gaining  ground," he said, referring to the Japanese currency whose rise  could dampen economic recovery.</p>

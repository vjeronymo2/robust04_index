These offices are established for the investigation of all potential and actual claims arising within their jurisdiction, either on an area basis or on a command or agency basis. A claims officer (see appendix B to this part) will not be a claims processing office; his or her role is limited to claims investigation. There are four types of claims processing offices as follows (&sect;536.8(c)):  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Claims processing offices without approval authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Claims processing offices with approval authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Medical claims processing offices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Special claims processing offices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) The chief of a command claims service and the head of an area claims office or a claims processing office with approval authority may delegate, in writing, any portion or all of his or her monetary approval authority to a subordinate JA or claims attorney in his or her service or office. The authority to act upon appeals or requests for reconsideration, to disapprove claims (including disapprovals based on substantial fraud), or to make final offers will not be delegated. Copies of delegations within claims processing offices will be provided to the area claims office and, if so directed, to command claims services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.6  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Designation of claims attorneys.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The Commander, USARCS, the senior JA of a command having a command claims service or the Commander, USAREUR Claims Service, the head of an area claims office, or the Chief Counsel, COE may designate a qualified attorney other than a Judge Advocate as a claims attorney.

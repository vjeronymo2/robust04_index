			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry will  notify other government ministries and agencies Thursday [10  February] afternoon of its austere fiscal 1994 budget proposal  after getting government approval at an extraordinary cabinet  session, ministry sources said Tuesday.    The general account budget for the year beginning April 1  will be around 74 trillion yen, 2.5 percent higher than the  initial budget for fiscal 1993.    In order to finance the 5.85 trillion yen cut in income and  residential taxes decided by the coalition government Tuesday,  the Finance Ministry will issue deficit-financing bonds for the  first time in five years.    General operating expenditures will grow by only a modest 2  percent to around 40.6 trillion to 40.7 trillion yen.    With the emphasis on reviving the sluggish economy, the  budget is likely to almost fully provide for the ministries'  requests concerning public works projects, rising 4.3 percent to  around 8.9 trillion yen.    Defense outlays are expected to grow less than 1 percent  amid  the global trend toward cutting down on defense spending.    Official development assistance will likely increase around  4  percent to the 1 trillion yen scale, roughly unchanged from the  original budget for fiscal 1993.    Tax grants to local governments are expected to be around  15.5 trillion yen, lower than the amount in the current fiscal  year.    Approximately 2 trillion yen from the Finance Ministry's  Trust Fund Bureau will be transferred to make up for the  shortfall, informed sources predict.    The budget for servicing outstanding government bonds will  shrink by 300-400 billion yen to about 15 trillion yen, as low  interest rates will reduce the payments of bond interest.    Tax revenues are expected to total around 58 trillion yen,  down 4.4 trillion yen from the current year because of the  implementation of tax reductions.    To compensate for the shrinkage, the Finance Ministry is  planning to earmark approximately 3 trillion yen in nontax  receipts such as those from the Bank of Japan.    If that measure fails to make up for the revenue shortfall,  the ministry will resort to issuing deficit-financing bonds or  construction bonds for long-term public investments, the sources  said.    The Japan Development Bank said it will inaugurate a  financing system to help companies invest in new business areas  to be created through deregulation.    The government-financed bank said the new system will be  available for local beer brewers, electric appliance recycling  enterprises, construction of discount goods distribution  facilities, and enterprises to promote sales of portable  telephone and international sattelite television program  receivers.    The bank said it will provide about 40 percent of investment  costs at an annual interest rate of 3.65 percent.    The bank is expected to receive applications for loans  totaling about 100 billion yen, it said.</p>

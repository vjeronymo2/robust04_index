			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Bozic: "Fear of Confederation With Belgrade"] </F>   [Excerpt] Virovitica -- The Croatian Social Liberal  Alliance [HSLS] is against the creation of a large number of  municipalities, increased bureaucracy, and illogical  centralization of power. It is necessary to question those who  supported such an organization, claiming that it will not be  expensive, Bozo Kovacevic, the chief secretary of the HSLS said  on the podium in Virovitica on the occasion of founding the HSLS  zupanija [parish] assembly for the Virovitica-Podravska Zupanija.    The assembly was opened by the Virovitica HSLS branch  president, Dr. Mirko Selak, who pointed out that, five years  after the party has been founded, the last zupanija assembly is  being formed here in Virovitica. Ivan Knezevic, the president of  the Orahovica branch and the initiator for founding the party in  this zupanija, addressed the assembly, pointing out social  problems and poverty on one hand and the unscrupulous enrichment  of some individuals on the other.    "The state must be sensitive to social issues. The state  must  make it possible for capable individuals to compete and must  protect the livelihood of those who are less capable. The HSLS  is a liberal party with a clear social emphasis," HSLS president  Drazen Budisa said in the introductory speech of the assembly,  stressing that the HSLS is a political party of the center,  which means that it will not lapse into totalitarism of the  right or left.    "The state, as the HSLS conceives it, should be as sensitive  as possible toward its citizens and as strong as possible toward  the outside world. We oppose the view that the party should be  regarded as identical with the state or with patriotism, and we  support free markets, trade, and learning, Drazen Budisa  emphasized, pointing out that political opposition parties  should not just have a decorative function but should also have  a corrective role in the area of political power. [no closing  quotation mark as published]    According to Budisa, the HSLS supports the Croatian-Muslim  federation agreement because it had a similar proposal drafted  in its program as early as 1992.    "The HSLA will ask the question of political responsibility  for Croatian victims in the Croat-Muslim war. We are viewing the  possible confederation with caution, so that it does not result  indirectly in a confederation with Belgrade. We are for  cultural, economic, and other links with the states that came  into existence in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, but we  are not for political associations, especially not with  Serbia,'' Drazen Budisa said, emphasizing that a peaceful  reintegration of the occupied territories of Croatia is expected  under the pressure of Washington and Moscow.

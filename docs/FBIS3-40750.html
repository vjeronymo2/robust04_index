			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "No GATT, Without Dunkel"] </F>   [Text] After the recent G-15 fiasco in Delhi, it is  heartless to single out India alone for the Third World  countries' supine surrender as their final act in the Uruguay  Round talks. The long negotiations over the Generalised  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, incorporating the Dunkel  proposals, have ended in Geneva, and in Delhi our government,  having accepted the Geneva document, has defended its decision  to accept it. It is one thing to accept the new global trade  regime as a fait accompli and another to espy in it virtues  which do not exist. When the Minister, in defence of the Geneva  outcome, talks of globalisation and gain in world trade  turn-over of $1.5 billion to $2 billion, he is repeating the  obvious, without hazarding even a guess at India's likely share  in this rise. What India's agriculture and the pharmaceutical  industry would lose is by now known. Is there any justification  for understating this grievous loss? India gains nothing if the  government's spokespersons gloss over this side of the reality.    The West's agribusiness and food industry would gain the  most--at the expense of Third World farming countries. If GATT  ensures world trade expansion of even $2 billion a year, that  would be only one per cent of the world's gross national  product. A large part of this gain, to judge by the concessions  the US has extracted under the Dunkel proposals, would go to  Euro-American food MNCs--BSN Groupe, Unilever NV, UBS, among  others. These will have ensured access to Asian markets which  were closed to them. Even the concessions the US was obliged to  make to the French farmers would give protection to temperate  zone farm produce, not to the tropical agricultural products.  Euro-American pharmaceutical companies have reason to celebrate  the occasion. At last they would be able to extract the pound of  flesh from countries like India which have made considerable  progress in being self-sufficient in the manufacture of basic  life-saving drugs. These MNCs have long been demanding that  India pay them royalty for "imitating" their unpatented drugs.  Prices of medicines are bound to increase if the Indian  pharmaceutical industry is made to cough out royalty for the  drugs it has long been manufacturing on its own. One only hopes  that in his natural anxiety to welcome the Geneva outcome the  Commerce Minister did not understate the effect the new GATT  regime will have on India's pharmaceutical industry. Already  Zeneca, a drugs MNC, is talking of the money it would recover  from Third World "imitators." When France threatened to block  the Dunkel proposals on farming the US made concessions and the  European Community loosened the purse strings to give more  subsidy to French farmers. When Portugal said that it [would]  walk out rather than endanger its uncompetitive textiles  industry, the EC allayed Portugese opposition by guaranteeing  $455 million as compensation for five years. The Indian  defenders of Dunkel have not said how the Geneva meeting has met  India's grievances concerning farm produce, compulsory food  import, patenting of seeds, cut in fertiliser and electricity  subsidies and the continuance of non-tariff protectionist  measures affecting low-cost, labour-intensive commodities  export. While non-tariff measures will continue to deter India's  export of textiles and stitched garments, European manufacturers  of better quality clothes will benefit because the raw material  prices will decline and the Europeans will gain access to the US  market. If the protectionist wall favouring Europe's chemicals  MNCs like BASF AG, ICI of the UK, and DSM NV of the Netherlands  is lowered, these large firms might be persuaded to relocate  their production units to low-income countries where  anti-pollution laws are lax, wages low and the governments are  bending over backwards to please the large foreign companies. A  similar propulsion for relocation of manufacturing business of  labour-intensive industrial products may be generated in other  areas also. Illustratively, textiles unit may move out of Europe  to seek relocation in Afro-Asia. Some "dirty" industries  currently under pressure of Europe's anti-pollution laws would  probably seek new homes in Third World countries.    In a world without the cold war and the developing  countries,  including the newly industrialised nations, in no position to  put up a common front against a global trade regime tooled  largely to favour the OECD countries of the northern hemisphere,  India alone cannot tilt against the windmills. But what is  expected of the government of the day is not adventurism but  frankness--the gumption to tell our people that these are the  areas where GATT is going to be inequitous to the less developed  countries, especially India.    If the Indians have decided that discretion is the better  part of valour, the French suffer from no such demoralisation.  Without the Soviets' shadows over West Europe, the Europeans are  able to stand up to the US to say that globalisation cannot mean  Americanisation of the globe, and that Europe's culture is not  going to be swamped by America's audiovisual floods. France  blocked the doors to US films, TV and radio outpourings. Unlike  Indians who have gleefully surrendered to the sky-piracy by  foreign TV networks, France has managed to exclude the  audiovisual products from the new GATT. Europe is not going to  be America's cultural colony. If France has reason to resist  foreign intrusion of European culture (through opening Europe to  US films and TV), India had a great deal more at stake in the  Uruguay Round of talks. The pity of it is that we have stopped  bothering about our stakes. Had we fought for them and lost,  that would have been a different matter. It is clear that we  have no stomach for a fight.</p>

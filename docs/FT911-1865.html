			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Dress rehearsal at the local hustings VOTERS GO to the polls in local elections across England and Wales today with both main parties reconciled to a hotly disputed outcome. With the voting widely billed as a dress rehearsal for the general election that must be held within 15 months, both Labour and Conservative officials were yesterday already disputing how various possible results might be interpreted. After their strong showing in local polls four years ago, some Tories claimed that the loss of up to 200 seats might be a sufficiently positive outcome to justify Mr John Major, the prime minister, seeking a fresh mandate in June. Labour argued that the distribution of its anticipated gains would be crucial. Gaining marginal seats could show it to be on course for outright victory in a general election. Party officials dismissed a computer analysis published at the weekend purporting to show that the party required total gains of 700 council seats to be sure of a comfortable Commons majority. As speculation mounts about the election date, the balloting in more than 12,000 council seats in 475 constituencies will be minutely analysed by the parties. Although no voting will take place in Scotland or London, strong Conservative showings at similar local elections in 1983 and 1987 persuaded the government to go quickly to the country. On both occasions, the Tories were rewarded with big majorities. This time politicians of all parties believe the Conservatives are highly unlikely to do well enough for Mr Major to risk calling an immediate poll. Concern about the economy, two recent by-election defeats and continuing debate on the reform of the poll tax have left the Tories braced to lose a substantial number of the 5,200 council seats won in 1987. Opinion polls show Labour level-pegging with the government on about 40 per cent of the vote, up from 31 per cent in 1987, and a near halving of the Liberal Democrats' support to about 14 per cent. If the Tories do better, as commonly expected, a final decision on an early general election in June will await the outcome of the Monmouth by-election, due on May 15, where the party is defending a 9,500 majority. One Labour official said yesterday: 'A crucial factor will be how the old (Social Democrat-Liberal) Alliance votes go, with us hoping for them to get a rising vote in the south and a falling one in the north.' Analysts will pay special attention to cities such as Nottingham, where a council split equally between the two parties reflects similar wafer-thin majorities in three crucial parliamentary seats.

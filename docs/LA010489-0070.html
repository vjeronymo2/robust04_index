			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ITALY SLIPS BACK INTO 6TH AMONG WEST'S ECONOMIES  </P> <P> Italy, which a year ago triumphantly announced that it had overtaken Britain as  the world's fifth-largest Western economic power, has slipped back into sixth  place, according to data released Tuesday by the National Statistics Institute.  </P> <P> Italy's gross domestic product, the broad measure of the goods and services  that a country produces excluding its foreign income, fell behind Britain's in  1986, the latest year for which data is available, after having edged ahead in  1985 for the first time.  </P> <P> The first four places were occupied by the United States, Japan, West Germany  and France.  </P> <P> Italy's brief success in toppling Britain from fifth place was attributed  mainly to an 18% jump in its GDP in 1985 as the National Statistics Institute  attempted to incorporate the booming hidden economy into official figures.  </P> <P> But the recalculation was criticized by some politicians and newspapers because  boosting official GDP risked forcing an increase in Italy's contributions to  the European Community budget.  </P></p>

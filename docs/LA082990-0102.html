			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UAW CHOOSES GM TALKS TO SET INDUSTRY PATTERN  </P> <P> General Motors Corp. became the strike target of the United Auto Workers on  Tuesday, but GM welcomed the chance to be the powerful union's top priority in  bargaining for new auto industry contracts this month.  </P> <P> "We, after deliberation, came to the conclusion unanimously we would go to GM  for the 1990 target," UAW President Owen Bieber said after union management  made its decision.  </P> <P> "GM wants to avoid being forced into an expensive agreement negotiated by  another company," said Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co.'s auto industry analyst,  John Casesa. "Being chosen gives them a say in their destiny."  </P> <P> Contracts between the Big Three car makers and the UAW are among the biggest in  U.S. manufacturing, covering 500,000 workers. They expire Sept. 14.  </P> <P> The target designation means that the GM talks will set the pattern for the  industry, while also concentrating the union's resources for a single showdown,  if needed.  </P> <P> Ford and Chrysler also sought to be targeted. They felt that the advantage of  being able to determine the parameters of an initial industry contract  outweighed the disadvantage of a possible strike.  </P> <P> The selection of GM, the world's biggest car maker, had been expected. Analysts  said the key issue for the union, job security, applies most to GM.  </P> <P> Thousands of union members at GM have lost their jobs since the last contract  was signed in 1987. The auto maker has closed a number of plants to bring  production in line with dwindling sales.  </P> <P> GM publicly welcomed the UAW's decision. Wall Street also appeared to approve,  boosting GM's shares $1.50 to $40.675 in active trading on the New York Stock  Exchange.  </P> <P> Now that GM has been targeted, the UAW will break off talks with Ford and  Chrysler and concentrate on working out an agreement with GM by the contract  expiration date.  </P> <P> GM will now be in a position not only to negotiate an agreement that benefits  itself but also one that puts its competitors at a disadvantage, analysts said.  </P> <P> GM said being the target company gives it "an opportunity to fashion an  agreement which addresses the interests of all who have a stake in the success  of GM, especially those of its employees."  </P> <P> However, analysts said, GM's selection is only a small victory in what could be  an arduous battle to reach a settlement.  </P> <P> Analysts noted that a prolonged strike would probably benefit Japanese  manufacturers, and the UAW does not want to cede jobs to Japanese plants in the  United States because most are non-union.  </P> <P> GM agreed, saying that it believes that a settlement without a strike is the  only outcome that makes sense, given the serious competitive issues facing GM  and the UAW.  </P></p>

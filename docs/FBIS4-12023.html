			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 4 Apr (MENA)--Responsible Palestinian  military sources have affirmed that there are major differences  between the Palestinian and the Israeli sides over arrangements  for the entry of the Palestinian police force into Gaza and  Jericho.    In statements to MENA, the sources said the Israeli side  wants a limited number -- no more than seven individuals -- of  the vanguards of the Palestinian police force to enter these  areas for a site inspection. Then, a small force can enter some  time between April and mid-May. The main body of the force  could enter at the beginning of July.    The sources warned against the dangers that could crop up  because of the delay in the entry of the basic police force into  Gaza and Jericho.    The Palestinian sources clarified that the Palestinian  military leadership, which has met for three days running in  Cairo, set out a specific working paper, which it dispatched to  President Yasir 'Arafat. 'Arafat asked Nabil Sha'th, head of  the Palestinian negotiating team, to adhere to this working  paper during his negotiations with the Israeli side.    These sources specified the demands of the Palestinian  military command in the following points:    1. Compliance with a specific timetable endorsed by the  Israeli side and linking the entry into Gaza and Jericho of the  vanguards of the Palestinian police force and the remaining  members of the force.    2. Agreement on the magnitude and arming of the force. A  timetable is to be set out for the entry of the Palestinian  force's equipment.    3. A strong entry by the Palestinian police force into Gaza  and Jericho, so that the Palestinians in these territories, who  have long suffered occupation and frustration, can feel pride  and dignity.    The same sources added that the Palestinian side stressed to  the political leadership the need to set out a timetable for the  entry of the police force, providing entry is complete before  the end of April. The sources noted that the Israeli side is  now discussing delaying the entry of the force from 15 May,  which marks the anniversary of the establishment of the State of  Israel, to 1 July. This could create a security vacuum that  might result in serious moral and military consequences, the  sources noted.    The sources added that the Israelis want the Palestinian  police force to enter Gaza and Jericho in closed vehicles or  buses and in a way that resembles the entry of prisoners or  infiltrators, not as security forces returning to their land  with pride and dignity, something that will affect the mission  of these forces and their future dealings with the Palestinian  people, who have suffered much from Israel's occupation and its  repressive measures.    The Palestinian sources added that the Israelis also want  the  equipment and weapons of the Palestinian police to enter in  sealed boxes, thus denying them the opportunity to test them.  The sources demanded that the 200 vehicles the United States  decided to give to the Palestinian police be handed over in  Egypt or al-'Arish, not in Israel, so that they might be  examined, painted in distinguishing Palestinian colors, and  marked with the security emblem of the Palestinian police. The  same sources stressed that the magnitude of the Palestinian  force has not been fully determined, adding that this topic will  be discussed during the current round.    The sources named the military commanders who must enter  Gaza  and Jericho as follows: Nasr Yusuf, commander in chief of the  Palestinian forces; Haj Isma'il, official in charge of security  in the Palestinian command; Major General 'Abd-al-Razzaq  al-Mahaydah, who is the chief of staff; Mamduh Nawfal, from the  Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine; and Muhammad  Qudsiyah, commander of the Badr Forces in Jordan. The following  are the names of the Palestinian commanders who must enter Gaza  [as received]: Sa'ib al-'Ajiz, commander of the Palestinian  Forces in Sudan; Khalid Sultan, commander of the Palestinian  forces in Libya; Muhammad Fawj, alias Abu-Humayd, commander of  the Palestinian forces in Yemen; and Brigadier General  'Abd-al-Hayy 'Abd-al-Wahid, commander of the 'Ayn Jalut Forces  in Egypt.</p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / China votes to exclude Khmer Rouge THE United Nations Security Council, including China, yesterday endorsed May elections in Cambodia without the participation of Beijing's Khmer Rouge allies, Reuter reports from the UN in New York. In a unanimous resolution, the council threw its support behind UN-supervised elections for a constituent assembly, scheduled for May 23-27, the first democratic poll in the country's history. Exclusion from the elections would bar the Khmer Rouge from a role in governing the country, though no one is sure whether a deal might emerge after UN forces leave. The Khmer Rouge, one of four parties on Cambodia's Supreme National Council, have violated a peace agreement signed in October 1991 which calls for the demobilisation of forces and registration of eligible voters. Western diplomats said it was the first time China had formally endorsed the elections with the knowledge that time had run out for its Khmer Rouge allies to participate in the poll.</p>

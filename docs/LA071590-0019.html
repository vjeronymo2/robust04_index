			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR SOME READERS, TIFFANY IS NO JETSON  </P> <P> Two months ago a producer-type sat me down and told me that what my movie (a  musical) needed, in order to sell big, was Tiffany.  </P> <P> He said I should dump the actress I had and think "soundtrack album deal"  instead.  </P> <P> That kind of individual is not concerned with entertaining and enlightening an  audience with a good movie but whether the neon-colored marketing campaign is  in place before anyone has written a script!  </P> <P> As one entertainment attorney droned on to me during a recent meeting, "All  they want is Tom Cruise in a race car." If this is becoming the norm, then this  business is headed for serious trouble.  </P> <P> RICHARD WAY  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

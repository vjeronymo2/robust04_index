			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Antonello Caporale: "Progressives -- Group of </F> Five"]    [Excerpts] Rome -- According to the very first (and vague)  statement by [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, Secretary]  Achille Occhetto, it will be a single group and will be called  the "Progressives and something." It will be the largest  parliamentary group, both in the Chamber of Deputies and in the  Senate, despite having lost the Communist Renewal deputies on  its left and the Socialist deputies on its right. In some  people's thinking it is intended to be the founding nucleus of  the future "Democratic Party." The old table has lost two legs  but now has five: the PDS, Rete, the Greens, the Democratic  Alliance [AD], and the Social Christians. The group's leader in  the Chamber of Deputies will be [outgoing lower house Speaker]  Giorgio Napolitano, and in the Senate -- in all likelihood --  [outgoing Italian Republican Party Chairman] Bruno Visentini.  There will be five deputy leaders in each chamber, one for each  party.    It has been a back-breaking task, but was finally hammered  out by deputies and senators who, in the first-past-the-post  constituencies, won considerably more votes under the  progressive banner than were available to the parties that had  put them up for election [passage omitted].    There is also a general directing this battle: [PDS Deputy  Secretary] Massimo D'Alema. He strove for this solution,  believed in it, and in order to see it come to fruition he  sacrificed a part of himself for it: While favoring a unitary  agreement he took two steps back by resigning from his position  as floor leader -- before anyone could ask him to. He remains a  general but has lost his stars. He is returning, as he points  out, to the ranks of ordinary deputy, "the deputy for  Gallipoli." Pressure from D'Alema, with grass-roots support,  persuaded Occhetto. Occhetto's new stance persuaded the Greens  and the AD. The unitary agreement was one that Rete and the  Social Christians always wanted. [passage omitted].</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / EU telecoms networks may be liberalised The European Commission will take immediate steps to liberalise the supply of telecommunications infrastructure across the EU if this week's heads of government meeting in Corfu endorses the principle of competing networks. Most of the EU's state telecoms operators are opposed to early competition in infrastructure, but pressure on the heads of governments from the Commission and business groups is intense following the report by the Bangemann Group of industry leaders. The Bangemann group, established by the last EU heads of government meeting, has recommended setting a 'clear timetable' for the liberalisation of 'telecoms infrastructures and services still in the monopoly area' - an advance on previous EU policy of opening services alone to competition by 1998. Dr Herbert Ungerer, head of the regulatory division of the Commission's telecoms directorate, said yesterday: 'Outside the UK the provision of liberalised services is substantially held back by the limited availability and high price of capacity.' Addressing an FT conference on European telecoms in London, Dr Ungerer said that if political support was forthcoming, the Commission would seek agreement this autumn for 'general principles and a firm time schedule linking the liberalisation of infrastructure to the liberalisation schedule for services.' Such a step would give an immediate impetus to investment in networks competing with those of state operators. Mobile cellular services, data telecoms, and private corporate networks are already liberalised across the EU, but competitors are obliged to rely on state operators' infrastructure. The main public 'voice' business of state operators will not be open to competition until 1998 across most of the EU but some prospective competitors are already active in other liberalised sectors. The Commission believes they and others would find it cost effective to install infrastructure in advance of the 1998 deadline. Fears for Europe's competitive edge are behind the Commission's desire to accelerate telecoms liberalisation. Dr Ungerer highlighted a 10-to-1 differential in the cost of leased telecoms lines between Europe and north America.</p>

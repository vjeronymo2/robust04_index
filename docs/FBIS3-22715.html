The department's Military Research Institute had intended to  run trials with the vaccine gpl60. Approval was given by the  National Committee on AIDS on February 14.    Produced by the Micro Genesis company of the United States,  gp160 is designed to combat the Human Immunodeficiency Virus  (HIV), which leads to Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome or  AIDS.    "The candidate vaccine (gpl60) has not performed  satisfactorily in tests on Americans," said the officer, who  declined to be named.    The institute was considering another multivalent vaccine  produced by United Biochemicals Inc (UBI) of the U.S.    "It is a synthetic vaccine which is designed to treat many  kinds of HIV infection, including the Thai strain," the officer  said.    However military testing of the vaccine could not start for  another six to eight months and would need the approval of the  National Committee on AIDS.    The committee has already approved testing of a UBI vaccine  by the Thai Red Cross under the auspices of the World Health  Organization.    Project director Prof. Praphan Phanuphak announced on  Wednesday that tests would start on May I using civilian  volunteers who test HIV-negative.    "WHO will be responsible for scrutinizing the trials and  making sure there is no breach of ethics or human rights," he  said.</p>

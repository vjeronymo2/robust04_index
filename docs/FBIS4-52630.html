			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Interest Rates, Stagnant Credit, and Foreign </F> Investors"]    [Text] It is expected that the annual interest rates for  loans in Indonesia, currently around 16-18 percent, will soar  with the recent rise in short-term U.S. interest rates from 3.5  percent to 3.75 percent. The current annual interest rate of  11-14 percent for savings will also rise by 0.5 percent. This  is absolutely unavoidable. Singapore and Hong Kong, among other  nations, have also raised their interest rates on loans.    Even though they are considered high nominally, Indonesia's  rates are among the lowest if you take into account inflation  (based on the evaluation of bankers as well as consumer index  prices) and foreign interest rates on loans.    An increase would definitely impose a heavier burden on  economic sectors that acquire loans from foreign banks, because  such loans would have to be repaid at higher interest rates.  This would not, however, create upheaval in the country's  monetary sector or in its macroeconomy. On the other hand,  should interest rates on foreign loans remain as they are, an  economic predicament will arise. There would be, among other  things, capital flight to other countries.    As such, a rise in interest rates on foreign loans by the  banking sector is not considered a major issue that could  agitate Indonesia's economy. The major problem, if there are  any within the banking sector, would only relate to the issues  of loans and stagnant credit.    These issues are currently negating the country's economic  and physical development. Such problems are our own domestic  issue.    The globalization of the economy, information, and  telecommunications has brought problems to Indonesia's banking  sector with regard to loans and stagnant credit as well as  investors and potential foreign investors who are interested in  coming to Indonesia.    The government is continuously trying to solve major  problems. Solving major problems can be time-consuming. We are  fortunate because foreign and other potential investors still  trust our officials' credibility, capability, and monetary  policies in trying to overcome major problems.    They are still making careful observations and adopting a  wait- and-see [preceding three words in English] attitude as to  what steps the government will take in its efforts to solve the  problems. The terms "credit policies" and "loans based on  notes," which are circulating among them, indicate what  approaches they would like to see toward these problems before  committing to any investments in Indonesia.    What do we need with their approaches when such matters are  our domestic concern? In the current era of globalization --  and even more so in the future -- there will be no line drawn  between domestic and global concerns. In fact, it will come as  no surprise if domestic issues are always taken into  consideration.    Foreign investors and potential investors are important to  Indonesia, and they are part of the global economy. Economic  transactions between investors and Indonesia are based on mutual  benefit (win-win situation) [preceding three words in English]  and will no longer be based on a presumption of winners and  losers.    In the eyes of foreign investors, Indonesia could lose as a  result of problems arising from the acquisition of foreign loans  and the stagnant credit faced by banks, which in turn could spur  foreign investors to reconsider making investments in the  country.    Indonesia needs foreign investors, whether it is direct  investment in industrial development or in the country's share  or capital markets. Instability will definitely send investors  flocking to China, India, Thailand, Malaysia, and even the  Philippines.    Within the context of international economic globalization,  no nation can determine on its own what steps it should take.  Our problem is how to coordinate Indonesian interests with  those of other countries. In the process of economic  globalization, we should only acquire through compromise, trade  transactions, and investment what belongs to us, while others  should only take what belongs to them.    Once again, in connection with the problem of foreign loans  and stagnant credit within our economy, we suggest that in this  era of economic globalization these problems should not be  solved according to our own terms.</p>

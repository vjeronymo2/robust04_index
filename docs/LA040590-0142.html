			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS / SAN DIMAS;  </P> <P> CANDIDATES FOCUS ON SMALL-TOWN ATMOSPHERE VERSUS DEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> Balancing the inevitability of development with preservation of a small-town  atmosphere is the overriding issue in this City Council race, with most of the  candidates pushing to slow development.  </P> <P> Seven candidates are running for two City Council seats Tuesday. Mayor Terry  Dipple is unopposed, and Councilwoman Maria Tortorelli is not running for  reelection.  </P> <P> Incumbent Sandy McHenry, 41, is running for a second four-year term on the  council. A lifelong resident of San Dimas, he promises to continue improving  parks, preserving open space and increasing law enforcement with an emphasis on  community relations and preventive programs.  </P> <P> He serves on the city Development Plan Review Board and Senior Citizens Housing  Committee, and was planning commissioner for four years. He owned a nursery  until last year.  </P> <P> Carla Damrill, 50, who last year formed Save Our Rural Environment to scale  down a proposed development, is running on a slow-growth platform.  </P> <P> "Our unique small-town lifestyle is threatened by the continued overdevelopment  of our hills and residential areas," said Damrill, who also led a call for a  new city ordinance that restricts tree cutting. A commercial insurance broker  and a 10-year resident, Damrill said she would like to develop more services  for seniors and more volunteer programs.  </P> <P> John Ebiner, 37, a hospital computer analyst, grew up in West Covina and has  lived in San Dimas since 1985. He holds a bachelor's degree in history from Cal  Poly Pomona.  </P> <P> Ebiner, who serves on the General Plan Advisory Committee, said he favors slow  growth and doesn't want to allow duplexes in the 20-block, predominantly  single-family residential town core, "to keep that small-town atmosphere." He  also supports additional housing for senior citizens.  </P> <P> Planning Commission Chairman Gary Harshman, 47, says attracting retail  businesses for more revenue and maintaining a solid budget are his goals. The  El Monte Airport manager has come under fire from other candidates for his  county links and support from developers.  </P> <P> At least $2,500 of the $3,000 contributed to his campaign came from developers  or investors in development, but he described development as a moot issue  because "San Dimas is almost built out." The 15-year resident has served on the  Planning Commission since 1987 and is on the General Plan Committee.  </P> <P> Ed Jones, 39, who has served on the city's Senior Citizens Commission since  October, is making his second bid for a council seat in two years. He is branch  manager of a manufacturing firm.  </P> <P> He said the council needs to protect mobile home parks "to give (park)  residents peace of mind." He also advocates a face lift for the Canyon shopping  center, calling it a "disgrace" that is forcing residents to shop out of town.  </P> <P> Artist and gallery owner Abraham Vanwyk, 57, says he is running as "a man of  the people" and believes development is crucial for the city. "If our town  doesn't grow, it will be dead on its feet," he said. "The others want to keep  the hills green with coyotes running around. I say people own those hills. If  you want green space, buy property for a park."  </P> <P> A former minister in the County Jail, retirement homes and hospitals, he is in  the Coast Guard Auxiliary and teaches boat handling and safety at Bonelli  Regional County Park.  </P> <P> Mary B. Young, 38, said she moved to San Dimas seven years ago because she  liked the small-town feeling and wants to maintain that atmosphere. The  homemaker she said she also wants to preserve the city's remaining natural  areas and increase youth programs.  </P> <P> She has volunteered in anti-drug education efforts in the schools and in the  Pomona Valley Council of Churches shelter program.  </P></p>

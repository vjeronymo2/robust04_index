			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTOROLA HAS A POCKET-SIZE CELLULAR PHONE  </P> <P> Motorola Inc. introduced a dramatically smaller cellular telephone Tuesday that  can be carried in a purse or coat pocket.  </P> <P> The device, half the size of any other portable cellular model, is about as  wide and long as a checkbook. It is about as thick as a fat wallet at the  earpiece while tapering down to half the thickness of a deck of cards at the  mouthpiece.  </P> <P> The phone has a shorter-than-usual battery life. The 10.7-ounce model has a  30-minute rechargeable battery, while the 12.3-ounce one has a 75-minute  battery. It needs no wires or base to operate.  </P> <P> The device, called the Micro Tac Personal Telephone, is expected to retail for  $2,995 and be available six weeks after being ordered. Motorola officials said  they were taking orders immediately.  </P> <P> "This is a new category of cellular -- the personal cellular," said Jim  Bernhart, vice president and director of distribution for Motorola's cellular  subscriber group. "We view it as the wave of the future."  </P> <P> Officials of the Schaumburg, Ill.-based company would not reveal development  costs for the new device, but said the company had invested about $350 million  in development of cellular telephones.  </P> <P> Bob Weisshappel, Motorola vice president and director of the North American  subscriber division, said the device has the identical range to the company's  larger, Dynatac portable.  </P> <P> Cellular telephones work as radio transmitters and receivers. Metropolitan  areas offering cellular service are divided up into sections called cells, with  each cell containing a receiving-transmitting antenna to connect many calls  simultaneously with the local phone system.  </P> <P> According to the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Assn., the United States  has about 2 million cellular subscribers. Nearly 839,000 subscribers were added  in 1988, the association said.  </P> <P> In the last six months of 1988, cellular service revenue was $1.07 billion, and  the average monthly cellular phone bill was $98.02, the association said.  </P></p>

Hwang said that since last  November, North Korean President Kim Il-song has again started  "his direct rule over the nation" in dealing with issues of top  priority such as the alleged DPRK nuclear development so as to  get over the most serious crisis ever since the nation's  founding; and that North Korea is now moving toward implementing  the policy of granting limited rights of independent cultivation  to farmers, which is a policy basically modeled on the reform  program that was started in China in the late 1970's, as well as  the policy of setting up special economic zones.    As for the reasons why President Kim is restoring "his  direct  administration," Ambassador Hwang cited the following points:  members of the "interim generation," meaning the generation born  between the first and second revolutionary generations and  including Kim's brother Kim Yong-chu, have been reappointed to  front-line political posts in the personnel reshuffle last  December; Secretary Kim Chong-il as well as other prospective  leaders of his generation such as Kim Tal-hyun and Kim Yong-sun  are now made to play only lesser roles; and in his recent talks  with various guests such as UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali, American missionary Billy Graham, and VIP's from  China, President Kim Il-song hinted at his posture of directly  controlling the state administration.    However, Ambassador Hwang also pointed out that the  restoration of President Kim's direct rule seems to be limited  at this point to important pending diplomatic issues such the  nuclear issue, the normalization of diplomatic relations with  the United States and Japan, and the issue on dealing with the  south on the one hand, and those issues related to the basic  principle of the government administration on the other. For  example, there are problems related to the partial reform and  open-door policy, which was started on a trial basis by leaders  of the second revolutionary generation such as Secretary Kim  Chong-il but which has now come to a deadlock.    Secretary Kim Chong-il has so far rejected the Chinese-type  reform and open-door policy, terming it as "revisionism".  However, President Kim Il-song sent Secretary Hwang Chang-yop  to China early this year to put an end to its relations with  China which have become rather awkward since China established  diplomatic relations with the ROK in the summer of 1992, and at  the same time to instruct him to make an inspection tour of  special economic zones in Shenzhen and Zhuhai. It is reported  that experts in economic affairs have been dispatched to special  economic zones since then.    Ambassador Hwang also maintained that President Kim  Il-song's  intention to restore his direct control is not an indication of  his attempt to change his decision on assigning Kim Chong-il as  his successor. As a basis for this observation, Ambassador  Hwang cited the fact that Kim Pyong-il -- who is Kim Chong-il's  half brother and who had returned home late last year after  completing his assignment as ambassador to Bulgaria -- has been  reappointed as ambassador to Finland.</p>

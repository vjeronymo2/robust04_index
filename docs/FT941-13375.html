			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / New mine operators warned of liabilities Private mine operators wishing to take over former British Coal pits in the Durham coalfield may face legal action from Durham County Council - unless the government spells out where responsibility lies after privatisation for abandoned mineworkings. Mr Len James, chairman of the county council's environment committee, warned yesterday that unless the coal industry privatisation bill specifies who is responsible for the potential problems of minewater pollution, methane and subsidence, his council may seek injunctions against any incoming private operators in an attempt to force them to accept liability. 'Prospective purchasers could find their plans bogged down in a legal quagmire while we continue to fight for what we believe is right,' said Mr James. The question of responsibility for coalmining's historic legacy affects many mining areas of Britain, but is of immediate concern in County Durham which is riddled with mineworkings dating back centuries. Minewater pumping, which prevents pollution, has been costing British Coal Pounds 6m a year in that area. The Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday the bill covered the environmental issues raised. British Coal yesterday won planning consent from West Glamorgan county council for an 800-acre opencast mine overlooking Neath Valley, south Wales. The mine, which will employ 140 people, is expected to produce 3m tonnes of anthracite over nine years.</p>

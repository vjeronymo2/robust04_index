			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / UK Company News: F&amp;C to manage Drayton Consolidated vehicle FOREIGN &amp; Colonial is expected to manage the rump of Drayton Consolidated, the investment trust which is currently planning a restructuring. Under plans already announced, the bulk of the trust's assets will be sold but the remainder will be placed in a 'realisation vehicle' which will consist of the unquoted securities and the less liquid quoted shares. It is this vehicle which Foreign &amp; Colonial is expected to manage. Details of the restructuring are not expected to be announced for some weeks. Drayton wrote off more than half the value of its unlisted assets in March. Investors have seen a sharp fall in the share price from 587p at its 1989 peak to 164p at yesterday's close.</p>

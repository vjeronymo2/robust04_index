			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AVALON OKS PACT WITH SHERIFF  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department will continue to provide law  enforcement services to Avalon in accord with a five-year contract approved  unanimously Tuesday by the City Council.  </P> <P> The council vote followed three months of discussion between city officials and  sheriff's representatives over ways to improve the department's image on Santa  Catalina Island and enhance the relationship between deputies and the  community, said City Manager Chuck Prince. Under the agreement, the sheriff's  station on the island will increase narcotics enforcement, replace car patrols  on Crescent Avenue, Avalon's main street, with a foot patrol, and have the  station commander in uniform more often, Prince said.  </P> <P> The contract also slightly increases the number of deputies patrolling the  city, said Lawrence Dykhouse, sheriff's commander for the part of the county  that includes the island.  </P> <P> The final cost of the contract will be decided in June, but Prince estimated it  at $300,000 to $350,000 a year.  </P></p>

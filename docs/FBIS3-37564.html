			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS string correspondent Semyon Ivanov] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 18 TASS -- The Russian  military-space forces launched a "Raduga" sputnik from the  Baykonur cosmodrome at 10 hours 56 minutes Moscow time today.  The sputnik was launched by means of a heavy "Proton-K"  three-stage carrier-rocket equipped with a "DM-2" acceleration  block. The orbiting was successful. The sputnik's flight is  controlled by the centre for testing and controlling the vehicle.    The sputnik, developed by the Applied Mechanics Scientific  Production Society (Krasnoyarsk-26) under the direction of Chief  Constructor and Director-General Mikhail Reshetnev, weighs about  two tonnes and will be able to remain on the orbit for three  years. It is fitted out with six-channel board relaying unit,  designed to transmit telephone and telegraph signals. The  sputnik will be placed on the near geostationary orbit -- 90  degrees eastern longitude -- approximately seven hours after the  start. Then it will be moved to its final position -- 45  degrees eastern longitude -- by means of low-thrust engines. It  will be used for the designed purposes in that position.    The launching of the "Proton-K" carrier-rocket was the 215th  since its first start in 1967 and already the third since the  beginning of this year. Only six launchings of this type of  carrier-boosters were effected last year.    Two "Soyuz" vehicles were launched from Baykonur this year  in  addition to the "Protons". Such a busy launching schedule was  made possible by the concerted efforts of men from the Russian  military-space forces, who, in spite of several unresolved  problems linked with the Baykonur cosmodrome and the town of  Leninsk, are continuing to prepare and launch spuntiks.    Talks on the status and lease of the Baykonur cosmodrome are  continuing between Moscow and Almaty. If they prove successful,  the presidents of Russia and Kazakhstan will sign corresponding  documents this March.</p>

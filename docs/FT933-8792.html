			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Rothmans/Dunhill The fine print of Richemont's asset reshuffle highlights the move's industrial logic but the financial advantages from the viewpoint of Rothmans' and Dunhill's shareholders are less clear. By untangling the web of interconnecting shareholdings, Richemont will produce two businesses separately focused on tobacco and luxury goods. Given the conspicuous clash of corporate cultures between the two groupings, this is doubtless a good thing. As a pure tobacco company, Rothmans clearly has its attractions. The opening of markets in eastern Europe and China has given tobacco companies revived opportunities: Rothmans expects world cigarette consumption to grow by 2 per cent a year to 5,700bn sticks by the end of the century. With Pounds 500m of cash, Rothmans is strongly placed for expansion. However, its yield, which is likely to languish well below that of BAT Industries, may hold the share price in check. Dunhill's minority shareholders, though, may reasonably gripe that their interests are not best served by transferring their assets, valued at the bottom of the cycle, into a bigger business over which they have diminished control. The Japanese downturn has certainly resulted in a nasty scratch across Dunhill's veneer. The company's currency hedging policies have also left it looking rather reckless - even if the immediate result is more red faces than red ink. But the unanswered questions remain: if Dunhill is as relatively weak as the terms of this deal suggest, why were its shareholders not aware of the fact; and why did its parent, Rothmans, not tackle the problems earlier?</p>

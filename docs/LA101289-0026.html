			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAFFIC AND SMOG  </P> <P> Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley wants at least 500 city employees to work with a  computer at home for one or two days a week as part of an experiment to reduce  smog by keeping some cars off the road.  </P> <P> It is called telecommuting, and we urge the City Council to approve the  experiment. It is important to know whether the theory works because the South  Coast Air Quality Management District wants 20% of Southern California's work  force to be telecommuters by the year 2010. AT&amp;T, Pacific Bell and Allergan  Pharmaceuticals in Orange County are among the private companies in Southern  California that already allow employees to work at home in Southern California.  Planners tell employers they can expect not only a boost toward cleaner air but  also increased productivity, lower absenteeism and access to larger labor  pools.  </P> <P> Nearly 5,600 of 49,000 city employees ranging from clerical workers to managers  qualify for the pilot project. Employees may volunteer as long as supervisors  approve; supervisors may have doubts about the program, but doubting  supervisors, in particular, should approve, because the idea of the plan is to  test whether such doubts are valid. The idea is to monitor the quality of work,  cost-effectiveness and the effect of telecommuting on workers themselves. The  council should go for it.  </P></p>

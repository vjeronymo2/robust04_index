			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: BAT loses ground THE PRICE of conglomerate BAT Industries was affected by a profits downgrade from one securities house and a change of stance from another. The shares were 7 down before recovering to close a net 5 off at 638p on turnover of 2.3m. The shares, which stood at 765p last July, have been depressed by heavy losses at BAT's insurance subsidiary Eagle Star. The latter was behind yesterday's forecast cut. Mr Nyren Scott-Malden of Barclays de Zoete Wedd downward revised his 1991 estimate by Pounds 30m to Pounds 1.05bn, with Pounds 20m of that figure representing the estimated impact on Eagle of the weak UK stock market in the fourth quarter. Although remaining a buyer of the stock, Mr Scott-Malden has also cut his 1992 estimate by Pounds 50m from Pounds 1.5bn to reflect shifting exchange rates. Further, Mr Bruce Davidson of Smith New Court changed his stance to a hold from a buy, arguing that: 'The yield on BAT is now in line with the lowest of the UK composites.' Inchcape firm International services and marketing group Inchcape gained ground shortly before the close of trading. It announced that the European Community had approved its Pounds 382m purchase of Tozer Kemsley &amp; Millbourn, the vehicle sales, distribution, transport and storage and tyre services concern. The announcement was expected and the shares were already firm but they moved forward another 3 on the news to close 12 ahead at 438p, an all-time high. The partly-paid shares gained 23 to 279p. After the second instalment of 151p is taken into consideration they are now at a discount of only 8 to the fully-paid shares. News of an encouraging gas discovery by an Arco-led consortium in block 44/18 in the North Sea triggered a flurry of support for the UK quoted participants in the find: Goal Petroleum, which has a 15 per cent stake, and Clyde Petroleum, with a 25 per cent interest. Clyde edged up 2 to 78p and the former rose 4 to 60p. Lasmo moved ahead 7 to 255p on heavy turnover of 3.6m, with much of the demand emanating from Smith New Court. The broker published a detailed document on Lasmo, labelling the shares a buy. Mr Alan Sinclair, exploration and production specialist at Smith, described Lasmo as a strong buy and said the company had made an excellent acquisition in Ultramar which had transformed Lasmo from what was becoming a somewhat depressing story of lack of growth. British Gas was active (5.5m shares traded) and held at 246p after reports that the group could be considering floating off its gas marketing operations. BP firmed 1 1/2 to 293p as the market responded to news that Saudi Arabia is reducing crude oil output by 100,000 barrels a day. The Saudi move follows output cuts by Libya and Algeria. Volatility in Glaxo was caused by continuing good news on the product front contrasted by US selling. The shares were off 12 in the morning but recovered to show a slim gain after the company announced that it had won a UK product licence for one of its hypertension drugs, Lacipil. However, continued unloading of the American Depositary Receipts on Wall Street depressed the London shares again and they closed 5 down at 859p with 5.5m traded. Fisons put on 5 to 358p ahead of today's research and development presentation. The company is expected to discuss two of its drugs, and the feeling among analysts is that the company is bound to try and come up with some good news to offset the recent negative comment. Smith New Court placed nearly 2.2m shares in London International Group in the market at 287p apiece. LIG firmed 2 to 292p on 6.4m share volume. London &amp; Manchester fell 22 to 263p after revealing unexpected provisions against commercial property for the year of Pounds 17m before tax, and a dividend held at 9.144p. The news caught the market by surprise. An analyst commented: 'I do not think anyone had contemplated anything of this nature.' The announcement pushed other life insurers down on fears of similar adjustments, Prudential losing 4 1/2 to 234p and Legal &amp; General, on a large turnover of 2.3m, dipping 5 to 373p. There was turbulence in the telecoms sector. Cable and Wireless dropped 17 to 589p on rumours that proposed merger talks with AT&amp;T, of the US, had been called off and might not resume until after the UK general election. Vodafone came under increased pressure, retreating 17 to 589p as the market continued to digest Monday's share placing and also remained depressed by disappointing figures, released recently, on new subscribers. Interest switched to Securicor Group, up 45 at 738p, and its associated shares, Securicor 'A', 23 stronger at 565p, and Security Services, 25 ahead at 455p, partly on greater confidence in Cellnet, the rival cellular phone system in which it has a 40 per cent stake. Word that British Steel was experiencing disappointing sales on strip products since increasing prices at the start of the year failed to have much effect on the shares, which eased a half-penny to 75 1/2 p. Bass was 20p lower at one stage on nervousness about a possible profits warning being made at the company's annual meeting today. Last year's meeting produced a significant profits warning that triggered a sharp fall in the share price. However, the stock picked up from yesterday's initial weakness to close just 5 off at 1092p. There was more overseas selling of PowerGen and National Power - from Japan and the US - which left the electricity generators off 2 at 136 1/2 p and 3 at 146p respectively. Volume was a relatively heavy 6.1m and 7.1m. RTZ finished 6 higher at 539p, continuing a recent rise on technical factors and in sympathy with recovery in cyclical stocks. Lonrho gained a penny to 165p in active trading ahead of annual results due tomorrow. There has been speculation that the group might cut its dividend. Continuing bearish sentiment in British Aerospace left the stock 16 weaker at 286p after brisk turnover of 5.7m. Monday's news of the resignation of the finance director and possible property provisions again acted against the shares. There was also renewed gloom in the market over the lack of news forthcoming on BAe's Saudi defence contract. Adverse dollar movements pushed Tomkins, the engineering group, down 10 to 435p. A negative review of UK economic prospects by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew prompted a selective downgrade of its leisure stocks. Analyst Mr Paul Heath said: 'We estimate an increase in consumer spending of just 0.2 per cent in 1992, which will have widescale implications for the leisure sector.' Hotel group Forte's 1992 profits have been shaved Pounds 15m to Pounds 135m, Queens Moat Houses' lowered Pounds 5m to Pounds 100m and Ladbroke's reduced Pounds 20m to Pounds 230m. Rank Organisation, which is due to report shortly, and Granada Group, recently revised by UBS, escaped the review. Forte slipped a penny to 235 1/2 p, Queens Moat added the same amount at 74p and Granada put on 4 to 217p, while Ladbroke eased 2 to 224p, as did Rank, at 633p. Market opinion shifted on Associated British Ports, where worries about property provisions had recently pulled the price down. The stock rallied 12 to 341p. Meyer International saw further profit-taking and closed 10 down at 401p. However, Wolseley, one of the favoured stocks in the builders merchants sector, added 6 at 416p. Blue Circle Industries was among the market's so-called bid favourites yesterday but the absence of any takeover news saw the shares relinquish 2 to 257p. Hanson lost 2 1/2 to 211 1/2 p as investors switched from convertible to ordinary shares. Turnover was a busy 10m. Food retailer Asda closed slightly easier at 36p after telling customers to return a range of garlic dips because glass fragments had been found in containers. A fresh slide in Ratners was accentuated by its decision to suspend payment of its preference shares. The stock fell 4 1/2 p or more than 18 per cent to 20p, following a decline of 2 1/2 the previous day. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991/92 NEW HIGHS (66).

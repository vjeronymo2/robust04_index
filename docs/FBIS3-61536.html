			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Vaganov under the rubric ``Upside Down'': </F> ``The Present Generation of Russian Scientists Will Live Under  Communism. At Least 700 People Are Already Living Under It'']    [Text] Last Monday more than 700 associates of the Joint  Institute of Earth Physics (OIFZ) of the RAS [Russian Academy of  Sciences] voluntarily (!) took two-week leaves without the  retention of pay.    ``The most skilled personnel: deputy directors, heads of  laboratories, lead scientific associates, heads of economic  subdivisions--in all 81 people--voluntarily refused to receive  wages,'' relates Academician Vladimir Strakhov, director of the  OIFZ. ``In their statements they wrote as follows: I wish the  days to be considered workdays, but wages not to be credited.''    Another 684 associates of the OIFZ--again voluntarily--took  leaves without pay proper. But of them very many are continuing  to come to the institute and to perform their official duties.    ``The sense of responsibility of the scientist proved to be  higher than considerations of an accounting nature. And I am  very grateful to them for this,'' Vladimir Strakhov emphasized.  ``This action is enabling us to release 40 percent of the  month's wage fund, that is, 23 million rubles [R].'' In all at  the institute it had been planned to spend a little more than  R80 million on the September wages. R62 million were allocated  from the state budget. But this money so far has also not come  to the accounts of the OIFZ.    What the Bolsheviks talked about for so long--``we will  arrive at the victory of communist labor''--has come to pass:  About 70 percent of the associates of the academic institute  have already arrived at this ideal. And voluntarily besides.    Incidentally, this occurred on the eve of another  significant  and long-awaited date for Russian science. ``For the purposes of  the preservation of the intellectual potential of the Russian  Federation, the further development of basic and applied  research, and the increase of state support of the workers of  budget-carried organizations of science and higher educational  institutions of Russia I decree....'' I have quoted the preamble  of Edict No. 1372 of the president of the Russian Federation of  16 September 1993, ``On Measures on the Material Support of  Scientists of Russia.'' Several points of this edict should take  effect on 1 November of this year. (The salaries for the  academic title of academician of the RAS are R150,000 and for a  corresponding member, R75,000; for scientists of budget-carried  organizations and workers of higher educational institutions the  monthly supplementary payments for academic degrees are 50  percent of their official salaries.)    According to the information at the disposal of NEZAVISIMAYA  GAZETA, neither in the planning and finance administration of  the RAS nor in the departments of the RAS does anyone know  precisely the technology of implementing this point. Although  ``instructions'' have arrived at several scientific  organizations: If the financial situation permits, you are  allowed to fulfill this edict.    The road to hell, as is known, is paved with good  intentions.  And this hell has quite real, specific financial parameters. As  a whole for the section ``Science'' for nine months of 1993  financing was opened in the amount of R500,380,049,100. What is  this? This is 49.3 percent of the annual plan and 75.7 percent  of the plan of nine months. The total arrears of the budget to  science are R160,672,337,900. The institutions of the RAS and  its regional departments have been financed at the level of  86-100 percent. The financing of priority directions of science  and technology is 70.6 percent of the plan of nine months and  46.5 percent of the annual plan.    The financing is broken down by specific directions in the  following manner. Programs of operations of state science  centers--82.6 percent of the plan of nine months; state  scientific and technical programs--60.6 percent; the most  important national economic programs and projects--62.8 percent;  international programs and projects--40.8 percent; regional  centers and programs--24.5 percent; programs of the development  of the innovation infrastructure of science--7.5 percent;  financing of the Basic Research Fund--58.6 percent.    There is another detail. According to the testimony of a  high-ranking administrative worker of the RAS, in recent times  talk, the goal of which is to prepare the ground, and at the  same time the Russian Academy of Sciences itself for the  decrease of its budget next year, has been circulating in the  Russian Federation Ministry of Finance.</p>

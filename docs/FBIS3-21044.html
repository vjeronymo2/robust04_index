Schwarz: "Radar for the Next Fighters" first </F> paragraph is FLUG REVUE introduction]    [TEXT] Although the radar systems for the Eurofighter and  the Rafale are still undergoing testing, European electronics  giants are already busy with the next generation. In mid-October  1993, the British-French firm GEC Thomson Airborne Radar  received a contract to develop a system with active send/receive  elements such as that which will soon be available in the United  States. The European product could be operational by 2010, at  which time it could be utilized in new tactical aircraft or for  a modernization of the fighter aircraft currently under  development.    Thomson CSF and GEC Marconi Avionics have already completed  a  great deal of preliminary work for the AMSAR (Airborne Multirole  Solid-state Active-array Radar) over the past three years, and  will invest approximately 25 million more German marks [DM] of  their own funds. The contract awarded by the French Delegation  G&eacute;n&eacute;rale pour l'Armement amounts to nearly DM50  million.    This sum should enable scientists to conclude the  preliminary  work necessary for the construction of the active-array radar.  The most important prerequisite is the processing of the  gallium-arsenide, which is the most important component in the  1,500 to 2,000 send/receive modules. Additional studies are also  needed on the assembly and cooling of these components. Last but  by no means least, it must be ascertained how the system can be  manufactured at an acceptable price.    The AMSAR program is divided into two phases. The year 2005  is the approximate target date for the production and test  flight of a fully operational system. The total cost will amount  to more than DM400 million. This investment is essential,  however, if Europe is not to fall behind in the field of radar  technology. "This level of development is only possible through  European-wide cooperation," explains Bernard Rocquemont of  Thomson-CSF. Consequently, talks are already ongoing with the  German government and German industry concerning the  participation of Deutsche Aerospace (DASA) and/or Siemens.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A short while ago, we spoke with the chief Israeli  delegate to the talks with Syria, Israel's Ambassador to the  United States Itamar Rabinovich, whom we asked whether the  reported new format of talks with Syria meant a certain  compromise on the part of each party -- namely, the depth of  withdrawal on the part of Syria and the nature of peace on  Israel's part.    [Begin recording] [Rabinovich] It does not necessarily mean  a desire to compromise on this basic equation. Rather, it is an  acknowledgment that after many months of haggling over this  issue, the negotiations will be better off if their scope is  expanded. In this sense, an agreement on the equation is almost  devoid of any significance. I do not want to belittle it, of  course, but it does not have any merit per se, and I think both  the Americans and the Syrians now realize it.    [Correspondent Itay Engel] By the way, what was the level at  which the decision to alter the format was made? Have the  Syrians agreed to it? So far, we have only heard our prime  minister's remarks on this matter.    [Rabinovich] Just last week, the U.S. peace team visited  Damascus. Their visit followed the prime minister's U.S. visit  and talks in this vein. The matter was presented to President  al-Asad by the U.S. peace team, and we have been told that his  reaction was favorable and positive. The reaction has generated  some of the present optimism concerning this track.    [Engel] Will the revised format help the Israeli-Syrian  negotiations out of the bind? Will it lead to a breakthrough?    [Rabinovich] I think the revised format of negotiations is  all you said, but above all, it shows that the negotiations have  reached a degree of maturity, that the Syrian approach is now  more realistic in that they now realize that negotiations cannot  consist of the two parties reiterating their respective stands  and eventually reaching a verbal agreement. A true agreement is  first and foremost one which changes the reality. To secure a  change, the agreement must address that reality. In the reality  of Israeli-Syrian relations, questions such as security, water,  and a genuine implementation of the agreement are no less  important than the verbal and legal formulations on which the  negotiations had focused until recently.    [Engel] Is there an envisaged time frame for the signing of  a joint declaration of principles that will pave the way for  negotiations on details?    [Rabinovich] I do not want to give rise to expectations of a  fast breakthrough. The negotiations are difficult and  complicated, and even if we manage to change the format and the  climate, I would not want to create an expectation of an  imminent breakthrough. This process will benefit if it is  conducted in a new format and if it gathers momentum when the  talks are resumed at the end of April. I hope to see results in  the subsequent weeks and months, but it would be definitely  premature and wrong to start speaking of dates and deadlines.    [Engel] Thank you very much, Professor Itamar Rabinovich.  [end recording]</p>

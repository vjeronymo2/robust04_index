			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Property: A Home Counties farmhouse with a good deal going for it Kings Farm, above, nestled in the village of Lower Wield, in Hampshire, southern England, has the classic triple combination of rural seclusion, comparatively easy access to London (the property is nine miles from Basingstoke, with a regular 45-minute rail service to the capital) and thorough modernisation behind a facade whose architecture claims a touch of William and Mary, writes John Brennan. The five bedroom, two bathroom house, which is set in 3 3/4 acres of gardens, includes a hard tennis court, a solar heated swimming pool with sauna, and a 40 ft timber-framed barn as the ultimate playroom. Kings Farm is available through joint agents Lane Fox (0256-474647) and Hill &amp; Morrison (0256-702892) at a price 'in excess of' Pounds 475,000.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] North Korea has notified that it accepts our  government's proposal for making a preliminary contact between  the South and North to discuss the procedure of the South-North  summit talks at the Freedom House in our side's area at  Panmunjom at 10:00 AM [0100 GMT] on 28 June.    On the telephone line now is a reporter who is covering this  issue. Reporter Kim Chong-chin. What is included in the  message from the North Korean side?    [Begin Kim Chong-chin recording] Yes. In a telephone message  sent to Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok today, Kang Song-san, premier  of the North Korean State Administration Council, gave an answer  to the effect that a preliminary contact for the South-North  summit talks be made at the Freedom House in the South's side at  Panmunjom at 10:00 on 28 June, as proposed by our side on 20  June.    For this, North Korea disclosed that it will send three  delegates headed by a vice premier-level official and four  entourage members. In today's telephone message, North Korea  said that it welcomes and agrees to the South side's proposal  because the acute situation prevailing in the Korean Peninsula  makes it all the more urgent than ever before for both the South  and the North to hold top-level summit talks.    North Korea pointed out that the holding of South-North  summit talks will be a historical event brining the joy of  national reconciliation and unity to the 70 million fellow  countrymen and giving a new hope of peace, and independent and  peaceful reunification of the country.    In this connection, the dialogue between the South and  North,  which was discontinued because of the 19 March remarks about  engulfing Seoul in a sea of flame, will resume after about three  months.    For the first time since the national division, both the  South and North sides will have official discussions on summit  talks.    One National Unification Board [NUB] official said: It is  fortunate to see North Korea accept our side's proposal as it  is. We can construe this as a sign with which we can judge in an  affirmative way the intention of the North's side to see an  early realization of the summit talks.    Meanwhile, in the telephone message, North Korea did not  mention the list of the delegates. In view of the past  practices, it is expected that there is the high possibility  that it will notify us of the list one day before the contact,  that is, on around 27 June.    Although our side's delegates have not been confirmed yet,  Yi  Hong-ku, deputy prime minister and minister of the NUB, will  surely be the head delegate.    I have so far reported the news report that a preliminary  contact for the South-North summit talks will be realized at  Panmunjom on 28 June because of the North Korean side's  acceptance of our proposal. I have been reporting from the NUB.  This is Kim Chong-chin, KBS News, from the NUB. [end recording]</p>

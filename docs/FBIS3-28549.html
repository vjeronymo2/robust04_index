			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Kim Chong-hung from Pusan] </F>   [Text] U.S. Ambassador to the ROK James Laney said on 4  February that due to the U.S. Administration's policy to cut its  budget, the U.S. Embassy to the ROK had already reduced its  personnel and that the plan to cut its budget includes the plan  to close the U.S. Consulate in Pusan. Ambassador Laney said  this at a meeting with merchants and industrialists in Pusan to  which the ambassador was invited. The meeting took place at the  Pusan Chamber of Commerce and Industry.    He also said: "The Pusan Consulate issued 12 times more  visas last year than in 1989. The consulate has made it  convenient for Pusan citizens to get visas and contributed to  promoting friendship between the ROK and the United States.  Therefore, the U.S. Embassy is making efforts to maintain the  consulate by explaining to the U.S. Government how important the  consulate is."</p>

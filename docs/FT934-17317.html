			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Bass says tax change would cost it Pounds 6m MR IAN PROSSER, chairman and chief executive of Bass, said yesterday that the change to end-product taxation of beer would reduce profits by Pounds 6m this year and Pounds 18m in 1994. The impact of the tax changes, already the subject of bitter dispute between brewers and Customs &amp; Excise, was disclosed to City analysts in Burton-on-Trent yesterday. Mr Prosser reported that trading during the past four months had confirmed a slow recovery in sales that would bring only limited benefits in the second half of the year. 'In the near term, I see price-driven revenue growth in UK brewing hard to come by in a low inflationary environment, particularly while excess capacity persists.' Bass Brewers had increased volumes by 0.5 per cent in a market estimated to have fallen 2 per cent. Strong growth was achieved in the free trade, with volumes ahead 5.3 per cent while deliveries to the take-home trade increased 3.5 per cent. An extra Pounds 83m net had been invested in free trade loans. A slight improvement in bad debts would result in a second half charge lower than the first half provision of Pounds 19m. Bass pubs' revenue was 1.1 per cent lower but the introduction of catering into 1,000 managed houses had raised food sales by 12.3 per cent. Britvic's profits, hit by bad summer weather and strong competition, would be about 20 per cent lower.</p>

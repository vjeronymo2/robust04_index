Border patrol police and army rangers were keeping vigil  at the border to ensure there were no spillover, Woranat said.  "There's nothing to worry about," he said "I don't think we  have to close the border." [passage omitted]    Fighting died down yesterday but the situation remains tense  after three days of battles between Cambodian government troops  and Khmer Rouge forces, Thai army officials said. The two  sides, weakened by heavy casualties, continued to bring up  reinforcements in the area across the border from Thailand, the  officials said. Casualty figures were incomplete, but they said  at lesst 20 were known to have died. The officials estimated  that Phnom Penh had mobilized some 700 troops backed by four  armoured vehicles. More men were being brought in to bolster  forces based at Phum Changnoi, the officials said. They had no  estimate of Khmer Rouge strength. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, Thai government spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa  said  the present situation would not affect Prime Minister Chuan  Likphai's planned visit to Cambodia between Jan 12 and l4.  Chuan's agenda would be to seek the Cambodian government's  guarantee on the future of Thai businesses in Cambodia which has  been affected by Phnom Penh's measures, Aphisit said.

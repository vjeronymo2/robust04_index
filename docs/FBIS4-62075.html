			<p>BFN     [Text] Nikolay Travkin, leader of the Democratic Party  parliamentary group, told Interfax that he had been appointed  government minister to allow him to retain his seat in the State  Duma when he returns to his duties as administration head of the  Shakhovskoy District, Moscow Region.    In compliance with the Constitution he had to abandon that  position when he was elected to parliament. But he was  reappointed to that position and simultaneously made a  government minister on May 1. This enabled him to retain his  seat in parliament.    Travkin made it clear that he had not been given any  instructions on what he is to be doing in the government. He  added he had not had any talks with Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin or any other minister on his new appointment.    Travkin thought that the government had to include somebody  representing local interests. He attributed all failures of the  reform to the inability of the government to hear what local  officials had to say about its grandiose plans. Travkin thought  that with his new appointment the government had an opportunity  and had to use it.    He dismissed press reports on a split in his parliamentary  group in the aftermath of his new appointment. He also thought  that his signing of the Civic Accord Pact had nothing to do with  the appointment.</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Labour speaker for NZ New Zealand's opposition Labour party has aided the National government's slim parliamentary majority by allowing one of its members to be nominated as speaker, writes Terry Hall in Wellington. Mr Peter Tapsell, an orthopaedic surgeon, will be the first Maori and first representative of an opposition party to be speaker. The appointment will make it easier for National to govern. With 50 MPs in Parliament, against the 49 from the three opposition parties, National would have faced deadlock on much legislation with a speaker chosen from its own ranks.</p>

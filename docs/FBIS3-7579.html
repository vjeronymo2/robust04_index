Democratic Voice of  Burma, DVB, has received the following report.    U Myint Maung, minister of agriculture and forest of the  NCGUB, has been missing. He was returning from Chiang Mai to  Bangkok on 25 March 1994. U Myint Maung, an elected  representative from Einme Township constituency-2, Irrawaddy  Division, went missing after he failed to arrive in Bangkok on  26 March as scheduled.    Although the disappearance of Minister U Myint Maung is  being  investigated, no confirmed news has so far been received.    In similar circumstances, NCGUB Finance Minister U Win Ko  and  Information Minister U Hla Pe were assassinated while traveling  in 1993. While traveling on official duty, Finance Minister U  Win Ko last contacted Bangkok from Kunming, China, on 27  February 1993. Three days later on 2 March, Minister U Win Ko  was found dead with two knife wounds in Room No.41 of the Green  Garden Hotel in Kunming. Furthermore, Information Minister U Hla  Pe went missing on 16 June 1993 while traveling in Bangkok,  Thailand. A few days later, his corpse was discovered with  gun-shot wounds. There is a possibility that the assassination  of the two ministers is the work of the State Law and Order  Restoration Council.    A reliable source says continued investigations are underway  on the disappearance of Minister U Myint Maung.</p>

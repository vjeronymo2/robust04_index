			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A U.S.-Laos search for American servicemen missing in Indochina has been  postponed because Laos objected to a U.S. report on the international drug  trade, the State Department said. Spokesman Charles Redman said that the fifth  joint excavation had been scheduled to start last Saturday and that "we regret  that the Lao government has temporarily postponed plans." In the report that  apparently offended Laos, President Bush last week added Laos and Burma to the  list of major drug producing or trafficking nations that are not qualified to  receive U.S. economic aid or support in getting loans from multilateral lending  agencies.  </P></p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: Nissan warns of operating losses NISSAN, Japan's second-largest car manufacturer, yesterday warned it would probably suffer an operating loss in the fiscal year to March 1994 - its second in a row - unless the yen declined in value against the US dollar. Mr Yoshifumi Tsuji, Nissan's president, warned that the exchange rate of Y106 to the dollar was much higher than that on which the company had based its profit forecast. If it remained at this level, the company would not be able to break even this year, as it had expected. Nissan based its earlier profits forecast on an exchange rate of Y110 to the dollar in the first half and Y115 in the second half. The yen has been fluctuating recently at around Y106. Mr Tsuji also said that Nissan was forecasting lower unit sales at between 1.17m and 1.18m units this year, down from the 1.2m units it had expected earlier in the year. To deal with the difficult market, the company is considering bringing forward plans to reduce its workforce by 5,000 by the end of 1996. It might also reduce its winter bonus, although Nissan has yet to consult its labour union, the company said. In the year to March 1993, Nissan reported its first net loss of Y15.1bn (Dollars 14m) compared with a net profit of Y54.2bn in the previous year. Pre-tax losses came to Y26.3bn compared with a profit of Y87.8bn and the company was forced to halve its dividend. Nissan had been looking to break even this year at the pre-tax level, although it is forecasting a loss of Y40bn in the first half, which the company hoped would be offset by profits in the second half. However, domestic demand has remained depressed. Toyota, the largest car manufacturer in Japan, was recently forced to reduce its unit sales forecast for the second time this year. Nevertheless, Mr Tsuji was still optimistic about second-half sales, and the company is planning to launch new models.</p>

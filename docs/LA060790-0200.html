			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> BINGO FUND-RAISERS FOR SCHOOLS ADVANCE  </P> <P> High school parent and booster organizations in the Garden Grove Unified School  District will be able to run fund-raising bingo games to support sports and  other activities under a policy approved by the Board of Education.  </P> <P> The trustees voted 5 to 0 Tuesday night to approve a policy allowing one group  at each of the seven district high schools to apply for city permits to conduct  the games. The policy also outlines rules and regulations for the conduct of  the games.  </P> <P> If approved on a second reading June 19, the policy would take effect  immediately.  </P> <P> At Tuesday's board meeting, some trustees expressed concern that bingo might  unfairly benefit schools in the more affluent areas of the district, which not  only includes most of Garden Grove but portions of Anaheim, Cypress, Fountain  Valley, Santa Ana and Westminster.  </P> <P> "It's possible," said Jim Griffis, the district's director of administrative  services. "It may be more difficult for parent groups in some areas of the  district to get the games set up and pay for the equipment that's required."  </P> <P> A variety of electronic devices are typically used to pick and display bingo  numbers, and the district's policy requires that smoking can be permitted only  if the group installs air filters or smoke-extraction equipment, which can cost  thousands of dollars.  </P> <P> "On the other hand, experience has shown that the poorer areas play more bingo.  If they can get set up, the schools in the less-affluent areas may actually do  very well," Griffis said.  </P> <P> The key, he suggested, is attracting regular bingo players.  </P> <P> "The base of players are ongoing, touring bingo players. Just like some people  may bowl or go to baseball games three or four nights a week, going to bingo  games is their social life."  </P> <P> The first calls for bingo in high schools came from parents complaining that  sports and other programs were at a disadvantage competing with schools that  raised thousands of dollars through bingo games.

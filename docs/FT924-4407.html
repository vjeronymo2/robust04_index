			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / International Company News: Uni Storebrand package rejected THE FUTURE of Uni Storebrand, the beleaguered Norwegian insurer, looked uncertain yesterday following a rejection by Uni's biggest creditor, West Deutsche Landesbank, of a plan to recapitalise the crippled group. The board appointed by the Norwegian government to administer Uni said it would seek a new solution to strengthen the group and did not rule out disposals. The most saleable unit is the non-life insurance business, which has an estimated 40 per cent domestic market share. But a disposal of this unit could be disruptive for the life business, which is also the biggest investor in shares in the Oslo market and behind the liquidity of free shares traded on the bourse. The board said it may sell shares in Uni Storebrand New - established after the collapse in August of the old holding company - to pay off debt and attract strategic investors. The failed recapitalisation plan called for, among other things, 70 per cent of NKr4.5bn (Dollars 690m) of debt to be converted to equity and a share issue to raise NKr1bn in fresh capital, but it relied on the backing of Uni's creditors. The administration board said that it will work to achieve a solution by next summer. West Deutsche Landesbank, which holds NKr1bn in Uni debt, has also suffered heavy currency losses on the debt. It scuppered the recapitalisation plan and demanded cash reimbursement.</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / International Company News: BCH to place Dollars 104m Aumar stake Banco Central Hispano (BCH) is to place 13.49 per cent of the equity it owns in Aumar, the toll motorway operator, via a global offering worth about Dollars 104m. The share sale, which will commence next week with Salomon Brothers acting as global co-ordinator, provides a rare opportunity for institutions to break into the tightly-controlled Spanish motorway sector. Aumar is Spain's second largest toll operator and its concessions, which are centred mainly along the Mediterranean coast, account for 25 per cent of the domestic toll motorway network. According to James Capel, the London stockbroker, Aumar's internal rate of return of 10.7 per cent is attractive against the long-term government bond yield. BCH, which controls 67.39 per cent of Aumar, will remain the majority owner with 53.9 per cent of the stock. Under the terms of the bank's agreement with Salomon Brothers, 9.37 per cent of the equity to be sold will be offered to international institutions and the balance will be placed on the Spanish markets in an allocation that will be split evenly between domestic institutions and small retailers. The Aumar offer is likely to be the first of several disposals by BCH from its industrial portfolio in order to strengthen its 1994 balance sheet.</p>

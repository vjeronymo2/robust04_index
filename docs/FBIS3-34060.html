A Foreign  Office spokesman told newsmen in Islamabad today, that the  agreement came after meetings separately of Pakistan's charge  d'affaires in Kabul with President Borhanoddin Rabbani and Prime  Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar. He said there has also been a  positive response from General 'Abdorrahim [as heard] Dostam,  when the acting consul general of Pakistan contacted him at  Mazar-e Sharif.    The spokesman said Pakistan would continue to provide  humanitarian relief to the displaced people at Jalalabad. He  said Pakistan was pressing all parties to the conflict to accept  a cease- fire.    On the other hand, the 100-member Jalalabad mediation team,  which arrived in Pol-e Charkhi near Kabul last night, has  started informal contacts with leaders of the warring factions,  to prepare the groundwork for negotiations.    Meanwhile a rocket and heavy artillery exchange rocked the  Afghan capital for more than an hour today. Forces opposing the  government attacked Kabul's [word indistinct] Wazir Akbar Khan  district with rockets. The pro-government batteries retaliated  for more than an a hour.</p>

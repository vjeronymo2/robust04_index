			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Japanese premier backs defence policy overhaul Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's new socialist prime minister, yesterday pledged his backing for the first overhaul of defence policy for 18 years. The defence review, by an independent panel set up in February and due to conclude its work next month, is expected to propose heavy cuts in the number of ground forces but prepare for fast responses to regional crises and increased spending on defence electronics. Japan is one of the last leading industrialised countries to adjust its defence guidelines to the end of the Cold War, a reflection of a taboo on defence debate, linked to the pacifist constitution. Panel officials are understood to lean towards reducing the number of ground troops from the present 150,000 to between 100,000 and 130,000, which is likely to win support from Mr Murayama's pacificist Social Democratic party. But the SDP may find it harder to accept the panel's proposal, in a draft report yesterday, that the military should establish an organisation to oversee Japanese contributions to United Nations peacekeeping. Mr Murayama hinted at his own reservations over UN peacekeeping by responding cooly to the German constitutional court's decision, the previous day, to permit German troops to take part in UN operations. 'Each country has its own situation,' he said. The draft plan also aims to prepare Japan to defend itself against several regional threats, such as North Korea, and to support the US presence in east Asia. It calls for co-operation with the US on anti-missile systems, a response to Washington's calls for Tokyo's participation in its theatre missile defence programme, designed with North Korea in mind. The existing 1976 defence programme, on which equipment procurement is still based, says Japan must prepare to defend itself, with US help, against a single large security threat, the former Soviet Union. It is clearly out of line with present threats. The government wants to adopt the new guidelines before it prepares next year's budget. It has already started to squeeze military spending, up a mere 0.8 per cent this year, the smallest rise in 34 years. Mr Murayama's moderate stance reflects the dominance of the conservative Liberal Democratic party in his three-party coalition. Officially, his own SDP believes Japan's military self-defence force is unconstitutional and that the US-Japan defence treaty, which allows US forces in Japan, should be revoked.</p>

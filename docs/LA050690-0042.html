			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROS AND CONS OF 'DR. GRIMES' BITTER PILL'  </P> <P> I took RU-486 in December, 1986, when I was three weeks pregnant. Twenty-four  hours later I began to have severe cramping and started vomiting. When this had  gone on for 10 to 12 hours, a friend took me to the County-USC Emergency Room.  After an excruciating pelvic exam, I was given a shot of Demerol, which did  nothing, and a prescription for a prostaglandin inhibitor to slow down the  process, which did relieve the pain. I had mild bleeding for a few days and  then six days after taking the drug, I began to hemorrhage. I continued to  bleed or spot until mid-March, 1987.  </P> <P> I'm not sure why I had such an extreme response. I chose to take the drug  rather than have a surgical abortion because it had been presented to me as a  relatively benign experience. I also thought it might help advance the causes  of both science and women.  </P> <P> Do I think RU-486 should be licensed in the United States? I'm not sure. I had  access to many resources not available to the general population of women who  might take this drug. I am a registered nurse who works at one of the most  sophisticated hospitals in the world. I was cared for by the research team  investigating the drug. I had no children who needed to be cared for.  </P> <P> The same cannot be said for women of the Third World. It also cannot be said  for women in the United States who do not have access to adequate health care.  In France, and all of the industrialized nations of the world, except the  United States, access to health care is a right, not a privilege. That makes  the use of RU-486 in those settings a safer option than here or in the Third  World.  </P> <P> TAMARA KETA HODGSON, Los Angeles  </P></p>

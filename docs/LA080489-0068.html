			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY IN COLORADO OKS NOISE-LEVEL CURBS ON ICE CREAM TRUCKS  </P> <P> The city has imposed decibel limits on amplified music-makers used by ice cream  trucks to advertise their wares, saying noise is noise no matter what its  cause, tune and purpose.  </P> <P> City Council members voted, 7 to 2, this week for an ordinance that orders ice  cream trucks to keep their music below 55 decibels, a limit also applied to  parties and dirt bikes. The jingles have registered from 70 to 90 decibels.  </P> <P> "Without music, we're not going to get any business," said Ice Cream Truck Inc.  owner Joe Saurini, 52, who has three trucks playing amplified jingles. The  tunes "have got to be so loud that people can hear you at least a block away,  so that people can get ready to buy."  </P> <P> "Citizens decided some time ago that (noise) is one of the things we are going  to regulate heavily," city spokesman David Grimm said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR MERGER;  </P> <P> CREATION OF LARGEST U.S. GAS-ELECTRIC UTILITY A STEP CLOSER  </P> <P> SCEcorp Chairman Howard Allen's dream of creating the nation's largest gas and  electric utility took another step toward reality Thursday when shareholders of  Southern California Edison and SCEcorp, its parent company, voted to merge San  Diego Gas &amp; Electric into Edison.  </P> <P> "This is another important milestone," Allen told the more than 1,000  shareholders who gathered Thursday to vote at a City of Industry hotel. Holders  of the parent corporation's common stock voted overwhelmingly to approve the  merger, as did holders of the utility company's preference and preferred stock,  according to Edison spokesman David Barron.  </P> <P> Allen told shareholders that the proposed merger would produce $1.7 billion in  cost savings between 1990 and 2000, most of which would be used to reduce rates  for customers throughout Southern California.  </P> <P> The merger that is expected to produce lower rates and better service for  customers will also improve shareholder value in the long run, Allen said.  </P> <P> That increased value will develop because the merged companies, with 4.8  million customers, will be better prepared to handle anticipated growth in  Southern California, Allen said. Shareholders will benefit because Edison would  control SDG&amp;E's service franchises in southern Orange and northern San  Diego counties, which boast the state's fastest growth rates.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Desirable Customer Mix'  </P> <P> The two counties have the "kind of desirable customer mix" that Edison needs to  balance the large commercial and industrial customers who increasingly have  been leaving the Edison system and building their own power-generation plants,  Allen said.  </P> <P> When pressed by shareholder Rosemarie Reynolds, Allen vowed that the merger  would not force SCEcorp, which is based in Rosemead, to alter its dividend  policy. However, Allen was unable to predict when the company's stock would  recoup the 7% dilution that will occur if the stock-swap merger is completed.  </P> <P> Allen also discounted the firestorm of protest that the merger has generated in  San Diego County, where the water authority has earmarked $100,000 to study a  possible government takeover of SDG&amp;E.  </P> <P> That protest is being led by a "small group of well-intentioned people" who are  running a largely emotional campaign against the merger, Allen said. The  anti-merger push "is damaging San Diego in the eyes of business leaders  nationally," said Allen, who complained that anti-merger proponents have  ignored "the facts" and instead concentrated on "an emotional approach . . . of  San Diego against Los Angeles."  </P> <P> Thursday's meeting was interrupted briefly when about two dozen protesters from  the Los Angeles-based Brotherhood Crusade began to chant anti-Edison slogans  outside the meeting room.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Terse Exchange  </P> <P> During a question-and-answer session, Danny J. Bakewell Sr., the group's  president, repeatedly pressed Allen to modify the way that Edison makes  charitable donations. Allen agreed to meet with Bakewell, but during a terse  exchange, the executive told Bakewell to sit down and let other shareholders  speak.  </P> <P> Bakewell, who identified himself as an SCEcorp shareholder, subsequently  complained that Allen had "simply kissed us off, ignored us."  </P> <P> The brief demonstration, however, was the only unplanned event at the closely  scripted meeting.  </P> <P> SDG&amp;E shareholders Tuesday approved the merger that now must be approved by  various regulators, including the state Public Utilities Commission and the  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  </P> <P> During Tuesday's meeting in San Diego, 61% of SDG&amp;E's common stock  shareholders approved the merger. Holders of SDG&amp;E preference and preferred  stock voted in favor by 67.3%. Approval of the merger required a simple  majority vote of common shareholders and two-thirds of the preference and  preferred stock holders.  </P> <P> According to terms of the merger agreement, SDG&amp;E shareholders will receive  1.3 shares of Edison stock for each share of SDG&amp;E. That stock swap is  expected to generate a 23% premium for each share of SDG&amp;E common stock. It  would boost SDG&amp;E common stock dividends by 24% and boost the book value  per share of each SDG&amp;E common share by 29%, according to the company.  </P> <P> SCEcorp closed at $32.125, down .125. SDG&amp;E closed at $37.875, also down  .125.  </P></p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / ILO warms to job agencies The International Labour Organisation is set to abandon its long-standing opposition to private employment agencies following publication of a report recommending reform of ILO Convention 96. After pressure from the European Commission, several European countries, in particular Germany and Spain, are abandoning their tight controls on private agencies. However Italy and Greece continue to ban them completely. It may be several years before the ILO formally abandons Convention 96 - which, in 1949, recommended abolition of fee-charging employment agencies. But the report, written by Mr Sergio Ricca, and endorsed by the ILO secretariat, is a significant step towards phasing out the convention. Traditionally, opposition to private agencies is based on hostility to the idea of private companies making money out of unemployment and on the fear that state agencies will be left with hard-to-place workers.</p>

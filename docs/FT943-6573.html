			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Kohl takes the high road in poll campaign Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany summoned more tears than cheers with a calculated, emotional election speech to 17,000 of his Christian Democrat (CDU) party workers in Dortmund yesterday. No mean hand at jokes and mud-slinging himself, he left most of the dirty work to his lieutenants. Mr Theo Waigel, leader of the CDU's sister Christian Social Union, warmed up the proceedings with a hatchet job on the Social Democrats' would-be finance minister, Mr Oskar Lafontaine. And Mr Norbert Blum, Chancellor Kohl's fiery labour minister, sent the crowd home committed to driving out the red peril. In between, Mr Kohl set out on the 50-day campaign before October's general election presenting himself and his party as the only guarantors of a secure economic and political future for Germany - and even Europe. While his cohorts had given the opposition SPD a fresh coat of red paint, damning them again as fellow travellers with the Party of Democratic Socialism, successor to the defunct East German Communist party, Mr Kohl was more thoughtful. He drew heavily on four years of historic change which had propelled Germany into a new role in world affairs. Correcting a blunder he made last week, he yesterday included Moscow in the list of world capitals with which Germany had broken the ice and built sound relations during his term. London and Paris were again worth a reference, but Washington earned a special mention. 'Our connection with America is the decisive factor for the peace and freedom of the Germans,' he said. However the main body of his speech was devoted to internal relations, on which his fourth campaign for the chancellor's job might yet stumble. 'It now remains for us to complete the fulfilment of our dream of German unity,' he said. The divisive terms 'Ossi' and 'Wessi' had to be driven out of the public vocabulary. The west had to accept how difficult it was for easterners to adapt after 50 years of Communist rule. People in the east had to remember how much better off they now were. Although weekend polls showed the CDU-CSU and the Free Democrat coalition partners gaining further support, and making their best combined showing since April 1992, the spoiling potential of the PDS weighed heavily on Christian Democrat minds yesterday. On the one hand, there is a slim chance that the PDS, through a quirk in electoral law, might gain a handful of seats in parliament without winning the 5 per cent of the overall vote customarily needed. On the other, Mr Kohl sees a chance of luring away the more conservative SPD voters to his side. Party leaders in Saxony-Anhalt caused dismay recently when they established a minority state government with their traditional Green allies plus the informal backing of the ex-Communists. While the chancellor's co-speakers vigorously denounced the prospect of a repetition at federal level, Mr Kohl played down the perceived threat as an extra incentive for party workers to fight for every vote. Although the Free Democrats are showing some gain in support, the chancellor does not want to leave his chances of a fourth term more in the hands of fortune than is absolutely necessary. According to weekend polls, the CDU-CSU would gain 41 per cent of the popular vote if an election were held now. The union now has one point more than a month ago, while the SPD is unchanged with 36 per cent. The FDP has 6 per cent and the Greens are steady with 9 per cent. Much may depend on the 8 per cent balance held by 17 other parties registered for the election. Half of this largely protest vote currently lies with the eastern-based PDS. With 49 more days to go and some 1,000 campaign meetings booked, the CDU's leaders set off in noisy convoy yesterday. Only the command vessel, Mr Kohl, was reserving most of its fire. He appeared content that his message - that Germany had founds its place in the world and needed him to maintain it - had come across clearly. 'Do our duty,' he said at the close. The cheers came only slowly, but the eyes in the crowd watered freely. A woman in a home-knitted yellow suit wiped away copious tears with one hand. In the other she held aloft a plaster image of the Christ child. Editorial comment, Page 15</p>

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Safety net, not social insurance: Change, not wholesale reform, is on the welfare state agenda It is official: the welfare state is safe in Conservative hands - or so the government says. After months of speculation about radical reforms - spur-red on by ministers such as Mr Peter Lilley and Mr Michael Portillo - the chancellor sought to lay the issue to rest in his Budget statement on Tuesday. 'This government will never take part in any attempt to dismantle the welfare state,' he said. 'We want to see a better welfare state, well-run, well-judged and one that meets the priorities of modern society.' That claim is borne out by the detailed measures in the Budget. There was a tightening up on eligibility for unemployment and invalidity benefits. A new drive on fraudulent claims was announced. Responsibility for sick pay was shifted to employers for larger businesses. And the state pension age for women will rise from 60 to 65 in the second decade of next century. For all the opposition's sound and fury, this hardly adds up to what Mr John Smith, Labour leader, called a 'vicious attack on the welfare state'. Indeed, Mr Clarke took the opportunity to reaffirm his party's support for the basic state pension, the most expensive social security benefit, accounting for 10 per cent of public spending. Mr Portillo, the hawkish chief secretary, may have suggested as recently as last month the state pension could be phased out for younger people. But the chancellor took the trouble to say the government was committed to the basic pension and 'retaining its value'. And in case it was thought that ministers were picking on lone-parent families, Mr Clarke introduced a childcare allowance that would help 'tens of thousands of mothers' go back to work. While acknowledging that this would benefit married mothers as well, he highlighted the help it would give single mothers in breaking out of welfare dependency. Further, the chancellor has secured the agreement of cabinet colleagues for an end to the sort of talk about fundamental reforms of the welfare state which might frighten backbenchers and Tory voters. Less will now be heard about moving from a welfare state to a 'welfare society', as trailed in the run-up to the Budget by Mr Lilley, the social security secretary. At the morning cabinet meeting Mr Clarke exerted his political authority by telling colleagues to tone down their rhetoric. He wanted the welfare state reformed rather than run down. Others should sing the same tune. Yet life is not so simple. The welfare state has never been a fixed entity. It has constantly mutated to meet new challenges during the 50 years since Sir William Beveridge set out the blueprint for a comprehensive social security system. For much of its first 30 years, the welfare state gathered size, creating new benefits, improving the generosity of payments and extending coverage beyond those paying national insurance contributions. Since the late 1970s, however, there has been a series of incremental changes designed to ratchet down the rising cost of welfare: Some universal benefits such as maternity grant and death grant have been abolished (with employers taking over responsibility for maternity allowance). Unemployment benefit and sickness benefit have become flat-rate payments, with the elimination of the earnings-related supplements which used to be paid with them. Since 1981, benefits have been increased annually in line with prices rather than earnings. The state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps) has been scaled down to reduce its cost in the next century as the population ages. The conditions for claiming most benefits have been tightened - restricting unemployment benefit to people actively seeking work. These changes have generally reduced the value of benefits as a proportion of average earnings, encouraging individuals who can afford it to make greater private provision. Almost 15m people, for example, have opted out of Serps into private pension schemes or occupational pension schemes. The result is that the welfare state plays a declining role in providing financial security for most people. Instead, it is increasingly becoming a safety net for those unable to provide for themselves. This week's Budget measures are a continuation of this trend, with further changes which will cut costs and encourage greater provision by individuals and employers. And while fundamental reforms may be off the immediate political agenda, Mr Lilley is keen to see the trend continue. He will pursue his efforts to encourage a debate on the subject with the aim of preparing the public for more incremental change and persuading them to do more for themselves. He will be helped in this by the decline in value of benefits now that they are linked to prices rather than earnings. The basic pension, worth 15 per cent of average earnings, will fall to about 7 per cent of average earnings over the next 30 years. Already two-thirds of people reaching state retirement age have income from occupational pensions of more than Pounds 56 a week, the amount of the basic state pension. As Mr Lilley recently pointed out, the UK is better placed than many other countries to cope with the strains imposed on the welfare state by an ageing population. By a series of policy adjustments - undertaken in the case of Serps long before the problem emerged - Britain has avoided the often arbitrary cuts other countries have recently introduced. The announcement that the retirement age for women will be raised starting in 17 years is a further example of this far-sighted approach, the chancellor argues. Certainly the welfare state is not fundamentally changed by the sort of measures announced this week. But the underlying process of reducing the demands on social security, of encouraging greater individual provision and seeking a greater contribution from employers continues. The outcome of that in the longer term is a welfare state which is more of a safety net, supporting only those who cannot make their own provision. The welfare state into which all pay contributions in good times and all draw out when times are bad withers. Beveridge might welcome elements of the switch, including the increasing emphasis on individual responsibility in welfare. But it is a far cry from the cradle-to-grave social insurance system he envisaged in his 1942 report.</p>

			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Monthly sales JOHNSON FRY is launching a monthly postal auction for buyers and sellers of second hand with-profit endowment policies. Selling a second-hand endowment policy is usually a more attractive option than surrendering it to the life insurance company because buyers are attracted by the steady growth that with-profits policies can provide. Bidders will be required to make a deposit of Pounds 500 for a submitted bid (a catalogue of policies for sale can be obtained from Johnson Fry Securities, 20 Regent St, London SW1Y 4PZ). There will be a reserve price for each policy and no bid below that will be accepted. The first auction date in on September 14 and bids must be received by 10am that day.</p>

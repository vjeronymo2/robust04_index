			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A PLEA TO END DAYLIGHT WASTING TIME SOONER  </P> <P> Feb. 15 was about 57 days after the winter solstice. Oct. 29, 1988, was about  57 days before the winter solstice. The hours of daylight are the same Oct. 29  and Feb. 15 (i.e., the length of time between sunrise and sunset).  </P> <P> On Oct. 29, we were forced to change from daylight-saving time to standard time  (daylight-wasting time).  </P> <P> I do not understand why we change time Oct. 29, but whatever the arguments were  for that change, they should now work in reverse and should require the change  back to daylight-saving time now, rather than in April or May.  </P> <P> RON GREIM  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

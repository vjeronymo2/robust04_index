			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> HUBBARD STREET ADDS ANGST TO ITS REPERTORY  </P> <P> Cute, zany, entertaining -- and, with its typically "Pink Panther" choreography  on tap, the Hubbard Street Dance Company came across exactly as intended  Tuesday at the Smothers Theatre, Pepperdine University: as marketers of slinky  bravura with a consuming desire to please crowds.  </P> <P> While supple bodies and extroversion were de rigueur for the familiar  disco-jazz routines inspired by artistic director Lou Conte, not all the  dancers could deliver the ultimate panache needed -- a point understandably  ignored by an audience seized with the sheer physicality of tightly controlled,  rhythmic routines.  </P> <P> But the Chicagoans, now in their 11th year, had greater success with the  program's newer works, journeys into the nihilism of serious contemporary dance  that demanded less virtuosity.  </P> <P> Margo Sappington's 1987 "Step Out of Love," for instance, set a quintet of  women, suffering a kind of street-corner nervousness, against a hard-rock  score. Distinctly in an MTV vein, the piece is made of flimsy stuff -- little  more than jerks and spasms, slides and grinds, flailings and spinnings.  Packaged as a smoky subterranean excursion, though, it has the easy appeal that  is the company's trademark.  </P> <P> Daniel Ezralow's 1989 "Super Straight," on the other hand, stepped somewhat  away from this standard. With its ear-battering industrial noise (a score by  Tom Willems, William Forsythe's favorite composer), its dancers in street wear  and its material a series of somnolent struts, floor writhings, and  confrontational stances, a true sense of urban Angst emerged.  </P> <P> Even this, however, evolved into unison maneuvers -- thereby bearing the  Hubbard Street seal. Couched among such favorites as the "Tango  Argentino"-inspired "Cobras" and the big-band swing number, "The '40s," it did  little to detract from the main show-biz thrust. And that's OK too.

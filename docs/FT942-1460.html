			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Reno to investigate US tobacco allegations The US Justice Department said yesterday it was examining allegations of criminal misconduct by the tobacco industry as a company executive hit back at charges that his company manipulates the level of nicotine in its cigarettes. Ms Janet Reno, the attorney general, said her department's criminal, civil and anti-trust divisions were looking at 'all the allegations. . . to determine what would be the appropriate response'. The investigation follows charges by members of Congress that tobacco company executives lied under oath when they testified in April that they did not manipulate the nicotine level in their cigarettes, and that they did not know nicotine to be addictive. Mr Thomas Sandefur, chairman of Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco, a subsidiary of the UK's BAT Industries, denied that his company deliberately manipulated nicotine levels and misled the public. Mr Sandefur appeared before the congressional sub-committee which on Tuesday heard Mr David Kessler, the Food and Drug Administration commissioner, allege that B&amp;W had secretly developed and commercialised a tobacco leaf with twice the nicotine of normal tobacco plants. Mr Kessler also accused the company of misleading FDA investigators who were looking into the high-nicotine leaf used by B&amp;W known as Y-1. Congress is attempting to determine whether cigarettes should be subject to FDA regulation on the grounds that nicotine is an addictive drug. Mr Sandefur and others in the tobacco industry claim that stringent FDA regulation will put 'the industry out of business.' Mr Sandefur accused Mr Kessler of leading 'a dangerous crusade' to advance his 'personal and political agenda' of banning tobacco products. He repeated his claim that nicotine is not addictive but struggled to convince sub-committee members, many of whom stated in their opening remarks that nicotine is a drug that should be subject to further government regulation. Mr Sandefur said B&amp;W did not instruct contract researchers working on Y-1 to mislead Mr Kessler's investigators about its existence and commercialisation. He said research was encouraged by the US Department of Agriculture in the 1970s.</p>

Ovchinnikov at Russia's Academy of  Sciences, Moscow; UDC 57.083.3]    [Abstract] The immunomodulating properties of  muramyldipeptide (MDP)--a minimal structure of the bacterium  cell wall--capable of substituting for the microbacterial  component and affecting the central nervous system and a lack of  complete understanding of the molecular principles of the effect  of muramyl peptides (MP)--a glycopeptide which contains muramic  acid--prompted the development of an original approach to  studying the receptors of biologically active ligands with the  help of anti-idiotypic antibodies. To utilize this approach to  examining the muramyl peptide receptor, an attempt is made to  produce monoclonal antibodies to  N-acetylglucosaminyl-(_b_1-4)-N-acetylmuramyl-alanyl-D-isoglutamine  (GMDP)--a biologically active analogue of muramyldipeptide--for  subsequent use of these antibodies for producing anti-idiotypic  antibodies to GMDP. The GMDP conjugates to MeBSA and  poly[(D, L-Ala)[.sub]n[/] Lys] (GMDP-AL) were  synthesized in the peptide chemistry lab of the Shemyakin  Institute while the GMDP conjugate to ovalbumin (GMDP-OVA) were  produced using water-soluble carbodiimide (EDAC) according to  Bahr, Garelli, et al. A prolonged immunization  procedure was selected for immunizing mice with the GMDP-MeBSA  conjugate. The hybridoma E6/1.2 line was produced by fusing  splenocytes of mice immunized with the GMDP conjugates to  methylated bull serum albumin (MeBSA) and cells of the SP2/0  myeloma line. The E6/1.2 line is capable of producing monoclonal  antibodies to GMDP. The E6/1.2 MCAs are classified as belonging  to the IgG1 subtype and have an affinity constant to GMDP of  2[.sup].[/]10[.sup]9[/] M[.sup]-1[/]. Based on data of  a competitive enzymatic immunoassay analysis, the  GlcNAc(_b_1-4)-MurNAc carbohydrate fragment and the first amino  acid, i.e., alanine, make the largest contribution to these  antibodies' interaction with GMDP. The conclusion is drawn that  E6/1.2 MCAs are highly affine and interact specifically with  GMDP, making it possible to use them for producing hybridoma  which, in turn, produce monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies  simulating the spatial GMDP structure.

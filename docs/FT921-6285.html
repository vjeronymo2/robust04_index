			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Royal Insurance loss at Pounds 373m THE EXTENT of the damage inflicted on Royal Insurance by the recession became clear yesterday when the company reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 373m. Recession-related underwriting losses of Pounds 545m (Pounds 313m) in the UK were the most serious black spot, overshadowing reduction in costs and improvements in underwriting in the group's international operations. The continuing weakness in the housing market and high levels of mortgage default in the UK are generating Royal's most serious problems. Losses from domestic mortgage indemnity policies - which cover lenders against any losses they might suffer following the sale of a repossessed property - amounted to Pounds 257m in 1991 (Pounds 10m). Royal, which has about 20 per cent of the UK market, paid Pounds 66m (Pounds 23m) in actual claims, with the bulk of the losses mainly the result of a steep increase in provisions against future claims. This follows a change in accounting procedures last year when the the company opted to provide for claims as soon as repossessions occur rather than after the sale of a repossessed property. The change means that effectively 21 months of claims are included in the figures for the year. Royal said last year that it had revised its estimates of future claims a further Pounds 150 to Pounds 200m in 1992 and 1993. The company has also been hit by a rise in recession-related claims. Despite an increase in rates on commercial lines business - ranging from between 10 per cent rises on packaged commercial policies to 23 per cent increases for motor fleet business - underwriting losses in the UK climbed during the year. Losses on commercial property insurances rose to Pounds 54m (Pounds 32m), commercial packages Pounds 17m (Pounds 13m), motor fleets Pounds 39m (Pounds 37m) and marine and aviation Pounds 59m (Pounds 30m). Bright spots in the UK included - - a fall in the cost of subsidence claims to Pounds 64m (Pounds 126m) Outside the UK the overall picture is much brighter. The US subsidiary made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 3m (Pounds 89m loss), Royal International Pounds 2m (Pounds 13m loss), and Royal Canada increased its profit to Pounds 35m (Pounds 30m).</p>

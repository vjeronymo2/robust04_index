			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Accrual of interest BECAUSE of my ill health, my wife and I had to sell our business in 1991. As the purchasers could not raise all the money he required, we left Pounds 60,000 in the business in the form of a second mortgage on the property. In early January 1992, the purchaser declared himself bankrupt and it took the building society until August 1992 to sell the business as a going concern at a much reduced figure. We expected the building society to claim back its loan capital but we did not anticipate they would claim full interest on the loan accruing from the date of bankruptcy to the date they received money for the sale. My understanding was that interest charges stopped accruing at bankruptcy. Could you please advise me if the building society were within their rights to take this interest before paying out our second charge, since it resulted in a serious loss for us. The building society was entitled to its interest, as it was realising its security, not proving in the bankruptcy. The moratorium on the accrual of interest which you have in mind applies only to unsecured debts which are proved in the bankruptcy. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

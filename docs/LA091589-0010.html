			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MONEY SOURCES  </P> <P> When the administration gives money and material to foreign countries, the news  articles should state where the funding is coming from. Is it from already  budgeted monies? Does it come from some "discretionary" fund of the  President's?  </P> <P> For example, from which of the government's accounts do the recent grants to  Poland and Colombia come?  </P> <P> Answers are particularly appropriate in these days of battling the budget  deficit. The Times and other media can help by detailing money sources. Those  of us paying the bills deserve to know.  </P> <P> BILL LYNDE  </P> <P> Cypress  </P></p>

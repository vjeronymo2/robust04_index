			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> The National Collegiate Athletic Assn. has informed the University of Arizona  that it has not reached a decision regarding the eligibility of Chris Mills,  former Fairfax High School star who transferred from Kentucky.  </P> <P> The NCAA Council, meeting in San Diego, told the university that it was  referring the matter to the Infractions Committee for review later this month.  Arizona officials sent the NCAA an appeal in late July asking that Mills, a  6-foot-7 swingman, be declared eligible for the 1989-90 season.  </P> <P> Mills, a key figure in the NCAA's recent investigation of Kentucky, was  declared ineligible at Kentucky earlier this year after the NCAA had levied  sanctions against the Wildcats. The NCAA found that Dwane Casey, former  Kentucky assistant coach, had sent $1,000 to Mills' father, Claud, during the  recruiting of Chris Mills.  </P></p>

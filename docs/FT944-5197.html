			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Observer: All that is Gold-man? A tricky year for Goldman Sachs draws to a close on a suitably downbeat note. Profits? But a pale shadow of last year's Dollars 2.7bn pre-tax extravaganza. Bonuses? Commensurately lean. Adding insult to injury, one of its number has turned up his nose at the offer of a partnership - for only the second time in the firm's 125-year history. Investment banker Kevin Conway, whose name appeared two months ago on the once so highly prized list, and who had until the end of last week to sign a partnership agreement, has broken the news to Goldman that he is off to become a senior principal at New York buy-out firm Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice. Goldman's rivals could barely contain their glee. Surely Conway's decision - following on from a similar slap in the face to the prestigious Wall Street house delivered by another independent spirit two years ago - only went to show that partnership had lost its lustre as a guaranteed route to riches at this generally much-envied institution? The ghastly rumour of possible capital calls on partners themselves this year also resurfaced. Nonsense, says Goldman very firmly to that piece of mischief, reminding its rivals both that the 57 partners signed up still constitute a record new intake, and that, in the last week, it has just pulled in an additional Dollars 250m in capital from a Hawaiian institutional investor. Conway's defection is of course also a feather in the cap for Clayton, Dubilier - even if one cannot help wondering just how much it had to fork out to win him.</p>

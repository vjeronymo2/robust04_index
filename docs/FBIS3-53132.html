			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Retired Colonel Ahmed Bencherif [former minister of  irrigation and former member of National Liberation Front  politburo] has called on everybody to take part in the national  dialogue and, speaking at a news conference, he described those  who reject dialogue as being unpatriotic. Amal Meddah attended  this news conference:    [Meddah] Before that, I would like to inform you that  following its recent meeting with the National Dialogue  Commission [NDC] the Islamic Arab Rally held a news conference  at the club of journalists and artists, at the radio station,  this morning to inform public opinion about the proposals made  by this party to the NDC. [Islamic Arab Rally leader] Ali  Zeghdoud indicated that his party has detected a certain  flexibility and moderation in the commission's position  regarding other parties' views. He added that there was a  development in the dialogue since everybody, the authorities and  opposition alike, now believes in the dialogue and regards it as  a means to come out of the crisis. We are, he said, advocates  and supporters of dialogue.    As for retired Colonel Bencherif, he said: If they entrusted  me with the responsibility, I would manage to resolve the debt  problem within three months and I would find a solution to the  security problem, since I was previously in charge of security  [as commander of the Gendarmerie], within six months provided  that they accepted all my conditions. He added: Between 1963  and 1979, Algeria experienced five violent convulsions, but it  never went through the bloodshed it is going through now.    Bencherif seized this opportunity to ask [Higher State  Council Chairman] Ali Kafi to release the political prisoners  Abassi Madani [leader of the banned Islamic Salvation Front] and  his colleagues. He also urged his friend Ait Ahmed [leader of  the Socialist Forces Front; currently in Europe] to return to  his country and participate in the dialogue. He also appealed  to [FLN Secretary General] Mr. Mehri to attend the national  conference and said in this respect: Anyone who does not take  part in the dialogue is not a patriot.</p>

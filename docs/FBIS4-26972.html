			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bill Wang] </F>   [Text] Washington, June 27 (CNA) -- Justice Minister Ma  Ying-jeou of the Republic of China [ROC] Monday [27 Jun] met  with U.S. officials in Washington to discuss joint  crime-fighting efforts.    Ma, the first ROC justice minister to visit the U.S. capital  since the two countries severed diplomatic ties in 1979, said  that he met with U.S. officials from the Justice Department and  the State Department on proposed mutual legal assistance and  extradition treaties.    The minister said that there is a growing consensus between  the two sides on the need for such agreements. Ma said that  some 157 suspects wanted by authorities in Taiwan are either in  the United States or are believed to be here but cannot be  brought to justice because there is no extradition treaty  between the two sides.    Ma added that Washington has signed mutual legal assistance  treaties with 15 different countries and is interested in  signing a similar agreement with Taipei.    Meanwhile, Ma met with officials from the Drug Enforcement  Agency, the Bureau of Prisons, and the Government Ethics Office  to discuss anti-drug efforts, prison administration and the  enforcement of government ethics.    Drug use is becoming a sejious problem in Taiwan, Ma told  the  officials. In 1933, law enforcement agents in Taiwan seized  1,110 kilograms of heroin, morphine and marijuana and 3,357  kilograms of amphetamine, up 133 percent and 17 percent  respectively from the previous year, he said.    He also refuted a State Department report released earlier  this year which claimed Taiwan is an international drug transit  point.    Ma arrived in the United States last week to attend the  convention of the National Association of State Attorneys  General in San Antonio, Texas. He came to Washington Saturday  and is scheduled to leave here for home Tuesday.</p>

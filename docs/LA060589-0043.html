			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Syrian and Christian gunners unleashed artillery barrages across Beirut,  killing two civilians and wounding 19 others, police said. Police said the  deaths in the latest round of Lebanon's civil war occurred in Christian East  Beirut when Syrian gunners pounded that side of the divided capital. Fourteen  people were wounded in the Christian sector, police said. Five others were  wounded when shells struck Muslim West Beirut. The casualties were the first  since May 11, when the Arab League called a cease-fire to halt nine weeks of  fierce artillery duels. Officials said the renewed violence dimmed prospects  for this week's meeting in Morocco of a three-member Arab League committee  seeking to find a permanent solution to the war.  </P></p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): MSF asks more members to contribute to political fund MSF, the general technical union, yesterday launched a drive to persuade more members to contribute to a political fund financing its affiliation to the Labour party and some of its campaign work, writes Michael Smith. It is likely to be the first in a series of similar initiatives among unions as a prelude to 1995, when all will be required by law to ballot members on whether they should have a political fund. Ms Barbara Switzer, MSF assistant general secretary, said yesterday that achievement of a positive vote in four years' time would be made easier if more members contributed to the fund now. She pointed out that about 39 per cent of the union's 650,000 members were contributors. That put MSF in the bottom quarter of unions, and the aim was to raise the proportion to 60 per cent. Full union dues paid by MSF members are Pounds 5.13 a month, including 24p for the political fund. One part of the campaign will be to ask members if 'you will give 6p to help win a better future'. Members will also be told that among MSF's campaigning priorities are equal pay for women, better child care, improved health and safety regulations and a higher level of research and development in British industry. The MSF campaign will be directed in particular at white-collar members, who are less inclined to contribute than other groups. Before MSF was formed three years ago through the amalgamation of the ASTMS and Tass unions, 66 per cent of Tass members paid into a political fund but only 25 per cent of those of ASTMS, Ms Switzer said.</p>

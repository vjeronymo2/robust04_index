			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH-HAT, LOW-BROW AND RAT-SMART;  </P> <P> IN ALL HIS GLORY; WILLIAM S. PALEY, THE LEGENDARY TYCOON AND HIS BRILLIANT  CIRCLE BY SALLY BEDELL SMITH (SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER: $29.95; 815 PP.)  </P> <P> Apparently a kindly deity has put certain rich people on this earth to give us  lesser mortals the pleasure of detesting them.  </P> <P> "In All His Glory" persuades me that William S. Paley is in that group.  </P> <P> One may easily admire him for the willpower, craftiness and luck that enabled  him to dominate the Columbia Broadcasting System for more than half a century.  And socially, when everything was going his way, he could be very charming.  </P> <P> But otherwise, phew! Paley was a notoriously unfaithful husband, a spiteful and  indifferent father, an often oppressive and devious employer, a braggart, a  shameless social climber, an opportunistic patriot. Among other suitable  adjectives: shallow, superstitious, hypochondriacal, vengeful, insensitive.  </P> <P> For that appraisal I rely solely on the evidence supplied by Sally Bedell  Smith. But I don't feel she has turned out a hatchet job. "In All His Glory,"  meticulously researched (the last 142 pages are citations and bibliography), is  as sympathetic and balanced as the facts allow. Elegantly written, entertaining  even when the action bogs down in the board room, free of hype, overflowing  with lush details to bring high society and low business to life -- it is the  best biography of a tycoon I've ever read.  </P> <P> Son of an immigrant Russian Jew who started from scratch and became a  millionaire making cigars, Bill Paley also was a successful cigar maker (first  as a strike breaker) until 1928 when, at the age of 26, he bought into and  became president of an infant radio network.  </P> <P> He made the career shift reluctantly. Although he concocted the legend that he  was a risk-taker, actually he hated risks. His lack of pioneering spirit later  hurt CBS the most when he held back from television, allowing NBC to take a  giant lead. Although CBS had a color technology ready to go as early as 1940,  its first commercial colorcast wasn't until midway through 1951.  </P> <P> Often, CBS' progress and profits came despite Paley, who lacked vision. He was  reluctant to support research that resulted in the LP record, one of CBS's  greatest technological triumphs and one of its most profitable. When the  corporation had accumulated so many surplus millions that it was looking for  investments, he passed up a chance to buy the gold-mine Washington Post and  instead used CBS's treasury to make piddling investments in toy and guitar  companies. With a worldwide news-gathering operation in place, CBS had a chance  to take the lead in cable news, but Paley left that prize to Ted Turner by  default.  </P> <P> Using the bottom line as a whip, Paley drove some of his best executives nuts.  One of his programmers used to vomit after every meeting with the boss. It was  underlings, not Paley, who discovered most of CBS's biggest stars, like Arthur  Godfrey and Lucille Ball, but Paley took credit for virtually all of his  subordinates' good ideas. Still, they respected him; he was, said one CBS exec,  "rat smart."  </P> <P> As an honorary colonel, he went off, with a golden dog tag from Cartier and his  personal valet, to fight World War II in such trenches as London's Claridge's  hotel. Later he did give some service as a propagandist in occupied Germany,  but mostly he spent the war boozing and bedding Pamela Churchill and Edwina  Mountbatten and his secretary.  </P> <P> Paley was often gone, playing around with his society pals, during the crucial  post-war years when CBS was struggling with the transition to TV and coping  with new federal regulations. But when those who really ran the corporation got  good press, Paley became dangerously jealous. Mean jealousy, Smith suggests,  was one reason Paley eventually would force Frank Stanton, who was CBS  president for 27 years and "whose business acumen, decency and understated  humor endeared him to his colleagues," to retire at the peak of his usefulness.  </P> <P> The fact is, except for the programming side of broadcasting, Paley had little  interest in business. He had, however, what many CBS executives told Smith was  a "rapacious" interest in money. Even after he was personally worth half a  billion, he wasn't satisfied.  </P> <P> To keep the loot coming in a flood, he was willing to put on trash  entertainment and let advertisers dictate the content of his news programs.  During the McCarthy witch-hunting period, CBS buckled under to right-wing  advertisers and had its own blacklist. (Oddly, Smith does not mention what CBS  did to John Henry Faulk in its most infamous case of blacklisting.)  </P> <P> Great reporters like Edward R. Murrow, William Shirer and Howard K. Smith were  beaten down, gagged, or fired. Always sucking up to Washington, Paley ran  reruns of "I Love Lucy" rather than cover some of the most important Vietnam  hearings. And during the Watergate investigation, says Smith, CBS was  remarkably timid.  </P> <P> A snob, Paley's purest delight was in hobnobbing with the rich. He planned his  marriages accordingly. Dorothy, divorced from William Randolph Hearst's  bibulous son Jack, served as first wife, but she was too independent, too  scathingly witty, to last. Paley wanted a wife who would not only help him  climb to the highest social circles but would put up with connubial peonage.  </P> <P> Barbara Cushing Mortimer, better known as Babe, daughter of a famous surgeon,  was made for the role. Not only were her social connections perfect -- one of  her sisters was married to Jock Whitney and the other married Vincent Astor  after divorcing President Roosevelt's son James -- but she was a fashion  goddess as well: 5-feet-8, a size six or eight, streamlined and spiffy, in  fashion's Hall of Fame. She wouldn't kiss her children good night for fear of  mussing her hair or smearing her lipstick.  </P> <P> Babe the hostess would do anything to please Paley. She thought nothing of  having "the chauffeur take her to Kennedy Airport to pick up a freshly shot  fowl that had been flown in from overseas."  </P> <P> But like Wife No. 1 (who said, "I had 13 years of dames"), Babe finally got fed  up with his philandering. For the last 15 years or so of her life, she never  slept with him. For sex, wives weren't necessary. Paley the pathological  skirt-chaser had nothing against bedding the rich and famous, but, says Smith,  "mostly he went for classic mistress types -- common, empty-headed and pretty"  -- and one-night stands because he was too tight to set up a long-term mistress  in style.  </P> <P> His wick flickered but never went out. Even in his 80s, he was dating  20-year-olds, confiding in them his sexual fantasies while never taking his  hand from their legs, bidding his guests good night with French kisses (to  their disgust), a dirty old man to the last.  </P> <P> What has this preeminent tycoon left behind as a monument to his life? A  network whose executives talked glibly of maintaining a "Tiffany image" but,  pressured by Paley, too often settled for the banal. The old glamour was gone  long before Paley lost control of the boardroom to Laurence Tisch, but when  that happened CBS became, in Frank Stanton's words, "just another company with  dirty carpets."  </P> <P> But, Smith wisely adds, "Perhaps Tisch finally made CBS what it had been all  along -- a machine of lowbrow mass-market entertainment, now shorn of its  pretensions."  </P></p>

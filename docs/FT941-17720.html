			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Profumo papers remain censored The extent to which the Macmillan government was shaken by the Profumo affair emerges from the cabinet papers. And sensitivities over the affair obviously remain - with sections of the papers censored. John Profumo, the war minister, was challenged about his relationship with model Christine Keeler by one of prime minister Harold Macmillan's senior officials weeks before the public first heard of the scandal. But Profumo - who was to resign from government and parliament on June 5 that year - suggested when he was first confronted that Macmillan need not be told. Many of the papers on the affair are missing from the documents - including three from the prime minister's own files. The earliest document in the prime minister's files on the affair - recording a visit to Whitehall officials by someone with information about the Profumo-Keeler relationship - has seven short sections obliterated from the released two-page photocopy. This was clearly done to hide the identity of the informant. The official who met him on February 1 1963 had promised 'to do his best' to protect the source of information. On the same day Macmillan's principal private secretary, TJ Bligh, went to see Profumo and asked him about the story, warning him of possible newspaper reports. 'Mr Profumo suggested that I need not bother the prime minister with this at this stage,' Bligh reported in his note, written on the same day. 'I said that it seemed to me of great importance to him personally that he should tell the chief whip without delay. 'If this story was going the rounds and the chief whip got to hear about it from some other source first, that would be bad for him. Mr Profumo was grateful for this advice and arranged to see the chief whip on Monday February 4.' The affair rose to the top of the cabinet agenda in June when Profumo resigned his post, confirming one part of the scandal surrounding his friendship with Stephen Ward, the London osteopath and artist, and Keeler. Ward, who faced charges of living off immoral earnings, had claimed that the minister used his flat to meet Keeler. Now Profumo admitted that he had lied to the Commons in a statement made earlier in the year when he said there had been 'no impropriety whatsoever'. While the public feasted on a series of salacious revelations, the cabinet wrestled with the embarrassing discovery that a member of government had committed a serious breach of trust in misleading his colleagues and parliament. The affair was discussed at three cabinet meetings in June. Ministerial concern was partly focused upon Ward's assertion that he had been passing information to the security services. The overriding concern, however, appears to have been the degree to which ministers who had advised Profumo had acted with 'good judgment and honesty of purpose'. The minutes concede that public opinion was 'shaken by the disclosure that a minister of the crown could so far abuse the unique degree of privilege attaching to a personal statement in parliament as deliberately to mislead his colleagues in the government and the House of Commons'. An internal inquiry carried out by the Lord Chancellor, Lord Dilhorne, developed into a 'who-knew-what-when' exercise. This was particularly important because, two years before the Commons statement, Profumo had been warned to end his association with Ward. The warning, delivered by Sir Norman Brook in 1961, was issued at the behest of the security services concerned about Ward's friendship with Captain Eugene Ivanov, the Soviet assistant naval attache to the UK. The minutes concur with the conclusion of the subsequent Denning Inquiry that neither the minister nor the security services had known at that time about the Keeler connection and that no breach of security had taken place. Alterations made to Lord Dilhorne's internal report into the affair - after new evidence emerged - suggest, however, that MI5 might have known more about Ward than it wanted to disclose. A reference to the security service possessing 'information' on Ward is deleted from the first draft of the report without explanation. The government's initial anxiety was not misplaced. Lord Denning concluded that the prime minister and his colleagues had not succeeded in dealing with the widespread public belief that Profumo had committed adultery.</p>

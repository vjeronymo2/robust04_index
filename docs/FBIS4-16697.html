			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 19 TASS -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin met visiting PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat in the Grand  Kremlin Palace today.    Welcoming the PLO chairman, Yeltsin said that Russia "is  making efforts to support you politically, especially now that a  negotiating process between PLO and Israel has begun." The  Russian president pointed out that "our position alongside the  position of the United States is very important".    Yeltsin pointed out that Russia understands PLO claims to  Israel. In his opinion, after the meeting the negotiating  process will go ahead more successfully. Yeltsin pointed out,  in particular, that "we had invited Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin to visit Moscow next week" so as to avoid a break  in the talks.    The meeting was attended by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev and presidential aide for international affairs, Dmitriy  Ryurikov.</p>

			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> PLANNERS URGE MORE TREES, FEWER LAWNS  </P> <P> Deciding that they want less grass and more trees, city planners have  recommended the adoption of an ordinance aimed at environmentally sensitive  landscaping.  </P> <P> The Planning Commission decision, made Thursday, follows the release of a study  showing that mowing, mulching and fertilizing turf grass ultimately hurts the  environment more than the greenery's production of oxygen helps it.  </P> <P> The City Council will now take up the matter.  </P> <P> The city's landscape planners say there are simply more water-efficient and  environmentally sensitive ways to landscape the city than the way it is done  now. To install and maintain just one acre of landscape each year, Irvine uses  four acre-feet of water, enough for eight average families over a 12-month  period. Studies show that 250 to 300 pounds of fertilizer and 102 gallons of  gasoline for lawn mowers are also needed to maintain that single acre.  </P> <P> An earlier draft of the ordinance detailed which plants could be grown and how  much water might be used. Tim Kirkham, Irvine's landscape architect, said the  new draft is not as specific.  </P> <P> "We feel that by spending additional time on the (specifics) that we will be  able to build greater consensus," Kirkham said. "It's not backing off on the  concept of the ordinance or the standards or guidelines. It needs another round  of discussions before it's ready."  </P> <P> Kirkham estimated that the specifics, contained in a manual, would be presented  to the Planning Commission, possibly in three to four months.

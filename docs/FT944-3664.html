			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / The Markets: Japan hungry for platinum - Commodities Japan may have trouble next year satisfying its hunger for platinum and its sister metals, palladium and rhodium, as South African supplies continue to slow. So it will be particularly anxious about the outcome of talks starting today with Russian officials. A mission from Almazyuvelirexport, the Russian platinum group metals export agency, in Tokyo to negotiate export contracts for 1995 with Japanese customers, is likely to find itself in a seller's market. The Japanese are expected to want a 15 to 20 per cent increase in shipments of the metals. But Russia, which has little room for expansion of output, will have to make further and heavier releases from its stockpiles to satisfy this extra demand. The Reuters news agency reported recently that South Africa's Impala Platinum Holdings had cut platinum contracts with Japanese buyers for 1995 to enable it to meet obligations to the US. Other events this week include the publication today of the International Primary Aluminium Institute's October stocks assessment. Today also sees the start of a four-day meeting of the Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries, the first since this month's decision to roll over the International Natural Rubber Agreement into another year. On Wednesday the International Cocoa Organisation's executive production and consumption committees begin three days of talks to assess the market situation and study proposals for curbing supply by 350,000 tonnes over the next five years. Commodity exchange officials from around the world will gather in Beijing on Thursday for a two-day seminar on futures trading being held by the city's commodity exchange. Also coming on Thursday is the publication of official figures for Malaysia's palm oil stocks, exports and output. This will follow the issue of private forecasters' assessments on Wednesday.</p>

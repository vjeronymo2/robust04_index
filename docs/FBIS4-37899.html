			<p>BFN     [Text] Parliament has been dissolved. The proclamation  dissolving parliament at midnight yesterday was gazetted by  President D.B. Wijetunga. Nomination for elections to the next  parliament have been set for the period from July 4 to 11.  Elections will be held on August 16. The new parliament is  scheduled to meet on August 25.    Addressing the nation today, President D.B. Wijetunga said  the decision to dissolve parliament and to hold general  elections was made by me after careful consideration. He said  he was convinced that morality was an essential requisite for  politics, as much as for every other aspect of public life. I  also hold, the president said, that a genuine democratic  political system of the highest quality is equally essential.  He rejected both covert and espousal of immoral and antisocial  and violent means to acquire power or remain in power. It is  this conviction that encouraged him to unhesitatingly go before  the people.    President Wijetunga said that his sole determination was to  provide leadership through exemplary political conduct so that  the secretive and corrupt forces that are today interested in  capturing power could be defeated and proper behavior and  discipline could be inculcated throughout our social fabric.  You will agree with me, the president said, that the policies  pursued by my government are the most suited for this purpose  and the best guarantee to achieve the success we desire.    He recalled that in his address to the nation when he  assumed  office in May last year, he stated that he could not act as a  politician but as a statesman in charge of his duties having the  best interest of the people at heart. He said he took over the  presidency at a crucial time and was able to bring about a  considerable degree of political and social stability before the  country.    In keeping with the economic and political philosophy of the  government, we freed the stranglehold of respective policies and  embarked on totalling the new economic program. President  Wijetunga explained in detail the policies implemented and the  achievements. He referred to the Janasaviya [welfare program] as  a major thrust in poverty alleviation. He also recalled the  invitation extended to the LTTE [Liberation Tigers of Tamil  Eelam] to cease hostilities and discuss a negotiated political  settlement and join in the political framework of the country.  However, he said that these measures did not bring about  concrete results. The government succeeded to a great extent in  ridding the Eastern Province of militancy. The fact that  elections to local authorities in this province were able to be  conducted successfully shows ample proof of this.</p>

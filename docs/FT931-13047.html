			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Observer: Bear-baiting After years of profiting from falling share prices, the Feshbach brothers of California, the most famous short-sellers in the US, have begun buying stocks - a U-turn comparable to Prince Charles announcing that he is forsaking polo for the game of darts. Although they made millions of dollars in the 1980s by searching out companies on the brink of disaster and selling their stock short, the three brothers have been hard hit recently by the steady upward climb of US stock prices. In 1991, when US equities rose sharply, Feshbachs' clients lost between 40 and 60 per cent in value. Last year, rising share prices again left the Feshbachs nursing losses. Consequently, they have decided to buy stocks as a hedge against further advances in the market. At first glance, this strategic shift looks like a vote of confidence in equities. It might, however, be worth taking a contrary view on this one. When the most famous bears in the business announce they are buying stocks - is not this the right time to be getting out of the market?</p>

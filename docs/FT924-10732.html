			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Arts: Tara Arts, where East meets West - Theatre How very satisfying to find Tara Arts staging a co-production with the Theatre Royal, Stratford East. Tara Arts, lest you need reminding, is the British Asian theatre company whose versions of Tartuffe and The Little Clay Cart has played so happily at the National Theatre and elsewhere; and the Theatre Royal, Stratford East, has one of the liveliest, and most culturally mixed, audiences in Britain. Part of the fun in watching Heer Ranjha, their latest Tara production, at Stratford East is to see how well the company's vivid performing style works here, and to hear the speed and ease with which many of its viewers respond. If Tara Arts is new to you, Heer Ranjha is a good primer in their style, which commutes so fluently between Western and Asian elements that it fuses them into one. This particular staging also commutes loveably between high drama and low comedy, between noble utterance ('Suffer me to kiss your hand and foot') and colloquial talk. And - never underrate this, you highbrows - it has a good story, about how the deep love between Heer and her father's cowherd Ranjha is threatened by her family, which successfully manages to part the two lovers with one catastrophe after another. One of the two musicians keeps up a lively, varied supply of music on Indian drums and guitar. If you have seen some previous Tara productions, you may well find Heer Ranjha touching, entertaining, but occasionally disappointing. Let me attend now to the disappointments. There is too much mugging and cuteness from secondary characters; and there are moments when some of them suddenly switch into broad London accents to make rude remarks about other characters ('What are you waiting for - bloody Christmas?'): too cheap, too inconsistent a ploy. The music sometimes makes it hard to hear the words; and the synthesised sound effects that one musician produces from his electronic keyboard add a horridly unspontaneous aura to events. Some of the Indian accents here, exaggerated for comic effect, reach the point of impenetrability. David KS Tse, playing Ranjha, is a lightweight who works too forcefully to compensate for his lack of heroism. All in all, though, this show is endearing. Shelley King, with her sharp, lined, wicked face and her sly, low voice, is an unlikely type to play the heroine Heer; but she is a commanding figure, and becomes the embodiment of dignity and devotion. Nirmal Chandra Pandey plays the river Chenab and other roles with beautiful authority. Magdalen Rubalcava's designs are always picturesque and evocative. Jatinder Verma and Christopher Shackle have turned the original 1759 Varis Shah text into a marvellous English theatre piece, constantly changing in mood. Verma, who is also the founder and artistic director of Tara Arts, also directs. Thanks to his flair for true entertainment, the Tara spell seldom falters. At the Theatre Royal, Stratford East till November 21.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 15 Apr (TANJUG) -- The information service  of the general staff of the army of the Srpska Republic issued a  communique today saying that the general staff has reliable  information that Tuzla airport is being placed under NATO  control.    The communique, which was forwarded to TANJUG, says parts of  the Nordic UN battalion are being withdrawn from the airport and  control is being taken over by 150 U.S. Army soldiers who were  airlifted from The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to  Tuzla.    "We also have information that only NATO transport aircraft  have been landing at the airport, bringing in weapons and  military equipment from NATO bases for the Muslims and  airlifting NATO rapid intervention units," the communique says.    The communique goes on to say that it is a well-known fact  that the Serb side and top Russian representatives agreed that  the Serbs will agree to the reopening of Tuzla airport only for  peaceful and humanitarian purposes, and provided that Russian UN  observers and Serb Army liaison officers are deployed there.    "Despite the fact that no agreement on the reopening of  Tuzla  airport has been signed and that Russian observers and Serb  officers are not deployed there, the NATO troops, under UN  auspices, have been transporting weapons and military equipment  for the Muslims, thus crudely violating the embargo on importing  weapons for the warring sides in this area. That is why they  are replacing UN Protection Forces troops with NATO personnel,  i.e. with U.S. Army soldiers," the communique says.    "These facts and other intelligence reports confirm our  assessments and indicate that Tuzla airport will not be used for  peace and humanitarian flights at all, but exclusively for  arming the Muslims and setting up a NATO base," the communique  says.</p>

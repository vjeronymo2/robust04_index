			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (4): Polly Peck: the death of a dream ASIL NADIR AND THE RISE AND FALL OF POLLY PECK by David Barchard Victor Gollancz, Pounds 9.99, 288 pages JUST OVER two years have passed since the collapse of Polly Peck, prior to that of BCCI, the most spectacular London business failure in recent years. The story is far from finished, since Asil Nadir's trial on charges of theft and false accounting is not expected to begin until next March, Nevertheless, pending further revelations, David Barchard has given us a fascinating and thoroughly researched account of Asil Nadir's career, from his early days as a tough and successful operator in the East End rag trade, through to international business stardom and his eventual and sudden downfall. Barchard's book is based on extensive interviews with those involved, as well as a long acquaintance with the Turkish political and business scene - a central, but seldom explained part of the Polly Peck story. He makes sense of a notoriously tangled web in a refreshingly crisp and engaging style. In retrospect, the important questions about Polly Peck are not just why it crashed, but why it seemed to be so successful for so long. Part of the answer was that many of its reported profits were a mirage. Most were derived from earnings from the fruit trade in Turkey and Northern Cyprus, where inflation has run at around 50 per cent for most of the last ten years, and the Turkish lira has steadily devalued in response. Polly Peck's resultant foreign exchange losses were charged not to its published pretax profits, but to reserves, and buried away in the notes to the balance sheets. None of this was illegal, but resulted from what looks like a serious weakness in the British accountancy rules. It is also worth remembering that Asil Nadir identified and skilfully exploited genuine opportunities, both political and economic. His family's original emigration from Cyprus to London in 1959 was caused by politics specifically, the impending British withdrawal from the island, and clear signs that the Turkish minority would not be allowed to get ahead in business in a Greek-dominated Cyprus. Later, after 1974, the Turkish takeover of northern Cyprus gave Nadir his first break outside the declining British textile industry, when he set up a badly needed packaging plant to export citrus fruits now being grown by the Turks. A second and bigger opportunity arose in mainland Turkey in the 1980s, after Turgut Ozal's government opened up a growing but hitherto highly protected and inward-looking economy to the outside world. Asil Nadir seized the chance, by moving into the fruit export business in Turkey with apparently spectacular success, and then diversifying into consumer electronics and tourism. His expansion was part of that of Turkish capitalism, and resulted in an alliance with its political sponsor, Turgut Ozal. To cement the alliance, Nadir bought two newspapers and a magazine in Turkey which, almost alone in the Turkish press, supported Ozal's cause. Nevertheless, in the final act, Ozal declined to bail out Polly Peck. The final collapse was partly caused by management shortcomings - in particular, the fact that Nadir continued to run a giant corporation as though it were still a small business - besides his disastrous bid to buy out the company in September 1990. However, his bankers must take their share of the blame. Only months before the crash, the banks had been queueing up to lend Polly Peck hundreds of millions, but then forced Nadir to fly round the world in search of a mere Dollars 30m to try to rescue it from liquidation. Hone of them kept a close enough watch on the company, until they were apparently scared off by an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office - not into Polly Peck itself, but a Nadir family company. Whatever Nadir's defects, the bankers' carelessness also played a fatal part in the disaster. In his last chapter, Barchard assesses Asil Nadir's undoubted talents, as well as his failures, pointing out his compelling charm and negotiating skills, as well as his intuitive grasp of innovative opportunities. His description is not just that of a spectacular business career, but of a fascinating personality. Whatever the outcome of Asil Nadir's trial, we are unlikely to get a fairer, more thorough or lively portrait.</p>

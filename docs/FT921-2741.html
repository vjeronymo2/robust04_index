			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / International Company News: Banque Generale du Luxembourg rises BANQUE Generale du Luxembourg pushed up net profits by more than 20 per cent in 1991 to LFr1.52bn (Dollars 44m) from LFr1.26bn a year earlier, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. The bank is proposing an increased dividend of LFr600 per share against LFr450. It underlined its policy of making provisions for 'all declared or perceived risks' and confirmed that its solvency ratio was well in excess of what will be required by EC law from the beginning of next year. The net balance sheet total increased by nearly 17 per cent to LFr593bn, and the consolidated balance sheet figure was LFr599bn.</p>

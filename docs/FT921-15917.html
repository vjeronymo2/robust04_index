			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Major urges UK farmers to get closer to markets UK FARMERS, hard pressed by falling incomes, should get closer to the markets they are aiming for and concentrate on adding value, the prime minister said last night. Considerable uncertainty surrounds the outcome of the current Gatt talks and Common Agricultural Policy reform plans, Mr Major said, but it was clear that farmers faced more competition and lower price support. The prospects were uncertain to bleak for farming, 'even though the rest of the economy is beginning to emerge from recession', he said. But it was not possible to continue present production patterns and price support. 'The key to surviving in this new environment will be the ability to respond rapidly to consumer demands,' he told the annual dinner of the Oxford Farming Conference. It was not just a matter of efficiency - UK farmers were among the most efficient in Europe. Quality was needed, and some farmers would have to change their production and selling methods. The government believed the answer must lie in better collaboration between farmers, said Mr Major, although that does not necessarily mean co-operatives. He referred to a recent Downing Street seminar involving food producers and retailers. The retailers promised to target opportunities for increasing their supply of UK food and food products; to offer a more open-door policy to producers; to second managers to help producers meet market requirements; and to declare the country of origin on own label products. 'The opportunity is there for more British producers to supply our supermarkets. They must grab this opportunity with both hands,' he said. The size of the UK food trade gap was itself an indication of the size of the market farmers had to tap. 'If British farmers can meet the high standards demanded by their customers in the food manufacturing and retail sectors, they will greatly benefit, not simply through recapturing their own domestic market, but in penetrating markets elsewhere in the community.' Mr Major told the 400 delegates that CAP spending would be right up against its limits this year. He criticised the CAP for not operating in the interests of producers, consumers or taxpayers. 'And it also led to the absurd prejudice that farmers are living in the lap of subsidy when in reality your income is falling.' Mr David Clark, the shadow agriculture minister, said last night that Mr Major had failed to give a lead to the farming industry and his suggestion that the planning regime in the countryside could be weakened was 'particularly worrying'.</p>

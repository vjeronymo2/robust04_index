			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Greece is firm about implementing the general  principles prevailing when UN peacekeeping forces are made up.  Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos made his remarks when  he was asked what Greece's stance would be following UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's proposal to send 1,000  Turkish blue helmets to Bosnia.    According to Venizelos, no formal decision has been made. He  said Greece is optimistic and expects the criteria governing the  composition of the peacekeeping forces will remain in force.    Venizelos pointed out that Turkey, in addition to its  historic impediment in the region, has no legal right to  participate in the UN peacekeeping forces, because of the  Turkish occupation of Cyprus.    Asked if Greece has expressed any desire to participate in  the UN force, the spokesman said: It is one thing to utilize  particular procedural possibilities and participate in  conferences, and it is another thing to insist on the firm  criteria on the composition of the UN peacekeeping forces.  Venizelos stressed that Greece is not considering the  possibility of Greek blue helmets going to Bosnia and said that  Greek foreign policy moves within the framework that was decided  at the latest party leaders conference chaired by the president.</p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Ex-Yugoslavia sanctions eased: UN Security Council rewards Milosevic and puts curbs on Bosnian Serbs The United Nations Security Council early this morning eased sanctions against the rump Yugoslav state to reward Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic for cutting off supplies to Bosnian Serbs and accepting international monitors on his border, Reuter reports from the UN. The vote was 11 in favour, two against and two abstentions. Voting against were Pakistan and Djibouti. Abstaining were Nigeria and Rwanda. The resolution was sponsored by the US, Russia, Britain, France, Germany and Spain. At the same time the council imposed new travel and economic curbs on the Bosnian Serbs, with China abstaining because of its general opposition to sanctions. A third resolution, adopted by a 15-0 vote, condemns ethnic cleansing in Banja Luka and elsewhere and demands access for UN personnel to these areas. The controversial resolution on easing the embargo against the Yugoslav states of Serbia and Montenegro suspends for 100 days bans on passenger flights to Belgrade and cultural and sports exchanges. It will also allow ferry service between the Montengran port of Bar and Bari in Italy. The measures go into force a day after Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, receives a report from the border monitors that Serbia is banning all but humanitarian supplies from crossing into Bosnia. The strict trade embargo against Yugoslavia remains in effect. Sanctions would return if Mr Boutros Ghali reported that Belgrade was again shipping proscribed goods across the Bosnian border The resolution had faced a storm of protests from Islamic member states. In an official statement they termed it 'nothing less than rewarding the aggressor, undermining the peace process and sacrificing the principles enshrined in the UN Charter'. The US, which joined Russia, Britain, France and Germany in drafting the proposal, had wanted to delay a vote pending talks that President Bill Clinton is due to have in New York tomorrow with Bosnian Moslem leaders, but relented after private consultations with the other members. Without timely Council action, there were fears that Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic would go back on the agreement.</p>

			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BRITAIN TO LINK POUND TO OTHER EMS MONEYS  </P> <P> Britain said today it will tie the British pound to other currencies in the  European Monetary System, ending its long opposition to linking its economic  policy with the European Community.  </P> <P> The change will take effect Monday and will mean that Britain will have to  adjust its economic policies and interest rates to ensure that the pound stays  within a certain range against the other currencies in the system.  </P> <P> The EMS already includes almost all 12 members of the European Community.  </P> <P> Britain has been the main opponent of a linked currency system. Prime Minister  Margaret Thatcher has said that it would restrict the government's ability to  set economic policy.  </P> <P> The battle over whether to join the EMS has also become a symbol of how much  power Britain is willing to give up as it moves closer to integration with its  fellow European Community nations.  </P> <P> A statement by the Treasury today also said Britain will cut interest rates by  1 percentage point to 14%.  </P> <P> Concerned about inflation, Britain has among the highest interest rates of any  of the EC nations.  </P> <P> The announcement was greeted favorably in the financial markets. The bellwether  Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading shares soared 59.6 points  in afternoon trading to 2,1300. The British pound also rose sharply.  </P></p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Great Portland to review management agent fees GREAT PORTLAND Estates, the UK's sixth largest property group, is to review a long-standing arrangement by which it pays management fees to a company fully owned by Mr Richard Peskin, the group's chairman and chief executive, writes Andrew Bolger. In the year to March, the property company paid fees of Pounds 2.9m to the management agent, Basil &amp; Howard Samuel, which acts solely for Great Portland. Mr Peskin told shareholders at the annual meeting that fees paid were significantly lower than those provided for by their contract and more than Pounds 6m had been saved for shareholders since 1986. In the light of the Cadbury Report the board had decided to review the existing arrangements at its next meeting.</p>

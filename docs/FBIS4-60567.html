			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ibrahim Humaydi: "'Ali Nasir Tells AL-HAYAH: </F> Secession Decision Foolish"]    [Excerpts] Damascus -- Former South President 'Ali Nasir  Muhammad yesterday vehemently attacked 'Ali Salim al-Bid,  secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party, for announcing  secession. He described the decision as "foolish." He stressed  that he had turned down an offer from al-Bid to hold the post of  deputy chairman of the presidential council in the "Democratic  Republic of Yemen." [passage omitted]    'Ali Nasir said that he had requested al-Bid to "abandon the  decision to secede and to return to dialogue" with Lieutenant  General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, "because secession will not solve  the problem." [passage omitted]    'Ali Nasir still believes that the "Pledge and Accord  Document" signed in Amman in February "represents a base for  solving all problems and contains comprehensive solutions to the  crisis." He added that my return to Yemen "in these conditions  is not my current concern. My concern is to bring an end to the  fighting."</p>

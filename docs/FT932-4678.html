			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Hicking ahead 31% to Pounds 2.9m HICKING Pentecost, the industrial products and textiles company, maintained its progress over the past three years with a 31 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.85m in the 12 months to March 31. Mr Tudor Davies, managing director, said he was pleased with the rise from Pounds 2.17m and added that the devaluation of sterling should have a favourable impact on next year's results. Export sales accounted for Pounds 6m - mostly in textiles - of the Pounds 29.5m (Pounds 24.6m) turnover. Mr Davies acknowledged that the textiles side had proved the most resilient  -it lifted operating profits 30 per cent to Pounds 2.32m on sales 9 per cent ahead at Pounds 20.5m. Operating margins rose to 11.3 (9.5) per cent. Since he and Mr John Lister, chairman, joined the group, they have added the industrial products side to the previously floundering textile group. He said they had been more adept at managing the core than either had imagined they would be. However, Mr Davies said that the group was looking for opportunities to create a third leg - 'so as not to be too dependent on textiles'. Operating profits in the industrial products division rose 7 per cent to Pounds 640,000 on turnover up 55 per cent at Pounds 9m. The turnover figure was boosted by three acquisitions for an aggregate Pounds 2.84m. Other acquisitions were predicted by Mr Lister: Mr Davies suggested that in textiles they would be bolt-on, possibly making use of Hicking's in-house dyeworks. Mr Lister said that in view of the 'excellent results and strong cash generation', a 20 per cent rise in the final dividend to 2.65p is recommended, making a total of 4p (3.4p), payable from earnings of 11.64p (10.07p).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Zhukov] </F>   [Text] A responsible customs officer has informed  KONTINENT that the Ruse customs will be swamped with Romanian  gasoline. At its meeting on Thursday 3 February the government  hid the real reason for the temporary ban on importing vehicle  gasoline, aviation fuel, and gas for lamps. The true reason is  the immense import of fuels across the Danube Bridge.    Yesterday morning alone, the customs authorities detained 96  Romanian fuel tanker vehicles. According to a source in the  Ministry of Trade, the border and customs authorities in  Dragoman are no longer in a position to say no to the mafia,  which is threatening their lives if they refuse to let the  tankers through to Yugoslavia.    A police source declared that the state apparatus is not  functioning, and only a complete ban can stop the flow of fuel  to Belgrade.    Until the new excise duty tariff takes effect, the duty on  liquid fuels is negligible, as compared with the huge profits of  250 to 300 percent that can be gained in embargo-stricken  Yugoslavia.    At the moment the excise duty is 60 percent on A-96 and A-98  gasolines, and 50 percent on the A-86 and A-93 grades. A  special police officer said that the Bulgarian mafia is stepping  up its attempts to send fuel through the Dragoman border  checkpoint because the Romanian and Hungarian mafias cannot wait.    The possibility cannot be excluded that the gasolines  shipped  through Ruse from Romania have actually been processed at the  Neftokhim refinery in Burgas, because the Romanians insist on  marketing their own petroleum abroad themselves.    The economic police are unable to check on the amounts of  gasoline entering the country to establish whether it is  destined for domestic consumption, whether it is stored in the  huge tank parks of the state Petroleum Company, or whether it  leaves the country again in Bulgarian railroad tankers.</p>

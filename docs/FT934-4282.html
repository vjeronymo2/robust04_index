			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Resignations called for at Bristol Scotts The gloves are off in the battle for control at Bristol Scotts, the stadium and restaurant group wracked by shareholder dissent, writes Peggy Hollinger. Mr Ian Stevens, head of the company's pubs division, whose family own just over 20 per cent of the shares, yesterday called for the resignation from the board of three members of the Kerman family, which has controlled the company for decades. Mr Stevens made the call in a letter to the company in which he withdrew an earlier request for an EGM to vote on appointing himself and fellow shareholder Sir Ian Rankin to the board. He has requisitioned a second EGM at which he proposes to remove Mr Anthony Kerman and Mr Nicholas Kerman, directors, and Mr Isidore Kerman, chairman. He has called for the resignation of company solicitors, Forsyte Kerman, and again proposed the appointment of himself and Sir Ian. Meanwhile, the High Court is expected to rule on Monday on the voting status of 830,000 Bristol Scott shares - 12 per cent of the company - sold by Mr Nicholas Kerman to the investment vehicle Mayfair Capital which sold them on to Mr Nicholas Berry. The Kermans are claiming to have an option to buy the shares back from Mayfair. Mr Berry has said that if allowed to vote he will vote for the appointment of Mr Stevens and Sir Ian.</p>

Yang Shouyue, director of the transportation department of  Guizhou Province, said that it will have established a full  transport network connecting other parts of the country by the  end of this century.    The length of highways in service in the province had  reached  32,100 kilometers by the end of 1993, and railways had risen to  1,481 kilometers.    The province is top of the league in China in terms of  railway electrification, in part thanks to the completion of  electrification of railroads in the province coming from  Sichuan, Yunnan and Hunan Provinces.    Local air companies have opened 30 domestic services and a  direct charter flight from Guiyang to Hong Kong.    The development of transport has spurred the booming of  other  industries.    The gross product of Guizhou Province increased at an  average  annual rate of nine percent between 1980 and 1993.    Rich in natural and tourist resources, Guizhou has verified  reserves of 74 different minerals, 29 of which rank in the top  five in China.    Located on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, with complex  geographic conditions, Guizhou's economic and social progress  had been hindered by its poor transportation facilities.    A survey shows that the province had only 1,950 kilometers  of  roads and highways when New China was founded in 1949, and even  sparser railway, water-borne and air transport facilities.    The government has made great efforts to improve transport  facilities since 1949, especially since 1978 when China began  its national reform and opening-up policy.    Investment in road-building during the past 15 years topped  1.5 billion yuan, 7.5 times the total in the previous 30 years.    In addition to the 8,000 kilometers of highways built during  the past few years, construction of an international airport,  three highways and four rail lines are under way in the province.</p>

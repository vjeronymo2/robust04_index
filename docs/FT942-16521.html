			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Queens Moat Houses The encouraging message in yesterday's results from Queens Moat Houses is that the new management has made a good start in getting to grips with the operational side of the business. The discouraging part is that there is still such a long way to go. After so many different valuations have been applied to its hotel portfolio one must take any figure with a pinch of salt. The latest one puts Queens Moat's better hotels broadly on a level with industry norms in terms of valuation per room. But the operating return on the revalued assets is a mere 2 per cent and, at Pounds 18m, operating profits pale into insignificance compared with an interest bill of Pounds 110m. Queens Moat has long been candid in admitting that it cannot hope to generate enough cash to service its existing debt. The question is how much debt it could reasonably carry after its financial restructuring. There are still considerable benefits to flow from cost savings and more active marketing. That will come on top of any cyclical recovery in the hotel business. So profits, at least in the UK, could grow quite strongly. But even if Queens Moat managed to push its margin on continuing operations up to 20 per cent from 7 at present it would still have operating profits of little more than Pounds 60m. Allowing a tight interest cover ratio of two times that would be sufficient to service less than a third of the present Pounds 1.2bn debt. The restructuring still promises to be painful, despite the improved trading climate.</p>

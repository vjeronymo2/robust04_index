			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> Karlheinz Stockhausen, the 60-year-old West German composer best known for  experimenting with electronic music, says he suffers acutely from the noises of  daily life and loves silence. "Acoustic pollution is worse than any other kind  of poisonous pollution because people don't know that sound waves immediately  change their souls -- even sound waves they don't notice." He finds no  contradiction between his belief that noise harms the soul and his use of radio  or car engine sounds and feet shuffling in his compositions. "Any sound can  become music if it is related to other sounds. Music is mainly a relationship  between sounds rather than an exhibition of sound, but first we need silence in  which to put an ensemble of sounds." ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / UK Company News: English &amp; Overseas Properties reduces loss ENGLISH &amp; Overseas Properties cut pre-tax losses from Pounds 2.32m to Pounds 707,000 in 1992, after charging exceptional items of Pounds 982,000, against Pounds 2.48m, a sizeable part of which was provided at the half year. As indicated at the interim stage, there is no dividend (1p). Losses per share came out at 2.98p (14.24p). Mr Jim Clark, chairman, said the company had taken steps to reorganise its capital and reserves. Progress had been encouraging with one outstanding matter to be resolved before the company could apply for court and shareholder approval. He said legal advice received indicated that such a reorganisation should be successful, particularly as E&amp;OP's trade creditors were minimal and the cash position was still strong at Pounds 4.7m. Entering 1993 with the majority of its properties let and substantial cash balances available for new investment, Mr Clark said medium term growth prospects were encouraging. Mr Clark said opportunities to acquire companies and properties where E&amp;OP could add value were increasing and he believed 1993 could be the 'window of opportunity' for such acquisitions.</p>

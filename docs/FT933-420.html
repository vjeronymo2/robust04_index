			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Arts: Strauss's 'Daphne' - Opera in concert There was a time when Richard Strauss's 1938 Daphne was thought safest on the concert platform. Not only because it was an unfamiliar opera in one longish act, and thus a risky bet for expensive staging; but also because at the end the carolling heroine must turn into a (wordless) laurel tree. Since designers nowadays have cleverer technology at their disposal, that is no longer the dismaying hurdle it used to seem. Furthermore, many music-lovers have by now seen Daphne staged: by Opera North, or in almost any German house and many French ones, though never yet in London. The experience proves how much easier it is in an orchestra pit to keep Strauss's band down to its intended pastoral-lyrical level. In the Royal Festival Hall on Monday, Andrew Davis found that hard to manage with the BBC Symphony. Too many orchestral voices vied for our attention; too many interesting ripples, too little serene flow. For all that, it was a sound, graceful performance, and had it not been so decisively outclassed a couple of years ago by Norman del Mar and the Chelsea Opera Group in the Queen Elizabeth Hall (semi-professional orchestra, mostly younger and less experienced singers) one might have warmed to it more. If the two performances were not fairly comparable, given their different circumstances, they certainly afforded different experiences. In the larger hall the BBC version - the opening shot in their 'Strauss/Stravinsky Season' - exerted no spell, tamed the much-needed ruderies of the shepherds' music, never lit up Strauss's magical pianissimi. Another Daphne might have inspired them more. Janice Watson's fresh, attractive soprano is more distinguished for energy than for long, floated lines or liquid legato, which are the prerequisites for her fey, other-worldly role. Besides, though she took its taxing high range nicely in her stride she made very little of her words. Among all his rapturous soprano monologues, there is not one that bears singing 'just for the tunes'. Josef Gregor's stiff libretto gives us a timorous adolescent Daphne, beset not only by an impractical yen for union with plants and trees - rather than, say, men - but by competing tenors. Young Jon Fredric West sang the masterful god Apollo with high efficiency, and even conveyed some vital feeling. Like his compatriots Jess Thomas and James King before him, West is a specialist in Strauss's strenuous, somewhat thankless Heldentenor parts. A brighter ring in the voice would have enlivened this one; perhaps he was jet-lagged. As Leukippos, Daphne's greenstick swain from childhood, Vinson Cole was as usual faultlessly musical, transparent and affecting. Why do we hear so little of this excellent artist in Britain? The only other halfway-decent roles in the piece are Daphne's parents, Peneios and Gaea. Peneios, seriously under-composed and under-dramatised, needs at least to wield a grave, imposing bass; for all David Wilson-Johnson's virtues, he had no such thing in his kit. In Gaea's strangely quiet, withheld music - which goes down to an unheard-of and possibly unheard E-flat - Jadwiga Rappe found a more penetrating note. The marginal parts, shepherds and maids, were cast from strength. What we heard was nevertheless a sum of uneven parts.</p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LATEST TESTS SHOW NO TRACE OF OIL IN SLICK FROM TANKER  </P> <P> Coast Guard tests released Thursday showed no evidence of oil in an offshore  slick probably caused by the Exxon Valdez, contradicting earlier state tests  that confirmed that the tanker's discharges were petroleum-based.  </P> <P> Exxon Shipping Co. officials welcomed the announcement. But Coast Guard  officials downplayed those results, and state authorities insisted that the  substance leaked in the 18-mile slick discovered 30 miles offshore Monday was  in fact oil.  </P> <P> In a related development, Alaska state officials said the Valdez trailed a  1-mile sheen of oil as it left Prince William Sound on June 23.  </P> <P> "They definitely trailed a sheen, and we definitely believe it was oil. It's  probably similar to what you have off the coast right now," said Bob Flint,  regional program manager for the Department of Environmental Conservation in  Anchorage.  </P> <P> The slick off San Diego, on Monday within a mile of the Valdez, and two smaller  discharges that leaked from the tanker Tuesday and Wednesday, have dissipated,  Coast Guard officials said.  </P> <P> However, new discharges were reported to be coming from the ship Thursday  morning, and officials said they would keep the ship about 50 miles from the  San Diego coast and continue to lower it in the water until the discharge  stops.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Continuing Mystery  </P> <P> The continuing mystery about the discharge meant that the Valdez was no closer  to resolving the problems that have delayed its entrance into San Diego Bay for  repairs. Before the ship can enter the bay, divers must remove as many as five  huge steel plates that have peeled downward from the hull and wouldn't clear  the bottom of the bay. Before that can happen, the discharge has to stop so the  tanker can receive permission to move to a protected area closer to the coast  to make repairs.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Cmdr. Frank Scarborough said preliminary Coast Guard tests had  found no oil in samples of the slick, but could not explain the discrepancy  between that finding and the opposite conclusion reached Tuesday by the the  state Department of Fish and Game.  </P> <P> "The tests indicate no presence of oil, but some unidentified organic matter,"  Scarborough said. "But we're still assuming we have discharges of oil."  </P> <P> One fish and game department scientist said state tests might be more fallible  than those of the Coast Guard.  </P> <P> "Our laboratory had inherent limits on its ability to identify crude oil," said  Greig Peters, an environmental specialist with the state water quality control  board, which analyzed the original samples.  </P> <P> "I think the true test is whether this stuff is going to be toxic or not. And  we won't get a good sample until divers can actually get inside and take  scrapings off the inside of the vessel."  </P> <P> But other officials rebuffed Thursday's test results.  </P> <P> "Based on preliminary lab results, appearance, smell, feel . . . based on 24  years of experience with oil, yeah," it's oil, said Reed Smith, pollution  response coordinator with the Fish and Game Department.  </P> <P> Scarborough said that, to prevent further discrepancies, scientists from the  Coast Guard, state and federal agencies, and Exxon have formed a single team to  test more samples of the original and subsequent discharges coming from the  tanker. Gary Patrae, a scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration, arrived Wednesday to head that team, Coast Guard officials  said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, officials Thursday still had not determined where the ship could be  taken to remove the five steel plates jutting from the tanker's hull.  </P> <P> Although Pirate Cove near San Clemente Island appears to be the primary choice,  officials also are considering Long Beach as a removal site. Pete Bontadelli,  director of the fish and game department, said Thursday in San Diego that  removing the plates in Long Beach poses less risk to the marine environment  than the San Clemente Island site.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Conditions Demanded  </P> <P> State politicians continued to demand that Exxon meet certain conditions before  entering state waters to remove the steel plates from its hull, and kept the  possibility of a lawsuit against the oil company hovering.  </P> <P> Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy, head of the state Lands Commission, late Thursday said  Exxon had verbally agreed to commission demands expressed Wednesday, but he  wants a written confirmation of that agreement.  </P> <P> The demands included no pollution of state waters by the Valdez, no leaking for  a 24-hour waiting period or when the ship is moved for removal of the steel  plates and a contingency plan provided by Exxon to prevent or clean up any  spills.  </P> <P> Growing involvement by state and federal politicians and agencies clarified on  Thursday, as the state Fish and Game Department was acknowledged as the lead  representative for all state agencies. But the decision on what happens to the  tanker, officials stressed, remains with the Coast Guard.  </P> <P> Scarborough, who has had that responsibility, today will hand it over to Cmdr.  Don Montoro. Scarborough is retiring and will be moving to Miami to teach  business classes at a small Catholic university.  </P> <P> The giant tanker hit a reef in Alaska on March 24 and spilled millions of  gallons of oil, fouling hundreds of miles of pristine Alaskan shoreline,  killing thousands of animals and upsetting the fishing industry.  </P> <P> The crippled Valdez arrived off the coast late Sunday from Alaska, and was to  have docked Tuesday morning at the National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co. in San  Diego Bay for a $25 million, nine-month repair job.  </P></p>

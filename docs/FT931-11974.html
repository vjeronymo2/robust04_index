			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Raglan Property Raglan Property Trust cut its pre-tax loss from Pounds 685,000 to Pounds 564,000 in the six months ended September 30 1992. Losses per share were clipped from 0.4p to 0.3p. The company continued to unwind outstanding liabilities initiated in the late 1980s, and recently exchanged an agreement with Tesco whereby Raglan was released from its obligation to purchase properties for Pounds 4.5m in the centre of Cirencester. Discussions with lending banks and Tameside continue. If successful, they will enable Raglan to achieve a capital restructuring.</p>

			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE;  </P> <P> HEALTHY A'S PUT HURT ON ORIOLES  </P> <P> After sending the leaders of the American League East into a tailspin, it  appears the Oakland Athletics are ready to take on the leaders of the West.  </P> <P> The injury problem is a thing of the past as the Athletics, .002 percentage  points behind the amazing Angels, take on their downstate rivals in a  three-game series beginning tonight at Oakland.  </P> <P> Slugger Jose Canseco, who said he was "fatigued" Saturday night, hit a two-run  home run and bullpen ace Dennis Eckersley pitched another perfect inning Sunday  at Oakland as the Athletics completed a four-game sweep of the Baltimore  Orioles with a 3-2 victory.  </P> <P> Canseco hit 42 home runs, drove in 124 runs and stole 40 bases when he was  healthy last season. He has played in only nine games this season, missing the  first 86 with a broken wrist. He says he is only about 60 to 70% healthy.  </P> <P> Tell it to Jeff Ballard. In the fourth inning, after a walk to Lance  Blankenship, Canseco hit a 479-foot home run. It was his fifth home run in 31  at-bats this season.  </P> <P> "When I came up, I was thinking to myself this guy's luck is going to run out,"  Canseco said. "I've got to hit one where they can't catch it."  </P> <P> For Eckersley, who missed almost two months with a shoulder injury, it marked  the first time he pitched in back-to-back games. In all five outings he has  been perfect.  </P> <P> It was the fifth loss in a row for the Orioles, who were showing signs of  having pitching and run-scoring problems before they ran afoul of the defending  league champions.  </P> <P> Cleveland 17, Kansas City 5 -- People who weren't even around before this month  are leading the Indians' drive into contention in the East.  </P> <P> Newcomers Dion James, Joey Belle and Brad Komminsk combined for 13 runs batted  in at Kansas City to lead the rout that brought the Indians within six games of  Baltimore.  </P> <P> James, acquired from Atlanta July 2, was 4 for 5, including a home run, and  drove in five runs. Belle, brought up from Double A ball on July 15, was 2 for  3 and drove in four. Komminsk came up from Triple A and first appeared July 1.  He was only 2 for 5, but he homered and drove in four runs.  </P> <P> In 15 games, James is 22 for 59 (.372), has scored 10 runs, driven in 11 and  hit two home runs. In 17 games, Komminsk is 18 for 56 (.321), has scored eight  runs, driven in 19 and hit four home runs. Belle, the only young prospect in  the trio, has played in just nine games. He is 10 for 35 (.287), has scored six  runs, driven in nine runs and hit one home run.  </P> <P> Texas 5, New York 4 -- Rafael Palmiero scored the winning run on Jesse  Barfield's 10th-inning throwing error as the Rangers rallied to beat the  Yankees at Arlington, Tex.  </P> <P> The loss was the sixth in a row for the Yankees, while Texas has won six of  seven, including a four-game sweep of the Yankees.  </P> <P> New York's Chuck Cary had a 4-0 lead and was one out away from a one-hit  shutout when Scott Fletcher doubled home Rick Leach, who had walked. Julio  Franco followed with a run-scoring single and Ruben Sierra homered to tie the  score.  </P> <P> Bobby Witt (9-8) pitched a four-hitter for the Rangers, striking out 11.  </P> <P> Boston 8, Chicago 2 -- The streak has come to an end for the White Sox, but the  optimism is back.  </P> <P> Fire-balling Roger Clemens (11-7) checked the hot hitting White Sox at Boston  and the spurt stopped at eight in a row. The White Sox had not lost since  before the All-Star game but Clemens stifled them for seven innings.  </P> <P> Randy Kutcher, getting a chance to play because Dwight Evans is ailing, drove  in four runs with his first home run and a single.  </P> <P> Milwaukee 4, Minnesota 1 -- Frank Viola had his home run ball working at  Milwaukee and the Brewers hammered him into submission.  </P> <P> Greg Brock and Glenn Braggs hit consecutive home runs in the fourth inning to  hand Viola his 11th defeat. Rob Deer hit his 24th and Robin Yount also homered.  In his previous 96 innings, Viola had given up only three home runs.  </P> <P> Seattle 5, Toronto 2 -- Trying to beat Randy Johnson and continue their surge  into contention in the East proved too tall an order for the Blue Jays at  Seattle.  </P> <P> The 6-10 left-hander from USC struck out a career high 12 and pitched a  five-hitter to improve his record to 4-2.  </P> <P> The Blue Jays, after splitting the four-game series, trail Baltimore by six  games.

			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> DAVIS VOWS A 'POSITIVE' TAKEOVER  </P> <P> Oil and entertainment mogul Marvin Davis, attempting to take over Northwest  Airlines, has promised to keep the carrier's headquarters in Minnesota, retain  its managers and employees and expand its routes.  </P> <P> In a letter to Northwest's Board of Directors released today, Davis said his  takeover "would be a positive step for the management and employees of the  company, as well as for the citizens of the communities in which NWA operates,  particularly the citizens of Minnesota."  </P> <P> The promises came one day after Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich pledged a united  effort by state officials and union leaders to try to stop Davis from taking  over NWA Inc., Northwest's parent company based in St. Paul.  </P> <P> The governor said a takeover by Davis, who has offered $2.6 billion, or $90 a  share, for NWA Inc., might lead to the breakup of the airline and cost the  state thousands of jobs and the airline's Twin Cities hub, devastating the  state's economy.  </P> <P> In his letter, Davis said he was prepared to increase his offer in negotiations  and also claimed that he could finance the acquisition without the sale of any  of NWA's strategic assets.  </P></p>

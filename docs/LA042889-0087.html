			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PURTZER BIRDIES FINAL HOLE TO TIE GLASSON AT LAS VEGAS  </P> <P> Tom Purtzer birdied his final hole for a six-under-par 66 Thursday and tied  Billy Glasson for the second-round lead in the five-day, $1.25-million Las  Vegas Invitational.  </P> <P> Purtzer played the Las Vegas Country Club, one of three desert resort courses  used for the first three rounds of this 90-hole tournament, and finished 36  holes of play with a 132.  </P> <P> Glasson, who won the Doral tournament in February and was one of four players  tied for the first-round lead, also was 12 under after a 67 at the Desert Inn.  </P> <P> Gil Morgan and Scott Hoch, a playoff loser in the Masters earlier this month,  were at 133.  </P> <P> Morgan birdied six of his first eight holes at Las Vegas and went on to a  nine-under-par 63, the best round of the tournament. Hoch had a 64 at Spanish  Trail and said it could have been better. The man who missed a two-foot putt  that would have won the Masters, missed two Thursday from less than four feet.  </P> <P> The teams of Al Geiberger and Harold Henning and Bob Charles and Bruce Devlin  each shot nine-under-par 61s to share the first-round lead in the $650,000  Legends of Golf tournament at Austin, Tex.  </P> <P> Gardner Dickinson and Dave Hill were one stroke back in the two-man,  better-ball event over the 6,367-yard Onion Creek Club course.  </P> <P> The Legendary Champions division for players over 60 was led by George Bayer  and Kel Nagle and Bob Goalby and Sam Snead, each at 64. Snead, 76, injured his  back during the round, in which he had two of the team's birdies. A doctor  examined Snead immediately after the round, and Senior PGA Tour officials said  they expected him to continue.  </P></p>

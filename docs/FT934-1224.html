			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Austrian tariff concessions lost EU foreign ministers agreed yesterday to withdraw tariff concessions on imports from the Austrian subsidiaries of Grundig and General Motors in a row over state subsidies. The decision follows a series of complaints about state subsidies to Austrian-based exporters, and could sour negotiations over Austrian accession to the Union. The EU Commission recommended withdrawal of favourable tariffs for two motor plants and a television factory in Austria last July, claiming they had received Ecu80m (Pounds 61.2m) of illegal state aid. Brussels argues the companies are in direct competition with EU manufacturers, and that the aid would not be accepted for similar projects carried out in comparable areas of the Union. The withdrawal of tariff concessions is likely to be equivalent to imposing import duties of 14 per cent on Grundig television sets, manufactured near Vienna. Diplomats said yesterday that 4.9 per cent duties would be levied on cylinder heads and gearboxes made by General Motors Austria at Aspern. However, a third Austrian company, Steyr, escaped duties on its heavy vehicles following negotiation of a subsidy-cutting deal with Vienna. The diplomats said Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands had voted against imposition of the duties, while Greece had abstained. The Commission claimed General Motors had received state aid amounting to 15 per cent of an Ecu324m investment in its Aspern plant, while Grundig had received 10 per cent state aid to sweeten an Ecu72.5m investment in its TV production line.</p>

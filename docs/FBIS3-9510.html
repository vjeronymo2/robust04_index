			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by V.M.B.: "Inflation Is Losing Breath"] </F>   [Text] What can be said for sure is that slowly but  surely, matters are moving toward the better, at least as far as  the bogeyman called inflation and the stampede of the denar's  exchange rate is concerned. Inflation, at least according to  last month's indicators, is slowly easing. The rate is not only  at a nearly complete standstill, but the black market, as an  indicator of all the movements in the country, is slowly losing  its breath.    After the January shock, when a 22-percent inflation came to  light, which did not coincide with what had been planned in the  Government Stabilization Program (to have an inflation below 10  percent in the first months, around 5 percent in the middle of  the year, and around 3 percent at the end), the dose of optimism  that matters would start improving returned the figures of the  last month's rate of inflation to around 6 percent, which is  only 0.8 percent over the plan. According to the announcements  of statisticians, the fall of inflation will be even greater in  the next months, certainly if some unpredictable disturbances  don't occur. Thus, an inflation of only 2.5 percent is foreseen  for July, which will fulfill the plans -- to reduce last year's  inflation rate of 300 percent to an annual level of 70 percent!    If this becomes our reality, we shall finally take a break  in  the race with inflation that we have felt in the past months of  this year, concerning the exchange rate of the domestic  currency. The exchange rate, the official one, according to the  information we got from the Macedonian National Bank, is real,  and the black market exchange rate is on almost the same level.    Taking into consideration its stability, as Dusanka  Hristova,  general manager of the sector for foreign currency system and  policy of the Macedonian National Bank said, the Central Bank  has not intervened at all in the foreign currency market this  year with the aim of maintaining the rate. Since the official  and black market rates are close, according to what Hristova  said, the number of those purchasing foreign currency on the  street is smaller, and on the other hand, the inflow of foreign  currency from authorized exchange bureaus has been increased.    That is certainly one of the reasons for the fact that the  black market is losing its breath, and it influences the  decrease of money circulation, according to the planned  proportions adjusted to the International Monetary Fund.</p>

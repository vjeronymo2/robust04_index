Last year's results included gains of Dollars 8m, or 6 cents, from discontinued operations. Sales slid to Dollars 1.85bn from Dollars 1.88bn. Monsanto said operating income from its Searle pharmaceutical subsidiary has started to turn around thanks to sales growth from new products. Operating income from its chemical group improved to Dollars 77m from Dollars 34m, reflecting higher demand for nylon fibers and continuing cost reduction measures.</p>

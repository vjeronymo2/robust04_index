			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> PLANS FOR RAYMOND THEATRE  </P> <P> The city may join efforts to preserve and renovate the 69-year-old Raymond  Theatre under an agreement to be devised between the city and theater owners  Gene Buchanan and Mark Perkins.  </P> <P> City directors on Tuesday voted to allow city staff members to begin  negotiations that would keep the 1,800-seat former vaudeville house on Raymond  Avenue in Old Pasadena alive as a concert and performance hall.  </P> <P> Three concert and theater operators have indicated interest in buying the  theater but said Buchanan and Perkins' asking price of $2.8 million has been  too high.  </P> <P> The owners had planned to convert the Raymond to offices but put those plans on  hold when the city hired R. F. McCann &amp; Co. Theatre Architects in 1988 to  determine the feasibility of preserving the Raymond. The McCann study concluded  that a theater could be profitable but suggested city participation.  </P> <P> That participation could involve the city's giving Buchanan and Perkins  development rights to a nearby bank parking lot in exchange for their accepting  a lower price on the theater property, said Marsha Rood, city development  operations administrator.  </P> <P> Although the city does not own the lot, it owns development "air rights" over  it, Rood said.  </P></p>

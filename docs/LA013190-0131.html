			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TILLMAN GIVES COMEBACK A LIFT WITH KNOCKOUT  </P> <P> Henry Tillman, the 1984 Olympic heavyweight champion whose pro career plummeted  nearly as quickly as his amateur career had ascended, knocked out former  Mexican heavyweight champion Gerardo Valero of Tijuana just 1 minute 7 seconds  into the second round of a scheduled 10-round bout Tuesday night at the Country  Club in Reseda.  </P> <P> Tillman, who won the North American Boxing Federation championship in 1986 in  just his 10th pro fight, lost to Bert Cooper later that year and then was  crushed by former Olympic team roommate Evander Holyfield in 1987.  </P> <P> He later lost to Canadian Doug de Wit -- the man he defeated in the Olympic  final -- and also lost to little-known Duane Bonds.  </P> <P> He stayed out of the ring for a year and a half before launching a comeback  last December in Florida.  </P></p>

He is 41 years old. He was  born in the settlement of Dangara in Kulyab Oblast. He began  his working life as an electrician at a creamery. He served in  the Army for three years. He graduated as an economist from the  Tajik State University. He was elected chairman of the trade  union and later director at his local sovkhoz, the sovkhoz named  for V.I. Lenin. During the civil war in 1992 he was one of the  organizers of the Kulyab antifundamentalist resistance. He led  the Kulyab Oblast Soviet Executive Committee. On 19 November  1992, he was elected chairman of the Tajikistan Supreme Council.    [Lenskiy] Esteemed Emomili Sharipovich, it has been over a  year now since the people of Tajikistan, under the leadership of  their lawfully elected government, managed to bring the civil  war to an end and embark on the path of a peaceful life. How do  you assess the political situation in the Republic today and how  is the constitutional process, which your speech at the December  session of the Supreme Council launched, developing?    [Rakhmonov] The political situation in the Republic today is  relatively stable if you compare it with what was happening a  year ago, when the civil war ended. The unhealthy passions in  society are dying down. There is, however, a rise in the crime  rate. Some 25,000 crimes have been committed in the Republic  over the year. Three out of every four remain unsolved.  Furthermore, this situation is typical today not just of  Tajikistan, but of all the CIS countries. Although, to be  honest, the recognition of this fact offers scant comfort.    A constitutional commission is at work right now. Work on a  new draft constitution is proceeding successfully. A nationwide  discussion of the document in planned for June. After the  adoption of the fundamental law, there will be elections to a  new parliament and possibly an election for president of the  republic. The question of the presidency must be resolved at  the same time as the adoption of the constitution.    New political forces are coming to the fore -- the People's  Party and the Party of Economic and Democratic Transformations,  which have applied for registration to the Republic's Justice  Ministry. But at the moment the largest parties in terms of  numbers and social weight are still the Communist Party and the  Youth League of Tajikistan.    We have agreed to political dialogue with representatives of  the antigovernment opposition. The talks are due to take place  in Moscow, with the Russian and UN representatives taking part.    [Lenskiy] On what terms is Russia prepared to create a  single ruble zone with Tajikistan?    [Rakhmonov] Russia has not presented us with any impossible  conditions. Talks are being held on the usual topics --  traditional mutual trade relations. First of all ,we must  restore Tajik cotton shipments to Russia to their former volume.  It must be stated with regret that annual cotton production has  halved now.    It is also necessary to consider increasing the proportion  of  Russian capital in our Republic's economy. I am talking about  the flotation of enterprises originally built using Russian  technology, enterprises such as the "Vostokredmet" Association,  or the Rogunskaya Hydroelectric Power Station, currently under  construction. New forms for organizing production units via  international flotation are perfectly acceptable in these  circumstances.    [Lenskiy] The CIS Collective Peacemaking Forces [CPF] have  been performing their duties in the Republic at the Tajik  Government's invitation for six months now. What is your  assessment of their activity?    [Rakhmonov] The role of the CPF should not be overestimated  or underestimated. It would be naive to suppose that their  introduction into the Republic's territory would immediately  bring border violations to an end. Our enemies across the  Pyandzha have regrettably not abandoned their intentions.  However, they now face greater obstacles to the realization of  their criminal schemes. The CPF have become a firm barrier along  the Tajik-Afghan border, which is 1,300 km long.    With Russia's assistance we are taking measures to resolve  the problem by political means. I have in mind the forthcoming  dialogue with opposition representatives, due to take place in  Moscow. I have repeatedly noted that such a dialogue is  necessary. The only condition was the need to define the  potential parties to the talks. I did not want to sit at the  same table as people who are under investigation for committing  crimes against their own people.    We want a peaceable, constructive discussion with those  people who are genuinely interested in improving the situation  in Tajikistan and who are ready to put their ambitions aside for  the sake of the people's well-being.    [Lenskiy] Instability is the main cause of the suitcase  mentality among the Slavs. What could be done, in your view, to  stop the migration of the Russian-speaking population?    [Rakhmonov] Yes, the exodus of the Russian-speaking  population is continuing, unfortunately. Even though we are  making every effort to hold on to specialists and indeed people  who are simply second- and third-generation citizens of  Tajikistan. Through the press I have appealed to those who have  left to return home. The conditions for this do exist.  Hostilities on the republic's territory have ceased.    The government is now trying to resolve the problem of  protecting the interests and guaranteeing the rights of the  nonindigenous population. Under the Tajik-Russian Treaty signed  in May 1993 it is planned to open a Slavic university in  Tajikistan. The only problem is resources, which we lack at the  moment.    [Lenskiy] What about dual citizenship?    [Rakhmonov] Well, it is too soon to talk about that at the  moment....    [Lenskiy] Sooner or later Tajikistan's defense capability  will become your internal affair. How is the formation of the  National Army proceeding?    [Rakhmonov] We believe that a sovereign Republic must have  its own Armed Forces. In this regard we are being helped by  Russia and other fraternal CIS Republics. We have created a  Defense Ministry here and we have subunits of special-purpose  troops and internal troops.    But only the initial, preparatory stage in the creation of  the People's Army of Tajikistan has been completed. An air  force helicopter squadron has been formed, a training brigade is  being formed, and a military school is being organized in  Khudzhand along the lines of the Suvorov School. The Sangak  Safarov Military College is already in operation.    [Lenskiy] It is exactly a year since the legendary Sangak  died. How do you assess his personality and activity today?    [Rakhmonov] I have deep respect for the memory of the  chairman of the People's Front of Tajikistan. May he rest in  peace. Sangak Safarov accomplished a great deed for his people  and in that sense his name now stands among those of the  people's heroes of Tajikistan. I now derive strength for my  work from our people among whom, I believe, there are quite a  few outstanding individuals like Sangak.    [Lenskiy] Recently Tajikistan was shaken by the  assassination of M. Nazarshoyev, deputy chairman of the Council  of Ministers, who hailed from the Pamirs. What effect could  this have on the situation in Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast?    [Rakhmonov] Quite recently, even before the tragic event, I  flew to Khorog where I took part in a discussion of topical  problems. The plan is to allocate to the oblast a long-term  preferential credit totaling 22 billion rubles. The state  budget is also financing the rebuilding of roads, bridges, and  other facilities which have been wrecked. We are trying to  speed up the commissioning of small-scale hydroelectric power  stations in the Pamirs.    The civil war brought the construction of the  Kulyab-Kalaykhum highway to a halt. It is meant for the  transport of economic freight to the Pamirs. Furthermore, this  road is capable of functioning all year round. Ten km of  asphalt still has to be laid in the mountains.    I understand that some people do not like good relations  with  Gornyy Badakhshan. They would prefer confrontation with the  Republic's government. This is confirmed by the provocative  murder of Moyensho Nazarshoyev, deputy chairman of the  government, by enemies of the Tajik people. The Prosecutor's  Office has established that this was the handiwork of the Mullah  Kasym gang, which is inspired to acts of terror and violence by  Said Abdullo Nuri, head of the so-called "government in exile."  That is how they are "preparing" for talks.    But despite the provocateurs' plans, the population of the  autonomous oblast is opposed to separatism.</p>

			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> CITY EXPECTED TO OK CAR-POOL, BIKE PLAN  </P> <P> An program to encourage city employees to car-pool or bicycle to work is  expected to be approved by the City Council tonight. The incentives include  preferential parking for car-poolers; bicycle racks, showers and locker rooms  for employees who bicycle to work; and a guaranteed-ride program for emergency  trips.  </P> <P> City officials are also considering a quarterly newsletter, a ride-sharing  fair, an orientation session with new employees and marketing materials  designed to encourage ride sharing and alternative transportation.  </P> <P> The total cost for the program is estimated at just under $58,000, according to  Traffic Engineer Richard Edmonston.  </P> <P> The recommendations come in response to pressure from the South Coast Air  Quality Management District, which is pushing local governments to reduce their  employee's transportation needs. According to Edmonston, AQMD staff members  have not assured the city that the proposed program of incentives is sufficient  to meet their requirements.  </P> <P> The city may be forced to consider other alternatives, including time off,  "significant" cash incentives, compressed workweeks and pay parking.

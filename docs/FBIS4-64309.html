			<p>BFN     [Text] Test flights with JAS-39 Gripen [fighter aircraft]  have once again been stopped. According to Saab Military  Aircraft, the testing of a future version of the steering system  has not given the results they expected. The tests have been  carried out on a simulator. No flights with the test aircraft  will be made until it has been ensured that deviations in the  steering system do not affect flight safety. Those JAS aircraft  which have been series-built and which will be delivered to the  air force have another version of the steering system.</p>

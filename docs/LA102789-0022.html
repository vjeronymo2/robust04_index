			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE NOTES;  </P> <P> WEST COAST CONFERENCE OK, BUT QUAKE SHAKES OFFICIAL  </P> <P> By and large, the West Coast Conference, with three members in the San  Francisco Bay area and its office just south of Candlestick Park, got off  lightly in last week's earthquake.  </P> <P> The quake, however, did leave a lasting emotional impression. WCC assistant  Commissioner Don Ott, who grew up in Washington State and worked at Oral  Roberts University in Tulsa, said: "I've been in Mt. St. Helen's (volcanic  eruption), a major flood, tornadoes -- and I'll take any of them over a 7  (magnitude) quake."  </P> <P> The conference office, and facilities at the University of San Francisco, Santa  Clara University and St. Mary's College, suffered no serious casualties or  damage.  </P> <P> One sporting event was affected. San Jose State was scheduled to play at USF in  a women's volleyball match the night of the quake. The visiting players were  eating in the USF cafeteria when the quake hit at 5:04 p.m. The San Jose women  were evacuated to USF's baseball field along with the rest of the students.  With power out, the match was postponed and the San Jose women boarded the bus  for a three-hour ride home on the gridlocked freeway. The nonconference match  has not been rescheduled and may be canceled.  </P> <P> Weekend games went off without a hitch, Ott said. He noted that the biggest  problems now are logistics. The WCC, for example, has its media guides printed  across the bay in Berkeley -- normally a relatively easy drive up the 101  freeway and across the Bay Bridge. Now, with the Bay Bridge closed, getting to  Berkeley has become an agonizing trip. And that will be an everyday story in  the Bay Area for months.  </P> <P> Ott said the longest-lasting effect of the quake may be a widespread malaise he  has noted. He said that while life "pretty much went on, it's hard  (psychologically) to get back to normal. There's this feeling of, 'What does it  all matter?' When I hear glasses clink now, I flash back to the quake.  (Psychologists) are saying people here are having the same reactions as Vietnam  veterans."  </P> <P> Cal State Dominguez Hills will find out early next week if it will be the host  site for women's NCAA Division II soccer playoffs. The Lady Toros, who continue  to be ranked second in the nation behind Barry College of Miami, Fla., conclude  their season Saturday at San Diego State. With Monday's 5-0 victory over Azusa  Pacific, the Lady Toros had set a school record with 15 victories, 12 by  shutout. After losing last week to Division I power UC Santa Barbara and  receiving a tongue-lashing from Coach Marine Cano, the Lady Toros came back to  score 13 goals in the next two games. With a strong finish, they expect to be  invited to the final four.  </P> <P> Barry appears to be Dominguez Hills' top competition as host site.  </P> <P> Anthony Blackmon, the four-year basketball standout from Cal State Dominguez  Hills, appears to be adjusting to life as a professional in Japan. The 6-foot-7  Los Angeles native is starting at center for Toshiba in Kawasaki, a Tokyo  suburb, and recently scored 49 points in one of his first games. Blackmon, the  California Collegiate Athletic Assn. Player of the Year the last two seasons,  is working on a one-year contract for $75,000 that also provides room, board  and transportation -- sizable expenses in metropolitan Tokyo. As a gaijin  (foreigner), Blackmon is also studying Japanese. Said Dominguez Hills Coach  Dave Yanai: "He has made the transition to a different kind of environment very  well."  </P> <P> Add Toros: Yanai opened practice with a slightly different roster than he  expected. Forward Segaro Bozart, a part-time starter last season, came up one  unit short of required class hours and will not be eligible until mid-December.  Two other lettermen decided not to return. Starting forward Kenyatta Kalisana  decided to concentrate on academics in his senior year. Guard Bryan Dell'Amico,  a part-time starter for two seasons, has left school for a year to work. Yanai  said Dell'Amico is continuing to train and plans to return next fall.  </P> <P> Romance is still alive. Pepperdine basketball player Shann Ferch, a native of  Bozeman, Mont., showed he has a grasp of Hollywood productions when he proposed  to girlfriend Jennifer Crowell this summer. With the help of friends, Ferch  placed a piano along the sand on Zuma Beach near the Pepperdine campus. He then  suggested a stroll at dusk along the beach, where they happened upon the piano.  Ferch, who had secretly taken piano lessons, played her a ballad he had written  for the occasion, then proposed. They plan to marry next summer.  </P> <P> Waves Coach Tom Asbury can only hope Ferch is this smooth on the court.  </P> <P> College Notes: Dominguez Hills senior Joe Flanagan became the school's career  scoring leader in men's soccer with a goal last week, giving him 81 points. His  34 goals are two short of the school mark. The Toros fell to 2-4-1 in the CCAA  on Wednesday with a 1-0 loss to Cal State Bakersfield . . . The Western  Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. will have a new look next spring. The WIVA is  expanding to 12 teams with the addition of Brigham Young and will split into  two six-team divisions, creating a postseason tournament for the title. One  division will house Loyola Marymount, Hawaii, Cal State Long Beach, San Diego  State, Stanford and USC. The other will include BYU, Cal State Northridge,  Pepperdine, UC Irvine, UCLA and UC Santa Barbara. WIVA members have won every  men's NCAA Division I volleyball title . . . Dominguez Hills senior setter  Karen Sutherland set a school volleyball record with 43 assists in a five-game  match against Cal State L.A.  </P></p>

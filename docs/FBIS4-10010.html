			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Marcano and Ligia Moreno; from "The News" </F> newscast]    [Text] [Marcano] The National Congress Bicameral Committee  has approved the report submitted by the Chamber of Deputies  Finance Committee on the draft of the special powers bill, which  grants special powers to the president on economic and financial  matters; thus, the first discussion of this draft bill began in  the lower chamber.    As known, the draft of the special powers bill was presented  by the Democratic Action Party and was endorsed by the Movement  Toward Socialism [MAS]. We have consulted both sides, given the  draft bill will be approved within days.    [Begin recording] [Carmelo Lauria, president of the Chamber  of Deputies] We maintained in the Finance Committee that it was  necessary to give the government special powers, so it could  quickly approve its tax reform; this was in response to what the  government has raised, that the current economic situation had  led it to suspend economic guarantees, something that is never  desired. In addition, the finance minister had said if the tax  law was not approved quickly, super-devaluation could occur.    [Segundo Melendez, director of the MAS parliamentary wing]  We  believe that in such circumstances approval of this law must be  expedited, so the government can adopt whatever decisions are  needed; in addition, we have pointed out that because the  opposition has admitted the seriousness of the crisis we are  experiencing and the urgency of it all, it is necessary to have  these powers expanded in general to include economic matters.  [end recording]    [Marcano] Regarding the special powers bill, the Social  Christian Party, COPEI, established its position yesterday in  the National Executive Committee. Our colleague Ligia Moreno has  the following report:    [Moreno] COPEI, through the National Committee, expressed  its  total support to the president of the Republic. The National  Committee of COPEI agreed to vote for the inclusion of the tax  measures in the special powers law; this would generate more  revenue and cover the tax on wholesale activities, the tax on  luxury products, the law granting concessions for public  projects, and modify when the national public income and  expenditure budget would have to be presented, bearing in mind  the reforms to the tax code and income tax law.    [Begin recording] [Jose Curiel, COPEI secretary general]  These measures are important but require a supreme will on the  government's part to have them carried out. COPEI is ready to  lend its support, as it has done in the past, to join this vast  agreement. [end recording]    [Moreno] Jose Curiel said bringing Venezuela out of its  current crisis is a task for all Venezuelans, and, therefore,  his party is supporting the existing system in our country.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Japanese business leaders regard the U.S. Trade  Representative's [USTR] annual report on foreign trade barriers  as a means of putting pressure on Japan. For example, Kosaku  Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry,  said, "The United States intends to force Japan to make  compromises at the framework talks by hinting at the possibility  that Japan may become a target of sanctions under the Super 301  provision." Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of  Corporate Executives [Keizai Doyukai], said, "Since it has six  months to specify its trade partners who will be the targets of  the sanctions, the United States is expecting some progress to  be made at the bilateral framework talks during this period."  Both leaders believe it is less than likely that the Super 301  provision will actually be applied against Japan.    However, Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation  of Employers Associations [Nikkeiren], said, "We should make all  possible efforts to avoid the worst-case scenario." As for  intensifying trade frictions between Japan and the United  States, Nagano is particularly concerned about the possibility  that these might have a negative impact on "the Japanese  economy, which has showed some signs of a recovery."</p>

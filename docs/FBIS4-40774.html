			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 20, RIA -- "Human rights do not exist  without the freedom of speech and of the mass media." This was  stated by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev at the  conference -- "The Role and the Responsibility of the Mass Media  in Democratic Process and the Development of Tolerance" -- that  has opened in Moscow.    "Our recent history testifies that manipulation with the  mass  media and the creation of a kind of ministry of the truth, for  instance in the form of an ideological department of the CPSU  Central Committee, may considerably affect the sentiments of the  people," pointed out the foreign minister. Today, too, such a  mighty weapon as the mass media is not always treated with  sufficient honesty and required dignity.    The minister pointed out that the mass media was often used  to propagandise Russophobia and anti-semitism and to stir up  national hatred. In many publications one can find ideas of  nationalism and chauvinism. "It is a dangerous disease which  cannot be left unnoticed," Kozyrev pointed out. He called for  respectful relations between the authorities and the press. "We  welcome well-reasoned, not ideologised, criticism, but we also  want that journalists quote the speeches of officials more  accurately, not distorting their words. However, they have the  right to their own commentaries on the speech of any official,"  the minister said.</p>

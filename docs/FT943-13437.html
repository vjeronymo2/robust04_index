			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / VW agrees wage deal Volkswagen, Europe's largest carmaker, said yesterday it had agreed a pay deal with unions giving workers a 1 per cent pay rise plus additional payments totalling DM900 (Dollars 372) per worker. The 102,000 workers at VW's six plants in west Germany, who began working a four-day 28-hour week to save jobs earlier this year, will receive an extra DM500 with their July wages. They will receive a further DM400 next March, the company said. The deal was reached after four rounds of talks with the IG Metall union, which had originally sought a 3.2 per cent pay rise to match inflation. Volkswagen, hit by a slump in demand because of the recession, has said its four-day week will save DM2bn this year, or 20 per cent of its DM10bn wage bill.</p>

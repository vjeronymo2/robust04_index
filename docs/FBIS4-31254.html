			<p>BFN     [Text] Here is Mirza Sadikovic reporting on the  continuation of the attacks by the joint aggressors in the Bihac  region:    [Begin recording] [Bosnian Serb leader Radovan] Karadzic's  chetniks carried out provocations with infantry weaponry and  antiaircraft weapons along all lines in the zone covered by the  [Bosnian Army's] 5th Corps, and particularly in the Bosanska  Krupa section of the front. Members of [self-proclaimed leader  of autonomous province of western Bosnia Fikret] Abdic's  treacherous paramilitary were in action with antiaircraft  weapons and heavy machine-guns along all lines of separation  throughout the night and this morning. They indiscriminately  shelled (?civilian) villages in the [word indistinct] regions of  (Strbac), Pecigrad, (Lickovac), and (Skodrovo). Shots and bomb  explosions could be heard throughout the night on the  (Strbac)-(?Sturlic) line, which clearly shows that what is  involved are new clashes between Fikret Abdic's mercenaries and  (?renegades) with the local population, which no longer accepts  the [words indistinct] conflict imposed on it.

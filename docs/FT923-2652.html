			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / The Liberal Democrats At Harrogate: Kennedy looks beyond pacts MR CHARLES Kennedy, president of the Liberal Democrats, yesterday urged party activists to cut through theoretical debates about deals with the Labour party and instead confront the threat of permanent Conservative entrenchment in government. Mr Kennedy sought to defuse the tensions which have built up among delegates over the potential for pacts with Mr John Smith, the Labour leader. He called on Liberal Democrats to devote their energies to building an 'intellectual framework which challenges the Tories' appeal to self-interest, but not in the same patronising or paternalistic way'. Mr Kennedy, who favours keeping open the door to co-operation with Labour at some stage in the present parliament, said that the task for the party in Harrogate was 'not to try and tie our feet in ribbons about hypothetical, undeliverable political pacts'. It had instead to consider whether the first-past-the-post electoral system, reinforced by demographic trends and prospective changes in constituency boundaries, pointed to an era of 'entrenched Conservative hegemony'. Against that background the Liberal Democrats should seek to become a 'catalyst' for reform in British politics. The party should focus its efforts now on honing a distinctive political appeal which recognised 'the primacy of the individual within the context of a community of shared values'. It should appeal to the individual drive for self-improvement but also explain the need for shared values. Mr Kennedy also underlined the concern among the party's leadership that a conference debate which is scheduled for today on the Liberal Democrats' future electoral strategy should not close the door to co-operation with other opposition parties. Stressing the potential which existed to reshape the opposition to the Conservative government, he concluded that as a catalyst for such a process the party could - as in the chemical process - change the political landscape without losing its basic form, properties or identity.</p>

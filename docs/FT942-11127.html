			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of Madeira (8): The late starter has an advantage - The island's offshore facilities cater mainly for serious investors Words like 'haven' and 'paradise' trip readily off the tongues of Madeira's tourism promoters but are strictly taboo to the advertisers of the island's offshore facilities. Madeira offers an international business centre with a special fiscal regime, they make clear, not any kind of refuge or sanctuary from the taxman. Madeira's concern not to be dubbed a tax haven or a fiscal paradise is part of a wider effort to promote the offshore centre as being in the top tier of what officials prefer to call the world's fiscally privileged locations, attracting the serious, financially-aware investor rather than the lightweight, fly-by-night operator. Born after a gestation period of almost a decade, the island's offshore financial and services centre offers some premium qualifications. Membership of the European Union provides both regulatory guarantees and full integration with a pre-eminent market, including free circulation of goods and services and the right of establishment. Madeira shares this status with only Ireland and Luxembourg, given that offshore centres in the Isle of Man, Gibraltar and the Channel Islands hang more tenuously to the EU by various differently-defined threads. Secondly, Madeira's offshore centre forms an integral part of Portugal. Companies setting up on the island are governed by the same corporate law and central bank regulations as their counterparts on the mainland and consequently enjoy the same guarantees of legal credibility and economic soundness. 'Companies in Madeira have to operate within an EU-wide regulatory and reporting framework,' says Mr William Cunningham, a Lisbon-based partner with consultants Arthur Andersen. 'Companies that don't like disclosing their accounts will not be attracted there. The island is developing as a base for legitimate international tax planning that can stand up to scrutiny.' The scope for such planning is considerable. Offshore service companies and financial institutions in Madeira enjoy total exemption from taxes on profits and capital gains until the end of 2011. Investors also benefit from total exchange freedom, including free repatriation of capital and profits, free transfers of funds used in commercial operations and complete freedom to import capital. This looks attractive compared with a leading EU competitor for offshore banking operations such as Ireland. The corporate tax rate in Dublin's offshore centre is 10 per cent, a partial tax holiday that runs out in 2005. Furthermore, new companies will not be allowed to set up there beyond the end of 1994. 'Being a late starter is an advantage for Madeira in this respect,' says Mr Cunningham, 'if only because many companies will be shut out of Dublin.' But analysts consider it unlikely that Brussels will allow one EU offshore zone to benefit from significantly greater tax advantages than another for any considerable period. This means that the main competitive advantages of such centres will be weighed in terms of costs, efficiency, accessibility, target markets including the applicability of bilateral tax treaties, language and quality of life. Madeira scores high in terms of operating costs. Salaries, rents and real estate prices compare favourably with other European locations. The island will become within easier reach after the airport runway is extended and is an inviting place to live. The question of target markets largely explains why all but one of the 27 banks and two insurance companies that have set up offshore operations in Madeira are Portuguese or branches of Portuguese subsidiaries of foreign institutions. The only exception is ABN-Amro Bank, which is nevertheless targeting onshore Portuguese clients. 'From Madeira we can provide all the services of an overseas branch without the heavy costs of establishing a network abroad,' says Mr Pedro Libano Monteiro, of Banco Comercial Portugues, the first bank to set up an offshore branch in Madeira in 1989. Banks made good use of the island by lending to onshore Portuguese companies at competitive rates, made possible because they did not have to pay withholding tax on the interest. But the Lisbon authorities wrapped them across the knuckles in March 1993 by abolishing the exemption. The central bank clarified the issue in January 1994 by creating two types of offshore banking branches. Exterior offshore branches (SFEs) can deal only with non-residents in Portugal and enjoy full tax exemption. International offshore branches (SFIs) can deal with residents in Portugal. They have to pay the same tax as an onshore branch except that they can accept deposits from individuals non-resident in Portugal without having to withhold a 20 per cent tax on the interest. Mr David Caldeira, head of the Madeira operations of Caixa Geral de Depositos, the only bank so far to open an SFI, says this can mean savings of 50 to 100 basis points on the cost of financing a foreign exchange loan to an onshore Portuguese company. Much of the private funding for offshore bank branches comes from Brazilians who like to keep part of their savings abroad and are drawn to Madeira by the affinities of language and culture. Brazil is also one of the 12 countries that have double taxation agreements with Portugal. Companies can use these to reduce withholding taxes on royalties, interest and dividends. But Portugal is one of the few countries whose roll of bilateral taxation agreements is, in fact, decreasing. Denmark unilaterally severed its agreement in January 1994 because it considered Danish investors were using the Madeira facilities to abuse Danish tax law. Other impediments that analysts say Madeira needs to iron out include minimum capital requirements that are much higher than those of its main competitors; an obligation to draw up accounts in escudos showing exchange losses or gains that can be purely fictitious for service companies whose business is solely in dollars or another foreign currency; and the impossibility of setting up variable capital companies by fund managers with varying numbers of subscribers.</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Drachma rises but selling engulfs shares The Greek drachma, bolstered by high interest rates, rose yesterday against both the D-Mark and the dollar, but banks said the currency crisis was causing a severe liquidity squeeze. It closed at Dr147.5 to the D-Mark, up from Dr149 on Tuesday, and at Dr244.4 to the dollar, up from Dr245.1. However, investor nervousness prompted a wave of selling yesterday on the Athens stock exchange, fuelled by rumours that the government plans to issue a one-month treasury bill with an interest rate of more than 30 per cent. The index dropped by 5.5 per cent to a two-year low, bringing losses for the week to around 10 per cent. Brokers said many investors were disposing of mutual fund holdings in order to invest in short-term government paper. Analysts said government efforts to defend the currency by raising short-term interest rates to triple-digit figures had proved successful, but only at the expense of stifling the banking system. The drachma has been under constant pressure for the past 10 days, since the government decided to lift capital controls. Faced with a deepening liquidity crisis, banks have been raising interest charges on working capital for corporate borrowers from around 23 per cent to as much 40 per cent. One banker said: 'It's a grim situation. The interbank market is practically dead after 10 days of pressure and would-be borrowers are being turned away.' The National Bank of Greece, the largest state-owned bank, which controls over a third of total deposits, has started restricting withdrawals to 50 per cent of new deposits. There is increasing speculation the government will be forced to raise interest rates sharply on treasury bills, the main instrument for financing the public sector deficit. A new issue is due next week, when the government must raise an estimated Dr400bn (Pounds 1.06bn) to meet its debt obligations. Meanwhile, the finance ministry issued instructions to state corporations and pension funds to transfer part of their deposits to the central bank. The move appeared aimed at ensuring that the government will be able to cover day-to-day spending needs.</p>

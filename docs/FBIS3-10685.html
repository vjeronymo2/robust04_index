Osny Eugene, quaestor of the office  presided over by Bernard Sansaricq, says he is setting the  institution in order.    [Begin Eugene recording] ...is that all those sections  were enclosed in a big accounting department. Well, there are a  number of irregularities that they [not further identified] will  be unable to discover because the accountant was both the  person in charge of spending the money and the bursar.    I must tell you that a partial audit led us to realize  that from May to December there were at least four persons --  including two who have died and two others who were dismissed --  for whom paychecks continued to be written. We are just now  setting things in order. We do not intend to harm anybody. We do  not intend to dismiss anybody but we are setting things in  order, even if it does mean that in the near future we will  (?have to) convert some employees, by putting them in the right  place.

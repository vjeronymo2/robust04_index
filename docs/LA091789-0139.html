			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALCOHOL IS LEGAL, BUT IT IS A DRUG  </P> <P> I read with great anticipation "All-Out Against Alcohol" (The Times, Sept. 7)  but was soon disappointed to see that another error was being promulgated. The  distinction was repeatedly and incorrectly drawn between "drugs and alcohol."  This reference fosters confusion and denial. Alcohol is a drug, legal but  nonetheless dangerous. The text could read "alcohol and other drugs" or "drugs,  including alcohol." Alcohol is a mind-altering chemical, it risks lives and its  use can lead to addiction. Therefore, alcohol is a drug.  </P> <P> ANNE MARIE ARNERICH  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

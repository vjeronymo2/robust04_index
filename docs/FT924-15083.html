			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Lamont to reveal aspects of economic policy MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, will respond to criticism of a vacuum in UK economic policy by explaining at the Conservative party conference tomorrow how the government plans to manage the economy with sterling outside the European exchange rate mechanism. Although his speech in the conference's economic debate will be couched in party political language, it is understood that it will break with tradition by giving details of the government's strategy to control inflation and secure recovery. Mr Lamont will stress that the government will take the sterling exchange rate into account to ensure a tight overall policy and underline the need to keep control over public spending. The decision to use a party political event to disclose aspects of economic policy reflects Treasury concern at the steep fall in sterling and UK equity values. Monday's drop in the pound and the 103-point decline in the FT-SE index were largely blamed on the government's failure to explain its economic strategy since sterling's float. Yesterday, however, the pound bounced back 5 1/2 pfennigs from Monday's London close to finish in London at DM2.4475 but analysts were not convinced it would hold this level for long. In New York it closed at DM2.45. Mr George Magnus, economist at SG Warburg in London, said many imponderables, such as the lack of UK economic policy and rumours of the reintroduction of capital controls in Italy, made European investors nervous. The dollar closed in London at DM1.4300, up more than 2 pfennigs, after the Federal Reserve failed to announce a rate cut on the first day of its open markets committee meeting. It eased in New York to DM1.428. The lira staged a spectacular recovery after falling 6 per cent at one point. It finished in London at L916.2 against the D-Mark, compared with a low of L985 and Monday's close of L934.4. In New York it finished at L922.13. Selling pressure on European shares also eased. In London, the FT-SE 100 share index rose 42.1 to 2,488.4, while share prices in Germany also stabilised. Lira yo-yos, Page 2 Currencies, Page 29 World stocks, Page 35 London stocks, Page 38</p>

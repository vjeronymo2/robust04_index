			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: Cypress sells offshoot CYPRESS Semiconductor, a Silicon Valley semiconductor manufacturer, to sell its microprocessor subsidiary, Ross Technology, to Fujitsu of Japan for about Dollars 23m. Ross is a producer of Sparc microprocessors, designed by Sun Microsystems. Sun, the largest user of Sparc chips, recently chose a different version of the microprocessor, produced by Texas Instruments, for its latest workstation and server computers. Ross recorded a pre-tax loss of Dollars 3m in the first quarter. Cypress said the sale was a better alternative than closing or contracting the Ross unit. The acquisition ensures Fujitsu continued supplies of Ross' Sparc chips to ICL, and other parts of its computer operations. Fujitsu will also gain Ross' microprocessor design capabilities. The sale is subject to US government approval.</p>

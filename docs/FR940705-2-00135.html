			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section III&hyph;C&hyph;4. Experiments Involving Whole Animals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section covers experiments involving whole animals in which the animal's genome has been altered by stable introduction of recombinant DNA, or DNA derived therefrom, into the germ-line (transgenic animals) and experiments involving viable recombinant DNA-modified microorganisms tested on whole animals. For the latter, other than viruses which are only vertically transmitted, the experiments may not be conducted at BL1&hyph;N containment. A minimum containment of BL2 or BL2&hyph;N is required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Caution_Special care should be used in the evaluation of containment conditions for some experiments with transgenic animals. For example, such experiments might lead to the creation of novel mechanisms or increased transmission of a recombinant pathogen or production of undesirable traits in the host animal. In such cases, serious consideration should be given to increasing the containment conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III&hyph;C&hyph;4&hyph;a. Recombinant DNA, or DNA or RNA molecules derived therefrom, from any source except for greater than two-thirds of eukaryotic viral genome may be transferred to any non-human vertebrate or any invertebrate organism and propagated under conditions of physical containment comparable to BL1 or BL1&hyph;N and appropriate to the organism under study (see Section V&hyph;B).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Animals that contain sequences from viral vectors, which do not lead to transmissible infection either directly or indirectly as a result of complementation or recombination in animals, may be propagated under conditions of physical containment comparable to BL1 or BL1&hyph;N and appropriate to the organism under study. Experiments involving the introduction of other sequences from eukaryotic viral genomes into animals are covered under Section III&hyph;C&hyph;4&hyph;b. For experiments involving recombinant DNA-modified Class 2, 3, 4, or 5 organisms, see Section V&hyph;A. It is important that the investigator demonstrate that the fraction of the viral genome being utilized does not lead to productive infection. A U.S. Department of Agriculture permit is required for work with Class 5 agents (see Section V&hyph;R and V&hyph;T).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III&hyph;C&hyph;4&hyph;b. For experiments involving recombinant DNA, or DNA or RNA derived therefrom, involving whole animals, including transgenic animals, and not covered by Sections III&hyph;C&hyph;1 or III&hyph;C&hyph;4&hyph;a, the appropriate containment shall be determined by the Institutional Biosafety Committee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section III&hyph;C&hyph;5. Experiments Involving Whole Plants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Experiments to genetically engineer plants by recombinant DNA methods, to use such plants for other experimental purposes (e.g., response to stress), to propagate such plants, or to use plants together with microorganisms or insects containing recombinant DNA, may be conducted under the containment conditions described in Sections III&hyph;C&hyph;5&hyph;a through III&hyph;C&hyph;5&hyph;e. If experiments involving whole plants are not described in Section III&hyph;C&hyph;5 and do not fall under Sections III&hyph;A, III&hyph;B, or III&hyph;E, they are included in Section III&hyph;D. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> . For recombinant DNA experiments falling under Sections III&hyph;C&hyph;5&hyph;a through III&hyph;C&hyph;5&hyph;d, physical containment requirements may be reduced to the next lower level by appropriate biological containment practices, such as conducting experiments on a virus with an obligate insect vector in the absence of that vector or using a genetically attenuated strain. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section III&hyph;C&hyph;5&hyph;a. BL3&hyph;P (Plants) or BL2&hyph;P + biological containment is recommended for experiments involving most exotic (see Section V&hyph;W) infectious agents with recognized potential for serious detrimental impact on managed or natural ecosystems when recombinant DNA techniques are associated with whole plants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III&hyph;C&hyph;5&hyph;b. BL3&hyph;P or BL2&hyph;P + biological containment is recommended for experiments involving plants containing cloned genomes of readily transmissible exotic (see Section V&hyph;W) infectious agents with recognized potential for serious detrimental effects on managed or natural ecosystems in which there exists the possibility of reconstituting the complete and functional genome of the infectious agent by genomic complementation  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in planta.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III&hyph;C&hyph;5&hyph;c. BL4&hyph;P containment is recommended for experiments with a small number of readily transmissible exotic (see Section V&hyph;W) infectious agents, such as the soybean rust fungus (Phakospora pachyrhizi <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and maize streak or other viruses in the presence of their specific arthropod vectors, that have the potential of being serious pathogens of major U.S. crops.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III&hyph;C&hyph;5&hyph;d. BL3&hyph;P containment is recommended for experiments involving sequences encoding potent vertebrate toxins introduced into plants or associated organisms. Recombinant DNA containing genes for the biosynthesis of toxin molecules lethal for vertebrates at an LD <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 50 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of &lt;100 nanograms per kilogram body weight fall under Section III&hyph;B&hyph;1 and require NIH/ORDA and Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III&hyph;C&hyph;5&hyph;e. BL3&hyph;P or BL2&hyph;P + biological containment is recommended for experiments with microbial pathogens of insects or small animals associated with plants if the recombinant DNA-modified organism has a recognized potential for serious detrimental impact on managed or natural ecosystems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section III&hyph;C&hyph;6.

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Management: Cleaning up your act at work - A more effective way to shuffle her papers When you get to the office in the morning, do you make yourself a cup of coffee and start sorting through a pile of papers? 'I must ring X about that and I'll sort that one out later.' There are papers on your desk and more on the floor. In your drawer, along with an umbrella and a tin of shoe polish there are more papers, but the important fax you were sent yesterday seems to have disappeared. It sounds like you do not know how to work. You are in good company. Inefficiency is rife at all levels. According to the OECD, productivity of white collar workers barely changed in the 1980s despite the introduction of computers, while that of factory workers rose by 75 per cent. People are trained to do every other aspect of their jobs, but when it comes to organising themselves they are usually left to their own devices. Changing bad habits is not easy, but it is possible, according to Jay Hurwitz of the Institute for Business Technology. His training company claims to have made 40,000 office workers more productive using what is grandly described as a 'Personal Efficiency Programme.' Its ideas are so simple it is hard to believe that people pay good money for them. DO IT NOW The PEP golden rule and a principle that even the most inefficient person knows to be a good one. However, simply saying those three words is one thing, living by them is another. PEP graduates have impressed on them that if they Do It Now they will Handle things only once and so save time Have fewer distractions and concentrate better Catch problems while they are small Not have to worry about not doing things or waste time explaining to others why you have not done so Once this has really sunk home, you can move to the next principle GET RID OF CLUTTER Clear out all your drawers and files. With each piece of paper ask yourself: have I ever used it and do I reasonably expect to use it? If I throw it away, and unexpectedly need it, will I be able to get another copy? Create a 'reference' filing system for papers that pass this test, and another 'archive' for things that you do not need, but have to keep for statutory reasons. Set up tree trays on your desk: In, Out and Pending. The last is not for things that have been put off, but those that cannot yet be completed. Use the middle drawer in your desk - or somewhere else close at hand - for all current work. Divide the work into different projects, each in its own folder. Make sure that you have all the other things you need - from telephone directories to paper clips - to hand. PLAN YOUR DAY Don't let yourself be a slave to the in-tray. According to some recent US studies, managers receive five times as much information as they actually need. Managers waste too much time reading unnecessary material and clog up their filing systems with the rest. Set up a new filing system for every day of the coming month. It should contain all the relevant papers for that day's meetings and details of delegated work that is due to be finished on that day. That way you do not have to clog up your mind with things to remember. Make yourself a realistic plan for the day-week of priorities for work, and mark yourself off against them. Delegate more. According to Hurwitz, most bosses spend 20 per cent of their valuable time doing things that could be equally well done by their secretaries. Do not agree to meetings that are not likely to be useful to you, or that will make it harder for you to meet your own targets for the week. It is all easily said. But it seems habits can only be changed under duress. The PEP team stand over each employee, breathing down their necks, to make sure they really are throwing away the contents of their drawers. One man had 20 cardboard boxes in his office containing the papers from previous jobs. Persuading him to throw them out 'took three days and was a very painful experience for that individual', says Hurwitz. The trainers go back after a few weeks and then after a few months to keep the pressure on. Each time they draw up a written contract against which to mark the employee. But does it last? 'There is some slippage, but they do not ever go back to where they started from,' says Hurwitz. As for me, I was planning to clear out my desk drawers after my conversation with Hurwitz, but I have not got round to it yet.</p>

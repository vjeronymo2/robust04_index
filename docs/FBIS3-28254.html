[Prefecture], Feb. 4  KYODO -- Japan's first fully domestically developed rocket, the  H-2, blasted off successfully on its maiden flight Friday [4  February], putting an unmanned prototype space shuttle into  circular orbit, the state space agency said.    After one pass around the earth at an altitude of about 450  kilometers, the experimental space shuttle code-named Orex  splashed down as planned two hours 10 minutes later about 460  kilometers south of Christmas Island in the mid-Pacific, said  officials of the National Space Development Agency (NASDA).    The mission has put Japan among the leading nations in  rocket  technology, opening up prospects for potential commercial  satellite launches, NASDA officials said.    Engineers at Tanegashima Space Center in southern Japan  cheered when the rocket ignited and took off from the center's  launch pad at 7:20 A.M. [2220 GMT], leaving a thick orange  condensation trail in the morning sky.    The lift-off was delayed by 20 minutes because a ship  unexpectedly entered the area where the H-2's solid rocket  boosters were to plunge down after the launch.    Originally the lift-off had been set for Tuesday but was  postponed until Friday because of bad weather and a faulty air  duct that came loose.    The rocket released the 860-kilogram cone-shaped Orex from  inside the payload fairing at the top part of the rocket some  six minutes after the launch.    Fourteen minutes later, the H-2 delivered a 2.4-ton  satellite, called vehicle evaluation payload (VEP), into a  high-altitude orbit, where it will circle the earth for four  days to confirm launch performance.    On reentering the atmosphere, Orex conducted various tests  that will help in research and development of a future unmanned  space shuttle called Hope, expected to be launched around 2005.    Compared with its predecessors, which contained a number of  foreign-made components, the two-stage H-2 rocket has a bigger  engine and can carry a bigger payload.    Due to an improved fuel tank and fairing, the H-2 is only  half as heavy as the European-developed Ariane-4 rocket, but  reportedly equals its capability.    The 50-meter-long H-2 can deliver a single two-ton satellite  into geostationary orbit.    For the first stage the H-2 uses a newly developed liquid-  hydrogen rocket engine called LE-7, which is said to be more  powerful than previous versions, and is claimed to rival the  engine of the U.S. space shuttle.    The H-2 has so far cost some 270 billion yen to develop.  Preliminary testing began in 1985, and NASDA started actual  development testing in 1986.    The initial goal of launching the first H-2 rocket in early  1991 was revised when scientists said it required more advanced  technology.    The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration  (NASA)  has said it will use an H-2 to launch a satellite to measure  rainfall in the tropics in 1997.    At present the high cost of the H-2, which at 19 billion yen  -- including launching fees -- is five times higher than for a  satellite launch by Ariane, are the obstacle to widespread use  of the rocket in commercial projects, officials said.    To increase Japan's competitiveness in the international  rocket market production costs must be substantially reduced,  they said.</p>

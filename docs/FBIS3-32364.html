The long-awaited day  in which we will participate in our civic duty has arrived. The  TSE respectfully expresses its confidence that we will carry out  this electoral process with the same order and enthusiasm we  have shown in previous elections. Our only request to the  members of the Vote-Counting Boards is that they strictly follow  the instructions they received from the TSE. Political parties  have supervisors at the Vote-Counting Boards, whose only  function will be supervising those boards. They cannot engage  in any other activities.    The TSE is receiving messages from all across the country.  People are already voting, the polling stations are open, and  there is a good turnout at the various polls. As we have done  in the past, we will place our homeland very high on the list of  privileged democratic countries.    I urge the TSE members to do their job. The TSE assures you  that we are doing everything and have done everything possible  to ensure you can vote without any problems. You can rest  assured that your vote will be respected.    Costa Ricans: Democracy needs your vote. Go out and vote.</p>

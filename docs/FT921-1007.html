			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Jump-starting the Brazilian car industry / A look at moves to make production more efficient and competitive REPRESENTATIVES from the Brazilian private sector, government and labour have been meeting in Brasilia during the past few days to outline a strategy for boosting the competitiveness of the country's automotive industry. If, as hoped, there is consensus on specific measures, the government is prepared to implement a package aimed at providing short-term relief. This could include lower sales taxes on new cars in exchange for a private-sector agreement to moderate price increases. 'I think we've already got a clear consensus,' said Ms Dorotea Werneck, national secretary of the Economy Ministry, the top-ranking public official in the talks. 'There are hopes that a set of measures can be announced.' Even if short-term measures are approved this week, talks will continue through June to develop a long-term strategy aimed at bringing the industry's competitiveness up to world levels. The question which will remain unanswered, even after June, is how big the automotive industry in Brazil can grow and still be competitive in world markets. The industry plays a significant role in the Brazilian economy, accounting for 10 per cent of the country's gross domestic product, and directly employs 125,000 workers. The jobs of an estimated 4.1m Brazilians are generated by the industry. Troubles in Brazil partly reflect global difficulties in the sector, particularly for the companies that dominate local car production: Ford and Volkswagen, which operate a joint venture called Autolatina; General Motors; and Fiat. However, the problems also reflect the Brazilian automotive industry's inefficiency, a crucial issue as it prepares to compete with imports for the first time since the 1950s. The government recently said it would bring forward, to October this year from 1993, a reduction in import duties for cars from 50 to 40 per cent. Duties will fall further to 35 per cent in July 1993. Imports, notably low-cost models made by Russia's Lada, which began as a trickle last year, are forcing domestic manufacturers to peek over their shoulders. 'For a quarter of a century Brazil closed its doors to the world,' says Mr Jacy de Souza Mendonca, president of the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers (ANFAVEA). 'Now there are radical changes.' Two years ago, a study by American economist James P. Womack, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, showed 48 man-hours were needed to produce a standard vehicle in Brazil, compared with 40 in Mexico, 37 in western Europe, 34 in east Asia, 25 in the US, and 17 in Japan. Although production rose slowly through the mid-1980s - topping 1m before dropping back in 19901 and 1991 - it has lagged behind projections in the heady days of the early 1980s, when the Brazilians expected to become world-class exporters. With vehicle sales weak, Autolatina and General Motors both cut production by extending the traditional Carnival holidays during the first week in March. Last week, GM announced another two-week forced vacation for 800 workers. This year, Ford closed an engine plant near Sao Paulo, with the loss of 900 jobs. Until recently, everyone blamed everyone else's inefficiency. Manufacturers hit out at high taxes, price controls, the informatics reserve law, and poorly-trained workers organised in militant unions. The unions decried declining real wages, poor management, lack of investment and state macroeconomic policies. And the government lashed its tongue at the 'oligarchy' it said ran the sector. Such charges are still aired, but all parties now seem convinced of the need to try to reach an understanding to reinvigorate the industry. 'There is now a consensus that the industry is not competitive,' notes Mr Jose Roberto Ferro, an economist at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, and an industry consultant for the sectoral talks. Manufacturers and labour both argue that the tax rates on Brazilian producers - 43 per cent of the retail price - must be reduced. Technological advances are also high on everyone's list. 'We think technological innovation is important. We aren't stupid,' says Mr Vincente Paulo da Silva, president of the Metalworkers Union of Sao Bernarndo de Campo and Diadema, an affiliate of the Unified Workers Central (CUT), Brazil's most militant labour federation. Employers, however, may not agree to the union's plan for introducing the changes. 'We want employment guarantees and we want to participate in changes made on the shop floor,' says the union chief. Mr Silva admits that union attitudes have been transformed in recent years. 'Before, we were only worried about wages. We wouldn't have been sitting around a table with economists and engineers discussing industrial policy,' he says. After years of battling for a share of a closed market, manufacturers are more concerned than ever with increasing sales. They have, however, taken advantage of their third period of price freedom in three decades, with mark-ups last year that out-distanced the annual inflation rate of 458 per cent by more than 100 percentage points. But the manufacturers are now joining the chorus of labour voices in favour of macroeconomic policies to boost the spending power of average Brazilians. 'One half of 1 per cent of the population participates in the new car market,' calculates Mr Mendonca, 'because per capita income has fallen.' In a possible signal of goodwill ahead of the latest talks on industry strategy, the big auto-makers had begun moderating price increases. Fiat, for instance, announced on March 16 that it would not raise prices again this month. 'For the first time,' notes economist Mr Ferro, 'all three parties recognise that there is a problem. It is a new step.'</p>

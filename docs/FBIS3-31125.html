			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sylwester Walczak, from New York, and Maria </F> Wagrowska: "WASHINGTON POST: Poland Sold Soviet Arms to the  United States; Speculations or Facts"]    [Text] "In the 1980's the United States bought in Poland  the newest systems of Soviet arms which could not be obtained in  any other manner, with the tacit approval of the Polish Defense  Ministry [MON]," claims THE WASHINGTON POST. "It is impossible  that anyone in Poland could agree to such transactions," stress  the interlocutors of RZECZPOSPOLITA. According to them, Poland  has never had the Soviet military technology of the newest  generation. It is possible, however, that the Soviet arms were  purchased by the West in the Near East, or that Polish products  got there through Cenzin [company licensed to transact arms  deals].    "Poland was a crevice in the Soviet arms," stated the Monday  [14 February] WASHINGTON POST, quoting anonymous intelligence  sources. "In the 1980's the United States purchased in Poland  the newest systems of the Soviet arms which they could not  obtain in any other manner. With the help of CIA, the Pentagon  tried to make such purchases in all the states of the former  Warsaw Pact, but the greatest number of arms was obtained in  Poland," claims the author of the article, Benjamin Weiser. The  weapons were bought for intelligence purposes -- the Americans  wanted to get an idea of how advanced Soviet military technology  was. They bought in Poland the newest Soviet air defense  systems, radars, helicopters, torpedoes, tanks, and  self-propelled guns; they paid for all this between $150 million  and $200 million.    According to Retired General Edward "Shy" Meyer, who  supervised the purchase program from 1979 to 1983, it was the  cheapest way to obtain the newest systems of the Soviet arms.    The Americans made the transactions by means of middlemen;  they paid money by means of letters of credits to bank accounts  in third countries. In the case of Poland, the money was sent to  Cenzin, which deals with the sale of arms. According to the  Washington daily, even though there is no direct evidence that  General...  <H5>  Wojciech Jaruzelski Was Involved in the Transactions </H5>   ...they had to be made with the tacit approval of the Polish  defense minister. There were too many transactions and they  always went off very smoothly, overcoming any bureaucratic  obstacles. This proves that the order was given up high, claims  the anonymous intelligence source of THE WASHINGTON POST.    General Wojciech Jaruzelski denied that such transactions  could actually happen; he called them "almost entirely  improbable" and risky. According to Jaruzelski, the Russians  guarded their newest arms systems which they had sold to Poland,  and the Polish Government would not have agreed that they be  sold to the United States. However, the general did not rule out  the possibility that the arms leaked to the United States  through third countries.    The CIA spokesman refused to make any comments; however,  other intelligence sources confirmed that in the 1980's Poland  was the greatest source of Soviet arms for the United States.    The Americans started this operation in late 1970s, when  they  bought moving anti-aircraft systems in Romania for $40 million.  The transaction was arranged by brothers of the dictatorial  Nicolae Ceausescu -- one of them was the Romanian defense  minister. CIA made its first purchase in Poland in early 1980s;  it paid between $20 million and $30 million for over 1,000 hand  anti-aircraft rockets which were later on given to... the Afghan  guerrillas (this was before they were equipped with the American  Stingers). Poland also sold the Americans anti-chemical  equipment, which was used by the Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan;  thanks to this the Americans knew what weapons were being used  there by the Russians. One of the main transactions came in  1987: the purchase, through the German Democratic Republic and  Czechoslovakia, of 12 T-72 tanks, which the Pentagon had not  been able to obtain in any way before. Another important  purchase was also the newest Soviet air-defense system, bought  by CIA at the time when power in Poland had already been taken  over by the Mazowiecki government, but Jaruzelski was the  president and MON was still controlled by the communists.    The arms, which later reached the United States, were often  supposed to be destined for Syria or Libya. It once happened  that officers met in Western Europe with CIA agents and  discussed the conditions of the transactions, writes THE  WASHINGTON POST. The daily claims that the main motive of the  Poles was either the desire to obtain hard currency, or perhaps  also the desire of some highly- placed employees of MON to  "protect themselves for the future."    The purchases that the Americans made in Poland were of  great  intelligence value for them. It is enough to say that after they  saw the details of the newest Soviet radars, they greatly  improved the "Stealth" technology, which made it possible for  them to build aircraft undetected by radars.    In the meantime, Colonel Marian Moraczewski, Polish military  attache in Washington, told the correspondent of RZECZPOSPOLITA  that he knows nothing about the transactions described in THE  WASHINGTON POST and that he has nothing to say about this  matter. "Perhaps Cenzin, as a trade company, made some kind of  transactions; however, it is very unlikely that this happened on  such a scale."    According to Colonel Moraczewski, the Polish Government  could not take part in such operations; these transactions, in  turn, were not possible if the government did not know about  them, because "the Defense Ministry is a highly centralized  structure." "The fuss that is being made about it is  unnecessary now," said Colonel Moraczewski; he added that such a  publication would certainly make Poland's eastern neighbors more  suspicious.    "No one knows anything certain in this matter,"  RZECZPOSPOLITA learned from its interlocutors, while trying to  obtain some comments on the publication in THE WASHINGTON POST.  <H5>  "We Can Only Speculate" </H5>   ...we were told by a high official connected to the  authorities in the 1980's, who wants to remain anonymous;  however, the entire affair seems improbable.    "This is total nonsense," RZECZPOSPOLITA learned from  General  Tadeusz Kusmierski, who fulfilled the function of the main  inspector of the technology of the Polish Army for some time  beginning in 1989. "I am just wondering who is interested in  advertising the affair and for what reasons. Nothing definitely  came out of the Polish Army; now, it is simply impossible to say  whether or not some arms were obtained by the West indirectly.  Foreign intelligence services use various methods. Never, I will  stress this word, never," said General Kusmierski, "did the  Soviet Union sell the newest weapons to Poland or to other  states of the Warsaw Pact. When we bought weapons from the  Soviet Union, we were always aware of the fact that we were  purchasing arms of an older generation and that the Soviet Union  had newer technology at its disposal. Now, what Poland was  manufacturing was no great revelation," he admitted. The former  MON employee told us that in the 1980's Poland had only one  company equipped with T-72 tanks; in general, it had only T-55  tanks at its disposal. Moreover, the rocket weaponry and combat  aircraft that Poland had were much more obsolete in comparison  with the Soviet Union.    All our interlocutors were unanimous in saying that the only  way that the Soviet arms could reach the United States was  through...  <H5>  The Original Sale of Them to Third Countries </H5>   According to our informers, there were two ways the West  could come into possession of the weapons used by the Polish  Army:    First: The intelligence services of a Western state, not  necessarily those of the United States, were able to skillfully  approach the proper Polish establishments. By presenting a  fictitious company, they, or rather the company, could argue  that the weaponry was needed by some independence organization,  some liberation movement in the Third World. In the opinion of  our interlocutor, it could have been then that the political  decision concerning the sale could be made. In such a case, only  Cenzin's predecessor and the military special services could  know about the possibility of exporting the arms.    The second possibility, which is considered to be the most  probable, is access to the Soviet and Polish weapons in  countries outside of Europe, mainly in the states of the Near  East. "The Americans had access," stated General Kusmierski, "to  Soviet weaponry mainly in Israel, Syria, and Egypt, where it was  left as a result of the warfare between Israel and Arabic  countries. Poland exported tanks and helicopters to Syria and  Libya. The former MON employee told us that the Near East and  India usually had more modern Soviet equipment than Poland did.    Wlodzimierz Lozinski, a close aide of Wojciech Jaruzelski  who  maintains contacts with him, as well as the interpreter during  the interview with the author of the text in the American daily,  remembers the general's statements very well. Jaruzelski assured  Weiser that he did not know anything about whether or not MON  gave anyone in the West any weapons or technical and  technological blueprints.    "However, in his interview for THE WASHINGTON POST, the  general did not rule out the possibility," we were told by  Lozinski, "that the weapons could be exported to third countries  and were intercepted by the Americans." In view of the fact  that the author of the article quotes CIA sources, it is  difficult to polemize with him.    MON Spokesman, Colonel Wieslaw Rozbicki told the television  "Wiadomosci" that the ministry had been taken aback by the  publication in THE WASHINGTON POST, and as a consequence, it was  not prepared to respond to the article. He does not say,  however, either "yes" or "no"; he must first verify everything.</p>

[passage omitted]    In regard to this incident, the Lebanese defense minister  said that this was not an act only against the Phalangist Party  but against Lebanon's security and tranquility as well. Almost  all the parties, groups, and personalities who condemned the  explosion agreed that this incident has threatened peace in  Lebanon and could lead to a fresh round of clashes from which  Lebanon had been free for some time. In 1975 after the  Phalangists' attack on a bus carrying Palestinians in 'Ayn  al-Rummanah region in Beirut, Lebanon became the scene of a  civil war that lasted for 15 years. This war, which put the  Phalangists on one side and Palestinian, national, and Islamic  groups on the other, paved the way for Syrian and Israeli  interventions in Lebanon, so much so that Israel attacked  Lebanon several times and ultimately occupied part of southern  Lebanon, which continues to be occupied by Israel and its allies.    The Syrian forces which came to Lebanon as peacekeeping  forces now control the pulse of the country's affairs, and the  Lebanese Government is unable to make any decisions without  their being confirmed and approved in Damascus. [passage omitted]    The explosion at the Phalangist Party headquarters has given  rise to the fear that the situation will once again change and  that clashes will once again resume precisely at a time when all  efforts are being aimed at preventing such clashes, since none  of the parties or groups want to see the situation return to  what it was before.</p>

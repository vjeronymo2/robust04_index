			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CHULA VISTA  </P> <P> Three Chula Vista banks were struck by two separate robbers, who made off with  an unknown amount of money, police said.  </P> <P> The robbers are suspected of committing four other Chula Vista bank robberies  in the last two weeks, netting $5,969, police said.  </P> <P> One of the suspects attempted to rob the Bank of America at 801 3rd Street at  12:53 p.m. Friday, but walked out of the building without any money, police  said.  </P> <P> "He walked out probably figuring that the gal had set off the alarm," said Sgt.  Richard Strickland. "He presented a note, got nervous and walked out."  </P> <P> The suspect, a stocky, 5-foot-6-inch Latino male weighing about 180 pounds and  wearing sunglasses, then struck the Household Bank at 599 Telegraph Canyon Road  at 1:09 p.m., making off with an unknown amount of cash, Strickland said.  </P> <P> The same suspect is thought to be responsible for two other Chula Vista bank  robberies, on Nov. 16 and 21, police said.  </P> <P> The other suspect, a 5-foot-10-inch white male weighing about 160 pounds, held  up the Great American Bank in the 4200 block of Bonita Road at 9:28 a.m.  Friday, Strickland said.  </P> <P> Police believe this suspect was involved in bank robberies Nov. 9 and 16.  </P> <P> In none of the instances was a weapon seen, Strickland said.  </P> <P> "It's been a long time since we've had two bank series going on at the same  time," Strickland said. "It's very unusual."  </P> <P> Strickland said the two suspects have so far confined themselves to robbing  banks in Chula Vista.  </P></p>

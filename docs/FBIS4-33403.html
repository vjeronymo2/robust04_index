			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The monthly PERU ECONOMICO [PE],  devoting its April issue to employment, said that employment  policy will be the central issue in the 1995 presidential  campaign, "no matter who the candidates are." The general public  calls unemployment the greatest problem facing the nation today  and is looking for a leader with solutions, according to PE.  Apoyo-owned PE speculated that unemployment ranks higher than  poverty because the solution to poverty is associated in the  public mind with social welfare programs. Peruvians today  "prefer a job with which to resolve the economic problems rather  than a handout." In addition to the primary focus on  unemployment, the composition of the presidential ticket will be  "much more important" than in the past. (In 1990 outsider  candidate Alberto Fujimori won the presidency on the strength of  his antipolitics stance and his commitment to restore civil  order by defeating the Shining Path [SL] and the Tupac Amaru  Revolutionary Movement.) PERU ECONOMICO predicted that the  candidates will run short campaigns "in order to avoid  overexposure."  <H5>  Stymied Jobs Creation </H5>   The labor reforms of recent years, which were intended to  improve competitiveness by reducing wage regulations and doing  away with collective bargaining have not led to any noticeable  increase in jobs. The reforms also caused a drastic downsizing  in the public sector: from 633,349 government employees in 1990  to 338,428 in 1993. Nor is the export sector expected to  generate any significant increase in jobs or wages in the  future, according to the April PERU ECONOMICO. The situation is  further exacerbated by the very large numbers of young people  entering the job market each year.    The labor unions have lost much of their clout and many of  their members as the reforms have encouraged individual  contracting, short-term employment, and modifications in wage  regulations with a system for compulsory saving.    The establishment of various mechanisms to reduce the cost  of  opening up new jobs, such as private pension funds and wage  reform, has not gone smoothly and the program to finance housing  (FOVI) has been suspended. Nor is there a timetable for starting  up private health organizations.   <H5>    Two Markets </H5>   According to the same issue of PERU ECONOMICO, creating more  flexible employer/employee relations and other "modernization"  attempts are only a partial solution to unemployment and lack of  competitiveness because the market has become divided into two  disparate segments: a formal market where the workers are  protected by labor laws and an informal market with no  protection. There are great differences in qualifications,  productivity, and wages in the two markets. In the informal  market there is not much chance of full-time employment or  upward mobility, nor is there any investment in human resources.    An expert consulted by PERU ECON0MICO is quoted as saying  that the government's strategy to modernize the labor market  will only affect the workers in "the most modern sector." They  would benefit from compulsory savings programs which will in  turn give them access to investment and credit. In the  traditional market, improvements could only occur through  increased foreign and domestic capital. The current reform does  not ensure that the unemployed or those in low-paying jobs will  benefit from economic growth. For that to happen there would  have to be a skills-training policy and incentives to invest in  human resources.  <H5>  Employment Numbers </H5>   PERU ECONOMTCO estimates that in metropolitan Lima the  underemployed (earning $135 per month) constitute 53 percent,  and those adequately employed ($341 per month) constitute 38  percent of the economically active population. The Lima sectors  with the greatest unemployment were mining (16 percent) and  construction (13 percent). Sectors providing the most adequate  employment were "nonpersonal services" (15 percent) and commerce  (14 percent). Age did not appear to be a factor.  <H5>  Poverty Rising </H5>   The monthly PERUPAZ in its April issue decries the Fujimori  government's failure to address the serious problem of poverty  and says that in spite of the economic successes the government  claims, its economic policy impedes any improvement in the  quality of life for most Peruvians. There is a disconnect, the  monthly contends, between Fujimori's economic policy and the  country's social needs. In 1992 the GNP dropped by 5 percent  from the preceding year to its lowest level in 15 years.    Studies by the Institute for Statistics and Data [INEI] show  "critical poverty" to have reached 53 percent of the population  by 1991, while "extreme poverty" rose to 21 percent.  <H5>  Urban Poverty </H5>   PERUPAZ says that "contrary to earlier decades," poverty now  exists also in the urban areas, and in particular in Lima, where  a full one-third of those in critical poverty live.    Thirty-three percent of the economically active population  of  Peru live in Lima. In 1989-1990 salaries and wages shrank by 13  and 16.8 percent respectively. The downhill trend continued for  the period 1990-1992: The number of underemployed went from 86.4  to 88.1 percent of the population and the number of unemployed  from 8.3 to 10 percent.    Nationally, underemployment decreased slightly--from 79 to  76  percent in 1991-1992, while unemployment went from 5.9 to 9.9  percent.  <H5>  Rural Poverty </H5>   The majority of the poor live in the rural and mountain  areas  of the country where income is extremely low and there is rarely  any access to basic health services, education, adequate  nutrition, and sanitation.    The INEI study of 1991 showed that in the rural areas of the  Sierra only 43 percent of the homes had drinking water (inside  or outside), and only 14 percent had sewage. Thirty-one percent  of the homes had electricity.  <H5>  Diseases </H5>   Diseases previously considered under control have reemerged:  malaria, tuberculosis, cholera, facial ulcers. Mortality rates  for children under the age of five did decline from 97 per  thousand in 1978 to 76 per thousand in 1991 according to INEI,  but Peru continues to have one of the highest infant mortality  rates in South America.  <H5>  Governability Questioned </H5>   PERUPAZ concludes that the government has failed to address  the problems of the poor, "who have become the majority." The  periodical calls for a vigorous social policy and an economic  policy congruent with the social necessities, saying that a key  factor will be stimulating agricultural production. PERUPAZ  warns that if the social issue is not addressed, it is "not  optimistic about the outlook for governable conditions in Peru."  <H5>  Steady Trend </H5>   Opinion polls over the past several months done by Apoyo,  Imasen, etc., have consistently shown former UN Secretary  General Javier Perez de Cuellar leading President Alberto  Fujimori in a two-way race, with the former enjoying greater  support in the country's interior. The polls also consistently  show that Fujimori would have a clear lead over the other  frequently mentioned potential candidates, Lima Mayor Ricardo  Belmont, former President Fernando Belaunde Terry, and former  Arequipa Mayor Luis Caceres (to date, only Belmont has declared  his candidacy).  <H5>  Vice Presidential Factor </H5>   In its April issue PERU ECONOMICO says the vice presidential  candidates will be a significant factor: National Police  Inspector General Antonio Ketin Vidal "could bring a lot of  votes." (Vidal is credited with the October 1992 capture of SL  founder and leader Abimael Guzman.) PE does not rule out a  surprise candidate, much like Fujimori in 1990, and notes that  there are other potential candidates, waiting for a "propitious  opportunity," prominent among them former Prime Minister Juan  Carlos Hurtado Miller.  <H5>  Fujimori Versus de Cuellar </H5>   PERU ECONOMICO concurs with the widely held view that Perez  de Cuellar's strength is his international stature and his  weakness is his decades-long absence from Peru. PE quotes an  unnamed "leading" politician with "many victories" as saying  "this product [de Cuellar] is not particularly marketable in the  sierra."    Fujimori's strength, successfully controlling subversion and  inflation, puts him in a "paradoxical situation" in that the  public sees him as a successful president, but not as a good  candidate. The country today has a sense of order; two years ago  "no one would have predicted that Shining Path would today be in  the process of disappearing," PE asserts.    Fujimori projects an authoritarian image and is perceived as  lacking any vision "beyond establishing order," according to PE,  which adds that the "general requirement" for more peaceful  times will be a leader who carries on a dialogue and is a  consensus builder. According to a poll published in the  Apoyo-owned weekly 24 April SEMANA ECONOMICA, 64 percent of the  interviewees believe the next president should be a consensus  builder and only 29 percent want an authoritarian president. The  number of respondents in the poll, conducted in Lima and "eight  other cities" was not given.  <H5>  April Apoyo Polls </H5>   The April Apoyo polls published in PERU ECONOMICO showed  that  a majority thought Fujimori's "self-coup" of April 1992 had led  to an improvement in the areas of terrorism, inflation,  corruption, and narcotics trafficking. A majority believed that  the nation's main problems are unemployment, poverty, nutrition,  education, and cost of living. The poll was conducted in Lima  and eight provincial capitals across socioeconomic groups. The  number of respondents was not given.  <H5>  Intelligence Service Poll </H5>   According to the weekly Sl [2-8 May] citing unnamed  "sources," President Fujimori ordered the National Intelligence  Service [SIN] to conduct a poll to check whether the  private-sector opinion pollsters' figures on the president's  reelectability were correct.    The findings of the SIN: Fujimori enjoyed a 72-percent  popularity rate ("6-8 percent more" than in the other polls); in  a two-way race, Fujimori would get 55 percent over de Cuellar's  35 percent; in a two-way race against Belmont, Fujimori would  get 52 percent to Belmont's 38. If the two vice presidential  candidates were Congressional President Jaime Yoshiyama and  Congressional Vice President Victor Joy Way (both of Asian  descent) only 3 percent would vote for the three-person ticket  while 90 percent would not, reputedly saying "that's a lot of  Chinamen." Asked if there should be a woman on the ticket, 77  percent said yes, 10 percent no. The majority wanted to see the  female candidate in the slot of second vice president.    SI reports that Fujimori is now looking at former Prime  Minister Hurtado Miller and National Police Inspector General  Ketin Vidal as vice presidential mates, but is also considering  Congresswomen Martha Chavez and Luz Salgado, both of New  Majority-Change `90.    According to the sources, 25 SIN officers were sent out to  "all parts of Lima" to interview 1,200 people, ranging in age  from 22 to 50.</p>

			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SAN CLEMENTE, DISTRICT ARE AT ODDS OVER MISSING WATER  </P> <P> Where did all the water go?  </P> <P> That's what San Clemente Utilities Director Greg Morehead wants to know.  </P> <P> According to figures compiled by Morehead, the Tri-Cities Municipal Water  District's reservoir inexplicably continued to decline during the water  shortage earlier this summer even as San Clemente residents were voluntarily  conserving millions of gallons.  </P> <P> So, at a district board meeting this week, Morehead raised the question, only  to have water officials in turn question his figures.  </P> <P> Water officials said that Morehead was wrong and that no water was missing.  Tri-Cities board member James Lawson accused Morehead of "trying to point a  finger at some other user." Lawson said that San Clemente is Tri-Cities'  biggest user and that any conservation in the city would be reflected in  overall water availability.  </P> <P> Morehead, however, said that Tri-Cities' reservoir readings show that its water  level continued to dip precariously in August even as San Clemente's utility  meters were showing sharp cutbacks in water use by residents.  </P> <P> Morehead said the August water "mystery" has current relevance. He said San  Clemente city government cannot plan for emergency water rationing in the  future if "there is incomplete information" about where available water is  being consumed.  </P> <P> San Clemente's City Council last month deferred action on a proposed  water-rationing law, saying that an emergency situation no longer existed. The  Tri-Cities board, at its Wednesday meeting, criticized the council for not  acting on that water-rationing measure and said it is still needed.  </P> <P> According to Tri-Cities, San Clemente accounts for two-thirds of the district's  water consumption. The other users served by the water district, which is  managed by an independently elected board of directors, are Capistrano Beach  (now a part of Dana Point), the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station and San  Onofre State Park.  </P> <P> "Your figures would defy the laws of physics," Lawson told Morehead at the  meeting. Lawson said that if San Clemente conserved as much water as Morehead  contended, the conservation would be felt by Tri-Cities.  </P> <P> Morehead, however, said: "I don't believe you have sufficient data. You don't  know what the other users are using on a daily basis."  </P> <P> Ray Woodside, general manager of the water district, conceded that the district  did not have daily consumption figures from the other three users. But Woodside  said he believed that overall consumption during the water shortage remained  about the same, with San Clemente still accounting for two-thirds of the usage.  </P> <P> Lawson said, "I think it's pretty clear, Mr. Morehead, that you're suggesting  that San Clemente is not responsible for the drop in the reservoir" during the  July-August water shortage.  </P> <P> Morehead responded, "I'm saying that if San Clemente residents decrease water  use by 500,000 gallons, then that 500,000 gallons ought to show up in the  (Tri-Cities) reservoir." He added that the city cutbacks and reservoir levels  showed no such correlation.  </P> <P> Dennis Erdman, president of the water board, said after the meeting that the  discrepancy might be explained by intermediate water-holding areas used by San  Clemente. Erdman said San Clemente has its own water-holding areas, and that  these, like the Tri-Cities reservoir, decreased during the water shortage.  </P> <P> "I believe the city's water-holding places probably increased during the water  conservation, and the increase would be reflected there while not necessarily  at our reservoir," Erdman said.  </P></p>

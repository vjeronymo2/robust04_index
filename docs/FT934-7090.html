			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Nigerian report attacks leakage in state funds A confidential report for Nigeria's deposed civilian leader attacks widespread leakages in state funds and urges an investigation into Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) of oil receipts paid into special project accounts in the first half of this year. The report also reveals that the mid-year limit for this year's national budget has been overshot, with the deficit reaching N26bn, far in excess of the N15.6bn target and little short of the N31.1bn deficit approved for the full 12 months. It also warns of 'huge' defence ministry debts. The disclosures come as Britain and its Western European Union partners meet in Luxembourg today to consider sanctions against Nigeria's new military government. The 60-page document, 'Final Report of the Budget Monitoring Committee', was commissioned earlier this year by Chief Ernest Shonekan, civilian leader of the military-backed interim government. He was forced to resign last week by General Sani Abacha, the defence minister who is now the new head of state. The report, handed to Mr Shonekan on August 24, criticises 'leakages' of state funds, condemns unviable multi-billion dollar projects, and shows up mismanagement and uncontrolled state spending under Gen Ibrahim Babangida, who stepped down last August. Western diplomats and aid officials, who gave access to the report, say that the committee's efforts to make government spending more transparent and to ensure independent audit of the operations of the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) were largely frustrated by the country's generals. The military feared exposure of the corruption that pervades the political system, they said. In the first half of this year, says the report, oil sales worth 'a total sum of Dollars 1.537bn was paid into various dedicated accounts'. The committee complains it 'was unable to have access to detailed information on the operation of these accounts', set up under Gen Babangida to meet the foreign exchange costs of projects such as a proposed liquefied natural gas plant. The committee advocates 'a clearly defined reporting process' for revenue earning agencies, 'particularly' for the NNPC 'so that the reason for the large shortfalls in revenue' in the first half of the year 'can be identified and leakages blocked'. The report expresses concern about 'non-payment of revenue of N1.1bn expected from the sale of domestic crude oil lifted and refined by NNPC for local consumption' in the first six months of this year. The report notes that the ministry of defence has 'accumulated huge debts which government is not in a financial position to honour at the moment' and criticises the 'considerable cost of keeping procured weapons in warehouses abroad'.</p>

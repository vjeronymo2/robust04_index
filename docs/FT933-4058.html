			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Cutting the cost of colour printing With the proliferation of colour PCs and software has grown the demand for colour printing. But colour printers have been too expensive for many businesses. QMS, of Mobile, Alabama, has launched a departmental desk-top colour laser printer for less than Pounds 10,000. The company has reduced the size and cost of the machine by replacing the multiple marking engines - one for each colour ink - with a single unit. In the Laser 1000 a belt circulates to pick up the ink from the four separate hoppers and deliver it to the marking engine. This is then transferred to the drum and on to the paper. The Laser 1000 will print two pages of colour documentation a minute at the cost of at least 5p per page. QMS: US, 205 633 4300; UK, 0784 430900.</p>

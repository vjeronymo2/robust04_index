			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Technology: Lost in space - The competitive nature of the satellite launch market Conditions were perfect for the launch. The rocket boosters ignited, and executives of General Dynamics, the launcher manufacturer, cheered and slapped backs as the distant glow was followed by a gathering roar. The US's second largest defence group had more than the Dollars 150m (Pounds 83m) cost of the satellite launch to worry about. General Dynamics' commercial programme has been beset by problems culminating in the abortive launch of a Japanese TV satellite in April. A second failure would be a blow to a company fighting for share in an increasingly competitive market. Despite problems 15 minutes into the launch, the satellite is now in orbit. Each successful launch - on this occasion of a satellite for the European operator, Eutelsat - reinforces the launchers' credibility in a market where reliability is a principal component. Failures are as spectacular as they are costly and the US has been rebuilding its launch operations since its expensive, and ultimately tragic, decision to re-use the Challenger launch vehicle, which exploded in 1986. Spurring the US effort has been the decline in orders from Washington for government and military satellites, which have been the bulk suppliers to domestic launchers General Dynamics, Martin Marietta and McDonnell Douglas. All have been eyeing the Dollars 2bn-a-year commercial market with increasing interest. So too have the fledgling commercial satellite nations China and Russia, with Japan also declaring a limited interest. The leader, with about 60 per cent of the commercial market, is Arianespace. It is owned by the French authorities and a consortium of 11 European countries. However, as the American record on reliability and safety has been restored over the last five years, its challenge has grown. Ramin Khadem, finance and administrative manager for Inmarsat, which has just invited bids for launching its new series of communications satellites, says: 'The reliability of the launch vehicle and the track record of the launcher have always been of the utmost importance. But with the US and the Europeans both having good performances, the issue of price is now becoming the focus.' Price is a contentious subject among the launchers. Charles Bigot, chairman of Arianespace, says: 'General Dynamics continues to reduce its prices and we feel that it is not normal. If you compare the GD price for the Intelsat-2 launch two years ago, today they are quoting prices 25 per cent less. It is like dumping. We do not think that it is good for the market to reduce prices without proper commercial reason.' Bigot claims financial aid from Washington underpins the GD policy. 'US government orders mean they can subsidise their commercial launches.' This would not be so bad, says Bigot, if Arianespace were allowed to bid for US government satellites. But Jack Isabel, GD information manager, cites a Dollars 400m capital programme as evidence of GD's independent financial commitment. He, in turn, accuses Arianespace of having a head-start. 'They have the advantage over us in that all their non-recurring costs are paid for by the European Space Agency.' The pricing dispute and access to the US market are now the subject of discussion at ministerial level between the EC, France, Germany and Washington. They are also debating a common policy towards China and Russia, which are making desperate bids to gain market access. One leading satellite operator who recently invited bids for a 1994 launch said that Russia offered to launch for around half the cost of Arianespace, while China had come in at about a third of that price. Moreover, Roy Gibson, head of the British Space Centre, says that China offered to launch a new series of British mini-satellites for nothing in order to gain experience. Perhaps not surprisingly, the US is presently refusing to allow either country entry to the market, citing the Cocom rules on the export of high technology to the former eastern bloc and Communist countries as the reason. It is, however, looking increasingly friendly towards allowing a Russian launch. 'We do not regard the threat from Russia and China as serious,' says Bigot. 'You want to be able to launch a satellite safely, reliably, on time and at the right price. Can they achieve these criteria? I do not think so. The Chinese will offer any price. With the Russians it is more difficult to say: who knows what their capability will be in, say, 1995? But, I still do not think they are a serious threat, mainly because they do not know enough.' Meanwhile, both Arianespace and GD are developing new launch vehicles and trimming costs. GD has four commercial launches confirmed for this year and hopes to announce others shortly. It also has 32 government orders over the next five years. Arianespace expects to launch nine rockets during 1992 carrying between 10 and 12 satellites, following on from the eight launched in 1991. From this, Arianespace expects to show a net profit in 1991 slightly higher than 1990's FFr135.4m (Pounds 13.85m) on turnover of FFr5.8bn. The consortium had orders to launch a further 21 satellites, worth FFr10bn on its books. Whether such a healthy state of affairs will continue remains to be seen. On the plus side, demand for satellite launches is rising with developing nations seeking to enter the operating market. Recently, Arianespace signed a contract with Thailand and is negotiating launches with Malaysia and South Korea. However, the biggest smile seems to be on the face of the operators. Khadem says: 'We very much welcome new suppliers in the launch market. The launch vehicle is a big element in our costs, and if new competition helps drive down costs that can only be good for our customers.'</p>

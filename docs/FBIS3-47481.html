According to their budget-drafting schedule, the ruling  coalition will work out guidelines on February 3 for compilation  of the budget and tax reforms for fiscal 1994, starting in April.    Based on this, on February 5 the Finance Ministry will  announce its budgetary plan, which is likely to be adopted as a  government proposal with few changes on February 10, just in  time for the summit meeting in Washington between Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton.    Government sources said the biggest point for debate will be  how to finance a planned reduction in the income tax.    The Social Democratic Party [of Japan], an important force  in  the coalition, has been opposed to raising the current 3 percent  consumption tax rate to offset the income tax cut, an idea  pushed by the Finance Ministry.</p>

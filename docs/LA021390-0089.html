			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: A'S CANSECO SETTLES FOR $2-MILLION DEAL  </P> <P> Jose Canseco agreed Monday to a one-year, $2-million contract with the Oakland  Athletics, a $400,000 raise over last season but well shy of the huge totals  other superstars have received this winter.  </P> <P> The right fielder was scheduled to have an arbitration hearing on Wednesday. He  wanted $2.2 million and the A's offered $1.6 million, same as last season.  </P> <P> Second baseman Mike Gallego also avoided arbitration by agreeing to a two-year,  $1,065,000 contract. He'll get $475,000 this year, $540,000 in 1991 and a  $50,000 signing bonus. Mark McGwire, whose hearing is set for Friday, is the  only player left on the A's arbitration list.  </P></p>

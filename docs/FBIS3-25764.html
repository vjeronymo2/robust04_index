			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Z.B. du Toit] </F>   [Text] In a scorching open letter on Friday [25 February]  General Constand Viljoen accused the state president, Mr. F.W.  de Klerk, of giving "strange advice": "You expect of me,  through a split, to bring a part of the Afrikaner with me and to  forget about the others -- like you did using the vague slogan,  reform -- when you tried to lead your followers into a situation  of which you have quickly lost control." General Viljoen  compares President de Klerk's actions to that of a "poor actor"  trying, in a "one-man show" [preceding two words in English],  "to regain support lost among his own people from other  communities."    This letter was in reaction to a challenge by President de  Klerk on Wednesday at Postmasburg for General Viljoen to have  the courage of his conviction and to do his duty by assuring  that the "reasonable majority" of the Volksfront [National Front  -- AVF] participates in the election.  <H5>  Shocking Tone </H5>   Yesterday, in a written reply President de Klerk expressed  his shock at the tone of Gen. Viljoen's open letter: "Malicious  intent, personal insults, belittling of political opponents, and  spite does not become you. This diminishes the good image so  many South Africans have of you." In his letter Gen. Viljoen  says: "Important components of the South African electorate,  the Zulus, the Tswanas, and the Boers had to hear that they had  missed the train.    "In endless bilateral and trilateral talks they are taken  from deadline to deadline, facing the arrogance of those `high  up' who will `meet them' somewhere possible, like waiting at  some side station for a train where you decide the time of  arrival, and where they just have to fit in, whether or not  their demands have been met. Where the people do not accept  your concessions they are branded as `spoilers'."    To this President de Klerk replies: "You lump together the  Zulus, the Tswanas, and the Afrikaners as if they all share the  same viewpoint. Nothing is further removed from the truth than  this. Also, I am convinced that a majority in each of these  three groups reject your viewpoint. As far as Afrikaners are  concerned this has already been proven in two elections and two  referendums."    On the volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] Gen. Viljoen writes:  "For this reason we asked: Give us a homeland before 27 April  which would eventually house the larger portion of our people.  When you and the ANC [African National Congress] refused, we  asked: Give us the necessary constitutional guarantees so that  we can get our homeland if we pass the necessary test to prove  support for this homeland. However, in this regard we must have  absolute certainty. As far as this issue is concerned I must say  that we received more understanding from the ANC than from you  and your party."    To this Mr. de Klerk replies: "You are looking for an  Afrikaner homeland with majority rule. Where would the borders  for such a homeland be drawn in order to achieve your goal?  Will all South African citizens, despite race or color, enjoy  full political rights within those borders? Can you give the  assurance that there will be no form of discrimination on the  grounds of race or color in such a region? During our numerous  discussions you have never succeeded in giving a sensible or  convincing answer on this issue."    General Viljoen takes the president to task for the  "revolutionary climate which developed under your leadership  because you have lost control. They (the Afrikaners) do not  share your bravado because they know that a simple one man one  vote system will result in them losing permanent control over  their futures."    In President de Klerk's reply he refers to the "clear  framework" being created in the constitution "for the promotion  of a homeland and self-determination, linked to a certain  territory. This is the strategic option you have asked for."  President de Klerk repeats his Postmasburg plea and renews his  call to Gen. Viljoen not to allow himself to be "dragged along  by the wild elements of the National Front who ... have already  decided on resistance, rebellion, and protest."    In what appears to be a direct reference to Gen. Viljoen's  letter, President de Klerk said yesterday at The Strand: "If  Gen. Viljoen wants to speak to me on Monday then my door is open  to him. Each of the amendments to be made to the constitution  this week is no gimmick, but addresses the fears of the Freedom  Alliance in a practical manner."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Fear of Responsibility `Abolishes' </F> the Chetniks"]    [Text] "An attempt has been executed to assassinate an  organization that served as a basis for the founding of the  Serbian Radical Party [SRS] and later became the backbone of the  party, from which the self-abolished chetnik duke rose to the  very top of Serbian policy," reads the statement of the SRS  branches for Montenegro and Serbia, issued in reaction to  [Vojislav] Seselj's Radicals' decision to abolish and disband  the Serbian chetnik movement.    Dr. Seselj, acting according to the "abracadabra" principle,  is attempting yet another double political somersault aimed at  achieving a change in the course of events on the Serbian  political scene and baffling the public. However, he will not  succeed. Actually, he cannot succeed, because the Serbian people  have passed the test of political maturity. These people no  longer accept the reheated lies and deceptions packaged in a  national wrapping [sentence as published].    At a moment when the recent chetnik duke, who has never  smelled gunpowder, is losing his reputation and trust among the  Serbian people and the Serbian Radicals, it seems that he has  also lost his patience.    It seems that he wishes to forget that a great many of these  patriots and volunteers were sent to the front without any  military training, and that they were led by officers that he  [Seselj] appointed, who did not have the necessary military  knowledge or experience, which resulted in a great number of  deaths and injuries.    Due to fear of responsibility, the chetnik duke is erasing  the chetniks from his political life. He probably thinks that  by erasing files, he can also erase human memory.    The duke has forgotten that he just recently appointed 20  chetnik dukes. With these appointments, considering some of the  people from the ranks of the new dukes, Seselj has publicly made  a laughing stock of the highest chivalrous and spiritual  attainment that the Serbs have reserved for their historical  dukes.    If Mr. Seselj is not ashamed of his actions before the  domestic and foreign public and the thousands of members of the  chetnik movement, he should be ashamed before the dead Serbian  patriots, disabled veterans, war orphans, and the Serbian  mothers and sisters shrouded in black.    The Serbian Radicals from Montenegro and the Serbian  Radicals, even though they believe that political parties do not  have the right to claim the chetnik movement, will never  renounce this national and patriotic organization of the Serbian  people, ends the statement of the two parties signed by Radovan  Bukcevic and Zvezdan Babovic.</p>

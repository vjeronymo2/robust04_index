			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Ready demand for LWT CONVERSION of LWT stock into ordinary shares brought the widely predicted flurry of selling from the company's senior management. Nearly 10m shares were traded as executives took their first opportunity to exercise options taken up as part of the company's successful franchise bid in 1991. Around 4m shares, or 3.78 per cent of the company's new share base, were placed with institutional investors at 458p by Cazenove. There was also speculation that Granada Group would be returning to the market after seeing its 20 per cent stake diluted by yesterday's con-version exercise. Granada, which paid around 500p a share in building up its stake in July, now has a 17.5 per cent holding. The first trade in the ordinary LWT shares was struck at 405p, but the stock soon picked up and eventually closed at 465p, its closing convertible price on Friday.</p>

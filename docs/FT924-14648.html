			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / US carriers seek delay in British air deal THE three largest US airlines have told the Bush administration that British Airways should only be allowed to complete its proposed Dollars 750m investment in Virginia-based USAir once an 'open skies' regime between the US and the UK is fully operational. The airlines' latest position is set out in a letter to Mr Jeffrey Shane, US assistant secretary of transportation for policy and international aviation. It comes as talks between the UK and US governments have just restarted in Washington over possible revisions to the bilateral agreement which governs aviation arrangements between the two countries. The airlines - American, United and Delta, with Federal Express, the largest overnight package delivery company - say they 'were advised that the administration's goal. . . in the discussions is to obtain a commitment for a phased-in open skies regime over a yet to be defined timetable.' But, they continue: 'If a 'phase-in' to full 'open skies' is the only avenue available, the US must ensure that the BA-USAir transaction can be implemented in full no earlier than the completion of the 'phase-in'. The US must maintain this leverage to protect its vital trade interests.'</p>

			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DROUGHT DRAINS POPPY PRESERVE OF ITS BLOOM  </P> <P> If you are thinking about packing a picnic lunch and spending the day amid a  brilliant display of orange poppies in the Antelope Valley -- think again.  </P> <P> For the second year in a row, the poppy season has been a disappointment, said  Bob McAdams, the ranger at the state's Antelope Valley California Poppy  Reserve.  </P> <P> A lack of rain once again kept most of the orange poppies from blooming on the  parched hills of the 1,740-acre preserve 13 miles west of Lancaster.  </P> <P> "We can cry and groan and moan and it won't change the situation," McAdams  said.  </P> <P> The last time the poppies carpeted the hills in a blaze of color was in 1988  when the desert received almost 12 inches of rain. By comparison, only 4.2  inches fell this winter.  </P> <P> Preserve workers are telling the hundreds of people who call from around the  state that this year's flower harvest is "poor to light."  </P> <P> "I don't want to entice people to drive hundreds of miles to something they  will be disappointed in seeing," McAdams said.  </P> <P> The Lancaster Chamber of Commerce is giving callers the same bleak message.  </P> <P> Although many will stay away, that probably won't harm the area's economy  because most visitors bring picnic lunches and leave by dark anyway, said  Connie Wilson, a chamber spokeswoman.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, on April 1 -- the first big Sunday of the season -- more than  3,000 people arrived, many with cameras, to look at the poppies.  </P> <P> Some complained, but the visitors are in a good mood compared to those who came  two years ago after reading a newspaper article. The Los Angeles Times reported  that the hills were covered with gorgeous blossoms, but the story wasn't  published until most of the flowers had disappeared, McAdams said.  </P> <P> The best poppy viewing this year is along Lancaster Road between Munz Ranch  Road and the reserve, McAdams said.  </P> <P> The ranger was philosophical about the flowers' poor showing this year.  </P> <P> "If the drought doesn't break," he said, "we're going to be worried about more  than flowers."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by the Civic Alliance; place and date not given: </F> "Recent Amendments"]    [Text] The Civic Alliance and the Association for Free and  Correct Information via Radio and Television draw attention to  the executive power's attempt to legally place the public  audiovisual media under its jurisdiction.    The introduction, at the last moment, of a set of amendments  by the parliamentary group of the Social Democracy Party of  Romania [PDSR], after the draft bill had been worked on for a  long time by the specialized commission of the Chamber of  Deputies, testifies to an attempt to either delay the  legislation process or (if the amendments would be accepted by  the plenary session of the Chamber of Deputies) to the desire to  totally and effectively acquire these two public services --  radio and television.    Not only because of certain provisions that limit the  independence of the radio and television and their staff but  also through procedures proposed for the appointment of the  Consultative Council, the Management Boards and their chairmen  (by the government and the presidency respectively), the PDSR  amendments violate the principles stipulated by any democratic  audio-visual law, including the recommendations made to our  country by the Council of Europe.    Bucharest, 2 February 1994</p>

			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Hongkong Bank bombed again MORE THAN 300 of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's 600 staff in London are expected to be at work today in different buildings, after the bank yesterday hastily re-allocated most of the work carried out at its Bishopsgate branch. Hongkong Bank, a subsidiary of HSBC Holdings, said the most severe disruption would be through the loss of paper files. Papers such as letters of credit dating back three months were scattered and destroyed in the blast. The bank was yesterday allowed to send managers into its office to retrieve computer data. It will today start re-running the data from a processing centre in Sheffield owned by Midland Bank, another HSBC Holdings subsidiary. The bank said most of its offices inside the Bishopsgate building transferred their paper files to microfilm after three months, but customers with more recent dealings could suffer disruption. The bank had to spend Pounds 600,000, largely replacing windows, to repair damage to the same building caused by the IRA bomb that blew up the Baltic Exchange a year ago. However, the damage this time was far more severe. Sir William Purves, HSBC Group chairman, said the Hongkong Bank branch in Bishopsgate, which concentrates on trade finance and corporate banking, was 'a relatively small branch' but was still the main one for the bank in Britain. In Hong Kong, Sir William said: 'It is fair to say that the computer is out and that the building is in a bad state. The water pipes were broken and water is flowing through the building and it has no power.' Hongkong Bank occupied eight of the 26 floors in the tower, which was opened 18 years ago. It had just moved its treasury operations to an office on Lower Thames Street in which its trading operations are merged with Midland. Hongkong Bank said that the main banking and trade finance operations of the bank would be relocated to spare office space at HSBC Holdings' head office in Lower Thames Street, and an adjacent Midland Bank data processing building. Its corporate finance and property services functions would be moved to an office in Devonshire Square where it carries out asset management functions and the fund management side of its James Capel subsidiary. The bank's vaults on the lower ground floor are thought to have remained intact, in spite of the collapse of some lower level floors. They hold all valuable documents such as securities. Hongkong Bank said it would have no clear idea of the damage to the building and whether it could be salvaged until it was allowed back in by the authorities, which it expected could be 'a matter of weeks rather than days'.</p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brighter prospects seen for silver SILVER SHOULD benefit from the present positive sentiment in the gold market, according to the American Precious Metals Advisors consultancy organisation. It suggests silver's price this year should average more than USDollars 4 a troy ounce and reach Dollars 4.40 to Dollars 4.60 by the year-end compared with Dollars 3.95 in 1992. 'Psychology is particularly important for silver because of the large stocks of this metal that overhang the market and the readiness of holders to part with silver,' says Mr Jeffrey Nichols, president of APMA, in his latest MetalsFax publication. He suggests that liquid silver stocks may amount to 2bn ounces in North America and western Europe - enough to satisfy demand for more than three years - and many investors, particularly those in the US, bought their metal at prices well above the present levels. 'Years of persistently declining prices have made it especially difficult for silver to manage a sustainable recovery because many holders at first will use any rally as an opportunity to unload,' he adds. APMA believes the silver market will see its fourth annual supply deficit in 1993 with demand outpacing production by nearly 81m ounces. This compares with a 1992 deficit of 46m ounces. Fabrication demand is forecast to rise from 574m to 580m ounces mainly because of record usage by the photographic industry, already the biggest user of silver. APMA forecasts the photographic industry, spurred on by the lowest real silver prices since the early 1970s and growth in picture-taking in the emerging industrial countries, will use 210m ounces in 1993, up from 207m in each of the past two years. APMA predicts a recovery in Indian imports following liberalisation of government regulations so that non-residents can take 3,200 ounces of silver into the country,subject to a 50 cents-an-ounce duty. Mr Nichols points out that between 75 and 80 per cent of silver is mined as a by-product of other metal mining. He predicts mine production this year outside the former eastern bloc countries is likely to fall by 8m ounces from the 1992 level to 352m ounces. Supplies of secondary or scrap silver are also expected to fall, from 196m to 194m ounces.

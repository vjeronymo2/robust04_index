			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A newly formed bloc of the Communist Party of the  Philippines (CPP) yesterday unveiled a program that rejects the  leading role of communists in the insurgent war against the  government, the CHRONICLE has learned.    The group, which broke from the Maoist-oriented CPP, has  been  holding a series of preparatory meetings for the formal  launching of "Siglaya [Siglo ng Paglaya -- Century of  Independence]" in the middle of May, according to a leader of  the group who spoke to the CHRONICLE.    As agreed upon by the preparatory committee, the group shall  be an "open and legal organization."    The committee for the founding congress in May includes  civic  leaders Liddy Nacpil-Alejandro, Ben Moraleda, Etta Rosales, Noel  Medina, peasant leader Jaime Tadeo, labor leader Robert Galvez  who represents the Ilaw at Buklod ng Manggagawa [Ilaw --  expansion unknown; and Workers Union], and scholar Joel Rocamora.    Ricardo Reyes, whom the military has identified as the  former  secretary general of the CPP, is one of the leaders group  principally assigned to draft the program.    The Siglaya leader also said a top-ranking Catholic  religious  leader has joined them but he requested the CHRONICLE not to  publish his name.    In a 15-page manifesto, the group lined up a 10-point  program  that one of its leaders said sets it apart from the mainstream  CPP and a breakaway group of some Metro Manila-based cadres and  members.    Among its goals are:    -- Aspire for national independence from imperialist control  and uphold the sovereign control over the country's national  life, politics, and culture.    -- Work to end the political control of "imperialists and  big  landlords and bureaucrat capitalists."    -- Establish a people's democratic state, uphold democratic  rights, civil liberties, human rights and other social rights  like the right to strike. It shall uphold the rights of the  minorities.    -- Work to make capital for agriculture available to  peasants, push for rural cooperatives, work to modernize  agriculture, and to ensure food security.    -- Work for a comprehensive and progressive policy for  social  welfare.    -- Uphold a culture that stresses patriotism, national  unity,  scientific and critical attitude, democratic ethics; respect for  the gender, religion and beliefs, race and color, and other free  thinking; a patriotic, scientific, critical, and liberating  education for the Filipino youth.    -- Uphold the rights of the Bangsa Moro people, people of  Cordillera at the national minorities for self-determination.    -- Oppose the destruction of the environment, defense of the  source of life, democratization in the exploitation of natural  resources.    -- Work for the equality of the sexes and the freedom of  women from a patriarchal system.    -- Adopt an independent foreign policy. Establish diplomatic  relations with all countries regardless of ideology and social  system.    Rejecting the vanguard role of the CPP in the insurgency,  Siglaya said it shall uphold empowerment in its political work.    Empowerment, Siglaya said, "is not only an aspiration as a  platform for change. According to the group, this principle  will start today, in spirit, in our ethics, in every process and  conduct, in the whole political and organization life of the  newly born movement."    According to the Siglaya leader, the new movement will rely  on several organizations for its mass base and shall not dictate  upon these organizations.    He said the new movement shall not take a confrontational  attitude towards the party led by Jose Ma. Sison. "Instead, we  shall let the masses decide which is the more viable political  program," the leader said.    Asked about the group of Metro Manila-based communists who  broke from Sison, the Siglaya leader said the Metro group led by  one Carlos Forte has yet to come up with a program.    "We hope the group finishes its draft so that the people can  decide on what program is the best," he said. Although Forte's  group has openly criticized Sison, it has yet to come up with  its program.    Asked to elaborate on its differences with the Sison group,  the Siglaya leader said he could identify at least three areas  where the new group differs with Sison.    One of these, he said, was on the ideological framework. He  said that while Sison has adopted the Maoist framework, the new  group draws its inspiration from the writings on early Marx.    He explained that the early Marx was a humane Marx who  stressed the need to uphold the rights and prerogatives of the  individual.    On the other hand, he said, the Program of the People's  Democratic Revolution adopted by Sison's CPP puts premium on the  rights of the state and the party over the individual.    On the method of grabbing power, the new group will utilize  all forms of struggle including elections, lobbying, and mass  mobilizations. "We are also open to armed struggle, but it  shall be on a case-to-case basis," said the Siglaya leader.    Sison's group, on the other hand, has a very clear stand on  the seizure of state power, and that is to destroy by armed  means the machinery of the state and installing a national  democratic state.    The Siglaya leader, however, said the new movement agrees  with Sison on the need to install a "national democratic state"  as a transition to a socialist goal.</p>

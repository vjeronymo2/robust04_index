			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: Opel to post 'clear' loss for year Adam Opel, the German subsidiary of General Motors of the US, said yesterday it was 'impossible to avoid a clear loss' for 1993, AP-DJ reports from Frankfurt. The company said it was confident it would return to profitability in 1994. In 1992 Opel reported a net profit of DM202m (Dollars 116m). The company reported group sales falling 24 per cent to 'more than DM22bn' from DM29.2bn a year earlier, but did not provide a precise figure for 1993. While GM Europe remained profitable in 1993, Opel said several factors pushed Adam Opel into the red. These were DM160m to fund shortened shifts and DM350m for early retirement and severance pay, as well as DM380m in losses from exchange rate fluctuations. Opel reported output slid 24 per cent to 1.074m units in 1993 from 1.411m units a year earlier. The combined European market share for Opel and Vauxhall cars increased 0.7 of a percentage point to 12.7 per cent, the highest in Europe, according to Opel. Car registrations, however, declined 11.5 per cent to 1.33m units from 1.62m a year earlier, the company reported. In Germany, Opel's market share declined 0.5 percentage points to 16.6 per cent, it said. New car registrations plunged 21 per cent to 529,000 from 671,000 a year earlier.</p>

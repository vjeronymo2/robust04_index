They Do,  but..."    [Text] Foreign investors' interest in Russian gold is  obvious. Gold is mined in the Urals, the Far East, a number of  regions in Western and Eastern Siberia, on Kamchatka and in  Chukotka. A total of 146 tonnes of gold were mined in 1992,  which means that the Russian Federation accounts for  approximately 10 percent of world gold production. Russia's  known gold deposits total approximately 12,000 tonnes.    According to a state program for the development of the  Russian Federation's mineral and raw materials infrastructure  and its geological service in the 1993-95 period and up to the  year 2000, a program now under discussion by the government,  Russia is currently supplied with enough known reserves of  placer gold to last 12 years and enough ore gold to last 30  years.    In 1990 the Glavalmazzoloto [Main Administration for the  Diamond and Gold Industry] Institute did a large-scale study  that made it possible to project the volume of gold production  in Russia and contained a model of the world precious metals  market through the 2005-2010 period. The Russian gold mining  industry's problems are inadequate equipment and a lack of  funding to prospect for new gold deposits.    The Russian Federation's admission to the World Monetary  Fund  and declassification of information about Russia's gold have  given foreign companies a real chance to participate in gold  mining. Representatives of various companies in Canada, the  United States, Australia, France and South Africa have already  visited virtually every Russian gold field and familiarized  themselves with their mining and refining equipment and  technology and with their labor organization.    In principle, the leadership of the Russian Almazzoloto  Corporation Joint-Stock Company and the Russian Prospecting  Cooperatives Union are in favor of attracting foreign investment  and participation by foreign companies both in the development  of new gold fields and in the modernization of existing ones. In  their opinion Russia already has all the necessary laws and  legal statutes for that kind of cooperation.    It is interesting to note that their positions differ on the  issue of foreign investment. For instance, whereas Almazzoloto  vice-president Ivan Alekseyev is in favor of having foreign  companies involved both in the development of new fields and the  modernization of existing ones, Viktor Tarakanovskiy, chairman  of the Prospecting Cooperatives Union council, favors foreign  participation, but only through the extension of loans, not  establishment of joint ventures. We should note that Russian  authorities are of the opinion that the best gold deposits  should not be turned over to foreign companies for development.  They should be developed solely by the Russian state and our  country's own private capital. Prospectors' cooperatives have  gone on record as saying that they themselves can increase gold  production if the government will lower taxes, grant them the  necessary licenses, give them the chance to carry on normal  geological survey work and allow them to purchase leased  property.    Foreign capital can only be used to develop ore gold  reserves, which are not that numerous in Russia. Foreign  investors are not likely to be interested in small placer  deposits (with reserves of one tonne of gold or more). In  addition, Russian ore gold deposits are difficult to work: they  contain heavy concentrations of arsenic, mercury and antimony.    The leaders of Russia's gold mining industry feel that  current Russian gold mining equipment is comparable to its best  Western counterparts. What Russia needs now is a completely new,  high-efficiency technology, which the West does not yet have.    Currently open to international tender (though other terms  are possible) are a number of new gold fields in the Russian  Federation, including Pokrovskoye (Amur Oblast), Khakandzha  (Khabarovsk Kray), Mayskoye (Magadan Oblast) and Ametistovoye  (Kamchatka Oblast). A tender involving foreign participation has  also been made to develop a deposit at Kubaka (Magadan Oblast).    Foreign investors are not limited to a 30-percent share in  net profits when engaged in gold mining. Authoritative  structures dealing with gold mining in Russia have refuted  published reports of any such restrictions, stressing that  foreign partners can definitely count on a greater share than  that. Much will depend on what any such cooperation would offer  the gold mining industry and Russia as a whole.    As for foreign investors' concerns over the political  situation in Russia, every business involves a certain element  of risk. But one should bear in mind that no matter what the  initial conditions, the winner among foreign investors will be  the one who is the first, disregarding the risk, to become  established in Russian gold mining.    However, when making the leap into Russian gold mining one  should also consider the negative experience of the Australian  corporation Star Technology Systems, which was interested in  developing the Sukhoy Log field in Irkutsk Oblast, the largest  gold deposit in Russia and one of the largest in the world.    Both publicly and privately leaders of the Almazzoloto  Russian Corporation Joint-Stock Company have levelled harsh  criticism at that first attempt at large-scale attraction of  foreign investment in Russian gold mining. The problem was that  the Star corporation established the Lenzoloto-Star Joint  Venture through a contract with the oblast state property  committee, which did not possess the proper authority or  authorization to do so.    By doing so the Australian company was granted the right to  develop not only previously surveyed deposits, but also any that  might be discovered at Sukhoy Log in the future. Furthermore, it  was agreed that gold prospectors' cooperatives would operate  solely on the basis of agreements with the Lenzoloto-Star Joint  Venture (thus far no licenses have been issued to prospectors).  Plus, as was later revealed, the Star corporation did not have  the necessary status or reputation in the gold mining industry  or the requisite financial resources, nor did it have anything  new to offer Russia's gold mining industry.    Russian gold mining industry circles have accused the  Australian corporation of bribing certain members of the local  administration in Irkutsk Oblast. The press has latched onto the  scandal. All these factors have delayed development of gold ore  deposits at Sukhoy Log by more than a year.    Foreign investors interested in mining gold in Russia should  draw the following conclusion from the failure of Australia's  Star corporation: matters involving access to the development of  new gold fields cannot be resolved solely with the aid of  regional governmental bodies. One must comply with all the  formalities established by federal law in order to obtain a  mining license. This "cavalry charge" by an Australian  corporation expecting to gain mining rights solely through the  support of certain local governmental bodies ended in failure.  Russian gold mining industry circles regard that approach as  ill-advised adventurism.    In conclusion it should be noted that gold mining in Russia  is at present a low-profit industry. Largely responsible for  this is "barbaric" (the term used by gold industry  representatives) taxation, which takes 80 or even 90 percent (in  Yakutia) of profits.    Yegor Gaydar said at a recent meeting with the heads of  Almazzoloto and the Russian Prospecting Cooperatives Union that  he deems it inappropriate to mine "gold that costs more than  gold." In such cases, Gaydar stressed, it would be more  advantageous for Russia to buy gold on the world market than to  mine it at home.    However, an infusion of Western capital combined with terms  favorable to both sides could significantly improve the  profitability of the Russian gold mining industry.</p>

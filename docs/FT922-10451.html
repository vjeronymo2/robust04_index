			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Survey of Building For Asia's Future (17): A basic need for better facilities - Indochina THE need for improvement of infrastructure is far more basic in the countries of Indochina than in the rest of Asia. The attempts of Vietnam and Laos to implement market-oriented economic reforms are hindered by poor transport facilities and inadequate communications networks. In Cambodia, the United Nations is overseeing the start of rebuilding a country ravaged by 12 years of war. Hundreds of thousands of refugees must be accommodated, land-mines will be a serious problem for a long time, and roads and communications are very poor. Vietnam's cities have seen a huge increase in private business activity  - albeit from a very low base - but the resultant rush hours still consist mainly of motorcycle and bicycle traffic. However, the state of roads is such that the 1,000 miles from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City takes about five days of hard driving by car or about two days by crowded train. The Australian company OTCI, has re-vamped the country's telecommunications so that international direct dialling is now available. Substantial spending on improving Vietnam's infrastructure to support the growth of business, industry and agriculture - as well as to meet essential human needs - must await the lifting of the US embargo on dealings with the country in effect since the Vietnam War. This blocks financing from international institutions such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank.</p>

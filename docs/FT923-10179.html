			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Banned athletes achieve fastest fall from grace THE EXPULSION of three of Britain's Olympic competitors following positive drug tests has provoked a burst of outrage and indignation from UK politicians. British sports minister Robert Key said he was 'horrified' and claimed that there would be 'no hiding place' for cheats. Lord Howell (formerly Labour sports minister Denis Howell) said: 'There can be no athlete in the country unaware of the dangers of taking forbidden substances, and I only wish every other nation behaved in such a decisive manner as we have done.' The three athletes - Jason Livingston, a sprinter, and weightlifters Andrew Saxton and Andrew Davies - were snared in random tests conducted by the Sports Council, Britain's umbrella sports organisation, prior to the Games. All three were sent home before having a chance to compete in Barcelona. Livingston, 21, who was entered in the 100 metres and 100m relay, tested positive for the anabolic steroid Methandianone. He was known as 'Baby Ben' by other British sprinters because of his resemblance to his hero, Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson. The Canadian was stripped of the 100m gold medal at the Seoul Games four years ago after failing his drug test. Saxton and Davies, both 25, gave test samples containing Clenbuterol, a banned stimulant. International sport is threatened by a wave of new-generation performance-enhancing drugs, often difficult to detect. Ironically, Britain has long claimed a pioneering role in fighting drug abuse, and has repeatedly called on the International Olympic Committee to toughen its stance against cheats. The three have a right of appeal, but face being banned. Dick Palmer, Britain's Olympic chef de mission, said the scandal had caused 'emotional distress' to the three competitors, the administrators and to the rest of Britain's 400-strong team. Livingston was tested on July 15. He was told he had tested positive three days ago and was told to return to Britain. Palmer said Livingston 'took the news very quietly'. Davies was tested on July 10, Saxton the following day. Both were 'very upset', said Palmer. The weightlifters admitted they had taken Clenbuterol. The substance is banned in the UK but is available elsewhere, including Germany, as a treatment for asthma. According to Palmer, Saxton said he took it for his asthma and gave it to Davies later. Livingston equalled the European 60m indoor record last February and lowered his 100m personal best to 10.09sec early this summer. He stood a good chance of a medal as part of the British 100m relay team. Saxton was a weightlifting outsider, but Davies was runner-up in his class in the world championships in 1989 and Commonwealth champion the next year. Since then his results have been less impressive. During the Olympics, drugs tests are normally completed within 48 hours. Palmer said these British tests had taken so long because of a backlog. The Sports Council had tested 1,050 samples in the last six months. Palmer said that he would have preferred the results to have been known before the Olympics. That way, the matter could have been dealt with by the British governing bodies of the two sports and 'we could have avoided the spotlight here.' He added that all the Sports Council tests had been completed and that none of the others was positive. He said: 'We are determined to carry on continual and continuous out-of-competition testing: our job is to stop drug-taking.' John Carlisle, chairman of the Conservative backbench sports committee at Westminster, said it was well known that 'a lot of top athletes are using drugs.' He said it was to the credit of the British Olympic Association that it had taken the decision to send the three home.</p>

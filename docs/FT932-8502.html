			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / The Danish Referendum: Belgium to press for Maastricht goals BELGIUM, which takes over the EC presidency in July, will press ahead with implementing Maastricht's goals during the second half of the year, even if Britain fails to ratify the treaty. But Mr Willy Claes, Belgium's foreign minister, said last night the Danish referendum result made him confident all 12 member states would soon be ready to move towards greater European union. Priorities for the six-month Belgian presidency would include preparing the next phase of economic and monetary union, and a common foreign policy. The second stage of Emu - including establishing a European Monetary Institute, forerunner of the central bank - begins next January 1 and should end with a single European currency in 1999 at the latest. Mr Claes said last night that the demanding timetable was essential. But he added that Maastricht's tough economic criteria for joining a monetary union might have to be renegotiated if recession continued. Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgian finance minister, came out in favour of amending the criteria at the weekend. Earlier in the day, in a speech entitled 'Against Euro-pessimism', Mr Claes said the original Treaty of Rome and the Single European Act, which laid the foundation for the barrier-free internal market, were not enough to respond to the economic and political challenges of the 1990s. 'It's time to take a further step and the Maastricht treaty gives us the means to do so,' he said. Pressed on the possibility that certain member states might not ratify the treaty, Mr Claes told an invited audience in Brussels that the Belgian presidency would still continue the task of deepening the Community with 10 or 11 member states, 'because there is no alternative'. He said Belgium intended to 'exploit all the new possibilities offered by the Maastricht treaty for following a true common foreign and security policy'. That would include preparing the administrative framework for such a policy, and asking member states to define the areas in which common action could be developed.</p>

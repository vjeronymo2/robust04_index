			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dr. Nuri Zadeh: "The Coca Cola, Pepsi Cola, and </F> Hamburger War in the Republic of the Ayatollahs"]    [Text] About three months ago, the manager of the  Pavilion-M [Ravaq-M] Restaurant, in the northern part of the  Iranian capital, invited a crowd of journalists and cultural  figures to attend the grand opening ceremony of this luxury  restaurant, the construction of which cost more than 800 million  Iranian rials [R]. It was expected that the Pavilion-M  Restaurant would serve fast food (hamburgers and sandwiches like  at McDonald's). When those invited went to the restaurant on the  appointed day, they were surprised to encounter hundreds of  members of the [Revolution] Guard, young revolutionaries, and  some clergymen encircling the restaurant after it had been  destroyed, hoisting signs with the slogan "Death to America,  death to McDonald's, down with hamburgers, we will not allow the  squandering of the blood of the martyrs by having McDonald's  come into Tehran."    Two days later it turned out that the reason for the anger  of  Hizbollah, which had attacked the restaurant, was the letter "M"  that the owner of the restaurant had drawn on the windows of the  restaurant and the fact that it looked like the "M" used by the  McDonald's Corporation.    In an interview with the press, the restaurant owner said  that he was managing a large restaurant corporation in Spain  when some of Rafsanjani's men contacted him, inviting him to set  up similar restaurants in Iran, under the protection of the  government. He revealed the fact that he had paid large amounts  of money to the municipality and to the advertising company  subordinate to the municipality for the preparation of a special  logo for the restaurant. He assured the press that the letter  "M" referred to the name of his company and not to McDonald's.    The incident involving the destruction of the Pavilion-M  Restaurant unleashed a war of words between the supporters of  the president of the Republic and the representatives of the  radical movement in the Majles and in the press. The government  was subjected to fierce attacks in the Majles and Friday prayers  because it had given permission to the U.S. company, Coca Cola,  to set up plants in Khorasan and Tehran in order to produce the  Iranian people's favorite drink. One should bear in mind that  the revolution had confiscated the property of the Coca Cola,  Pepsi Cola, and 7-Up companies in 1979. Pepsi Cola, however,  returned to Iran, but with a new taste, which after a while was  not accepted by the Iranian people. But those who still wanted  Coca Cola had to buy their favorite drink on the black market,  where a can of Coca Cola produced in Pakistan, Turkey, or the  Gulf states cost 80 tomans. Since the Coca Cola plants began  production in Iran on the basis of an agreement between the U.S.  company and the Iranian Coca Company, most of whose shares are  owned by businessmen who have close ties to the government, the  other beverages such as Pepsi Cola, Canada [Dry], and Kawthar  Cola have not been able to compete with it. The result is that  bankruptcy is the possible fate of the firms that produce all  these drinks--all of which are owned by the Foundation for the  Oppressed.    In spite of the hostile campaigns, the Coca Cola Company  continues to operate, and its plant in Tehran is expected to  begin production, after it has been shown that the plant in  Mashhad is unable to keep up with the market demand which  consumes 2 billion containers of non-alcoholic beverages per  year. This surge in business happened because of protection  granted by President Rafsanjani and his assistant for economic  affairs, Dr. Mohsen Nurbakhsh, to the Coca Cola Company and all  the companies which benefited from the easy terms provided at  the beginning of Rafsanjani's administration and proceeded to  set up joint companies and plants with foreign establishments.    Although the radicals succeeded in destroying the Pavilion-M  Restaurant and preventing what they described as McDonald's  entering the land of the revolution, Coca Cola still remains the  symbol of change in this country where the U.S. dollar has  become the semi-official currency.    As long as Coca Cola bottles fill refrigerators, according  to  Qazvin's representative in the Majles, the men of the revolution  will consider Iran to be in danger, and will be forgetting what  the real danger is.  <H5>  The Real Danger </H5>   "This son and his father turned Iran into a big graveyard."  This is the famous utterance spoken by Ayatollah Khomeyni, on  the day of his return to Iran in January of 1979, at the Zahra'  Garden Cemetery when he was describing the Shah and his father  Reza Shah, the founder of the Pahlavi dynasty. By now this  utterance has become part of a joke told by people in Iran, and  which goes as follows: "The Shah turned Iran into a humble  cemetery, but there is no greater cemetery in the world than the  Cemetery of the Imam [Khomeyni]."    A total of 15 years has passed by since Khomeyni made this  utterance, and during that time the Iranian people have gone  through hardships that ordinary people would not be able to  bear. The word "oppressed," which was used a lot by Khomeyni and  his associates at the beginning of the revolution to describe  the poor among these people, now has come to be used when  referring to the majority of the people.    During the Naw-Ruz (Iran's national new year holiday)  celebrations after the revolution in March of 1979, Ayatollah  Khomeyni said that there was no reason to have the holiday that  year since the families of the martyrs and the oppressed were  not able to celebrate it, and that first of all it was necessary  for them to secure their basic necessities. At the time, these  statements aroused a tremendous protest on the part of Engineer  Bazargan, the prime minister, and Hasan Nazih, head of the  National [Iranian] Petroleum Company and head of the Attorneys'  Union. Bazargan put on an elegant suit and addressed the people  in a large stadium, saying: "Let's celebrate the holiday this  year even more than last year." And Hasan Nazih said: "A nation  in which the average individual income is $4,000 and which has  billions of dollars of hard currency reserves is not an  oppressed nation." There is no doubt that Nazih did not foresee  that the Iranian people would be transformed into a nation of  oppressed people within the space of just a few years, while  hundreds of the mullahs and their sons, plus the merchants  having ties to those in the centers of power, would join the  ranks of the rich.  <H5>  The Oil Share </H5>   During the revolution, the clergymen with ties to Ayatollah  Khomeyni who occupied the high-ranking positions in the Islamic  Republic, were promising the people that the revolution would  bring them electricity, gas, and gasoline free of charge, and  that basic goods would not be taxed. They also said that what  they then called the "oil share," that is, each person's share  earned from the oil revenues, would be distributed among the  people every month. The striking thing about the matter is that  Dr. Mohammad Mofatteh, one of the clergymen with close ties to  the leader of the revolution, who was assassinated after the  revolution, said, during one of his speeches in Tehran's Quba  Mosque, two days after Khomeyni's return: "After the revolution,  every Iranian will have the right to demand $270 a month, which  will be his share of the oil revenues." Dr. Mofatteh  disappeared, and those who believed him and joined the bandwagon  of the revolution on their way to prosperity and economic and  social justice did not receive anything from the oil revenues.    In spite of the intensified censorship of the press, some  publications such as newspapers SALAM and HAMSHAHRI, and the  satirical newspaper GOL AQA, occasionally publish stories  dealing with the tragedy of the nation that has depended on the  promises of the clergymen and sent them to positions of power,  only to then pray that God bring back the days of the Shah. Or,  as GOL AQA said, in one of its issues, on the basis of a line  from popular poetry: "We didn't appreciate the gold, so they  were generous with us and gave us copper."    We have chosen excerpts from the column "Telephone of the  Readers," in the newspaper SALAM, letters from the readers in  the newspapers JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI and the satirical newspaper GOL  AQA, as well as excerpts from a report published by HAMSHAHRI,  concerning the widespread poverty in Iran, in order to show the  reality of how the Iranian people live after 15 years of their  "revolutionary" regime.    The following was printed in the radical newspaper SALAM,  published by Hojjat ol-Eslam Mohammad Musavi-Kho'iniha, the  former public prosecutor and leader of the Line of the Imam  students, in Issue No. 802 of 20 February 1994: "I ask those in  power, why are the oppressed ones, who have to buy a kilogram of  chicken for R2,700 , at fault? Did the price of the dollar rise  because of the month of Ramadan or the Naw-Ruz holiday?"    In the same issue of SALAM we read: "I am the father of a  student at the Free University in Tehran, which is owned by  Rafsanjani, Khamene'i, and a number of other persons in high  positions in the regime. For my son's tuition, I paid R331,000  for the first semester and 345,000 for the second semester. And  now the people in charge of the university are demanding that I  pay them an additional R263,000 for last year. Is the Free  University free to raise its tuition whenever it wants and as  much as it wants?"    Another quote from the same issue of SALAM was: "I am a  retired employee. I swear by God that I still do not own my  house. Thirty years ago I bought a small plot of land in a  railroad town. However, the municipality refuses to issue me a  building permit."    In Issue No. 806 of SALAM, dated 26 February, we read: "The  removal of the slogan `Death to Saddam' from the walls of Tehran  on the occasion of the arrival of an Iraqi delegation to Tehran,  has caused a lot of anguish to the families of the martyrs.  Being a member of an Iranian family that has given up a few  martyrs in the fight against Saddam, I strongly protest this."    In Issue No. 805 of the same newspaper, we see the  following:  "Whenever I hear the word `subsidy,' referring to the government  support for the prices of foodstuffs, I am very surprised.  Officials are talking about government price supports as if they  are paying for them from their own pockets or from the wealth of  their families. Were the allocations for government subsidies  for some of the foodstuffs not provided from the treasury and  the revenues earned from oil, gas, and copper, which are the  property of the people? And are we still providing Syria with  oil free of charge?"    In the same issue we read: "The president of the Republic  indicated that prices in Iran are very low. Does he know  anything about the salary levels of employees?"    From Another Newspaper:    In the newspaper HAMSHAHRI, which is put out by the  municipality of Tehran on colored pages costing the municipality  R250 per copy (whereas the paper is sold at a price of R50 per  copy), a report dealing with widespread poverty was published in  Issue No. 356, dated 9 March 1994.    One of the things mentioned in the introduction to the  report, which was written by the newspaper's editor for social  affairs, was the following: "Have I suffered hunger? I don't  mean for an hour, a day, or three days, but rather for a whole  month, a whole year, or a number of years.    "Do you know what it means to be an orphan? Or what it means  not to be waiting for someone? Believe me, there are many  children in Iran who are dreaming about having a hand of  compassion. Do you know what it means to have to wait a whole  month just to eat a bowl of rice? Do you know how long it takes  for a poor child to forget what a banana looks like?    "Can you put yourself in the place of Maryam, the young girl  who came to school at the end of spring with her winter coat on  and who, in spite of the sarcastic remarks of her schoolmates,  was unable to take it off because she wanted to hide her shabby  clothes?    "Have you ever been in the position of the father who, a few  days ago, pretended to his children that he was going to buy  clothes for them for the holidays? Could you, like his children,  pretend that you don't need any new clothes and that what you  have is beautiful and up-to-date? Can you put yourself in the  place of the eldest son of an Iranian family who, when he sees  that the dinner table does not have enough food for his little  brothers and sisters, pretends that he has already eaten outside  home and that his stomach is full?"    Then the report from HAMSHAHRI talks about some families who  were visited by the writer of the report. They include the  family of "Khadijeh," a 40-year-old woman. Khadijeh says that  her husband committed suicide four years ago because of poverty  and how hard life was for him.    Khadijeh is a mother of four, and she has to take care of  her  family with 4,000 tomans per month (bearing in mind that the  cost of a kilogram of meat in government stores is more than 576  tomans). In other words, Khadijeh, with her monthly salary, is  not even able to buy seven kilograms of meat.    In the newspaper JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI, the newspaper's  editor-in-chief called upon the "rich to help the oppressed ones  during the feast." But the nouveaux riches are not concerned,  they live in luxury homes in northern Tehran, which they  occupied under the protection of the Revolution Guard, they ride  around in bullet-proof Mercedes cars, and they send their  children to the land of the Great Satan (America) for them to go  to school there and to enjoy themselves.  <H5>  Dr. Sa'id Has Barely Enough to Live On, and Hamid Reza, the </H5> Fruit Peddler, Now Owns Half of Tehran    Dr. Sa'id studied English at the Pahlavi University in  Shiraz, and received a Ph.D. in English Literature, with a  rating of "very good," from the University of Tehran two years  before the revolution took place. He is married and has three  children, the eldest of which is Hamid, who is studying physics  in his first year at the University of Tehran. His wife, Mina,  works as a teacher in the Girls' Institute. He works as an  instructor at the University of Tehran, he also teaches six  hours a week at the Institute of International Political and  Economic Studies in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and he also  puts in 10 hours at the Free University. On weekends he makes  corrections in academic books that have been translated for the  Tehran University Publishing Company. He was one of those who  was enthusiastic about the revolution, and he was one of the  founders of the Association of Revolutionary Professors who led  the university sit-in in Iran. As a member of the revolutionary  professors' delegation, he met Khomeyni on the day of his return  to Iran.    The earnings of Dr. Sa'id and his wife, in addition to the  amounts of money they get from various sources and from  additional teaching and translation, amount to 67,000 tomans a  month. This total equals 10 times the average salary of a  low-ranking government employee. But in spite of this, for about  a year Dr. Sa'id has been forced to work at night, using his  Paykan automobile to transport passengers back and forth between  Tehran and Karaj.    Every time Dr. Sa'id takes five passengers from Tehran to  nearby Karaj, he receives R5,000 from them. This has helped a  great deal to make his life easier.    In an interview with the newspaper ETTELA'AT, Dr. Sa'id  pointed out that the rent gobbles up half of his earnings, and  that he lives in a two-bedroom apartment in downtown Tehran.    Dr. Sa'id's only hope is that he will be able to send his  son  Hamid abroad to continue his studies before he is drafted into  the military.    Dr. Sa'id's cultured wife Mina is not even 45 years old, but  her appearance suggests that she is in her late forties. She is  apprehensive about the future of her two daughters. She says:  "Women have no value in Iran. The mentality of the men has  changed during recent years. They [now] look at women as if they  are furniture for the kitchen and bedroom."  <H5>  The Story of Mohammad 'Ali </H5>   Mohammad 'Ali is a man in his forties who lives in the city  of Esfahan. His eldest son Reza was killed in the war between  Iran and Iraq, and his second son Mahmud lost an arm on the  front.    He works in the iron and steel plants in Esfahan, and his  monthly salary amounts to 12,000 tomans. He also receives 3,000  tomans from the Martyr Organization for his handicapped son  Mahmud.    Mohammad 'Ali lives with his wife and five children in a  humble house he inherited from his father before the revolution.  He was one of the revolutionary workers, and after the  revolution took place, he worked in the city of Esfahan's  Central Revolutionary Committee for a year. At the same time,  his eldest son Reza was one of the first to volunteer when the  Iran-Iraq war broke out.    In a letter to the newspaper SALAM, Mohammad 'Ali explained  his tragedy, saying that his salary was not enough to feed even  dry bread or rice to his children. He wondered: "Did the  revolution not promise us a happy, decent life?"    Mohammad 'Ali begins his day at 0600. After he prays, he  rides to the plant on his bicycle and works there from 0800 to  1700. Then he goes to the factory of Hajj Kazem, one of his  relatives, and works there as a mechanic from 1800 until 2200.  When he arrives back home, the hands of the clock show 2230.  <H5>  Dr. Homa Darabi </H5>   Dr. Homa Darabi graduated from the College of Medicine at  the  University of Tehran, and specialized in psychiatry at a  well-known American university. She married a colleague of hers,  a well-known psychiatrist. Homa joined the Iranian National  Front, which was in opposition to the Shah, when she was a  university student, and was an active member of the Front. She  went to jail because of her political activity and because of  her admiration for the late national Iranian leader Dr. Mohammad  Mosadeq after the revolution. When Daryush Foruhar, the leader  of the National Front, became minister of labor, he suggested  that Dr. Darabi be chosen as his assistant. But Homa refused to  accept official positions, and she continued her work as a  doctor and university professor. Homa Darabi's tragedy began  when Ayatollah Khomeyni decided to get rid of the nationalists  and exercise power as a dictator. In spite of this, she resisted  all of the pressures and continued to teach and receive patients  at her private clinic. But one day in 1992 she received an  official letter from the rector of the University of Tehran,  informing her that she was discharged from the university  because of her views, which were hostile to the government. For  two years Homa Darabi fought the university administration and  the government in order that the unjust ruling issued against  her be reconsidered. However, she admitted defeat when the  Administrative Court gave its support to the ruling made by the  rector of the University of Tehran. On a cold day last February,  Homa got up early, took one last look at her sleeping husband  and one of her daughters, and left the house, carrying a big  container full of gasoline. She drove her car toward the Tehran  suburb of Shemiran, chose a spot that was full of people passing  by, and then got out of her car. As she was throwing the  contents of the container all over her body, she began shouting  slogans against the regime and ignited herself. As the fire was  burning her body, some of the passers-by hurried to save her,  but the revolutionary lady did not allow anyone to come near her  and she continued to scream until she fell down to the ground. A  few hours later Homa Darabi fell silent, while she was still  dreaming of freedom.  <H5>  The Story of Hamid Reza </H5>   Hamid Reza is forty years old, was not able to finish  elementary school because his family was too poor, and had to  work in the fruit-sellers' square in the city of Tehran for  several hours as a porter. After working there for a while, he  met Mr. Mohsen 'Ali, whose brother owned a big store in the  fruit-sellers' square, and Mohsen 'Ali helped him to get a job  with his brother, Hajj Javad, the store owner. Hajj Javad was  one of Ayatollah Khomeyni's supporters and participated in  demonstrations in support of him against land reform and  granting women the right to vote in 1963. During Khomeyni's  exile in Turkey and Iraq, Hajj Javad used to send amounts of  money to him from time to time. This earned Hajj Javad a special  place in the heart of Ayatollah Khomeyni. During the revolution,  Hajj Javad became responsible for Khomeyni's reception  committee, while his brother Mohsen was made responsible for  driving Khomeyni's car, on the day of his return, from the  airport to the 'Alavi School. And Mohsen, who in all of his  activities had not forgotten his friend Hamid Reza, chose him to  be one of Khomeyni's bodyguards and bought him a pistol from a  former member of the armed forces.    Hamid Reza thus became one of the Imam's bodyguards. When  the  Revolution Guard was established and Mohsen got one of the  leading positions, he appointed Hamid Reza as an assistant to  the commander of the Revolution Guard in the Tehran area. As  Mohsen's position rose in importance, Hamid Reza's position also  rose with him until he became head of the Intelligence Division  of the Revolution Guard in 1984 and he kept this position until  his friend Mohsen was transferred to the Foundation for the  Oppressed. At that point, Hamid Reza decided to try his luck in  commercial business, during the beginning phase of the  commercial open-door policy. Of course, Hamid Reza kept, and  still keeps, his influence with the Revolution Guard and its  intelligence division. He is also considered to be one of the  most powerful men of the regime in Iran, in spite of the fact  that, to all outward appearances, he works in the field of  business. Hamid Reza's wealth, after he took possession of the  Kater Company, is estimated at about 1.7 billion tomans. He owns  a palace in Tehran, as well as a villa overlooking the Caspian  Sea, a large park in Karaj, a 148-apartment housing complex at  Vanak Square, in North Tehran, and he supervises 40 industrial  units. He also owns 30 percent of the business shops in the  Safavi Market in North Tehran.    Hamid Reza begins his day at 0900, he sits in the back seat  of his bullet-proof Mercedes, and orders his driver to take him  to the Kater Company on Shari'ati Street. After his inspection  tour at the company, he goes to one of the secret headquarters  of the Intelligence Division of the Revolution Guard where he  reads a few letters and files and then issues some orders. At  about noon he goes to the "Rest House," which is a building  surrounded with trees in North Tehran, where he spends hours  with his buddies sitting around an opium table. In the evening,  he makes inspection rounds at his companies and establishments,  visits some officials, and then he goes to his white villa where  he spends the remaining hours of the evening with his family and  children, watching the latest videos from America and Europe and  satellite channel programs which the people of Iran are  forbidden to watch.

Men's suits which sold for R500 before the revolution  now sell for R65,000. The percentage of the increase in prices  for domestically produced cars (Paykan, Renault, Peugeot,  Nissan) rose tremendously.    The price of the Paykan car rose from R500,000 in 1979 to  R18  million in 1994. The price of a 1979 Chevrolet car, produced in  Iran (the production of which stopped after the revolution), now  is R11.5 million, whereas the price of this car, when purchased  in 1979, was R1.1 million.    Whoever is able to purchase an imported Mercedes automobile  (the favorite car of the clergymen and those in positions of  power) will have to pay R16 billion, that is, 16 million tomans,  in order to get one.

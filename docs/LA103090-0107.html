			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> A MOTLEY CREW: CHARGERS PIECE TOGETHER BACKFIELD  </P> <P> It is patchwork of the finest quality.  </P> <P> The Charger defensive backfield, which intercepted four passes in a 41-10  victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers Sunday, was pieced together through scans  of the waiver wire, non-blockbuster trades and one good draft choice.  </P> <P> Gill Byrd, a first-round selection from San Jose State in 1983, is the only  member of this unit who was handpicked by the Chargers.  </P> <P> Here's how the rest came to San Diego:  </P> <P>  -- Safety Vencie Glenn arrived in 1986 when the Chargers swapped a 1987  fifth-round draft selection with the New England Patriots. He had started 54  consecutive games until he missed the fourth game of this season because of a  concussion.  </P> <P>  -- Cornerback Sam Seale, who Jim Mora, Charger defensive back coach, says has  been the most consistent player in the secondary the past two seasons, was  claimed off waivers from the Raiders in 1987.  </P> <P>  -- Safety Martin Bayless was acquired from Buffalo in 1987 for cornerback  Wayne Davis.  </P> <P>  -- Safety Lester Lyles was picked up as a Plan B free agent from the Phoenix  Cardinals in 1989.  </P> <P>  -- Rookie cornerback Donald Frank, from Winston-Salem State, tried out and won  a spot during training camp this year.  </P> <P>  -- Cornerback Donnie Elder was acquired in the fifth week of this season after  spending the first four weeks on the Miami Dolphins' injured-reserve list.  </P> <P>  -- Cornerback Anthony Shelton was claimed off waivers from the San Francisco  49ers at the end of exhibition season.  </P> <P> So there you have it. The group that reaps the benefits of the Chargers'  amazing pass rush. Or, at least, that seems to be the general perception.  </P> <P> "We have a great pass rush, granted," Mora said. "But these guys deserve more  credit than they ever get. It's always the pass rush, but hey, (the defensive  backs) do something, too. I think they really get tired of always hearing how  bad they are."  </P> <P> Take Sunday, for instance. What will people remember? Byrd making his 29th and  30th interceptions to become the Chargers' all-time leader or the play on which  everyone blitzed and was then burned by a 68-yard touchdown pass from Chris  Chandler to Mark Carrier?  </P> <P> As Charger Coach Dan Henning points out, it's easy to recall when a defensive  back gets beat for a long touchdown but harder to remember all the times when  the play is foiled. That's why people keep asking Seale about Willie Gault, who  had a big day in last year's opener against the Raiders.  </P> <P> "The guy who never seems to get talked about unless he gets beat has been  having an outstanding season, and that's Sammy Seale," Henning said. "That's  the nature of the business at corner. He's the only guy who hasn't missed any  time back there this year. He's playing real solid."  </P> <P> Injuries to the secondary have been frequent in recent weeks. Glenn has  suffered from a concussion, an ankle sprain and a hamstring pull. He was forced  to sit out for the second time this season when the Chargers played the Raiders  Oct. 21.  </P> <P> "It's an empty feeling," Glenn said. "You're used to being out there battle  after battle after battle, and there's nothing you can do. It's terrible. It's  the worst feeling in the world."  </P> <P> Byrd has also been slowed by an assortment of injuries, including the groin  strain that he has played with the past two games. Sunday he could be found  lying on the bench stretching to keep loose each time the Charger offense was  on the field.  </P> <P> And Bayless missed Sunday's game with an ankle sprain.  </P> <P> As a result of the injuries, Shelton, Elder and Lyles have been called on to  fill in, and they have been more than adequate. Both Lyles and Elder had  interceptions Sunday.  </P> <P> "There hasn't been much drop off," Mora said. "Fortunately we have some young  guys who are playing pretty well behind (the starters)."  </P> <P> In the meantime, the starters who are nicked and bruised don't plan to miss  much of the action. And Mora says that has something to do with tradition.  These guys may still be trying to live down the days when the Chargers had the  leakiest defense in the NFL.  </P> <P> "It's tough to keep those guys down," he said. "They're all so competitive and  they hate to miss games. I think part of that is they feel like they have a lot  to prove because, for many years around here, there have always been so many  negative things said and written about the secondary."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 11 (YONHAP) -- South Korea, Japan and  the United States agreed through chain talks Saturday to seek  phased U.N. sanctions against North Korea.    Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu met with U.S. Undersecretary  of  State Peter Tarnoff and Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa  and concluded that sanctions are inevitable now when the  opportunity for measurements from North Korea's nuclear reactor  is damaged, ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho said.    Kakizawa, agreeing with Han that close  Seoul-Tokyo-Washington  cooperation is necessary in dealing with the North Korean  situation, made clear that his country will take responsible  actions "within limits of the Japanese Constitution" when the  U.N. Security Council decides to act, Chang said.    The two foreign ministers also agreed that China's role is  critical in solving the North Korean nuclear problem. Kakizawa  said he plans to seek Beijing's active influence when he meets  Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen during his China visit.    Kakizawa, moreover, pledged his government's efforts to have  the G-7 summit next month declare its firm will to deter North  Korea's nuclear development, Chang said. He apologized for  former Japanese Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's controversial  remarks about Tokyo's responsibilities for World War II, saying  it was "extremely regrettable" to have hurt the feelings of the  Korean people.    Kakizawa and Tarnoff had flown in over the weekend for key  talks on the North Korean nuclear controversy, on its collision  course with the U.N. after Pyongyang refused demands by the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to have its nuclear  reactor fuel rods measured by the agency.    Foreign Minister Han met earlier in the day with Tarnoff and  explained President Kim Yong-sam's trip to Russia this month and  his talks with U.N. and Chinese officials, the spokesman said.    Tarnoff had flown in from Tokyo and briefed Han on what he  discussed with Japanese officials.    Han and Tarnoff exchanged views on upcoming Seoul-Pyongyang  visits by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter next week and  agreed that the visit should be used as an opportunity to relay  firm will of the international community to North Korea.    They both evaluated the Friday's IAEA resolution as a  reflection of the hardline stance of the global community  regarding the North Korean nuclear situation, Chang said.</p>

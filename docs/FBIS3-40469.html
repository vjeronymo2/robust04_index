			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] For years, the company that manufactured the Zero  fighter plane and the battleship Musashi enjoyed  almost-uninterrupted growth, courtesy of Japanese defense  contracts.    Churning out F15 fighters and ground-to-air Patriot missiles  for the Defense Agency, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries rarely had  to worry about revenue sources or economic downturns. Not only  were fixed profits guaranteed, the company also knew that it  would receive a host of new contracts every time the Defense  Agency's budget rose.    But Japan's largest comprehensive heavy-machinery  manufacturer has found out the hard way that all good things  must come to an end. With the Cold War over, this behemoth  corporation, one of the symbols of Japanese industrial prowess,  is facing similar problems to those besetting arms contractors  in the U.S. and Russia.    For the last three years, annual sales of &yen;2.3-2.4  trillion ($20-21 billion) have been flat while annual net  profits have gradually fallen -- to an estimated &yen;70 billion  in fiscal 1993 through March this year.    To reverse the fall, Mitsubishi Heavy's military  manufacturing sectors are under the gun to find new non-defense  revenue sources. Given the recession, that's a tough order to  fill.    The company's recipe: cut costs, promote competition within  the firm, start research on new private-sector products and  inculcate a sense of urgency in complacent arms-manufacturing  employees.      The results so far: mixed.    ``We've got to use our brains harder to expand new business  opportunities,'' company President Kentaro Aikawa told managers  last September during a visit to Mitsubishi Heavy's two  principal arms-manufacturing centers in Nagoya, which rely on  Defense Agency contracts for 70-80% of all orders. The  Defense  Agency's fiscal 1994 budget, set to be determined later this  month, is likely to be flat.    With the endorsement of Aikawa, known within the company as  ``Mr. Cost-down,'' a new deputy chief, Shiro Goda, was appointed  at the company's guided-propulsion-systems center to shake up  the staff.    ``Goda's appointment was designed to equip the center for  survival in the private sector by infusing traditional technical  skills with a new commercial awareness,'' explained a senior  official.    The goal is to develop high-quality products such as  commercial airplanes at competitive prices, a new concept at a  center used to having almost unlimited funds with which to build  ships and planes at taxpayers' expense.    As one of his first acts, Goda reduced the center's nine  divisions to six and slimmed down its 45 sections to 38, giving  impetus to the decision-making process and to the  commercialization of new products.    ``I was surprised to find that most of the 2,000 staff who  work here at the Nagoya center are really quiet,'' said Goda.  ``They are not challenging, not aggressive; they are more like  government officials.''    Indeed, according to analysts, many Mitsubishi Heavy  executives view themselves as quasi-government officials, so  closely is the company tied to the government teat.    As a whole, about half of the company's orders come from the  central and local governments or from semi-governmental  institutions such as public utilities. About half of its  &yen;120 billion annual research and development budget is also  derived from governmental institutions. Mitsubishi Heavy's  corporate slogan -- ``To walk with the nation'' -- also reflects  the close ties.  <H5>  Divisional Changes </H5>   The company's electronics division reflects the new emphasis  on private-sector business.    The division was long operated as an R&amp;D division but  was  transformed a year ago into a marketing and sales division. All  300 engineers in the division are expected to work as sales  engineers, responding to customers' demands and requests.    This fiscal year, the division expects to receive some  &yen;5  billion worth of orders. While that's only a fraction of total  annual sales, division General Manager Kenzo Noguchi said he's  happy that the division is gradually combining the three  functions of research, production and sales.    For one of the company's core divisions, shipbuilding, the  transition has been rougher. Twenty years ago, the division  accounted for half the value of all company orders. By last  year, that had fallen to less than 18% of orders, with  little  hope for improvement in the near future.    In contrast, the company's power-systems division, which  makes power plants, has gradually increased its sales, profits  and corporate influence by promoting intense internal  competition between factories.    The company's past three presidents, including Aikawa, all  belonged at one time to this division, which last year generated  27% of total sales.    Among contracts the power-systems division won last year  were  for a &yen;60 billion integrated electric-power generating plant  in Syria, a &yen;20 billion coal-fired power plant in Chile and  contracts for thermal power stations in the Philippines and  Saudi Arabia.    Much of the credit for the power-systems division's  profitability goes to Yotaro Iida, now the company's chairman.    ``Mitsubishi Heavy can survive even if the yen surges to 100  to the dollar,'' Iida said recently.    The secret of the division's competitiveness lies in  management's decision to allow related sections and factories to  compete with each other for outside orders, explained Tomozuchi  Kawamura, the division's general manager. ``Such tough in-house  competition has enabled the division to grow stronger and more  powerful on the international bidding scene,'' he said.    For Mitsubishi Heavy, the quality of technology is less a  problem than how to apply it to new products.    Worldwide, the company's reputation for developing excellent  products dates to the late 19th century when the firm's  predecessor made most of Japan's fleet.    As the core of the heavy industry division of the prewar  Mitsubishi zaibatsu, the company was a leading  munitions maker until its dissolution in 1950. It regrouped in  its current form in 1964.    Among the company's latest technological accomplishments is  the Yamato 1, the world's first ship to use superconducting  magneto-hydrodynamic direct drives. In June 1992, the vessel  successfully completed a test voyage in Kobe Bay.    ``The key to R&amp;D is the ability to go beyond the problem  barrier,'' said Hiroshi Sakai, chief engineer at the company's  Kobe Shipyard.  <H5>  Risks as Challenges </H5>   For Kuniichi Kanda, project manager on the FSX, the  next-generation fighter being developed by Japan and the U.S.,  the greatest task is keeping development costs down.    Kanda, who works at the company's Nagoya aerospace systems  factory, said he has managed to do this in part by using data  from tests already carried out on similar fighters already in  existence.    ``Without such savings, development costs would have been  three times as high as they are now,'' Kanda said.    To President Aikawa, knowledge of what it takes to succeed  in  technical fields is what's needed to succeed in business as well.    ``The ability to see risks as challenges is what stops the  technical manager from being a mere administrator,'' said Aikawa.    He said he hoped that completion this spring of a new  R&amp;D  center in Yokohama would enable different kinds of engineers  from different divisions to brainstorm and to come up with new  ideas from basic research that can be commercialized. The center  will absorb 2,600 engineers from different divisions, a large  percentage of the company's R&amp;D staff. About 10% of  the  company's more than 45,000 employees are assigned to R&amp;D  activities.</p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> 101-CARAT DIAMOND UP FOR SALE  </P> <P> The largest internally flawless diamond to be auctioned will be put on sale in  Geneva on Nov. 14.  </P> <P> David Bennett, director of Sotheby's jewelry department, told a news conference  today that the 101.84-carat stone could fetch about $13 million.  </P> <P> The pear-shaped stone is 1.43 inches long and was certified by the Gemological  Institute of America as D color. In a white diamond, this is the highest  possible classification, denoting a total absence of color. "It is an extremely  rare feature in a diamond of this size," Bennett said.  </P> <P> It also has a purity grading known as "internally flawless," which is important  because the presence of inclusions or other natural features within a stone can  impair its brilliance.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Belem, Para (Brazil), 7 Jun (EFE) -- During a  speech to the 24th OAS General Assembly on 7 June, Bolivian  Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar Quiroga stated that the  Bolivian Government hopes that this year it will start holding  talks with Chile on the problem of Bolivia's land-locked  situation.    Aranibar said: "We believe there are new conditions to  tackle  the issue of our aspirations to an outlet to the sea." He  reported that the presidents of both countries will discuss the  issue during the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of heads of  government and state to be held in the Colombian city of  Cartagena de Indias on 14-15 June.    The Bolivian foreign minister asserted that "in the course  of  the meetings that (Bolivian) President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada  held with Chilean presidential candidates before the elections,  including then-candidate Eduardo Frei, he sensed that Chile was  more willing to discuss that issue."    Bolivia's land-locked situation was on the agenda of the  24th  OAS General Assembly, which was inaugurated in Belem, a city in  Para State in the Amazon, on 6 June. This issue was discussed  by the foreign ministers of the two countries involved.    This question has been included on the agenda of all OAS  General Assemblies since 1979 at the request of Bolivia and  despite the fact that Chile has always objected to it. The  Bolivian claim has been endorsed in the last few years by 11 OAS  resolutions.    In his address to the foreign ministers and chiefs of  delegations of the 34 OAS member countries, the Bolivian foreign  minister asserted that his country has the right to ask the  international community to discuss Bolivia's possibility of  having an outlet to the sea and to give it the same treatment as  the cases of Palestine, South Africa, and Haiti.    Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa Serrano stated that  his country's stance is based on respect for the principle of  nonintervention and faithful compliance with the treaties on  that matter. He said: "We would like once again to insist at  this meeting on the legal arguments that prove that our claim is  valid." [passage omitted]</p>

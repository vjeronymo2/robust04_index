			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / International Company News: Exxon earnings flat in first three months EXXON, the world's biggest integrated oil company, yesterday posted essentially flat underlying earnings for the first three months of 1993. Net income in the latest quarter was Dollars 1.19bn, or 94 cents a share, including a one-time gain of Dollars 47m from asset sales and tax credits outside the US. A year earlier, Exxon had net earnings of Dollars 1.3bn, or Dollars 1.03, including non-recurring gains of Dollars 158m. Revenues fell 2.3 per cent to Dollars 27.26bn from Dollars 27.91bn in the first three months of 1992. Mr Lawrence Rawl, outgoing chairman, said the company's reduced operating expenses helped staunch earnings erosion in the quarter in spite of sluggish economic conditions in Exxon's leading markets. On Wall Street, shares in Exxon fell Dollars 1 5/8 to close at Dollars 64 1/4 yesterday. During the first three months of 1993, Exxon benefited from higher crude oil prices and higher sales of chemical products. On the other hand, petroleum product and chemical margins were weak in the quarter. Earnings from domestic exploration and production operations rose to Dollars 228m in the quarter from Dollars 125m a year earlier. Underlying earnings from non-US exploration and production operations were Dollars 648m against Dollars 699m last year. Profits from refining and marketing operations in the US eased to Dollars 21m from Dollars 23m a year ago. Outside the US, refining and marketing operations brought in earnings of Dollars 277m against Dollars 339m a year ago, excluding one-time gains of Dollars 115m in 1992. Exxon's chemical operations had income of Dollars 123m compared with Dollars 151m in the previous year.</p>

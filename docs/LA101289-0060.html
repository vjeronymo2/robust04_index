			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> FOSTER AND DONOHOE IN OPENER OF PACIFIC SYMPHONY SEASON  </P> <P> It was opening night for the Pacific Symphony, and it sounded like it. That is,  it sounded as if the orchestra hadn't played together for a while, hadn't sat  in Segerstrom Hall of the Orange County Performing Arts Center all summer,  hadn't had time to adjust to this week's guest conductor. All in all, it was an  inauspicious beginning to the orchestra's 11th season.  </P> <P> Kazimierz Kord, the orchestra's musical adviser and principal guest conductor,  was not on hand for the opening festivities Tuesday. Lawrence Foster, former  assistant conductor with the Los Angles Philharmonic and now music director of  the Monte Carlo Philharmonic, held the podium on this occasion. He is the first  of seven guest conductors this season, as the orchestra continues searching for  a permanent music director. It's an ensemble in a transitional stage, which  certainly goes a long way in explaining Tuesday's unsettled results.  </P> <P> British pianist Peter Donohoe served as the evening's soloist in Bartok's Piano  Concerto No. 1. If ever there was a concerto to test an orchestra's mettle,  this is it. The complex sonorities, the driving and shifting meter and the  complicated interplay between soloist and ensemble tax even the greatest of  orchestras. This one wasn't yet ready for it.  </P> <P> From the beginning, orchestra and soloist never quite got together. Donohoe  leaped into his part with neat, energetic efficiency; the orchestra lagged  behind. Foster beat out the rapidly changing meter clearly but his players  turned the corners with labored effort.  </P> <P> Even in the slow movement, with its steadily repeated thump, thump, thump, the  ensemble didn't gel. The music plodded along aimlessly.  </P> <P> And so it went. The unevenness of the hall's acoustic, its clear highs and  muffled bass, made balances an ongoing problem. The percussion, placed  immediately surrounding the soloist, obscured orchestral detail. The brass  section could have been in another county: Its sound did not project forward.  Donohoe gave a propulsive, clean account of the solo, but this concerto does  not live by piano alone.  </P> <P> After intermission things went a little better for Schubert's Symphony No. 9 in  C. Here the strings made a solid contribution, with precise execution and lean  tone. Foster was most convincing in the Andante second movement, where the  steady clockwork of his tempo, the intimate details in small-scaled passages  and a warm unhurried lyricism worked its charm.  </P> <P> Overall, however, his interpretation proved more neat than noble, interesting  rather than inspired. Woodwind solos generally lacked sparkle and the brass  were, again, recessed. Schubert's Ninth has been known to have greater effect.  </P> <P> The concert began with a stately, well-played account of "The Moldau" by  Smetana. TIMOTHY MANGAN  </P></p>

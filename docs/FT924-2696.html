			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tories to revamp strategy for by-election campaigns THE Conservative party is preparing to sharpen its by-election campaigning as part of the shake-up in the party organisation begun by Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman. One key element in the changes will be a move to send a senior party figure to a constituency immediately the need for a by-election arises, to advise local party officers about the intense media pressure of the campaign so they can take account of that in choosing a candidate. Contacts between the local campaign and party headquarters at Smith Square in London will also be improved. The most likely course is that a national party officer or experienced MP will be seconded to the campaign, in addition to the 'minder' that every by-election candidate has under present arrangements. Concern over the party's dismal performance in by-elections during the last parliament has intensified because of the government's overall Commons majority of just 21. In the last parliament, the government held just three of the 10 seats it sought to defend, although it won them all back at the April general election. The changes in the party organisation are expected to include a swathe of job losses as the party makes progress in reducing its Pounds 15m deficit. While final decisions are not expected until the new year, the party's area offices, which at present employ about 60 staff, are likely to bear the brunt. Streamlining the 12 area offices might mean that some are amalgamated, although party figures emphasise that they think areas with distinct identities, such as Wales and the south-west, should still be able to mount their own operations. The Scottish organisation is thus unlikely to be seriously affected. In an effort to improve the effectiveness of local campaigning, party officials are also considering 'twinning' safe Tory seats with marginals where the constituencies are next to each other. The party is already planning a more co-ordinated effort in the elections to the European parliament. In particular, senior officers are already clear that Mr John Major must play a more active part than Baroness Thatcher did in the campaign for the 1989 Euro-elections.</p>

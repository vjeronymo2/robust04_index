			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Fel V. Maragay] </F>   [Text] President Ramos created yesterday a new body that  will oversee the implementation of projects for the social and  economic rehabilitation of rebels who have returned to the folds  of the law.    The Chief Executive issued Executive Order (EO) No. 152  creating the National Program for Unification and Development  (NPUD) to replace the National Reconciliation and Development  Program (NRDP) which had been rendered inoperative due to the  deletion of its P200 million budget from the 1994 general  appropriations act.    In the same EO, Mr. Ramos formed the three-man National  Program for Unification and Development Council (NPUDC) to be  headed by Interior and Local Government Secretary Rafael Alunan  III.    The NPUDC will have Defense Secretary Renato de Villa and  Presidential Adviser on Peace Process Oscar Santos as vice  chairman and member.    The creation of the NPUDC is seen as a rebuff to the  Senate's  withdrawal of funding to the rebel-returnees program that was  tantamount to the abolition of the NRDP.    The Senate chopped off the P200 million rebel-returnee  program over the vehement objection of Malacanang which warned  that such action would jeopardize the peace and reconciliation  program.    The alleged rampant irregularities in disbursements of  rebel-  returnee fund induced the Upper Chamber into scrapping the said  funding.    The senators gave credence to reports that funds were  released for fake rebel-returnees and even ghost surrenderees.  Malacanang, however, said that action was being taken to check  the alleged anomalies.    The [Malacanang] palace said even assuming that these  anomalies existed, this was not sufficient ground to withhold  funding for the program.</p>

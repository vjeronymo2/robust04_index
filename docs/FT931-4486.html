			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Union Discount Union Discount had little choice but to sell Winterflood, otherwise it would have had insufficient capital to retain its banking licence and continue with its traditional money market business. It may now be able to turn its fortunes round. But it will have to make its capital sweat to produce a decent return, and it is difficult for such a grandiose name to accept the status of mere niche player. One must hope Union does not become over ambitious. That would be doubly disconcerting after the careless way it lost money on September 16.</p>

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Sheffield Insulations trebled to near Pounds 10m Sheffield Insulations, the distributor of thermal insulation and related products, more than tripled pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.95m to Pounds 9.77m for 1993. Mr Bill Forrester, chief executive, said the company's markets had not been brilliant, with growth of about 2 per cent, but the company had continued to weed out costs and improve margins. Turnover from continuing operations increased from Pounds 133.5m to Pounds 149.1m. A contribution of Pounds 21.6m from WMS Group, a manufacturer of fittings for plastic windows and doors, took total turnover to Pounds 170.7m. Sheffield acquired WMS Group - which contributed Pounds 3.9m to pre-tax profits - for Pounds 52.9m last June. The group's ceilings and partitioning market and the architectural hardware markets showed volume demand growth of 2 per cent and a 2 per cent price improvement. Volume demand for insulation and related products fell by 4 per cent. However, the outlook was positive for all three markets this year, and the group was optimistic on the prospects of both Sheffield Insulations and WMS. Net interest receivable was Pounds 31,000, compared with net interest payable of Pounds 132,000. Gearing at the year end was 5 per cent (41 per cent). Earnings per share doubled from 6.2p to 12.7p. A final dividend of 3.6p is proposed, making an unchanged total of 5.4p. Since the end of last year Sheffield has continued on the acquisitions trail, buying Freeman, the insulation, distribution and fabrication specialist, for Pounds 18.6m. Freeman has a strong French business, giving the group a base in continental Europe. In addition, it has purchased Kessel Isokauf, a German distributor of insulation and related products and Turton Ventures, a distributor of safety and workwear clothing products.</p>

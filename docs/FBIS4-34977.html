			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Evening Information Review" newscast] </F>   [Text] The 200 North Americans who are visiting Havana in  defiance of their country's laws have announced new trips to the  island at the end of the year and in 1995 to pressure President  William Clinton to lift that prohibition. In a news conference,  the activists of the U.S. Freedom To Travel movement said that  in the Clinton administration and Congress, there are those who  support an end to the prohibition on visits to Cuba. They  indicated that hundreds of people backed the bill and that in  only one week, they collected $25,000 to make the trip after the  Treasury Department's decision to freeze $43,000 of the  organization's bank account. They emphasized that Freedom To  Travel is composed of 50 organizations from 25 states and is  committed to ending the restrictions on visiting Cuba and  lifting the economic blockade.    The group, which will stay on the island until 30 June,  plans  to visit sites of historic and social interest and meet with  Cuban officials.    We hope that the Freedom To Travel group will achieve its  objective of changing the unjust laws with which the U.S.  Government seeks to prevent visits by U.S. citizens to Cuba,  Medea Benjamin, executive director of the Global Exchange  Project, said in Havana. In remarks to this station, the  spokesperson of the group said this second defiant action is  greater than the first and that something very important has  been achieved in recent months: a Congressional resolution that  stipulates that the president cannot restrict the U.S. citizens'  rights to travel. Medea Benjamin added that through these trips,  the members of the group can confirm the Cuban people's  affection and verify how irrational and unjust the U.S. policy  against Cuba is.    Last year, the Freedom To Travel group made its first visit  to the island, and, when it returned to the United States, many  of its members experienced coercive measures, such as having  their passports withheld and their bank accounts frozen and even  being threatened with imprisonment.</p>

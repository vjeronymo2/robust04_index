			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Jersey (13): Reclamation projects forge ahead - The second, much larger, waterfront site is thought to be the biggest land reclamation project in Europe. It is anticipated that it will provide 25 to 30 years of tipping capacity / Planning and Construction The construction projects most in evidence in Jersey are two large land reclamation sites on St. Helier's waterfront. While the recession has generally slowed construction in the island, these important projects are forging ahead. Great piles of earth bear witness to the progress of the first site and the States has just granted the go-ahead for the second. Although they are always referred to as land reclamation sites, they are rubbish tips. The island has insufficient space for a landfill site to take waste not suitable for its incinerator. Instead, long sturdy walls are being built out into the sea adjoining the waterfront, and the enclosed area filled with builders' rubble and other island waste. No organic waste goes into the infill, but concern ts being expressed about the inclusion of fly ash from the incinerator. The site is regularly tested and monitored to check behaviour and seepage of heavy metals and other potentially dangerous components of the fly ash. Plans are already drawn up for building on the sites once they are full and covered. Mr. Peter Thorne, planning officer, said: 'This first site, which is about halfway through its contract period, will provide about 12 acres of land for development. By 1997, we should be ready to do the housing and hotel development on it and to lay out a new marina adjoining it.' He said the authorities were aware of the need for quality. Particular attention will be paid to this in the waterfront scheme in all areas such as design and finishes. The States has granted permission for a second, much larger site on the waterfront. This one is thought to be the biggest land reclamation project in Europe and it is anticipated it will provide 25 to 30 years of tipping capacity. Most of the work is going to specialist structural or marine engineering contractors from off the island. The large stones to construct the new sea walls enclosing the sites are shipped from France in barges carrying 4,000 tons a load. But some work is going to local contractors. Mr. Ian Browne, managing director of Charles Le Quesne building contractors, said his company was building slipways at the site. However he is not generally optimistic about the island's construction industry. 'The 1980s was an extremely buoyant period for everyone in the island and clearly things will never recover to how it was then. But we are hopeful there will be some recovery in a couple of years, once confidence returns to the market place.' He said the recession of the early 1990s, coupled with the States zero job growth policy, hit his industry hard. 'The last three to four years it has been a steadily decreasing market. This is not only in work opportunities but also in severely increased competition - there are now more after a piece of a smaller cake.' 'Three reasonably substantial companies have gone bust in the past two years, but the situation has been relieved by the States bringing forward its housing schemes in recognition of the decline in private sector work. 'Our fear is that the public sector work will have substantially dried up and, unless there is an upturn in the private sector, a lot of traditional builders will face problems.' Jersey companies resent having to face competition from off-island contractors. Non-local companies have to quote prices 10 per cent lower than their Jersey counterparts to gain contracts. 'I don't necessarily believe outsiders offer a better deal. Some have gone bust and left enormous debts with local subcontractors and builders' merchants.' Mr. Browne said there would not be anything very hopeful for the industry until growth returned to the market. 'In the meantime we try to be more efficient. We are looking at different types of work so we do not have to rely on the tender market.' Mr. Thorne agreed that the recession was biting the building trade. His department has seen the number of building applications drop to low levels in 1987-88, prior a peak in 1990. 'There is a bit more confidence in terms of applications and we are seeing some speculative development. There is a lot of activity in the housing area. People are going for alterations and extensions to existing homes rather than moving up-market,' he said. Although not everyone has been satisfactorily housed yet, land has been identified for housing, and building is expected to start soon. Two big new schools are also to be built within the next three years. 'There is a new mood in the States towards the island becoming 'greener.' And people are becoming more aware of these issues, which results in more representations against planning applications than we used to get.' Mr. Thorne said this change in attitude had also led to recognition of the need to protect some of the island's buildings. 'We have now identified all buildings we consider worthy of protection and hope to get them designated as the Jersey equivalent of listed buildings.'</p>

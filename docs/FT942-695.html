			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Dark days at the races: The future is an each-way bet at east Germany's largest race track If only the Marx Brothers had immortalised Hoppegarten, east Germany's largest race course, its fame might have guaranteed its future. Instead, the legacy of Karl Marx is causing headaches for the managers of this old-fashioned site, redolent of a grander age and less than a 30-minute train ride east of Berlin. The race course, which boasts a hurdles, flat and steeplechase track, as well as stables for 450 horses spread over 1,100 acres is trying to find a new lease of life in a unified Germany. As it shakes off its communist past, it is also trying to regain the glory it enjoyed when it was set up in 1866. Like most former state-owned properties, Hoppegarten was placed under the Treuhand, the agency charged with privatising east Germany's factories and shops, land, forests and sports facilities, after unification in 1990. Mr Artur Boehlke, Hoppegarten's 56-year-old manager, is determined that the agency will not sell the race track for industrial development. 'We have lost much time since the course was placed under communist control back in the early 1950s,' he said, sitting in an office decked with photographs of horses, race meetings and celebrities. 'The managers and Treuhand are now trying to revive the course's pre-war reputation.' Until the second world war, Hoppegarten and its race horses had been honoured by visits from Crown Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, the Aga Khan and others. The meetings were important social events backed by money from the Union Club, a select group of aristocrats which owned vast tracts of land stretching across Prussia, and which bought the course in 1874. This state of affairs persisted until the east German communists were installed in power in 1949. 'Racing was no longer exciting under the communists,' said Mr Boehlke. 'There was no chance for private stables or trainers. The state ran everything, including Hoppegarten. 'I well remember those days,' he added. 'Of course, the races continued to be held. But the international meetings, such as they were, only involved the other socialist countries. There was one international meeting a year. The Russians usually won. Somehow, their horses were faster than ours . . .' There was little scope for betting. 'You chose a horse, handed in a ticket and waited ages to get your money if you happened to win,' Mr Boehlke said. After German unification in 1990, east and west Berliners started returning to Hoppegarten to attend its 18 annual meetings. By late that year, the course had been placed under the Treuhand, which is still looking for an owner. The agency has subsidised the course by about DM1.2m (Pounds 480,000) a year since then, but the track still has annual losses of DM500,000 to DM1m. The Union Club has tried unsuccessfully to get its property back from the government. As the former owner of land expropriated by the Soviet authorities, which governed east Germany between 1945 and 1949, it has no legal right either to restitution or compensation. The club, which has about 200 members, consists of bankers and prominent sportsmen as well as landowners. Many members believe that even if they cannot buy the race course outright from the Treuhand, they will be able to obtain a long lease on it. Mr Evert Von Ungern zu Sternberg, 72, a prominent member of the Union Club, reckons it will be successful. 'If we cannot reclaim the Hoppegarten, we told the Treuhand that we are prepared to lease it, to invest DM30m over the next 10 years, and build another 450 stables.' Mr Von Ungern zu Sternberg, who was born in Estonia, fought on Germany's side during the second world war, moved to south America after 1945, and settled back in Germany after 1972, says the race course could be an instrument through which the club could regain its once-elevated status in a united Germany. The future of the course could be decided this week when the Treuhand meets representatives from the state of Brandenburg, where Hoppegarten is located. They could set up a Stiftung, or foundation, which could become the new owner of the course. The Stiftung would then lease the course to the Union Club. 'This solution means that the Hoppegarten will remain as a race course. But the Treuhand is insisting that the Union Club must make those investments, and find ways to get back into the black,' said Mr Wolfgang Horstmann, the Treuhand's director responsible for privatising land in east Germany. Mr Boehlke is looking forward to the time when the Hoppegarten's future will be more secure. 'Once we really get off the ground, we'll put the other race courses in west Germany to shame, and we'll be great once again. A day at the races will really mean something.' Now that is a finale the Marx Brothers would have really enjoyed. . . .</p>

			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Minding Your Own Business: How to make your updates automatic - Second of two articles by Jean Miles on monitoring share prices I HAVE been looking at ways to update share prices automatically in a computer portfolio program. Accessing prices via a telephone line through a modem is an excellent but relatively expensive way of doing it. The other possibilities, by no means to be despised, are to convert your computer into a teletext receiver or to subscribe to a data disk service. With all systems, each share must be identified by a code name which corresponds precisely - including the distribution of capital and small letters in the name - to the code name used in the data source. If your portfolio program can accept automatic updates, there will be space for the code to be entered along with other data when you first identify the share to the program. Installing a teletext card has the advantage over all other systems that, once acquired, it involves no further expense. Among the disadvantages are that you will need to plug a television aerial into your computer; and that the teletext pages on both the BBC and ITV list only about 500 shares between them whereas more than 3,000 equities, gilts, USM stocks and London-listed overseas securities actually are quoted on the stock exchange. Curious and very apprehensive, I installed a teletext card from Microtext. But everything went smoothly including Fast-Link, the program which transferred the teletext data into my own files in the portfolio management program called Fairshares Watchdog. The Microtext manual explains how to instal and tune the card, how to 'grab' teletext pages, and includes directions for finding and saving the prices of particular shares. So, if you are proficient in such matters, you could import your teletext data into a spreadsheet, or use it to update share prices in any investment program as long as you know (or can figure out) the necessary data format. For instance, the budget program called Quicken includes a shares investment module; and the Quicken manual, for both the MS-DOS and the Windows versions of the program, explains clearly the data format the program can 'read' and the procedure for importing prices. Market Breaker, from Alibro Software, is a 'share price analyser' program running under the Windows operating system and designed specifically to take data from teletext without the need for any other program to make the connection. It will draw a number of interesting graphs. You can add non-teletext shares and update them by hand. Sharewatch, from Dividend Associates, is a program which comes supplied with prices, results and dividends for approximately 1,400 companies going back several years. It is simplicity itself to use. The data can be sorted, analysed and graphed in a number of ways. Shares can be assigned to a portfolio. Prices can be updated weekly, fortnightly or monthly with a new disk which simply over-writes the previous data files, leaving the portfolio information intact. Although it lacks some of the features of a complete portfolio management program, Sharewatch - at Pounds 40 for the program and Pounds 4.10 or less for the update disks, including VAT - is remarkable value for money. It begs the question we started out with - that of how to update prices automatically in your own portfolio program - but it is so cheap that you might want to have a look at it, anyway. I also tried the weekly data disk service offered by Fairshares Software for use with its programs. This is utterly simple to use and, like Sharewatch, is therefore a good choice for those uneasy about their computer expertise. Over some months, the disk has never failed to arrive in Tuesday's post. All I have to do is put it in the disk drive and choose 'data service update' from the opening menu. Occasionally, one or two prices fail to register, and some of the more recondite unit trusts are not included, but these are not serious complaints. The cost starts at Pounds 60 a quarter, including VAT, for 'all equities' weekly closing prices' and goes up as you choose other data options. For users of other programs, the Financial Times' Finstat service offers monthly data disks from Pounds 40, weekly from Pounds 65 (both plus VAT) - expensive, but not absolutely out of the question. You would have to confer with Finstat and/or with the supplier of your software about importing the data into your own files. I set out on this quest convinced that typing prices was a useful exercise, keeping me in close touch with the progress of each share. But I have enjoyed being awash with data. If I were a more active or adventurous investor, I would certainly go automatic. If active, adventurous and poor, I would choose Sharewatch. The teletext adapter card for IBM-compatible PCs costs Pounds 172.50 (plus VAT) from Microtext, 7 Birdlip Close, Horndean, Hants PO8 9PW. Tel. 0705-595 694; fax 0705-593 988. Fairshares Software Ltd, 5 West Street, Epsom, Surrey KT18 7RL. Tel. 0372-741 969; fax 0372-739 883. Market Breaker runs on IBM-compatible computers under Windows 3.0 or 3.1. It costs Pounds 150 from Alibro Ltd, Alibro House, 190 Ellesmere Road, Willesden Green, London NW10 iJT. Tel./ fax 081-208 1067. A demonstration disk is available for Pounds 5, refundable on buying the program. Sharewatch runs on IBM-compatible computers. It costs Pounds 39.95 (inc. VAT) from Dividend Associates, 2 The Dell, Vernham Dean, Andover, Hants SP11 0LF. Tel. 0264-87 642. Finstat: Tel. 071-873 4613; fax 071-873 4610.</p>

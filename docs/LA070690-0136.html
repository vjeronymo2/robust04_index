			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TITAN-TO-SOONER SHUTTLE COULD GET BUSY;  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASEBALL: BLYLEVEN AND OTHER PLAYERS HE RECRUITED TO FULLERTON ARE  PLANNING ON FOLLOWING FORMER COACH LARRY COCHELL TO OKLAHOMA.  </P> <P> One high school baseball player who had signed with Cal State Fullerton said he  will follow former Titan Coach Larry Cochell and pitching coach Vern Ruhle to  the University of Oklahoma. And two players who were planning to transfer to  Fullerton from four-year colleges appear ready to jump on the Sooner shuttle.  </P> <P> In addition, two players who had signed with Fullerton are wavering in their  commitments in the wake of Cochell's resignation Tuesday to accept the Oklahoma  job.  </P> <P> Villa Park High School pitcher Todd Blyleven, who had signed with the Titans,  said Thursday he will ask to be released from his letter of intent so he can  pitch under Ruhle, a former major-league pitcher.  </P> <P> Blyleven, a right-hander who is the son of Angel pitcher Bert Blyleven, was 8-2  with a 1.26 earned-run average and 82 strikeouts this season. Only Fullerton  Athletic Director Ed Carroll can issue the release, but Carroll is on vacation  until next week.  </P> <P> "It's nothing against Fullerton or anything, but Vern was the reason I went  there," Blyleven said. "I want to stay with him. I'm looking forward to going  to Oklahoma. It's my kind of area -- you can wear cowboy boots, jeans -- it's  kind of hicksville. That's what I'm like."  </P> <P> Ruhle also was the reason that USC sophomore Mike Smedes, a right-handed  pitcher from Laguna Hills High, had asked to be released from his Trojan  scholarship after the season.  </P> <P> Smedes, an eighth-round draft pick in 1988 by the Seattle Mariners, said he was  planning to transfer to Fullerton after Trojan Coach Mike Gillespie gave him  his release. But now, his plans may change.  </P> <P> "Coach Ruhle is where it's at, and I'd like to stay with him," Smedes said.  "I'd like to take a trip to Oklahoma and see what it's like. I'll probably make  a decision next week."  </P> <P> Tony Darden, a sophomore right-hander who redshirted at UCLA this past season,  was released from his scholarship by Bruin Coach Gary Adams and said he was  planning to transfer to Fullerton. But the Diamond Bar High graduate said he  will re-evaluate his situation.  </P> <P> "One of the reasons I was transferring was because of the coaches," Darden  said. "They've expressed interest in me going to Oklahoma, and they're supposed  to get back to me in a few days."  </P> <P> Cochell, who can recruit Smedes and Darden because they are not presently  obligated to any school, said he would like to have both pitchers at Oklahoma.  </P> <P> Greg Brannis, a left-handed pitcher from Estancia High who signed with  Fullerton this past spring, isn't exactly sure where he will go to college.  </P> <P> "I'm playing it by ear to see who comes in as the head coach," Brannis said.  "But the reason I chose Fullerton was Vern Ruhle, so I'm a little upset by  this. It has left a weird feeling. I'm not sure why I'm going to Fullerton  anymore."  </P> <P> Frank Herman, an outfielder from Golden West College who has signed with the  Titans, says he isn't sure how the coaching change will affect him.  </P> <P> "But a coach from Arkansas here says if things don't work out, I have a chance  to play there," Herman said from Anchorage, Alaska, where he is playing summer  baseball. "I was really looking forward to playing for Cochell."  </P> <P> Cochell, who guided the Titans to two College World Series appearances in three  seasons, says he doesn't want a mass exodus from Fullerton.  </P> <P> "I will talk to all the kids and tell them not to panic, because Fullerton will  hire a good coach," Cochell said. "The program will be as good or better as  than it is now."  </P> <P> Two other players who have signed with the Titans, Golden West infielder Robb  Carabba and Glendale College first baseman Art Chute, said they will honor  their commitments to Fullerton, regardless of the coaching change.  </P> <P> Craig Constantino, an outfielder from Mission College in Santa Clara; Jim  Betzold, an outfielder from Mater Dei High, and Jason Hutchins, a pitcher from  Golden West -- who fill out the balance of Cochell's recruiting class this year  -- couldn't be reached for comment.  </P></p>

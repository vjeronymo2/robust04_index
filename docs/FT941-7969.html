			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / People: Bauman head-hunted Bob Bauman, recently appointed non-executive chairman of British Aerospace, is also finding time to go on the board of Russell Reynolds, one of the largest international headhunting companies. Russell Reynolds, which is headquartered in New York but has now established more than half its 24 offices outside America, has been taking steps to 'internationalise' its board. Though Bauman is an American citizen, he moved to London in 1986 to take up the post of chairman and chief executive of Beecham Group. Since then he earned high marks for piloting the merger with SmithKline Beckman, and become one of the UK's highest paid directors. It was Russell Reynolds who brought Bauman, then vice chairman of Textron, across the Atlantic. Jane Kingsley, a London-based managing director at the headhunting company, says that when Bauman announced he would be retiring from SKB it would have been 'a completely natural conversation' to ask him if he wanted to come aboard the headhunting firm, which is still retained by SKB. She would not elaborate further on the timing of his decision. He is also a non-executive director of Reuters, CIGNA, Union Pacific Corporation and Capital City/ABC. The board meets 'three or four times a year', Kingsley adds, 'but is mainly there to give advice, so he will receive many, many phone calls.' Other members of the board include John Loudon, the retired chairman of Royal Dutch Shell, and Philip Caldwell, the former chairman and chief executive of Ford Motor Company. The company hopes to bring in a British director in the next few months.</p>

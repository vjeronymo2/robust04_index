			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTLOOK FOR THE '90S;  </P> <P> FOR BUSINESS, THE 1980S WERE A PERIOD OF ENORMOUS TURMOIL. A JAPANESE SIEGE OF  THE HIGH-TECHNOLOGY AND AUTO INDUSTRIES, A SURGE AND PLUNGE IN OIL PRICES,  MASSIVE FAILURES OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND A FEARSOME STOCK CRASH. THE  1990S DON'T PROMISE MUCH PEACE AND QUIET. HERE'S A LOOK AT WHAT BUSINESS FACES  IN THE NEXT DECADE.;  </P> <P> DEFENSE  </P> <P> The defense industry's thrill ride up the Reagan Administration military  spending boom is quickly changing into one of the scariest plunges in the  industry's long history, threatening a major consolidation in the next decade.  </P> <P> The 1980s opened with a national consensus to rebuild America's military  forces, a goal that led to a doubling of defense acquisition and the awarding  of major weapons programs to virtually every prime contractor in the industry.  </P> <P> But a series of national scandals involving criminal fraud in the industry,  overpriced spare parts and faulty weapons systems led to a congressional  backlash. Regulations exploded, profit margins were squeezed and financing  terms became penurious, forcing major increases in debt loads.  </P> <P> Worse yet, the Reagan spending boom encouraged the industry to add industrial  capacity at a time when most experts agreed that there was already excess  capacity. Another Pentagon policy of fostering competition failed to cut costs,  but profits suffered.  </P> <P> By 1985, the great boom had already peaked and leveled out, though the long  pipeline of funding from Washington continued to allow many contractors to grow  for several years.  </P> <P> Although the thawing of the Cold War has just begun, it already seems likely  that the nation's 2.2-million-member armed forces will be reduced -- and the  arms industry along with it. Annual spending on defense has already been  declining at 2% after inflation for several years, and political pressure is  building to accelerate that decline.  </P> <P> Excess capacity will have to be reduced; some companies will leave the defense  industry permanently, and contractors will be thinned out further by mergers  among themselves.  </P> <P> But the aerospace industry has a bright future in commercial aircraft, in which  Boeing and McDonnell Douglas have backlogs that will extend production into the  next century. And the civilian space program is growing rapidly once again.  RALPH VARTABEDIAN  </P></p>

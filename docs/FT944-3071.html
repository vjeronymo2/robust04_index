			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Blair wins backing over Clause IV Labour's National Executive Committee voted overwhelmingly yesterday to hold a special conference on plans by Mr Tony Blair, the party's leader, to dump the Clause IV commitment to nationalisation, heading off the prospect of an effective leftwing revolt. The NEC agreed by 20 votes to three to Mr Blair's request for a special conference in London on April 29, after five months of consultation with party members by a team led by Mr John Prescott, the party's deputy leader. The special conference will take place before most of the party's affiliated trade unions hold their annual conferences, preventing union militants from attempting to mandate their leaders to vote against Mr Blair's proposals. The conference will be asked to vote on a single proposal for an updated Clause IV to be drawn up by the NEC, which is overwhelmingly sympathetic to Mr Blair's plans to modernise the party. The proposal is likely to include a commitment to a dynamic market economy - regarded by some leftwingers as a betrayal of Labour's history. Officials said there would be no vote on alternative proposals. As expected, the proposal for a special conference was strongly opposed by Mr Dennis Skinner and Ms Diane Abbott, two leftwing MPs elected to the executive at October's annual conference in Blackpool. They were joined by Ms Clare Short, a moderate leftwinger, reflecting widespread concern on the left of the party at the leadership's tight grip on the reform process. Ms Short said the decision should be left to the next annual conference. Underlining the growing unease, the European Labour Forum yesterday sent a questionnaire to all 634 Labour constituency parties in an attempt to demonstrate lack of grassroots support for Mr Blair's proposals. The forum, which groups leftwing Labour members of the European parliament, described Clause IV in a letter as a 'landmark statement' and declared that 'capitalism is no less dangerous now to human freedom than it ever was'. Mr Blair told the NEC that the government was preparing to launch a personal campaign against him in the new year. 'It is vital in the next few months that we define our aims and values and present them clearly to the electorate. The time is right to convert the extensive opposition to the Tories into positive support for Labour,' he said.</p>

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Chinese aircraft hijack talks fail Taiwan and China yesterday ended five days of talks without resolving the problem of frequent hijackings of Chinese aircraft to Taiwan, reports Dennis Engbarth from Taipei. The two sides could not agree on mutually acceptable language for an agreement in principle that hijackers should be repatriated. Nine Chinese aircraft have been hijacked to Taiwan this year. The failure underlines the difficulty which the two sides will have as 'unofficial' contacts gather pace. The talks were the third round of negotiations on practical issues agreed by Taiwan's strait exchange foundation and China's association for relations across the Taiwan strait in April.</p>

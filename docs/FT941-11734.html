			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Lebanon agrees Pounds 250m deal to upgrade phones The Lebanese government has awarded a Dollars 380m (Pounds 253.3m) contract to Alcatel, Siemens and Ericsson, the French, German and Swedish telecommunications companies, to rehabilitate and expand the country's shattered telephone network, Mark Nicholson writes from Cairo. The contract is the biggest so far awarded towards the reconstruction of Lebanon's infrastructure since the end of the civil war, which left much of the telephone system barely operable. Fewer than half the country's 500,000 lines work, and businesses and private users have been forced to resort to cellular phones, many using US networks. Lebanon's present telephone system is an increasing hindrance to the economy, with many 'difficult numbers' from one part of town to another often proving impossible to dial, while international direct-dial lines are scarce even from the main hotels.</p>

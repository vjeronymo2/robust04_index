			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Pink Snow (8): Cross-country skiing Why should you want to haul yourself about on skis while the ski lift could do the work? Why plod through the snow with the brakes on when you could be swooping like a bird amid the peaks? If you are asking these questions, you have never tried cross-country skiing. Sir Norman Foster, the architect, has been an enthusiastic cross-country skier for more than a decade and has more-or-less completed the switch from downhill. He says that cross-country skiing is easy. 'It's fantastic at every level. It works for little old ladies who go out for a walk on skis to the most incredible athletes in streamlined clothes.' Before you even start, you feel the difference. The boots are like running shoes and the skis weigh ounces. On day one, with zero technique and on the flat, each normal walking step takes you two metres. After a week, you can climb into woodland off-piste and enjoy the exhilaration of being in mountain peace that mechanised Alpine skiers do not know exists. Choose your resort carefully. Few people can cross-country ski from dawn to dusk. Make sure that you have the options of shopping, dining, skating, curling, sleigh riding, hot pool swimming, dog-sledding, ice fishing or just strolling. Then rediscover all the things that could be done in winter before they were buried by the avalanche of Alpine skiing.</p>

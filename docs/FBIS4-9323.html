			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Zvornik, April 22 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb  authorities will do their best to help find a solution  acceptable to all, enabling a U.N. High Commissioner for  Refugees (UNHCR) convoy to proceed to Gorazde, Bosnian Serb army  sources told TANJUG on Friday [22 April]. The Gorazde-bound  convoy of 49 combat vehicles, with 141 U.N. Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) members from Great Britain and Ukraine and 41  Norwegian medical workers, on its way from Sarajevo was stopped  in Rogatica on Thursday by a group 350 Serb women and children.  The spontaneously gathered group demanded that UNPROFOR  evacuated all Serbs held captive in the [word indistinct]  Bosnian Moslem enclave of Gorazde. They also demanded the  return of the bodies of killed Serbs.    The Bosnian Serb republic (S.R.) authorities are investing  every effort towards resolving the situation, Bosnian Serb army  sources said. The Serbs have agreed that two U.N. platoons be  deployed in the Gorazde area under Tuesday's S.R.-UNPROFOR  accord pursuant to which the Serbs proclaimed a unilateral  ceasefire in the area on Wednesday. In the meantime, UNPROFOR  Commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina British General Sir Michael  Rose was reported to have ordered the convoy to return to  Sarajevo.    News agencies reported that UNPROFOR spokesman in Sarajevo  Rob Annink said that Gen. Rose at 1.30 p.m. (1130 GMT) on Friday  ordered the convoy to return. He added that the order was  issued for tactical and political reasons. Clashes around  Gorazde escalated in late March when the Moslems from Gorazde, a  U.N.-designated `safe area' which should have been demilitarized  last spring, launched an offensive against Serb positions. The  offensive has been crushed by a strong Serb counterattack.</p>

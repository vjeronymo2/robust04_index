			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Hall Engineering advances to Pounds 1.55m DESPITE continuing difficult trading conditions in the UK and South Africa - its two main operating areas - Hall Engineering (Holdings) achieved a 33 per cent pre-tax profits advance to Pounds 1.55m in the six months to June 30. Turnover of Pounds 64m compared with Pounds 79.4m. Total borrowings rose but were still some Pounds 7m lower than at the corresponding stage last year following good cash generation in the the second half of 1991. This led to a fall of almost Pounds 1m in interest payable to Pounds 1.56m. The company said the continuing predominance of profit from overseas had led to a build up of advance corporation tax which could not be set off against current mainstream UK tax. While the amount paid remains available to be utilised, the company considered it prudent to write off a large part of this year's ACT costs against profits. This has led to an assumed rate of tax for the year of 55 per cent. Earnings per share fell to 2.27p (2.69p) and the interim dividend is maintained at 3.3p. Mr Richard Hall, chairman, said the group continued to enjoy a high level of reward from its investments throughout the world, in particular the associated companies in the Pacific Basin.</p>

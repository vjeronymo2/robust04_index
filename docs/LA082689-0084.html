			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROCK OPERA REVIEWS;  </P> <P> 'TOMMY' &amp; CO.;  </P> <P> THE WHO'S CLASSIC RETAINS ITS FIRE  </P> <P> Even at a benefit concert like Thursday's star-studded performance of "Tommy,"  put on by the Who at the Universal Amphitheatre, it's easy to find cynics.  </P> <P> Mindful of the current Who tour's controversial brewery sponsorship, one wag  suggested that maybe the rock opera's troubled title character could appear in  a beer commercial -- as in, maybe, "That deaf, dumb and blind kid sure can  knock 'em back!"  </P> <P> Cheap shot. Uncalled for. Irascible.  </P> <P> But then, "Tommy" itself was a fairly acerbic work, especially for its dreamy,  idealistic year, 1969. If the Who's world-weary anthem "Won't Get Fooled Again"  later served as the final benediction for the '60s, then the enduringly  brilliant "Tommy" -- and its song of rebellion against the spiritual path,  "We're Not Gonna Take It" -- may have been cynical enough to be the era's first  real musical death knell.  </P> <P> Its climactic vision of a nation of young seekers giving up on the search and  rising up against their ascetic pop guru was plenty prophetic, whether you want  to relate it to a generation deserting its ideals or simply to songwriter Pete  Townshend's eventually disassociating himself from his own avatar of the time,  Meher Baba, who was credited with helping inspire "Tommy."  </P> <P> Some of the anger and disillusionment that may have fired the original "Tommy"  still came across in Thursday's sold-out performance (which was seen nationally  as a pay-per-view TV event, in addition to the estimated 6,000 who paid from  $75 to $1,500 to witness the show in person).  </P> <P> There was some fire and brimstone there. Townshend even menacingly aimed his  guitar neck at the audience, Tommy-gun style (ahem), during a rat-a-tat-tat  passage of "We're Not Gonna Take It," mirroring the experience of a public  taking up arms against its artists and prophets.  </P> <P> But this run-through of the most famous of all rock concept albums was not big  on emotion, nor geared toward theatricality. Clearly, the Who was not relating  to "Tommy" as a moving story with big themes so much as just a piece of music  to be played for old time's sake.  </P> <P> And to be played around with, for new time's sake. What the three surviving Who  members, their 12 back-up musicians and their five celebrity guests did to  rearrange the work probably didn't add up to any Who fan's ultimate "Tommy,"  but it was a gas nonetheless, and not just for sentimental reasons.  </P> <P> The pageant of guest stars may have distracted and detracted from the piece's  thematic strengths, but their presence no doubt nudged along the Who's  willingness to have a little fun with the musical aspects.  </P> <P> The evening's most radical rethink: Steve Winwood's rendition of "Eyesight to  the Blind," which, backed by five horns and three singers, suddenly sounded  very much like a slick, up-tempo R&amp;B rave-up that wouldn't have been at all  out of place on his own "Back in the High Life" album.  </P> <P> Most electrifying vocal: With Who lead singer Roger Daltrey not quite at his  finest, honors easily went to Patti LaBelle as the viciously seductive Acid  Queen.  </P> <P> Best typecasting: Bad boy Billy Idol as the nasty Cousin Kevin, liberally  sprinkling his promises of baseless cruelty to little Tommy with profanity.  Underneath this, the big band found a musical intensity of almost metallic  proportions.  </P> <P> Most game guest: Phil Collins as the child molester Uncle Ernie, the only  performer of the evening to attempt to actually act out his role. Even the  stone-faced Townshend had to break up at the sight of Collins in a raincoat and  boxer shorts, sporting one of those "comb-over" hair jobs -- with the hair  combed over down front, to approximate bangs.  </P> <P> Letdown: Elton John, usually a galvanizing presence on any stage, surprisingly  subdued reprising his movie role singing "Pinball Wizard."  </P> <P> You'd have to be as single-minded as Tommy himself to focus on the story amid  this parade of celebs, not to mention Daltrey's still-swell microphone-swinging  and Townshend's leaps. Nevertheless, it holds up as a sprawling epic that moves  with admirable cohesion from pulp melodrama to a saga of cruelty to a spiritual  odyssey to a satirical commentary on pop/religious culture.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, how's this for an unhappy ending: For the climactic "Listening to  You," the "cast" rejoined the band -- dominated by a self-impressed Idol  bounding about, bound and determined to be as obnoxiously omnipresent as  possible. Was this his show or the Who's?  </P> <P> The hour-plus "Tommy" presentation was followed by a generous greatest-hits  set, anticlimactic only in that the Who seems less willing to "fiddle about"  with the arrangements of its other material than it does with its  lovable-albatross rock opera.  </P> <P> The organizations benefiting from the performance were the Gilbert W. Lindsay  Children's Center at California Medical Center Los Angeles, United Friends of  the Children, MacLaren Children's Center, Westside Children's Center and the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation.  </P> <P> The Who will perform many more of its hits, along with a condensed "Tommy,"  tonight at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.  </P> <P> LIVE ACTION: Priority wristbands for tickets to Paul McCartney's Nov. 27-29  stand at the Forum will be handed out at Ticketmaster locations starting at 8  a.m. Monday, with sales to start at 9 a.m. No lineups are allowed before 7 a.m.  The price will be $28.50 for all seats, plus a $3.50 service charge ($5.50 if  ordered by phone). . . .

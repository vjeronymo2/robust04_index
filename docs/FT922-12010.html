			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Letter: The FT and the British election - wrong, wrong but for the right reasons, and right Sir, Thank you for your careful leader analysis and Labour recommendation, which, despite the election result, shows that at least someone is keeping a clear mind. As an Englander who has already left England, all the talk of 'keeping socialism out' in the UK looks rather odd to me here in Austria where the government is a conservative/socialist coalition led by a socialist chancellor with a doctorate in banking. Such a comparison would probably be lost on some of your letter writers of April 10 who continue to use the word 'socialism' as if the Cold War hadn't ended. As far as political stance goes, it seems to be forgotten that the FT recommended the Tories in 1987. David Henkel-King, SGP-VA Gmbh, Siemensstrasse 89, Vienna 1211, Austria</p>

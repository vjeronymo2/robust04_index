			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / International Company News: Pentagon cuts depress General Dynamics GENERAL Dynamics, the US defence contractor which is trimming its sails to adjust to lower military spending, suffered a small drop in earnings from continuing operations in the first quarter. Net earnings tumbled to Dollars 57m, or Dollars 1.37 a share, from Dollars 124m, or Dollars 2.97 a share, a year earlier. Last year's figures however, included a large gain from the settlement of an anti-trust suit against AT&amp;T and other telephone companies. Earnings from continuing operations were Dollars 63m in the first quarter of 1990. Sales dipped to Dollars 2.3bn from almost Dollars 2.5bn, and the order backlog plunged to Dollars 22.7bn from Dollars 27.7bn. In both cases, the drop was blamed on the Pentagon's decision to scrap the A-12 attack aircraft programme. General Dynamics took a large charge on the A-12 last year to reflect the uncertain outcome of legal claims it has launched against the US government. Mr William Anders, chief executive, said the earnings 'are right in line with our plan'. Mr Anders' strategy includes an emphasis on cash flow, which has resulted in a far-reaching austerity drive to maintain margins in a declining market. General Dynamics cut its workforce to 90,900 from 98,100 during the first quarter, and is chopping capital spending this year by 46 per cent. The research and development budget has been trimmed by 18 per cent in the past year to an annual rate of about Dollars 200m. As domestic defence business slips, the company is working hard to expand its penetration of the international market. Thiokol, another defence and space contractor, posted a small increase in net income in the March quarter to Dollars 11.6m (60 cents a share) from Dollars 10.5m (54 cents) a year earlier. Sales climbed by 7.8 per cent to Dollars 307.9m. A 25 per cent tumble in operating income from space business was offset by a strong performance in some military sectors and higher interest income.</p>

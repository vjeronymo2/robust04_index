			<p>BFN     [Text] There is a danger of the fighting in Rwanda  spreading between the Rwandan Army and the Rwanda Patriotic  Front [RPF], which is marching toward the capital to link up  with its forces in the town. The RPF forces could reach Kigali  this morning if they do not meet too much resistance. What is  the RPF's aim? We spoke to Emile Roua Massirabo, one of the  RPF's leaders in Kampala, Uganda:    [Begin Massirabo recording] We have to get to Kigali. This  is quite obvious. We have to arrive in Kigali to save and to  aid the population, which is being massacred at this very  moment. Our forces are advancing on Kigali. I can't tell you  exactly where they are right now, but they are advancing along  the road from the north. We want to put an end to the massacres.  We want to arrest those responsible for these massacres, so as  to put the country back on the democratic path. The opposition  forces have systematically been exterminated. It has never been  our aim to seize power. [end recording]</p>

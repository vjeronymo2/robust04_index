			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 20 TASS -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin will not suspend his decree on fighting gangsterism in  Russia, presidential chief of staff Sergey Filatov said on  Monday.    Filatov told ITAR-TASS that despite the State Duma's  recommendation to suspend the decree on urgent measures to  protect the population from gangsterism, "Boris Yeltsin has no  intention to backtrack from his decision."    Commenting on the president's aides' position, Filatov said  that "for two years there have been the talks about the need to  fight crime, but anti-crime legislation has not moved a step  forward." The last few years have been marked by the thriving of  such dangerous forms of crime as terrorism and gangsterism.  Criminal gangs have brought society to the verge of war.  People are losing confidence and faith that bodies of power can  protect them, he said.    Filatov believes that the decree is very timely.    Explaining why the president allowed the police to detain  suspects for 30 instead of three days as envisaged by the  current criminal code, Filatov said that not less than 50 per  cent of crimes are committed by outside hoods. But 72 hours are  not enough to find evidence and trace criminal groupings.  Criminals go abroad and avoid the inevitability of punishment.  A 30-day detention will allow (the police) to bring the  majority of criminal cases to court.    At the same time, Filatov did not hide his concern that the  implementation of the decree may cause human rights abuses. To  minimise the possible negative impact of the decree, Filatov  suggested strengthening the role of the public prosecutor's  office, the Russian High Commissioner for Human Rights and the  Russian Presidential Commission for Human Rights.    Filatov said that the leaders of Russian regions have  supported Yeltsin's measures to fight organised crime.</p>

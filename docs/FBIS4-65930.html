			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer by </F> Rainer Hupe and Annette Littmann in his office in Frankfurt;  date not given: "We Always Need a Bit of Good Luck"]    [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank  lowered the key interest rates by half a percentage point, more  than it has done in a long time. Did Federal Chancellor Helmut  Kohl thank you for this nice election aid?    [Tietmeyer] It has nothing to do with an election aid. But  public reaction, including from the opposition, was mostly  favorable. By the way, compared with the past, it was not an  unusually large step.    [DER SPIEGEL] It is unusual for the recent past. Despite  the recession, you lowered the discount rate by a mere quarter  percentage point several times.    [Tietmeyer] Two factors were decisive for us. On the one  hand, the stability prospects have clearly improved, and the  German mark is strong. On the other hand, there was too much  liquidity by the turn of the year, which increases the money  supply. In addition, owing to the turmoil in international  financial markets, investors were uncertain about the further  course of long-term interest rates and waited with their  investment. We believe that in this situation, lowering  short-term interest rates could help promote the formation of  capital.    [DER SPIEGEL] The liquidity increase was a result of tax  policy. Capital was deducted from investment funds because of  the increase of the capital yields tax.    [Tietmeyer] Right, tax policy changes initially inflated the  money supply, and the stimulus for swift reinvestment in the  capital market was small, given the relatively small difference  between short- and long-term interest rates and the uncertainty  I mentioned earlier.    [DER SPIEGEL] Did the economic cycle play a role in your  decision?    [Tietmeyer] Of course, we always also consider the economic  situation. However, we do not pursue an anticyclical policy,  but a longer-term stability policy oriented at the money supply.    [DER SPIEGEL] Nonetheless, the Bundesbank is the only  institution able to move something regarding the cycle. Fiscal  policy is blocked because of budget deficits. In this role, you  can certainly make policy.    [Tietmeyer] It is the Bundesbank's role to create stable  conditions for growth. That is our task, and we think it is the  best way to serve the economic cycle.    [DER SPIEGEL] How do you assess the current cyclical  situation? Officials in Bonn are already talking about  recovery. The mood there seems to be much better than the  situation.    [Tietmeyer] Export orders have been increasing for some time  now. Capacity utilization in German industry is increasing  again, business expectations are clearly improving. These are  important conditions for the second step of the classical German  recovery pattern -- an increase in the domestic investment  demand -- to follow.    [DER SPIEGEL] Has recovery set in, or are these only initial  signs?    [Tietmeyer] The first step can be seen. Now we hope that  the domestic investment demand will increase soon.    [DER SPIEGEL] This is influenced by interest rates. Was  this the reason you agreed to lower the interest rates  substantially?    [Tietmeyer] The real interest rates have been relatively low  for some time, including long-term interest rates, which are  particularly important for investment financing. On the  monetary side, we do not see any obstacle to economic recovery.    [DER SPIEGEL] Are commercial banks hindering recovery? They  have been accused time and again of failing to pass on, or pass  on in time, interest rate cuts.    [Tietmeyer] In a highly competitive banking system, changes  in refinancing conditions will be passed on -- regarding both  debit and credit interest. Perhaps this could occasionally have  been done faster.    [DER SPIEGEL] When, for instance?    [Tietmeyer] When we lowered our minimum reserves, it took  some time for the markets to react.    [DER SPIEGEL] We have the impression that you changed your  opinion within two weeks. You said early in May that the danger  of inflation was not yet banned, and therefore, the Bundesbank  had to "proceed very carefully."    [Tietmeyer] This impression is clearly wrong. There is no  change in our argument. We also proceeded carefully at this  time.    [DER SPIEGEL] Your counterpart, Hans-Juergen Koebnick, the  president of the Land Central Bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and  Saarland, early this month called for clear interest rate cuts  by at least half a percentage point. Did he and his group of  supporters assert themselves in the Central Bank Council?    [Tietmeyer] There are no groups in the Central Bank Council,  but personages with independent minds. It is in the Central  Bank Council that opinions are formed and decisions made. In  this case, a Central Bank Council member announced his opinion  in advance. I prefer such discussions being held within the  Central Bank Council.    [DER SPIEGEL] How much will the key interest rates have to  be lowered for the cycle to accelerate?    [Tietmeyer] Our recent decision has cleared the horizon for  the next few months.    [DER SPIEGEL] Until after the summer recess?    [Tietmeyer] We are examining the situation continuously, but  now we must wait and see how the monetary situation in our  country is developing.    [DER SPIEGEL] In recent months, you revised your interest  rate decisions almost every month. In all these cases, the  impression was promptly created that something had to be  improved in this respect.    [Tietmeyer] Revised and improved are not the correct terms.  We took cautious steps. I cannot make a decision that applies  indefinitely. We do think, however, that the state of affairs is  quite acceptable in the foreseeable future.    [DER SPIEGEL] The impression has been created that the  Bundesbank is lacking orientation and fails to act on a  long-term basis.    [Tietmeyer] This impression is wrong and is not reflected in  the reaction of the markets. The German mark has remained  externally strong and has internally stabilized. The rate of  inflation is decreasing. It is now important for us to get the  money supply expansion under control. We had to abandon the  high interest rate level, without creating new inflationary  dangers, and without jeopardizing the German mark in proportion  to other currencies. We had an interest rate advance over the  United States of more than 6 percent. This lead has meanwhile  decreased to approximately 1 percent, without the external value  of the German mark having been jeopardized. I consider this a  mark of confidence. The international markets have realized that  the Bundesbank has not changed and will not change its course.    [DER SPIEGEL] You personally contributed your share to  create such uncertainty by publishing the money supply figure in  January. It was thoughtless not to comment on the more than 20  percent expansion. As a result, the financial markets were  plunged in turmoil.    [Tietmeyer] The turmoil had begun a day earlier in the  United States. Nonetheless, the January publication was by no  means an excellent performance of the Bundesbank.    [DER SPIEGEL] Will you keep to the money supply target in  1994? Your target is between 4 and 6 percent. In each of the  first three months, you had two-digit growth rates.    [Tietmeyer] We will see by the end of the year. As usual,  we will review our annual target in the light of the information  available in July. Even if we exceed our own annual target  once, this does not automatically spell the danger of  inflationary development. In the past, we also occasionally  exceeded our target. It very much depends on how -- in the  eighties, for instance -- the money supply grows over a  medium-term period, and medium-term does not mean 12 months.    [DER SPIEGEL] If it had happened just once; 1994 would be  the third time in a row.    [Tietmeyer] But the extent to which we missed the target  differed considerably in each case. In addition, we had quite a  number of special factors -- German unity, exchange rate  turmoil, interventions, new tax laws, and so on. This  substantially complicated a precise control of the money supply.    [DER SPIEGEL] Would it then not have been better to at  least suspend the money supply concept temporarily or find an  entirely new concept?    [Tietmeyer] Definitely not. Look at the results of other  central banks in comparison with ours. As a general tendency,  we have always had better results. However, the money supply is  not a robot that could tell us in any given situation what to do.    [DER SPIEGEL] Critics have accused the Bundesbank of giving  priority to monetary stability for too long, regardless of the  cycle at home and in the other EU [European Union] member states  on which high interest rates were imposed.    [Tietmeyer] We do not see price stability as an isolated  factor. However, without restoring monetary stability in  Germany, we can neither achieve longer term growth nor a longer  term improvement in employment conditions. That is also  important for Europe. Of course, we do not live on an island,  but in an international community and must therefore consider  well the repercussions of our policy on others. That is what we  have done, even though one can always argue on the degree.  However, I have heard no criticism of our policy from other  European countries for some time now, and even less from my  counterparts.    [DER SPIEGEL] You were lucky to be able to lower the  interest  rates now. If the dollar were stronger, the Bundesbank could  not ignore the increasing U.S. interest rates.    [Tietmeyer] We always need a bit of good luck. But I think  we have less a weak dollar than a stable German mark. Regarding  the dollar, the situation is indisputably a specific one. On  the one hand, this has something to do with the controversies  between the United States and Japan, and on the other, with the  discussion in the United States on whether or not there are  longer term dangers of inflation.    [DER SPIEGEL] Has the trade war between the United States  and Japan shifted to the financial markets? Or can you explain  the weakness of the dollar?    [Tietmeyer] I do not have a complete explanation. But it  also seems to have something to do with the reactions of  Japanese investors. The situation in Japan tempts people  increasingly to keep some of their old yen holdings, or reinvest  them in the yen. In addition, much depends on how the dispute  between Japan and the United States will continue. Over the  longer term, the development of external balances is important.  There is the continuing surplus in Japan and again an  increasing deficit in the United States, whereas our deficit is  gradually decreasing. This is apparently also reflected in the  exchange rates.    [DER SPIEGEL] You had to support the dollar again recently.  Is new turmoil imminent in the international monetary system?    [Tietmeyer] We all have an interest in quiet currency  markets. Extreme fluctuations are never good. I do not think  there will be monetary turmoil.    [DER SPIEGEL] The U.S. Federal Reserve Board has increased  interest rates once again. Does this mean that further interest  rate cuts in Germany are blocked?    [Tietmeyer] Our decisions depend above all on developments  in our own country. Uncertainty in international markets has  also interfered with the readiness for capital formation in  Germany in recent months. The recent U.S. decision has now  created welcome clarity.    [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Tietmeyer, thank you for this interview.</p>

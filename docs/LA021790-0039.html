			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . . : IS THIS AMAZING OR WHAT?  </P> <P> Fishing for catfish and working in community theater -- that's what Arliss  Howard was up to in 1983, just before he auditioned for the TV movie "The Day  After." ABC Circle Films was shooting in Kansas City, Mo., and meeting with  local talent there.  </P> <P> "I walked in and said, 'How you doin?' " Howard remembers, 'I think they were  taken with my manners, 'cause I'm really polite. . . . They said, 'Read this.'  And I read it, and I didn't make any mistakes."  </P> <P> Next thing you know, Howard was on the set in Los Angeles, hanging out with  Jason Robards.  </P> <P> Howard may still seem more Huck Finn than Hollywood, but in the new film "Men  Don't Leave," he's paired with Hollywood leading lady Jessica Lange.  </P> <P> Howard plays Charles, a musician-composer whose experimental music group  includes such sound-makers as an egg-beater and a typewriter. Charles plays the  accordion and, when the widow Beth Macauley (Lange) stumbles into his rehearsal  bearing goodies from a chic eatery, he plays on her heart strings as well.  </P> <P> "Jessica's great," says Howard about his leading lady. "She rehearses full  blast. So when it came time to shoot, it was a breeze. Man, she hooks up. She  really hooks up. We had a lot of fun."  </P> <P> Howard is known for his work in "Tequila Sunrise" and Stanley Kubrick's "Full  Metal Jacket," in which he played Cowboy. Since he finished "Men Don't Leave,"  he's appeared at the Los Angeles Theater Center in "The Geography of Luck" and  in the TV film "I Know My First Name Is Steven."  </P> <P> Howard has no particular plans for the future, but he's not particularly  worried either.  </P> <P> "I like to do a job and, when you finish, you go off fishing . . . or you go to  Europe. And, while you're there, you're like soaking it up. Soaking your life  up. Everything's happening and you're just like, 'Wow, is this amazing or  what?' " DEVON O'BRIEN  </P></p>

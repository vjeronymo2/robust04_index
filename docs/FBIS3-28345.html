Toyoda, 68, will succeed Chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa after the  federation's general meeting scheduled for late May, the  officials said.    Toyoda's selection was endorsed at a meeting between Hiraiwa  and the organization's vice chairmen, they said.    Toyoda, who is currently one of the federation's vice  chairmen, told reporters after the meeting he will seek the  cooperation of other officials in managing the federation.    Hiraiwa, 79, said Toyoda's appointment as his successor will  rejuvenate the federation's leadership.    Toyoda said after the meeting he would emphasize economic  recovery and try to contribute to a healthy growth in the  Japanese economy.    Masaru Hayami, head of the Japan Association of Corporate  Executives (Keizai Doyukai), welcomed the selection of Toyoda as  Keidanren's next chairman, citing automobile trade as the core  of economic relations between Japan and the United States.    He expressed the hope that Toyoda will demonstrate the  leadership, independent of the automobile industry, to cope with  the difficult problems facing the Japanese economy.    Yoshinari Yamashiro, chairman of major steelmaker NKK Corp.,  said the federation will be able to tackle Japan-U.S. trade  problems seriously under the new leadership.    Toyoda emerged as the strongest contender for the post after  Akio Morita, chairman of Sony Corp. and one of the federation's  vice chairmen, became ill last November.    Four vice chairmen of the federation, including Toyoda, are  scheduled to quit their posts after serving two consecutive  four- year terms and three successors have already been  informally selected, Keidanren officials said.    The three new officers will be Sho Nasu, chairman of Tokyo  Electric Power Co., Kenichi Suematsu, president of Sakura Bank,  and Yotaro Kobayashi, chairman of Fuji Xerox Co. They will  replace Ryoichi Kawai, chairman of Komatsu Ltd., Yotaro Iida,  chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., and Hiroshi Saito,  chairman of Nippon Steel Corp.</p>

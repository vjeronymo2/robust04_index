			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LETHAL SECTION OF I-5 TO GET GUARDRAIL;  </P> <P> HIGHWAY SAFETY: THE $1.8-MILLION PROJECT BEGAN ALONG A 13-MILE STRETCH OF THE  FREEWAY NEAR GORMAN. SIX PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN HEAD-ON COLLISIONS THERE THIS  YEAR.  </P> <P> Caltrans began a $1.8-million dollar project this week to install a center  guardrail on the Golden State Freeway along a stretch of road in northern Los  Angeles County where six motorists have died in head-on collisions this year.  </P> <P> The steel barriers will be placed along a 13-mile stretch of the freeway going  north from Templin Highway near Castaic Lake to Hungry Valley Road near Gorman.  </P> <P> Caltrans spokesman Thomas Knox said actual construction could begin any day.  Contractors began stockpiling rails to be used for the project at a Templin  Highway storage yard Monday.  </P> <P> Authorities said the Interstate 5 project, which was approved by the state more  than a year ago, is expected to be completed by February.  </P> <P> "This is good news because of the accidents we've been having," said Capt.  Terry Horan, head of the California Highway Patrol's Newhall district, which  includes the area where the barrier will be installed.  </P> <P> "This will make it safer," Horan said. "The head-on collisions demonstrated the  need for a barrier. There were fatals; there were accidents where a blown tire  could send cars into the other side."  </P> <P> The four northbound and four southbound lanes of the freeway -- the major  artery linking the Southland with the San Joaquin Valley -- are divided by  guardrails or canyons throughout the Santa Clarita Valley. But the separation  ends from Templin Highway north to California 138 above Hungry Valley. Along  this stretch, the northbound and southbound lanes are separated only by a  36-foot-wide gravel median that dips in the center.  </P> <P> The guardrail project is part of a statewide plan to add safety barriers along  the entire length of Interstate 5 as increased population and traffic dictates,  officials said.  </P> <P> CHP officers said that in recent years there have been numerous accidents along  the stretch that were caused when cars crossed the center strip into oncoming  traffic. Since April, six people have been killed in four separate accidents  involving head-on collisions.  </P> <P> In addition to the deaths, the accidents often cause massive traffic snarls on  both sides of the freeway -- the state's major north-south artery. On Aug. 5, a  head-on collision in Sunday evening traffic near Templin Highway left one  motorist dead and delayed weekend travelers more than two hours.  </P> <P> CHP Officer Steve Cortes, who has patrolled the stretch through open,  mountainous country, said the area is heavily traveled by trucks and motorists  making lengthy drives to or from Northern California. He said that several of  the accidents he has investigated there involved drivers who fell asleep and  drifted into oncoming traffic.  </P> <P> "It's going to prevent a lot of serious accidents," Cortes said of the new  center guardrail.  </P> <P> Cortes said that once while chasing a speeding car along the stretch, his  patrol car blew a tire and veered across the center median and all four  oncoming lanes. It was 3 a.m. and traffic was light. He and his partner came  out of it shaken but unscathed.  </P></p>

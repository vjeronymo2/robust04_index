			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Survey of Korean Financial Markets (3): Youth and modesty contributing factors - Profile, Shinhan Bank MEDIUM-SIZED Shinhan Bank has emerged as one of the best performers in South Korea's troubled banking sector. Shinhan, founded in 1982 by a group of Korean businessmen living in Japan, was the first of seven commercial banks created over the past decade as part of a government policy to foster competition against the country's six main city banks. It now ranks as the country's sixth largest bank with 126 branch offices and total assets of Won15,630bn last year, having doubled in size since 1989. Analysts predict that its rapid growth will continue. After posting a 23 per cent growth rate in total assets last year, assets are likely to increase by 16 per cent in 1993 and 21 per cent in 1994, according to one estimate by BZW in Seoul. Although net earnings grew by a meagre 8.3 per cent to Won125.2bn in 1992 and are expected to decline by 4.2 per cent to Won120bn this year due to increased taxation, it still has the third largest bank profits in Korea after the much bigger Korea First and Hanil banks. Operating income, however, is expected to jump by 27 per cent in 1993 and 1994, after growing by 8 per cent last year. Shinhan's relative youth and modest branch network are two reasons it is able to maintain high profit margins and one of the strongest capital bases among Korean banks. The fairly recent establishment of Shinhan has meant that it has not been forced by the government to provide a large amount of the low-interest industrial policy loans that have caused bad debt problems for older banks. Its non-performing loans at the end of 1992 amounted to Won210bn, or 2 per cent of total loans. In contrast, the ratio of non-performing loans for the six main city banks was 8.8 per cent of total credits. This has meant that Shinhan has been able to maintain a strong balance sheet in terms of capital and assets. Most Korean banks will be forced to boost their equity base or keep lending growth in check to fulfil the Bank of International Settlements' global capital adequacy ratio of 8 per cent by 1995. Shinhan, however, already has the highest BIS ratio among commercial banks at 13 per cent. The size of Shinhan's branch network has meant it has so far avoided the overstaffing problems that are reducing profits at other Korean banks. Although wage levels at Shinhan are higher than average for a Korean bank, so is the level of employee productivity. The profit-per-employee ratio is four times the average for the commercial banks. Operational efficiency has contributed to Shinhan's ability to maintain the highest return-on-assets among Korean commercial banks during the past four years. Shinhan also enjoys the highest lending margins among the main commercial banks, with an estimated interest rate spread of 3.5 per cent last year. This reflects its strategy of focusing on lending to small and medium-sized companies. The growth of these businesses is favoured by the government and the central bank is giving cheaper funds to banks willing to lend to them. Shinhan has taken advantage of this policy to increase its lending margins, with its exposure to the small business sector accounting for an estimated 65 per cent of its loan portfolio against 45 per cent for most other banks. 'Shinhan is concentrating on a market niche avoided by most banks which believe that lending to small companies is too risky. But Shinhan is developing a skill in credit analysis that is often lacking in other banks which have relied too much on lending to big corporate customers,' said John Wadle, a banking analyst at BZW. Nonetheless, Shinhan was forced to more than double its loan loss provisions last year when the small business sector suffered a record number of bankruptcies as the government squeezed credit to reduce inflation. Bankruptcies are expected to decline this year and Shinhan is considered fully provisioned for loan losses. The bank is now concentrating on selectively expanding its retail network into rapidly growing urban neighbourhoods, with at least 20 branches being opened a year. It has also recently focused on developing business abroad, particularly in south-east Asia, which is a favoured site for Korean foreign investment.</p>

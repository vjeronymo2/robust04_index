			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Last night the Security Council debated whether  or not to lift the arms embargo that's been in force against  this country for so long. Deputy President Thabo Mbeki was  there to address the council and the message he brought was that  South Africa intended being a good citizen of the world. The  debate evoked considerable comment and overran its scheduled  time by more than two hours. We now we have some excerpts from  the proceedings. [passage omitted]    [Begin Mbeki recording] We therefore view the decisions that  the council will take today as an acceptance by the world body  that we have become a democratic country, and a country that can  be counted on to subscribe and adhere to the pursuits of the  important goals of international peace and security. Like  millions of other people across the globe, we count on this body  to continue to act as a principal protagonist in the global  struggle for peace, security, and stability. We firmly commit  our country, Mr. President, as a member of the United Nations  and as a responsible citizen of the world, to live up to its  obligations in this regard and consequently to contribute what  it can to the making of the peaceful world, which is the right  of the people. Our government and people are determined to  ensure that within our borders we banish from our national life  all those things that make for war and violent conflict.    The successful transition to a democratic order constitutes  the firm foundation for peace which our people have yearned for,  for generations. It constitutes also the basis from which we  will move in the search for a negotiated, just, and stable  regional security system for all the peoples of southern Africa,  which would guarantee the sovereignty of all the countries of  our region and ensure that never again should any country fall  victim to aggression and destabilization. Our country has also  begun discussions to see what further contribution we can make  to the search for peace in Angola and Mozambique, in support of  the efforts of the United Nations, and the governments and  peoples of these two countries. We are also committed, Mr.  President, to participate to the full extent of our abilities in  the efforts spearheaded by the OAU to address the related issues  of peace, security, stability, cooperation, and development on  our continent. We are accordingly ready to begin discussions  with the OAU, the UN, and all concerned with regard to what can  and should be done concerning the tragic situation in Rwanda.  [passage omitted]    I thought it might be appropriate, Mr. President, without  taking too much time of the council, to express our -- our  thanks for the statements that members of council, and members  of the United Nations generally, for the statements that they  have made today -- for the salute they have made to our  President Nelson Mandela, to Deputy President De Klerk, and our  people generally, for the manner in which they have conducted  the process of transition in South Africa and to say, Mr.  President, we shall surely convey to our leadership and our  people the sentiments expressed by this council, members of the  United Nations, and to say we appreciate very much the fact of  the unanimous decision by this council. I'm grateful, Mr.  President, that you make reference to the extent to which our  continent is over-armed, and indeed we thought we needed to  indicate in our own intervention that it certainly was not our  intention to play a role on the African continent, given South  Africa's capacity with regards to armaments production. It  certainly was not our intention to exploit the decision that the  council took today, to worsen a situation on the African  continent which does not need worsening, but needs improving.

This requirement will protect the Department from financial losses in the event an importer places animals in quarantine and then fails to pay outstanding bills. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  July 21, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Dr. Samuel Richeson, Senior Staff Veterinarian, Import-Export Animals Staff, Veterinary Services, APHIS, USDA, room 764, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;8170.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The animal import regulations contained in 9 CFR part 92 (referred to below as the regulations) govern the importation of certain animals into the United States, and require certain animals to be quarantined in the United States as part of their importation. The regulations in &sect;&sect;92.304, 92.404, and 92.504 require importers to pay a reservation fee covering 25 percent of the estimated cost of care, feed, and handling of horses, ruminants, and swine, respectively, to be quarantined in U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) facilities. The fee may not exceed $2,500.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On September 14, 1993, we published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 48003&hyph;48004, Docket No. 93&hyph;073&hyph;1) a proposal to amend the regulations to require importers of horses, ruminants, and swine wishing to use a USDA quarantine facility to pay a reservation fee covering 100 percent of the estimated cost of care, feed, and handling of the animals. We solicited comments concerning our proposal for a 30-day comment period ending October 14, 1993. During that period, we received one comment. The comment, from a horse importer, opposed the proposal, arguing that it would place an undue economic hardship on horse importers. The importer also stated his belief that the majority of horse importers have established credit histories with USDA and that this proposal, if enacted, would punish those importers for the actions of a few.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We recognize that raising the quarantine reservation fee to 100 percent of estimated quarantine costs may inconvenience importers. However, based on our experience conducting quarantines at USDA facilities, we have discovered that requiring only a partial payment of estimated costs prior to quarantine leaves USDA vulnerable to significant financial losses in the event importers abandon their animals in quarantine facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, in 1993, an importer abandoned at a USDA quarantine facility a shipment of camels discovered to be tubercular. Quarantine and subsequent destruction of the camels cost USDA over $100,000. We were unable to recover any expenses beyond the prepaid maximum reservation fee of $2,500, as the importer, who was neither a United States citizen nor resident, left the country. There have been several other cases in the last few years where USDA lost considerable sums due to nonpayment for quarantine services and/or abandonment of animals in quarantine. Two cases have involved horse imports; in one case, USDA lost more than $30,000, in the other, about $11,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By requiring quarantine reservation fees of 100 percent of estimated costs, this action will provide USDA with protection against these sorts of financial losses. Though this action undoubtedly will inconvenience importers, we believe it is imperative to prevent any further loss of Federal resources because of nonpayment for quarantine services and/or abandonment of animals in quarantine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Forfeiture of Quarantine Reservation Fees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulations in &sect;&sect;92.304(a)(3)(iv), 92.404(a)(4)(iv), and 92.504(a)(4)(iv) require importers to forfeit 100 percent of their quarantine reservation fees in the event they fail to present their animals for entry at USDA quarantine facilities within 24 hours of the designated time of arrival, and if they fail to qualify for any of the exemptions from forfeiture specified in the regulations. This action does not revise those regulations. However, animal importers failing to present their animals as required will stand to forfeit a larger sum since this action raises the quarantine fee from 25 percent to 100 percent of estimated quarantine costs. Increasing the possible forfeiture amount hopefully will deter importers from frivolously reserving quarantine space and will further protect USDA from financial losses in the event we reserve space at a quarantine facility for an importer who fails to present his animals for quarantine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule and in this document, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as a final rule.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Requiring horse, ruminant, and swine importers to pay reservation fees covering 100 percent of estimated quarantine costs will have no significant economic consequences. Importers will pay the same fees as previously required, only sooner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12778  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and local laws and regulations that are in conflict with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 92 CFR Part 92  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Animal diseases, Imports, Livestock, Poultry and poultry products, Quarantine, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, 9 CFR part 92 is amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=56 g=1 f=1 --> PART 92_IMPORTATION OF CERTAIN ANIMALS AND POULTRY AND CERTAIN ANIMAL AND POULTRY PRODUCTS; INSPECTION AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN MEANS OF CONVEYANCE AND SHIPPING CONTAINERS THEREON  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

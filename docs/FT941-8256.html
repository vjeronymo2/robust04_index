			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Mitigating mortgage risks Sir, I read with interest Barry Riley's article, 'Yielding no quarter' (February 12-13), which discussed the problems in managing the risks inherent in meeting the demand for fixed rate mortgages from a floating rate funding base. I was surprised that no mention was made of the modern risk management techniques available to mitigate and control such risks, in particular derivatives. This omission is all the more surprising since building societies are already extensive users of such instruments.

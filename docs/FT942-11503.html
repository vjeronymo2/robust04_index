			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: Silvermines recovers to IPounds 1.57m Following the rationalisation and cost cutting of 1992, Silvermines, the electrical services and property group, returned to profits last year with IPounds 1.57m (Pounds 1.54m) pre-tax, against restated losses of IPounds 9.71m. The result was helped by an exceptional gain of IPounds 648,000 on the sale of a subsidiary. There were exceptional costs last time of IPounds 6.48m. The Dublin-based company is proposing a final dividend of 0.5p - an interim of 1p was declared in 1992 - payable from earnings per share of 3.09p (30.77p losses). Turnover was IPounds 27.2m, against IPounds 36.8m including IPounds 5.01m from discontinued activities. Since the year end the company has acquired Molynx, the closed circuit television company.</p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / International Company News: Stena to allow foreign investors STENA LINE, the Swedish shipping group which acquired Sealink, the UK ferry operator, 18 months ago, announced yesterday that foreign investors would be able to buy shares in the company after next Thursday when trading in its restricted B shares on the Stockholm bourse will come to an end. The formal decision to seek government permission to revoke an alien ownership prohibition clause from Stena's articles of association was taken at last May's shareholders' meeting. In future, all Stena's restricted shares will become unrestricted. The company said it had decided to change its share structure because of 'the increased level of foreign inquiries' it had received, 'not least from interested parties in the UK'.</p>

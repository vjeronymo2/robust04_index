			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- The lower chamber of the  Russian federal legislature, the State Duma, approved today what  Justice Minister Yuriy Kalmykov described as "a document of  prime importance," the first part of the Civil Code of the  Russian Federation designed to regulate the most important  public relations during the country's transition to a market  economy.    The vote was practically unanimous, a rare case in the Duma,  even though it was preceded by a heated debate. Many speakers  still remember too well the Soviet Civil Code adopted 30 years  ago. Common sense prevailed eventually and the chamber approved  the document after the Agrarian Faction insisted on a  significant amendment.    In preparing the document for second reading, the drafters  were instructed to proceed from the assumption that the  alienation and use of land and other natural resources is  regulated by civil legislation in as much as land and other  natural resources can be an object of civil turnover under land,  agrarian and other legislation concerning natural resources.</p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Lack of exceptional credit leaves Borthwicks lower Interim pre-tax profits at Borthwicks, the natural flavours company, fell from Pounds 1.28m to Pounds 1.13m in the first results since the company completed its exit from the meat processing industry. Figures for the half year to September 25 were distorted by a one-off Pounds 442,000 credit booked in the comparative period related to tax on a New Zealand lamb contract which had been sold. Sales fell by more than a third to Pounds 14.9m (Pounds 23.2m). Turnover in continuing businesses increased to Pounds 14.5m (Pounds 12.9m). 'As far as the future is concerned, clearly we are going for organic growth but we are also working on joint ventures and partnerships and are searching for acquisitions,' said Mr Peter Brackenridge, chief executive. 'In the UK, despite a difficult economic situation, and despite the well-documented price pressure from Mr Sainsbury and Mr Tesco et al, we did increase sales from the UK operations, although operating margins slipped.' Borthwicks said operating margins in the UK businesses fell to a little more than 9 per cent (10 per cent) over the period partly because of price pressure and partly because of sterling's devaluation which affected more than 60 per cent of raw materials. Operating margins across continuing businesses fell to 8.5 per cent (8.8 per cent). Interest charges dropped to Pounds 142,000 (Pounds 324,000), reflecting disposals in the second half of last year. Net borrowings fell to Pounds 3.82m (Pounds 6.62m) but had climbed Pounds 500,000 since the year end. Gearing was 47.5 per cent (58.6 per cent). Unrelieved tax losses of Pounds 4.7m and planned US tax losses of Pounds 6m should ensure a tax charge of about 13 per cent for 'the foreseeable future'. The interim dividend is maintained at 0.5p although earnings per share fell to 1.6p (1.9p).</p>

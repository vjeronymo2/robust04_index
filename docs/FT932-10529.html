			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Bosnia's safe-havens: 'lines in the sand' THE international community is drawing lines in the sand if it does not put muscle behind its decision to create 'safe areas' in six Bosnian towns, according to diplomats and United Nations officials. The Security Council on Thursday approved the despatch of 50 military monitors to the six towns, which include Srebrenica, the fallen eastern enclave. The additional monitors would bolster a force of some 9,000 peacekeepers currently deployed to protect humanitarian aid convoys in Bosnia. But UN officials and diplomats worry that 50 UN officers will be inadequate to monitor the safe areas, the last remaining Moslem strongholds in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Mr Cedric Thornberry, deputy chief of the UN Protection Force said yesterday: 'I would not like to hazard a guess as to how many troops would be needed to fulfil the functions of safe areas'. SARAJEVO: Some 360,000 people are trapped, entirely dependent on international relief. Most of the aid reaches the city through overland convoys from Belgrade, the Serbian capital. Renewed fighting between Moslem and Croat forces has halted convoys from Split, the Croatian port, which has increased the importance of the Belgrade-Sarajevo route. The humanitarian airlift to Sarajevo airport, in operation since July, has helped especially when clashes have blocked aid routes. Serb forces have besieged Sarajevo for 13 months. Artillery from the surrounding mountains has pounded the capital, damaging or reducing to rubble centuries-old mosques and churches which bear testimony to the city's rich cultural heritage. 'Sarajevo yesterday had a remarkably quiet day. Only 36 rounds fell on Serb-held positions and 13 on the government side,' said Mr Thornberry. BIHAC: The north-western town set in the Moslem heartland, has been surrounded by Serb forces since last summer but has not been under constant attack. An assault last week by Serb paramilitaries from neighbouring Croatia was described by Mr Thornberry as evidence of 'two way ethnic cleansing'. Relief workers say the 270,000 people in Bihac, including Moslems from surrounding villages who were expelled by Serb forces, rely on outside food aid for survival. TUZLA: UN relief workers say Tuzla's population of 125,000 has more than doubled with refugees, mostly fleeing the Serb onslaught on eastern Bosnia. Once a major industrial centre the north-eastern city is now cut off by Serb forces, while Croat troops police the only open route to the city, blocking it at will. Mr Jose Maria Mendiluce of UNHCR says Tuzla authorities have performed 'miracles' in coping with the influx of refugees. City officials have taken over the distribution of food, and even bread is rationed. About 80 per cent of food aid is delivered through Serb lines from Belgrade. Serb mortar rounds frequently hit what was the only city in Bosnia where liberal, non-ethnic parties were elected in the republic's first multi-party elections in 1990. While Tuzla symbolises free Bosnia, relief workers worry about how much longer Tuzla will manage to shelter streams of traumatised refugees and defeated soldiers and still manage to retain its multi-ethnic character. SREBRENICA: A company of 150 Canadian peacekeepers last month finally crossed Serb lines to reach Srebrenica, set in the foothills of the Drina River valley. Besieged for 11 months, Bosnian Serb commanders agreed to allow UN peacekeepers into the town if the Moslems defenders were disarmed. Srebrenica's peace-time population of 8,000 tripled with Moslems seeking sanctuary from Serb troops burning and looting surrounding villages. The enclave, which has shrunk to an area of about 8km by 14km, shelters an additional 28,000 people in the immediate surroundings, according to UN officials. Relief workers are trying to repair the town's power lines, cut since last May. Most of the inhabitants are afflicted with scabies and body lice. Many have been made refugees several times over in the past year and are anxious to leave, lacking confidence that the UN will be able to protect them. GORAZDE: An industrial town in south-eastern Bosnia, it is believed to shelter 60,000-80,000 people. 'The situation is very critical. There are no food reserves. The local population is living off the land to a great extent,' reports Ms Lyndall Sachs of UNHCR. Water supply is adequate because the town is set on the River Drina. Overland convoys have reached the town, but usually encounter considerable delays at Serb checkpoints. UN officials believe the food provision was improved by the US air drop of food and medicine pallets. Doctors, speaking via radio amateurs, which as in most of the enclaves represent the only link to the outside world, say there is a grave shortage of insulin. ZEPA: Aid workers say the situation in Zepa, set deep in a narrow valley in the mountains of eastern Bosnia, is most critical. Bosnian radio said yesterday the village was under attack from Serb forces positioned on the mountain tops. Just three convoys, carrying 180,000 tonnes of food and medicines, have reached the remote village since the war erupted 13 months ago. Unconfirmed reports from radio amateurs yesterday said 200 Moslems were killed in a Serb attack from Han Pijesak, their mountain stronghold. Negotiations were underway on the deployment of UN military observers to the village, said Bosnian radio. Dramatic reports two months ago said the 28,000-30,000 people were barely surviving. Food reserves had been depleted and inhabitants were eating bread baked from wild grains.</p>

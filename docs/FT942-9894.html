			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Scott may call more witnesses Lord Justice Scott may call more witnesses to give evidence to the inquiry into the exporting of defence-related equipment to Iraq, officials indicated yesterday. The scheduled public hearings, which have lasted just over a year, ended yesterday when officials from Customs and Excise completed giving evidence. Their presence had already caused the inquiry to extend its original April 1 deadline. Even if more witnesses are called, Lord Justice Scott is expected to keep to his original timetable and complete his draft report by July, with the final report due to be published by December. Provisional criticisms will be sent in August to those concerned.</p>

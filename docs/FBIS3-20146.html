			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Randah Taqiyy-al-Din and Arlit Khuri: "Juppe: </F> We Fear That Lebanon May Pay Price for Syria's Participation in  Settlement"]    [Excerpts] Paris -- French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe  said yesterday that there is concern over Lebanon's sovereignty  and unity, stressing France's refusal to allow the abandonment  of Lebanese sovereignty to be the price for Syria's  participation in the peace process. He said that the disbanding  of the "Lebanese Forces" while Hizballah continues to retain its  weapons is tantamount to adopting a double standard. However,  he stressed his support for the Lebanese Government, pointing  out that the meeting he is going to hold today (Friday) with  Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri is the sixth of its kind in one  year. [passage omitted]    During a breakfast banquet he held at the French Foreign  Ministry with a number of Arab journalists in Paris, Juppe dealt  with the situation in Algeria. He stressed that there has been  no change in French policy toward Algeria, emphasizing France's  willingness to support it financially. He pointed out that a  new development is the appeal to French nationals "whose  presence in Algeria is not essential" to return to their country  because of the deteriorating security situation, which he hopes  is temporary.    He stressed that French policy in the Middle East is still  balanced and that his country is committed to the relations  binding it to the Arab states and Israel.    With regard to Iraq, Juppe said that the information  available to the United Nations about Iraqi weapons of mass  destruction justifies an experimental phase, whose date is to be  determined by the international committee.    On his opinion of the Lebanese Government's decision to  disband the "Lebanese Forces" and prevent -- temporarily -- the  media services in Lebanon from broadcasting [political] news  bulletins, Juppe said that, "if that is true, it is not possible  to settle problems by gagging the press." [passage omitted]    He added: "When we say that we are eager to prevent Lebanon  from paying the price for peace in the region, this is clear --  and I have emphasized this before in Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt.  Frankly, we do not want Lebanon's sovereignty to be the price  for persuading Syria to participate in the peace process."    However, he added: "We have good relations with Syria, and  we hope to keep them so. But we continue to stress the need for  Lebanon to regain its sovereignty and territorial integrity."    Asked whether he was concerned about Lebanon's sovereinty  and  unity, Juppe said: "Yes there is concern. Who is saying what I  am saying? I hope other states will start to do so as well."    With regard to the withdrawal of Israeli forces from  Lebanon,  he said that "the Lebanese Government's position urging Israel's  willingness to withdraw in accordance with Resolution 425 and to  negotiate a timetable does not conflict with my reasoning. Once  the security problem in southern Lebanon is solved, there will  be no need for foreign forces to remain in Lebanon."    Asked whether he believes it is fair to disband the  "Lebanese  Forces" while Hizballah retains its weapons, Juppe said: "It  reflects a double standard." [passage omitted]    He said that the "ugly crime committed against two  Frenchmen in Algeria increases the number of French killed there  to eight so far. As a result of the deterioration there, we  have urged our nationals whose presence in Algeria is not  essential to return to France. It is a matter of conscience.  Some saw this as playing the extremists' game. But do we have  the right to keep our nationals there amid very serious  conditions? I do not believe so."    He added: "I must tell you that we are increasingly  concerned as a result of the escalating violence. And we would  like to hope that dialogue is still possible." He stressed the  need to help Algeria "financially and by rescheduling its debts.  This reflects the fact that France is probably the only country  which offered Algeria 6 billion francs in 1993, and this year  too."    He said that "our ability to intervene (in Algeria) is very  limited and cannot go beyond lending advice. We have for  several months been giving advice regarding the need for  political dialogue and economic change. France cannot do more  than that, and the solutions are in the hands of the Algerian  authorities and the Algerian people." [passage omitted]    Asked whether the French Embassy in Algeria is making  contacts with the Islamists, Juppe said: "Our embassy makes  contacts with anyone who supports dialogue, but, of course, we  have no contacts with those carrying out the assassinations."    Asked whether France intends to provide military aid to  Algeria, Juppe said "no."    With regard to the Middle East, Juppe described as untrue  reports of a change in French policy in the region. "It is not  new to say that France is a friend of both the Arabs and the  Israelis. This has not changed. But it seems that it is not  easy to convince everyone of this." [passage omitted]    Answering a question about Iraq, he said: "We do not need  lessons from anyone at this level. It is natural for French  institutions to prepare for the stage that will follow the  [lifting of] the embargo imposed on Iraq. All the big powers  are working on this basis."    He stressed that the French position on Iraq remainsthe  same,  and it stipulates "the safeguarding of Iraq's unity, on the  grounds that it is a fundamental factor for the region's  stability. Anything liable to harm this unity worries us,  because it would affect stability. Besides, the Security  Council resolutions do not entitle the United Nations to choose  the Iraqi regime. That is not among our aims. It is an Iraqi  question. I am often told that under a totalitarian regime  words are always easier than actions. But this applies to many  of the regimes in the region. France is seeking to compel it  [the Iraqi regime] to fully implement all the international  resolutions adopted against it."    Juppe stressed that "questions related to freedoms and human  rights are not negotiable: Either they are respected or not."    He added: "With regard to the elimination of the weapons of  mass destruction, protracted and thorough investigations have  been conducted in this connection by the special UN committee  headed by Rolf Ekeus and we have noted that the Iraqis responded  to it, sometimes willingly and sometimes unwillingly. On the  basis of the available information, it has been decided to  impose an experimental phase on Iraq to ascertain the extent of  its compliance with the removal of the weapons systems in its  possession."    He stressed that "the special committee has to set a date  for  the start of the experimental phase, because that falls under  its, not France's, jurisdiction."    He said that Iraq had sent a message to the United Nations  in  which it stressed its respect for Kuwait's sovereignty, but  failed to mention respect for the common border.    Asked whether he supports U.S. policy on the dual  containment  of Iraq and Iran, Juppe stressed that "we have no fundamental  disagreement with U.S. policy in the region, but we do not use  the same phrases. What we want from Iraq is implementation of  the international resolutions. As for Iran, we are pusuing a  critical dialogue with it."    He pointed out that "some Iranian positions are causing  problems for us, including, for example, the issue of the writer  Salman Rushdie and Iran's position on the peace process in the  Middle East -- a position which we cannot describe as  constructive. There is also ambiguity in terms of Iran's  relations with some terrorist movements. All this explains the  critical dialogue between us."    With regard to Libya, Juppe said that there has been no  further development in the Libyan position. "They told us in a  message of their willingness to respond to the specified legal  demands, but this willingness has not materialized yet."    On events in Yemen, he expressed his hope that the agreement  signed among Yemeni parties in Amman would be implemented. He  pointed out that "France will participate in the proceedings of  the Omani-Jordanian military observation committee."</p>

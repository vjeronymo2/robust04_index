			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Ford Motor It has not taken long for British-born Mr Alex Trotman to make his mark as Ford's chairman. Mr Trotman, who ran each of Ford's Asia-Pacific, European and North American operations in succession before assuming his current role at the start of the year, is now sweeping those regional baronies away. The geographical structure made sense when long-distance communication was hard but is a hindrance in today's global village. Developing different models for different regions is wasteful, while fuzzy lines of authority make co-operation cumbersome. The reorganisation on product lines follows Ford's previous faltering attempts to create a global car. Plans in the early 1980s to create a single world Escort did not materialise because of squabbling between fiefdoms and, though Ford has managed to create a global car with the Mondeo, it cost Dollars 6bn and took six years. The new structure will allow the same to be done for Ford's whole range but more swiftly and at lower cost. While the upheaval should put Ford in a better position to serve the global market than its main US rivals, it still has a fight on its hands. The anticipated annual Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn savings by 2000 are not huge when set alongside the group's near Dollars 100bn costs. Moreover, Ford lacks an effective strategy for the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region, where its market share is only 2 per cent. Japanese rivals such as Toyota, which have always produced one car for all markets, have a better global reach.</p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading A LATE burst of activity enlivened a quiet session in the futures market yesterday, writes Christopher Price. The March contract opened at 2,448 and was squeezed up to 2,455 by independent traders covering short positions. It then proceeded to trade in a very narrow range in a quiet morning session. A firm opening from Wall Street improved sentiment, but it was not until political factors came into play late in the afternoon that buying started in earnest, taking March to a premium, from a discount to cash where it had traded most of the day. A surge in the Paris bourse, on rumours of the prime minister's resignation and a possible cut in interest rates, was the first factor to stimulate London trading. Further interest was sparked by a rumour of a favourable opinion poll for the British Conservative party in today's press. March closed at 2,465, up 10 points from the previous session and at a two-point premium to the cash market. Volume was a low 4,407 contracts. Trading in the LTOM was also low at 14,000 contracts. Storehouse was the busiest traded option on 1,525 lots, followed by Abbey National on 400 and the Euro-FTSE on 391.</p>

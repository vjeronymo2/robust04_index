			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Tilbury Douglas stable at Pounds 7m aided by acquisition TILBURY DOUGLAS, which is moving up rapidly to join the ranks of large UK contractors, increased first half pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.66m to Pounds 6.98m, writes Andrew Taylor. They would have been lower than last year but for the inclusion of the former Robert M Douglas businesses, acquired in September 1991, for Pounds 85.3m in shares. Earnings per share, on the increased capital, fell from 23.2p to 13.9p. The interim dividend is again 10.5p. Mr Michael Bottjer, chief executive, said the group had embarked on a series of cost cutting exercises, 'recognising that any industry wide recovery is unlikely in the near future.' About 500 jobs had gone following the merger, reducing the labour force to 4,000. Some Pounds 1m had been taken out of the ready-mixed concrete and form work division, mainly through redundancies. The balance sheet, however, remained extremely strong. At the end of June net cash was Pounds 4.8m. Contracting, the biggest division, had benefited from its specialist water, pipework and heavy electrical expertise, which had continued to perform well despite the big downturn in UK construction work. 'It is very difficult for companies which have no experience to break into these specialist markets and margins, although under pressure, have held up better than for general contracting,' said Mr Bottjer. Property, he said, had just about broke even and would have incurred a loss but for the Scottish housebuilding operations, which had underpinned the divisions relatively small operation in the depressed English market. Ready mixed concrete and form work would also have been in loss if the group had not moved swiftly to reduce overheads. COMMENT Tilbury's strengths are its balance sheet and mix of specialist contracting skills which should continue to underpin in recession. Demand for construction from water companies and process plant businesses, such as the petroleum and pharmaceutical industries, have held up far better than other areas of contracting. The mechanical and electrical business similarly has benefited in demand from the recently privatised electricity supply companies and from British Rail, which is in the process of upgrading signalling in the wake of recent rail accidents. Nonetheless, the company is not immune from the construction decline although profits should beat last year's Pounds 15m. The attractions of Tilbury are already in the price.</p>

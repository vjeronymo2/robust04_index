			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Vladimirovich Belov, deputy </F> chairman of the Russian Federation Committee for Patents and  Trademarks, by DELOVOY MIR commentator Igor Krylov, under the  rubric ``Innovations''; place and date not given: ``The Patent  Situation in Russia''--first paragraph is DELOVOY MIR  introduction]    [Text] On 1 September new amounts of the patent fees were  introduced in Russia. But last week in Uzhgorod (Western  Ukraine) delegations of the CIS countries held talks on the  prospects of the creation of a common CIS patent and an  interstate patent office. These events--extremely important ones  for the development of the innovation process--were at the  center of the conversation of DELOVOY MIR commentator Igor  Krylov with Vladimir Belov, deputy chairman of the Russian  Federation Committee for Patents and Trademarks.    [Krylov] Vladimir Vladimirovich, first of all about the main  parameters of the situation: How many applications for patents,  useful models, and trademarks are people now submitting?    [Belov] Last year yielded 34,000 applications for patents,  this year we expect not less than 40,000. The decline has  halted, and invention activity has gone up, though slowly for  the present. From foreign firms 2,313 applications were  received, 9,515 were received from the republics of the CIS. The  breakdown of the granted patents of Russia is also  noteworthy--legal persons receive about 60 percent, inventors  themselves receive the remaining 40 percent. As a whole this  approximately corresponds to world practice.    As is known, the patent law of Russia introduced a deferred  system of examination, but nearly half of the applicants do not  use it--they submit a petition for the conducting of a full  examination at the same time as the application for a patent. In  world practice on the average not more than a fourth of the  applications are submitted with such petitions. Here, I think, a  certain inertia of the thinking of our patent experts and the  lack of a habit for the deferment of the examination for the  present are working. Many applications, incidentally, contain  the request to speed up the publication of the patent and to  give it earlier than the 18 months that are envisaged by the  law. As a rule, this is connected with the patenting of an  invention abroad and other requirements of its quickest  commercialization--advertising, participation in exhibitions,  and others.    The number of applications for trademarks for several years  now has been increasing steadily--in 1992, 29,000 of them were  submitted, the annual increase came to 12.5 percent. Russian  applicants submitted 17,000 applications, 4,000 were submitted  from countries of the CIS, 12,000 were submitted from remote  foreign countries. Incidentally, Ukraine yields on the order of  80 percent of the applications for trademarks and 60 percent of  the applications for patents from nearby foreign countries. Is  this not evidence of the close interweaving of our economies?    In 1992, 2,730 applications for industrial designs were  submitted, and the tendency for the protection of this important  type of industrial property to decline thus far, unfortunately,  has not been overcome. The legal protection of useful models was  introduced with the coming into force of the new patent law--on  14 October 1992. On 1 September 1993 about 100 applications had  been submitted. Apparently, applicants for the present are  taking a close look, but I link precisely with useful models the  hopes for the increase of invention activity. According to my  predictions, in the future not less than half of the  applications for new technical solutions will be received  precisely for useful models.    [Krylov] Do you foresee difficulties in the process of the  examination of useful models and the consideration of disputes  about the legitimacy of the granting or the violation of a  patent for a useful model? For the procedure of the examination  of a useful model, as is known, is at sight--they grant a patent  ``at the risk'' of the applicant, without guarantees.    [Belov] Indeed, conflicts and disputes about the validity of  a patent for a useful model are possible. We do not forecast too  many misunderstandings with regard to useful models. But  nevertheless we are developing a procedure of their examination  before taking them to court. That is, before the submission of  an objection to the Appellate Chamber the interested parties  will be able together with an expert to determine the conformity  to the criteria of patentability of the granted patent for a  useful model. But as a whole, as I have already said, we do not  expect many such disputes--the term of the legal protection of a  useful model is only five years, while the fees for them are  lower than for patents for inventions.    [Krylov] It may, perhaps, interest many people, why they  established the patent fees in fixed amounts, when there is  hyperinflation outside. After all, at the State Motor Vehicle  Inspectorate and so on today they take many fees and fines on  the basis of the amount of the minimum wage.    [Belov] The point is that the maximum term of effect of a  patent is 20 years, while during this time the minimum wage will  be revised so many times.... How is one to calculate the fee? On  the basis of the minimum wage for the year of priority, or the  granting of the patent, or the making of a specific payment?    Moreover, several republics within the Russian Federation  have their own minimum wage norms, which differ from federal  norms. As a whole I believe that it is necessary to allow the  applicant to work under the conditions of stable patent fees, in  spite of the complete instability of the ruble. No one here ever  calculated how much revenue patent fees can yield, to what  extent they are capable of covering the work of the patent  office.... Everything went to the state budget. Now the question  of the division of patent fees is constantly arising during the  discussion of the questions of the establishment of the  Interstate Patent Office of the CIS. Armenia, for example, is  demanding for itself 100 percent of the patent fees....    There is another urgent thing: The model of the patent  convention of the CIS, which is being discussed today, differs  from the European model or the model of the Agreement on  International Patent Cooperation. The applicant, who submitted  an application for a CIS patent during the first year, does not  have the right to choose--he should pay the patent fees in all  the countries that are parties to this agreement. In general  talks on any patent problems of the CIS member countries proceed  slowly and with difficulty. The main result of the meeting held  in Uzhgorod was the fact that we arrived at a preliminary  agreement--30 percent of the patent fees go to the budget of the  Interstate Office, the rest goes to the member countries.    The main problem today consists in the fact that all the  partners to the talks without exception believe: Russia  personally should advance all the expenses on the establishment  of the Interstate Patent Office. They substantiate this by the  inheriting by Russia from the USSR of the property of the former  State Committee for Inventions and Discoveries.    [Krylov] The fact that any property and financial talks of  the CIS member countries proceed with extreme difficulty, is not  surprising. But still is there a convergence of positions? What  has changed in the positions of your colleagues from the young  patent offices of the states of the CIS?    [Belov] I would say that the period of patent euphoria has  ended. They actually understood all the labor intensiveness and  complexity of patent work. Today the complete lack in the patent  offices of the CIS countries of any patent statistics is greatly  complicating the work. And this is when there are still few  applications and it is quite easy to count them.... We,  incidentally, since 1992 have been putting out an annual report  of the Russian Federation Committee for Patents and Trademarks,  which has been completed in accordance with all international  standards of patent statistics. For without clear knowledge of  the patent situation in its own country any patent office simply  cannot operate.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 19. The agency has reviewed the submitted data on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hexachlorophene and concludes that the data do not address the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety concerns expressed by the Antimicrobial I Panel on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingredient. Therefore, the agency is proposing that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hexachlorophene remain available by prescription only. (See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section I.H., comment 13.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20. The agency has evaluated a ``mixed iodophor'' consisting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of iodine complexed by ammonium ether sulfate and polyoxyethylene  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sorbitan monolaurate and found it to be safe for use as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surgical hand scrub and health-care personnel handwash, but there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are insufficient data available to determine its effectiveness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for these uses. Therefore, it is being classified in Category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III. (See section I.I., comment 15.) The other iodine-surfactant complexes classified by the Antimicrobial I Panel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remain in Category III for health-care uses due to a lack of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 21. The agency is including povidone-iodine 5 to 10  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent as a Category I health-care antiseptic ingredient for use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a surgical hand scrub, patient preoperative skin preparation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash. (See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section I.I., comment 17.) As discussed in section I.I., comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16, the agency is not including the warning about the interaction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of iodophors and starch-containing compounds proposed in comment 66 of the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1221). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency is also not including professional labeling to limit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> molecular weight of povidone-iodine or special warnings related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the molecular weight of povidone-iodine. (See section I.I.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment 18.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 22. The agency has evaluated the data submitted on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benzalkonium chloride and determined that the data are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient to establish the efficacy of this ingredient as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patient preoperative skin preparation. (See section I.J.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment 20.) No data were received on other health-care uses of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this ingredient or health-care uses of the two other quaternary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ammonium compounds (benzethonium chloride and methylbenzethonium  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chloride) classified by the Antimicrobial I Panel. Accordingly,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quaternary ammonium compounds remain in Category III as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health-care antiseptics.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 23. The agency has reviewed data submitted on sodium  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oxychlorosene, an ingredient not previously classified for OTC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> topical antiseptic use, and is placing this ingredient in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Category III for both safety and effectiveness. (See section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I.K., comment 22.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 24. The agency has reclassified triclosan up to 1 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from Category II to Category III as a health-care antiseptic for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use as a patient preoperative skin preparation, antiseptic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handwash or health-care personnel handwash, and surgical hand  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scrub. While submitted data indicate that triclosan_when properly formulated_may be effective, data that meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria described in section I.N., comment 28 are needed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish effectiveness. In addition, based upon submitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety data and other information, the agency has reclassified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ingredient from Category III to Category I for safety for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> short-term use as a patient preoperative skin preparation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Triclosan remains classified in Category III for long-term use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surgical hand scrub). (See section I.L., comment 23.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 25. The agency is proposing a number of Category I health-care antiseptic ingredients in this document. All of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingredients included in this proposal as Category I health-care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antiseptic ingredients are standardized and characterized for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality and purity and are included as articles in the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> United States Pharmacopeia or National Formulary (U.S.P./N.F.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ref. 1). However, a number of other ingredients being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered in this rulemaking,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  triclosan and triclocarban  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not listed in the U.S.P./N.F. For an active ingredient to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in an OTC drug final monograph, in addition to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information demonstrating safety and effectiveness, it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to have publicly available sufficient chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information that can be used by all manufacturers to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the ingredient is appropriate for use in their products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency believes that it would be appropriate for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parties interested in upgrading nonmonograph ingredients to monograph status to develop with the United States Pharmacopeial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Convention appropriate standards for the quality and purity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health-care antiseptic ingredients that are not already included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in official compendia. However, should interested parties fail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to provide necessary information so that appropriate standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be established, ingredients otherwise eligible for monograph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> status will not be included in the final monograph.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Reference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) ``United States Pharmacopeia XXII_National Formulary XVII,'' United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc., Rockville,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MD, 1989, pp. 34, 703, 731, and 1119.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 26. The agency is proposing testing requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patient preoperative skin preparation, antiseptic handwash or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health-care personnel handwash, and surgical hand scrub drug  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products in &sect;333.470 of this tentative final monograph. As part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the effectiveness criteria for a patient preoperative skin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preparation, the agency is proposing new testing requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products labeled with the proposed indication ``for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preparation of the skin prior to an injection.'' (See section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I.N., comment 28.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

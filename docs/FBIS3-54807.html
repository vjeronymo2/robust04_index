			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Leonid Okhotin article: "Antiliberal Front: Designers of </F> New Split"]    [Text] The defeated liberals' attempts to create an  "antifascist front" mark the political death throes of a ruling  regime that proved incapable of even creating the illusion of  popularity with elections that bore little relation to  democratic norms. The aggressive logic adopted by the  authorities as they consistently antagonize, humiliate, and  snipe at their political adversaries old and new has made the  political elite totally isolated. Under the spell of their own  omnipotence and thrilled by the passivity of the people and the  demoralization of power structures, the liberals easily  alienated both democrats, patriots, and communists. And now,  faced with the whole spectrum of hostile "Red," "Brown,"  "Red-Brown," "Black," "White," "international," "nationalist,"  people's," elitist," "youth," and "nonyouth" forces, they have  finally become aware of the seriousness of the situation. But,  instead of reconsidering their course, we are once again seeing  the liberals' typical, extremist move: If everyone is against  us, it is necessary to split the opposition and generate a new  civil conflict, and that is also the purpose of proclaiming an  "antifascist" front.    Incidentally, we would point out that the actual creation of  this front is in direct contravention of the law -- even the  Constitution that has just been adopted. The creation of  "antifascist front" branches in the prefectures (that is,  attached to organs of executive power) contravenes the  fundamental provision of the new Constitution regarding the  absence of any ruling ideology in the state (which means the  absence, among other things, of antifascist ideology, which can  only exist as a sociopolitical, but not a state phenomenon on  any account). But the fact that the Constitution was violated  as soon as it was adopted should not surprise those long  accustomed to the dictatorial methods used by the authorities.    On the other hand the idea of an "antifascist front" is  clearly aimed against the election triumph won by Zhirinovskiy's  Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and thus against the voters'  free will, which is the basis of democracy. In other words, in  the wake of the "highly democratic elections" their defeated  organizers are cynically flouting their own constitution and  their own "democracy."    The total absurdity of this postelection behavior by the  liberals is obvious not only to Russians, but also to foreign  political observers. Thus, France's LE MONDE wrote in an  article 21 December 1993 with the following highly significant  question as its headline "Is Western Support for Yeltsin  Justified?": "The main danger to Russia today is not fascism  but the policy pursued by the incumbent authorities." In a  situation where the "overwhelming majority of voters  unequivocally stated that they either do not support Yeltsin's  course or categorically reject it" it is quite unjust to say  that Yeltsin has supposedly won a "third vote of confidence."  Nor did the latest piece of deception as regards early  presidential elections increase the president's influence or  popularity, LE MONDE wrote.    Bearing in mind that France, the democratic LE MONDE in  particular, is an outpost of antifascism and democracy in Europe  it is quite obvious how other, less antifascist countries should  regard the defeated liberals' clownish idea of "antifascism."  Confidence in the current authorities in Russia is on the wane  even among their foreign supporters. Each new step taken to  escalate the political situation meets with increasingly obvious  antipathy.    So it is obvious that provocation is behind the  "antifascist front," but what is its ideological thrust?    One Radio Liberty commentator commenting on the postelection  situation recently made the following unequivocal statement:  "The nationalists' victory jeopardizes reforms in Russia." Let  us ponder this statement, which in effect explains a great deal  about the reforms. If a socialist or communist victory, for  instance, could indeed be logically interpreted as a threat to  liberal (that is, radical capitalist) reforms, on what grounds  are the "interests of reformers" being compared to "national  interests"? Thus, the purpose of the reforms being implemented  by the current authorities, as they themselves see it, is  identified with antinational activity. Otherwise there would  simply have been no panic over Zhirinovskiy's victory, since on  an economic level he supports liberal capitalist  transformations, which should, in his view, however consider  national interests.    Thus, the liberals' undisguised fury toward Zhirinovskiy  represents an expressive feature of the ideological portrait of  the incumbent authorities, revealing that reforms are aimed not  only against a socially oriented economy (socialism), but also  against nationally oriented capitalism.    On a social level the liberals support radical capitalism,  the concepts of Hayek, Friedman, etc., and from the outset this  made them enemies of the Communists. In the sphere of the  economy and the state the Communists were and still are the  radical antipodes of the ruling liberals. This was manifested  particularly clearly at the time of the August putsch and the  subsequent banning of the Communist Party, but at that time  other forces joined the liberals in opposing the Communists --  the social democrats, the democrats, and certain national  anticommunist movements.    The liberal elite began to be "cleansed" of "fellow  travelers" at the next stage. The main target being the  soviets, the social democrats, and other democratic or socially  oriented institutions and political forces. The bombardment of  the parliament put an end to the alliance between the democrats  and the liberals. Even those democrats who did not join the  social democrats, the christian democrats, and the  constitutional democrats in directly defending the White House  were nonetheless in various forms opposed to terror and  dictatorship, opposed to tyranny and authoritarianism. It was  from this moment that a progressive split in public opinion  began, a split reflected in the democratic choice made by such  newspapers as NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA,  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA in part, and MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI (we would  remind you of the very honest reporting of the events of  October) and the opposite liberal choice made by MOSKOVSKIY  KOMSOMOLETS, IZVESTIYA, etc. In principle the division of  Yeltsin's former confederates and supporters into several blocs  during the election campaign also reflected the objective  ideological dissociation between the liberals and democrats in  the ruling strata itself. Travkin represented the most radical  democratic and antiliberal flank, Yavlinskiy was somewhat closer  to the liberals, and Shakhray and the Movement for Democratic  Reforms went further. It was only "Russia's Choice" that acted  as a purely liberal ideological bloc. Thus, the division of the  liberals and democrats lent an ideological tinge to the entire  election campaign.    Zhirinovskiy's victory presented the liberals with a  dilemma:  Either to enter into an alliance with him on the grounds of  their single liberal orientation or to remain true to their  textbooks and spurn national interests as somehow impeding a  "free market." The liberals' total lack of political  flexibility also took its toll this time. Instead of seeking  out allies they set about making themselves new enemies with  threats of executions, guns, and "antifascist committees."  "Fascists" now undoubtedly include not only all "Red-Browns"  but also all democrats, who have been rudely repudiated by the  extremist liberals.    The ideology which, contrary to the statement of the  Constitution, has become the prevailing, dominant one in our  society is the classic Anglo-Saxon liberal ideology, which  denies in a totalitarian manner all other political concepts'  right to exist. This ideology is antisocial and antinational.    We have gotten a one-party state, which is now actively  setting up punitive institutions to preserve the power of the  ruling elite. The European newspapers joked that "the Russians  will now take Lenin out of the Mausoleum and put an embalmed  statue of Adam Smith in his place."    The provocative call for the creation of an "antifascist  front" is politically important for the liberals. The cynicism  and brutality of the "reformists'" liberal measures have  alienated all other political forces that are in any way  different from liberal orthodoxy. An antiliberal alliance of  Communists, nationalists, and democrats is clearly brewing in  the new Duma. Under these conditions, sensing danger, the  liberals decided to urgently provoked a conflict between their  adversaries. If indeed the "antifascist front" even becomes a  temporary, transitory reality the antiliberal opposition's  strategic game will be totally ruined.    Instead of uniting all forces whose ideology focuses on  collective interests (be it the socialists' "socium," the  nationalists' "nation," the democrats' "demos") against the  liberals, who, in accordance with their classic position, insist  on the supremacy of the individual, the "antifascist front"  would like to set the Communists and the democrats against the  nationalists or at least split all opposition movements and  parties, particularly those represented in the Duma, into  supporters and opponents of "fascism." Naturally by "fascism"  the liberals mean any nonliberal ideology, any ideology that  differs from theirs, so the time is nigh when they will use the  term "democratic fascism," devised by extreme Communists, to  abuse their democratic opponents. Similar charges have already  been heard from liberals regarding those who disagree with the  line pursued by "Russia's Choice."    The defeated liberals' "antifascist" adventure would be  ridiculous where it not for the political naivete of our people,  who have difficulty in distinguishing between a vile,  meaningless slogan and a genuine program. Representatives of  the older generation of Communists, certain provincial  democrats, and even some archaic patriots and conservatives may  regrettably succumb to "antifascist" rhetoric.    Having become aware of the perfidious scheme being hatched  by  the liberal "executioners of Russia," all political antiliberal  forces have to find a common platform. The creation of an  "antiliberal front" is on the agenda -- a front which could  include "Reds," "Whites," and "democrats." The existence of  such an "antiliberal front" in the Duma could be the last  opportunity to peacefully remove the uncontrolled "reformers"  from power.</p>

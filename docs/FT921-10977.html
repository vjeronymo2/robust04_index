			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / World Trade News: IBM returns to India for joint computer venture IBM World Trade Corporation of the US and Tata Industries have launched a joint venture in India to make computer systems, along with software development, in which each will have an equity of Rs260m (Pounds 7.1m). The joint venture will be known as Tata Information Systems but IBM representatives maintained yesterday that their commitment to the company was total. Its products will bear the brand name of IBM. The company will be registered in Bangalore. The joint venture marks the return of IBM to India after 15 years. It wound up its operations in 1978 when it was asked to 'Indianise' its ownership under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA), which governs foreign investment. At the time, IBM's worldwide policy was that its subsidiaries in other countries should be fully owned by it. Rather than partly 'Indianise' its ownership, it chose to withdraw from India. Since then, the attitudes of the Indian government and of IBM have changed. FERA provisions have been changed and an equity ownership of 51 per cent is allowed to foreign companies under the new foreign investment policies. Equally, IBM has started joint ventures in other countries without insisting on full ownership. IBM's return to India is considered a breakthrough by the Indian government. It considers it a sign that its liberalised foreign investment policy is becoming acceptable. IBM is making a direct investment of Rs260m under the new policy framework. The joint venture will manufacture high end microprocessor systems. Other IBM products will be taken up in response to market opportunities. Both system and application software will be developed for export and the Indian market. The focus will be on OS/2 and AIX/Unix operating systems. The initial project cost will be about Rs850m and will be funded by equity from Tata and IBM as well as long-term loans. The initial import of capital equipment will be covered by IBM's equity contribution.</p>

			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Move to audit tendering reported A LARGE proportion of UK companies are putting audit contracts out to competitive tender, according to a survey by European Accounting Focus, a monthly newsletter, Andrew Jack writes. Many changed auditor as a result, and all which did so secured a reduction in fees. The findings come as auditors face increasing criticism for cutting fees. The survey covered 26 large companies, audited by one of the six biggest accountancy firms. A quarter had annual audit fees exceeding Pounds 1.5m. Nearly one third had put the audit contract out to tender in the last few years, and two thirds changed auditor as a result. Half the companies gave their firm a score for overall performance of at least eight on a 10-point scale. Half the companies also said the legal responsibilities of auditors should be clarified by statute. Survey of UK finance directors. European Accounting Focus, Brigade House, Parsons Green Lane, London SW6 4TH. Pounds 150.</p>

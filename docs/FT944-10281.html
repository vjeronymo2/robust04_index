			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Transgenic mice make collagen Dutch scientists have bred 'transgenic' mice that are capable of producing human collagen in their milk. This development, which was achieved through injecting the relevant gene into a mouse's fertilised egg, is seen by the researchers as a step towards their goal of producing human collagen from the milk of transgenic dairy cattle. Gene Pharming Europe, a Leiden-based transgenic technology company, working in partnership with Collagen Corporation of California, believes that transgenic farming techniques could be a cost-effective method of producing large volumes of collagen, which is used for the treatment of burns, fractures and stress incontinence.

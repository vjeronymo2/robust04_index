			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUAKES AREN'T TIED TOGETHER, SCIENTISTS SAY  </P> <P> The earthquakes that rattled both Northern and Southern California on  consecutive days this week even startled a few scientists, although they  insisted there is no reason to believe that the widely separated earthquakes  were related events.  </P> <P> "We're uneasy when we see earthquakes popping off all over the place," said  William Ellsworth, a seismologist and geophysicist with the U.S. Geological  Survey in Menlo Park.  </P> <P> But he quickly added that he doesn't think that Tuesday's quakes near Upland  caused Wednesday's quakes near Watsonville.  </P> <P> "If there is a mechanism (that would cause that), we don't understand it,"  Ellsworth said.  </P> <P> Caltech staff seismologist Kate Hutton was a little more succinct. Asked if  earthquakes can cause other temblors hundreds of miles away, she said bluntly:  </P> <P> "No."  </P> <P> The question pops up every time earthquakes strike at about the same time at  widely separated locations, partly because "we tend to see patterns in  everything," Hutton said.  </P> <P> There have been enough quakes in California this week to jangle even the  strongest of nerves. At least 14 quakes, ranging up to 5.3, hit the area  between Watsonville and Santa Cruz Wednesday morning on the heels of a series  of quakes near Upland on Tuesday measuring up to 4.6. The Southern California  desert community of Indio also had two small quakes Wednesday morning measuring  3.2 and 3.8.  </P> <P> When an earthquake strikes, it rearranges stress patterns in the Earth's upper  crust that can cause aftershocks or even other quakes nearby, but "changes (in  stress) even several miles away are minuscule," Hutton said. So she sees no way  that quakes at one end of the state can cause temblors at the other.  </P> <P> However, adjacent areas are another matter entirely, and experts were examining  evidence Wednesday that the Watsonville temblors may indeed have been caused by  the devastating Loma Prieta quake that struck Oct. 17. The Loma Prieta quake  caused extensive damage as far away as San Francisco, and Ellsworth said that  Wednesday's temblors seem to have extended the October rupture southward on the  San Andreas Fault.  </P> <P> If so, Wednesday's earthquakes could offer scientists a classic study in how  some temblors can cause other nearby quakes by redistributing stress patterns  in the Earth's crust.  </P> <P> "It's like a jigsaw puzzle," Ellsworth said. "And we just had a whole bunch of  new pieces dumped into the puzzle all at once."  </P> <P> Earthquakes are caused by the movement of the huge slabs of the Earth's crust,  called tectonic plates. The giant plates literally float on the Earth's molten  mantle, grinding past each other as they move about the surface of the planet.  </P> <P> The Pacific Plate, which underlies nearly the entire Pacific Ocean, and the  North American Plate, which includes nearly the entire continent, grind past  each other along the West Coast. One of the most prominent manifestations of  that process is the San Andreas Fault that rips through the length of  California.  </P> <P> In some areas, the San Andreas moves almost continuously in a process that  allows the plates to pass each other gradually with minimal problems. But in  most areas, the fault sticks like two pieces of sandpaper being rubbed  together. Occasionally, the pieces slip, releasing enormous amounts of energy  through an earthquake.  </P> <P> The interaction of various blocks of the Earth's crust can be extremely  complex, so at this point scientists are struggling to understand the dynamics  of what now appears to be a series of Northern California quakes that began  with the Oct. 17 temblor that killed 67 people.  </P> <P> The October quake hit in the mountains between Santa Cruz and San Jose, and it  struck along a section of the San Andreas that has been seismically "quiet" for  some time, Ellsworth said.  </P> <P> However, when the two plates suddenly slipped in what scientists call the "Loma  Prieta quake" last October, it redistributed stress patterns in nearby blocks  of the Earth's crust, and scientists have been trying ever since to find out  just how the patterns have changed.  </P> <P> While admitting that the evidence is "preliminary," Ellsworth believes they  found out Wednesday just where the stress moved to.  </P> <P> It apparently moved south to the next section of the San Andreas, which has  been relatively active over the years. Wednesday's activity was "much more  vigorous than we have seen in the past," Ellsworth said.  </P> <P> The quakes ranged up to 5.3 in magnitude, and they may not ultimately be  classified as aftershocks to the October temblor because they struck on a  different segment of the fault.  </P> <P> Wednesday's quakes, like all temblors, also changed stress patterns in that  area, but it will be months before scientists figure out which areas are the  most likely candidates for quakes in the near future.  </P> <P> But most experts would agree on at least one point: Wednesday's quakes in  Northern California have nothing to do with the temblors that shook much of  Southern California in recent days.  </P> <P> "It's just too far away," said Caltech's Hutton.  </P> <P> </P> <P> RECENT QUAKE ACTIVITY  </P> <P> While scientists found the succession of earthquakes this week in Northern and  Southern California intriguing, they insist they are not related. Tuesday's  quakes that hit the Upland area did not cause Wednesday's quakes near  Watsonville because the distance between the two areas is just too great, they  say. "When an earthquake happens, it releases strain in the immediate area,"  said Caltech seismologist Kate Hutton, and that can cause aftershocks nearby.  But areas that are farther away are subject to very different geophysical  conditions, and one quake is unlikely to cause another temblor even 20 or 30  miles away.  </P> <P> Watsonville  </P> <P> A swarm of earthquakes struck the Bay Area beginning at 6:37 Wednesday morning.  The largest of the temblors was a magnitude 5.3 quake, with at least 13 others  registering 1.6 or more by nightfall. Seismologists said Wednesday's quakes  resulted from stress patterns created by the 7.1 magnitude Bay Area quake that  killed 67 last October and caused damage estimated at more than $7 billion.  </P> <P> Upland  </P> <P> A daylong series of quakes jolted the Upland area on Tuesday. The quakes, all  aftershocks of a 5.5-magnitude temblor on Feb. 28, measured between 4.6 and 2.6  on the magnitude scale.  </P> <P> Indio  </P> <P> Two quakes struck the Indio area at about 7:30 a.m. Wednesday. One measured 3.8  on the magnitude scale, the other 3.2. Seismologists said both were aftershocks  of a 4.1 quake there earlier this month.  </P></p>

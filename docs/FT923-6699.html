			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Letter: Press is judged by own standards Sir, In your Leader yesterday ('Privacy and the press') you perpetuate an inaccuracy often heard in discussions on this issue. You write that 'the Press Complaints Commission has attempted to set its guidelines in terms of the public interest'. But, to the contrary, the newspaper industry's code of practice, which the commission upholds, was framed by editors. It is fundamental to the new self-regulatory sys-tem that the commission interprets and enforces the guidelines set by editors themselves. Mark Bolland, director, Press Complaints Commission, 1 Salisbury Square, London EC4Y 8AE</p>

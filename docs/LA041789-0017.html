			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'A SIGNAL FOR SHAMIR'  </P> <P> In response to "To Reach a 2-State Solution, Israeli Doves Must Be Heard," by  Prof. Yehoshafat Harkabi, Op-Ed Page, April 4:  </P> <P> Harkabi's is a 3-state not a "2-state solution" -- two Arab Palestinian states  and one Jewish Palestinian state.  </P> <P> Jordan was created by Britain in 1922, and -- occupying 80% of the "Jewish  homeland" purportedly assured to the Jews by its League of Nations mandate and  prior Balfour Declaration -- is an Arab Palestinian state. It is 70%  Palestinian in population.  </P> <P> Adding to that Arab Palestinian state occupying 80% of Palestine, a half of the  remaining 20%, by converting the 10% which is Israel's last security in depth,  i.e., the "territories," to which Harkabi refers, into another Arab Palestinian  state, is a recipe for war, not peace.  </P> <P> For that 10% which Harkabi would give for another Arab Palestinian state  contains the Jordan River crossing, heights and passes; the holder is in a  position to cut off Israel's capital, Jerusalem, its water and principal food  sources. And to cut Israel at its narrow waistline along the sea. It includes  also the seacoast salient leading from Egypt into Israel (Gaza).  </P> <P> And Harkabi is dreaming, indeed, when he analogizes the Arab world, in which  rule is by despots or anarchy (Lebanon) -- to possible membership with  democratic Israel, of a "common market, Benelux or confederation."  </P> <P> LEONARD HORWIN  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

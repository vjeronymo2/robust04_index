			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Delete ``, or (3) has violated the principles governing adequate removal procedures under &sect;417.2(b)'' at the end of proposed &sect;417.16(a). Any member alleging that the local union does not have adequate procedures for the removal of officers guilty of serious misconduct must follow the procedures of subpart A of 29 CFR part 417. Therefore, the international argued that this language is merely a duplication of subpart A procedures for determining whether the union's officer removal procedures are adequate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Change the language in proposed &sect;417.16(a) which reads ``(2) has violated the procedures agreed to with the Director'' to the following: ``(2) with respect to the case which was the subject of the prior application filed with the Office of Labor-Management Standards charging inadequate procedures, has failed to implement the provisions agreed to with the Director.'' The international indicated that this change would clarify that the limits of the authority of the Department in officer removal cases are set by the substantive procedure of section 401(h) of the LMRDA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Change ``Title IV'' in the first sentence of &sect;417.17 to ``section 401(h).'' The international believes that this modification would clarify the scope of the regulation because Title IV is ``certainly inexact and potentially misleading.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both of the other commenters opposed the amendment. The firm of Acuna, Casas &amp; Araiza argued that the amendment is ambiguous as written because it fails to state any steps the Secretary will take after a member has exhausted internal union procedures. They further argued that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is the only judicial decision interpreting the officer removal regulation and, therefore, is not definitive. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Association for Union Democracy, Inc. generally argued that the court's reasoning in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is unpersuasive and the Department should not amend its regulation based on a single court decision. The Association disagreed with the court's reliance on Senate Report No. 187 and the Supreme Court's opinion in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United Steelworkers <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sadlowski <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for the proposition that Congress did not intend for courts to ``interfere'' in internal union affairs. In summary, this organization argued that an analysis of other judicial decisions, the language of Title IV governing the minimum standards for election procedures, the overall purpose of the LMRDA as well as the way in which some unions operate reveal that Congress intended the Secretary to have the authority to compel a union to follow its adequate officer removal procedure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Association for Union Democracy stated, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Our primary concern about the Department's proposal to concede lack of authority in this area stems from our knowledge that union constitutions often do not mean what they say; or they mean only what the union officers say they mean. Indeed there is a whole body of judicial precedent, beginning with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> English <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Cunningham, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  284 F.2d 283 (D.C. Cir. 1980), that accords judicial deference to the interpretation of union constitutions by union officials. Moreover, by virtue of their effective control over the implementation of constitutional process, union officers can often subvert that process and render facially adequate removal procedures meaningless, and thus inadequate in reality. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. The Department's Responses and Decision <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After considering the comments, the Department has decided to amend the regulations governing the officer removal procedures of local labor organizations as proposed at 59 FR 31056 with slight revisions as discussed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We agree with the comments by the labor organizations which support the court's interpretation in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of the Act's officer removal provision as limiting the Secretary's authority to file suit against a union to cases in which the union's officer removal procedure has been determined to be inadequate by the Department. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

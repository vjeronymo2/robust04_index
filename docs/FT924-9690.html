			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: Textiles company tries to recapture a former industrial glory - Arvind will soon be one of the world's largest suppliers of denim cloth ON the outskirts of Ahmedabad, a dusty city in north-western India, engineers are fitting out a new textiles mill with state-of-the-art machinery from Germany and Japan. Bullock carts regularly roll past the site which will soon be one of the world's largest suppliers of denim cloth and also a large producer of material for shirts. This factory is the pride and joy of Mr Sanjay Lalbhai, managing director of Arvind Mills, the biggest employer in Ahmedabad and one of India's largest textiles groups. Mr Lalbhai is trying to win back for Ahmedabad a touch of its former industrial glory. Once known as the Manchester of the east for its vast cotton mills, Ahmedabad has long since lost its pre-eminence in textiles following decades of declining investment. Mr Lalbhai is determined that Arvind, which was founded by his great-grandfather and is controlled by his family, should not follow other companies into liquidation. 'We are very strongly focused on export markets. And we have modernised, unlike some other mills which have made the same products on the same machines for 50 years.' Other large Indian textiles groups are also responding to the government's economic reform programme by investing in export businesses. They have seen how decades of over-dependence on a protected low-margin domestic market has sapped the industry's competitive strengths. Now that the government is promoting exports, they are trying to put a priority on overseas markets for the first time in decades. But few companies are as single-minded in the pursuit of exports as Arvind. It is investing Rs6bn (Dollars 211.1m) in an attempt to increase textiles exports from Rs500m in the year to March 1992 to Rs5bn by the year to March 1994, when fully 60 per cent of turnover is planned to come from overseas sales. It has this year signed a deal with Cluett, Peabody, the US clothing group, for the joint manufacture of shirts. Within the next year, it is planning to become the first Indian textiles group with sales offices overseas - in New York, London and Hong Kong. Mr Lalbhai started preparing these moves long before the reformist government ofprime minister Narasimha Rao took office last year. Arvind's export programme dates back to the mid-1980s when Mr Lalbhai decided the group risked going into decline if it continued to rely on low-margin, low-quality domestic markets. His first reaction was to diversify - into electronics and other growth industries. But these moves have brought only modest success. More important was the decision to upgrade textiles production by greatly increasing exports. Mr Lalbhai believes India has considerable competitive advantages in textiles, including abundant raw cotton, plentiful trained manpower and a long history of textiles manufacture. But he admits Indian companies must overcome some serious disadvantages such as poor infrastructure, little experience of foreign markets and the low-quality image of Indian goods overseas. He adds that while government reforms have improved business conditions in the past year - especially cuts in duties on machinery imports  -severe restrictions remain. Foreign businessmen who have dealt with Arvind say it is a cut above most other Indian textiles companies in quality and efficient service. Mr Lalbhai's ability to project an outward-looking image for Arvind is also not in doubt. But one buying agent in Delhi warned: 'Sanjay (Lalbhai) knows where he wants to take the company. But will the rest of the group follow him? Don't forget this is a very traditional Indian company.' Mr Lalbhai is aware of the challenge. He has made a point of reforming Arvind's recruitment policies - by employing executives from outside the textiles industry. including marketing and production specialists from the Indian subsidiaries of multinational companies. But he admits it is not easy transforming Arvind, let alone the whole Indian textiles industry. 'There are no short cuts. We must convince the clients through years of good service. That's what Japan had to do.'</p>

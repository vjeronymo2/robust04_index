			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Emerging Markets: Market focus remains on the dollar - Currency markets Foreign exchanges will again focus on the dollar this week, with markets anticipating a further tightening of US monetary policy. The dollar has been fairly stable since central banks intervened to support it earlier this month, but further stability presumes that the policy-making Federal Open Markets Committee will lift interest rates when it meets tomorrow. The market is expecting a fairly aggressive tightening, with most observers predicting that the Fed will lift the discount and federal funds rates by 50 basis points. Anything less is likely to lead to a renewed sell-off of the dollar, and further weakness in the US bond market. The two have traded in tandem recently. Last week the dollar gained support from the Bundesbank's aggressive cut of 50 basis points in official interest rates. It also benefited from the Bank of Japan easing monetary policy, by allowing overnight interest rates to fall to their lowest level in 18 months. A tightening from the Fed would represent the final stage in what appears to have been a concerted sequence of monetary policy initiatives, aimed at supporting the dollar, after the initial round of intervention. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London, said that the cut in German rates last week appeared to have given the dollar a solid base against the D-Mark. He said European investors also tended to believe that the dollar would recover from current levels. He is less optimistic, however, about its prospects against the yen. Although US officials have recently been more emollient in their approach towards Japan, Mr Hannah doubts whether this will persist if - as he predicts - the Japanese government fails to deliver on market access measures. He said Japanese investors remained sceptical about the outlook for the dollar. They have a history of poorly performing foreign investments, mostly because of the strength of the yen. Mr Hannah said he could not foresee large Japanese capital flows abroad again 'just because the dollar settles down for a few days.' In the UK a plethora of economic data, including inflation, unemployment and retail sales, will be published. The six 'wise men', who offer advice to the Chancellor on the economy, will deliver their quarterly report, and the minutes of the April monetary policy meeting will be published. The data are expected to confirm that the next move in UK rates will be up, which should support sterling.</p>

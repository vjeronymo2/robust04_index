			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Major confident on US relations: Britain's PM heaps praise on Clinton after Washington visit BRITAIN'S prime minister, Mr John Major, left Washington yesterday offering lavish praise for President Bill Clinton's domestic and foreign policy agenda and voicing confidence that the arrival of a Democrat in the White House would not weaken Anglo-US relations. Reviewing his first meeting with the new president, Mr Major said he was 'in no doubt whatever' that he was committed to an early conclusion of the Gatt world trade talks. Mr Major said he had been given the clear impression that the US would not seek to re-open the so-called Blair House accords on farm trade which would be at the heart of any trade deal. He also gave a broad hint that he settled with Mr Clinton the terms under which a US emissary will be despatched to Northern Ireland. The two had agreed on the priority of a political settlement between the communities in the province, Mr Major said. The president, in the UK view, is under intense pressure from Congress to meet his campaign pledge to take an active role in Ulster. The US political perspective is that this pressure is, by Washington standards, very modest. Nevertheless, Mr Clinton is expected to announce the 'fact-finding' mission within the next week or so. Mr Tom Foley, the speaker of the House of Representatives, may be asked to lead it. The prime minister was determined to show this week that he could establish a good relationship with Mr Clinton. He summed up their meeting with the comment: 'I don't think the relationship could have been any more natural and easy than it has been.' But in a series of interviews with the main US and UK television networks yesterday Mr Major found himself pushed on to the defensive in defending his domestic policies in Britain. Several of the interviewers pressed him on the rising youth crime rate in the UK and on the high and rising level of unemployment. He admitted that the government had made mistakes but insisted that the policies were in place to generate sustained economic recovery. Editorial comment, Page 19</p>

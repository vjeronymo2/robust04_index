			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Low skills 'deter investors to Wales' The success of Wales in winning inward investment is being threatened not only by greater competition but by its lack of labour skills. This is the finding of a report by the Centre for Advanced Studies at the University of Wales, Cardiff, which describes the vocational education and training system in Wales, as elsewhere in the UK, as 'woefully inadequate'. It says that the skills deficit is most acute in the craft and technician category. 'While the UK has been adept at producing an educational elite, it has manifestly failed to equip generations of young people with the vocational skills which are necessary to sustain a modern manufacturing sector.' Wales, with less than 5 per cent of the UK's population, attracted more than 14 per cent of UK inward investment between 1979 and 1991, which helped its manufacturing sector to grow while in the UK as a whole it declined. But the report warns that inward investment is likely to decline sharply during the 1990s. 'Strengthened competition from other regions within Europe, as well as from low-cost locations in eastern Europe and Latin America, coupled with the loss of assisted-area status, will make Wales relatively less attractive.' A further handicap, it says, is the quality of labour and suppliers. Alfred Teves, a German automotive components company at Ebbw Vale, is quoted as describing the calibre of electricians and engineers as 'absolutely poor'. Robert Bosch, the German components and power-tools group at Miskin, near Cardiff, regards its workforce as highly motivated and finds labour costs much lower than in Germany. But managers claim that the labour market in Wales, as in Britain, is like a sandwich. At a higher level, they say, the calibre of personnel is on a par with anywhere in the world, as is the case with semi-skilled or unskilled workers who they consider very adaptable. But they find grave problems at the middle level of supervisors. The report says Sony, the Japanese consumer electronics group at Bridgend, Mid Glamorgan, has been unable to meet its apprentice targets in recent years because of the deteriorating quality of applicants.

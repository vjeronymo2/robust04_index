			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Tea Landed teas met strong and active demand, particularly towards the close, reports the Tea Brokers' Association. Best liquoring and brighter east African teas often gained 5 to 10p and sometimes more. Mediums also realised fully firm to dearer rates but plainer sorts were irregularly easier. Ceylons sold readily and prices tended easier. Offshore; good general demand with brighter teas fully firm and often dearer, but plain descriptions attracted limited enquiry. Quotations quality 160p/kg, good medium 140p/kg, medium 105p/kg, low medium 82p/kg. The highest price realised this week was 164p for a kenya pf. 1.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ion Cristoiu editorial: "The Left Has Fallen Into Ion </F> Iliescu's Subtle Trap"]    [Text] At his news conference held at the end of last  week, Presidency Spokesman Traian Chebeleu announced the signing  by Ion Iliescu of a decree pardoning certain individuals. Among  these "individuals" were the candidate members of the Political  Executive Committee (PEC) [of the former Romanian Communist  Party, PCR] who were sentenced to jail terms after the December  1989 events. The specification "candidate PEC members" was  necessary to dispel the impression that the decree refers to all  participants in the famous PEC meeting of 17 December 1989. The  high presidential goodwill only touched a part of those who  later had to pay for their presence at that meeting. The full  PEC members were not pardoned, which has led to their  complaining about it to the Council of Europe in a letter  published on page 3 of this issue of our daily. The pardoning  of part of those sentenced after December 1989 has caused great  enthusiasm within the Socialist Party of Labor [PSM], the  Greater Romania Party [PRM], the Romanian National Unity Party  [PUNR], and even the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR].  Recently, the left has insistently demanded the release of the  former PEC members. The satisfaction with which the  presidential decree was received resides in the belief that Ion  Iliescu has had to give in. Is this belief justified? If we  read only part of the decree, the answer is positive. However,  if we read the full text, the satisfaction of the PRM, the PSM,  the PUNR, and the conservative group within the PDSR is not all  that justified, for the simple reason that, along with the  former PEC candidate members, eight Hungarian ethnics involved  in the murders committed at Zetea and Dealu in December 1989  were also pardoned. The latter were sentenced in 1990 and 1991  for first degree murder, after killing several Romanian  militiamen on 22 December 1989. The nationalist-communist  forces, represented by the PRM, the PSM, the PUNR, and part of  the PDSR, received with great satisfaction the sentences  pronounced against the Hungarian ethnics. The Democratic Union  of Hungarians in Romania [UDMR] immediately protested and never  ceased to do so since then on. It complained to various  European bodies, including the Council of Europe. The PRM, the  PSM, the PUNR, and part of the PDSR rose against the UDMR's  action. In the press and Parliament, the nationalist-communist  leaders termed the UDMR protest as a destabilizing action and  asked the institutions of the power, headed by the presidency,  not to give in to what they called Hungarian blackmail. The  international pressure to pardon the eight Hungarians became  increasingly greater with each passing day. It was mainly the  Council of Europe that took up the issue of their pardoning.  One of the points of the inspection by the two Council of  Europe rapporteurs [Friedrich Koenig and Gunnar Jansson], due to  start today, is whether Romania released the eight Hungarians.  Ion Iliescu was thus confronted with a dilemma. By keeping the  eight Council of Europe proteges in jail, he risked to incur  great international wrath. By releasing them, he risked the  fury of his left-wing allies. He solved this dilemma in the  well-known Ion Iliescu style, namely through a politically  well-thought maneuver. For the president, the main thing was to  comply with the Council of Europe's requirement. However, this  should be done in such a way as to not upset the  nationalist-communist leaders too much. Therefore, he added the  PEC candidate members to the list of the pardoned people. In  that way, the president tried to reduce to the maximum the  negative impact that the pardoning of the eight Hungarian  ethnics was bound to produce among the left. One might say that  his former party-state colleagues were pardoned thanks to the  eight Hungarians. If it had not been for this complicated  problem, it is more than certain that Ion Iliescu would not have  even thought of freeing those who remained bosses, while he was  demoted to a mere director of a publishing house. One cannot  say that the president did not act cleverly. The PSM, the PRM,  the PUNR, and part of the PDSR overlooked the pardoning of the  eight Hungarian ethnics. Their entire attention concentrated on  the release of the former PEC candidate members. It is easy to  imagine what a hullabaloo would have been if the pardon had only  envisaged the Hungarians. The president would have incurred the  wrath of his allies. Consequently, the pardoning of the former  PEC candidate members is not a sign of weakness from Ion Iliescu  vis-a-vis the left of our political landscape. It should rather  be considered as a subtle trap that the president has set for  the PRM, the PSM, the PUNR, and part of the PDSR. Therefore, a  more careful examination of the situation reveals that these  political forces have no reason to be enthusiastic about the  recent decree signed by Ion Iliescu.</p>

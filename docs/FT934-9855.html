			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Public 'puts high value' on landscape PEOPLE rate environmental protection of the countryside as good value for money, the government said yesterday, Bronwen Maddox writes. The public is prepared to pay five times the current cost of conservation schemes to save traditional English landscapes, said a report commissioned by the Ministry of Agriculture. Publication of the study follows calls by ministers for the costs and benefits of environmental protection to be weighed more carefully. The Centre for Rural Economy at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne asked 3,000 people about the value they put on the countryside and compared it with the cost of the Environmentally Sensitive Areas scheme under which farmers and landowners are paid to conserve some landscapes and habitats. The overall cost of the ESA scheme in England last year was about Pounds 20m  -approximately Pounds 1 per household. Residents of the South Downs area of southern England indicated that they would be prepared to pay an additional Pounds 27.52 a year in taxes to conserve the appearance of the countryside. People from other parts of England indicated that they would pay Pounds 1.98 per household for conservation of the downs, even if they never visited them.</p>

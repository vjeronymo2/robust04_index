			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / International Company News: IBM seeks lifting of decree IBM aims to persuade the US courts to lift restrictions on its computer services business imposed in a 1956 anti-trust consent decree. The decree forces IBM to separate its US 'outsourcing' business, which manages computer centres on behalf of customers, from other operations. IBM lawyers discussed the consent decree with a New York Federal judge yesterday, but have not filed any motions with the court, IBM said. The consent decree arose from a 1952 government complaint which alleged IBM had monopolised the market for tabulating machines, the precursor to the electronic computer. The terms of the decree include orders that IBM must operate its 'service bureaux' business as a separate wholly-owned subsidiary and that the subsidiary must pay for IBM computer equipment and software on the same terms as its competitors in the service business. IBM is also restricted in its sales of used computer equipment by the decree. IBM may only acquire used computers when they are traded in or exchanged for credit on new equipment. The company must then go through a 60-day listing and remarketing procedure before it is allowed to sell the used equipment. 'We think the decree operates to the disadvantage of customers by artificially raising our costs and preventing us from passing on to our customers the benefits of our integrated operations in marketing, services, manufacturing and development,' IBM said. 'The information technology industry of today bears no resemblance to the infant industry of 1956,' said an IBM spokesman. While the decree applied originally to tabulating machines it is now being interpreted to apply to computers. IBM's efforts to modify the decree's terms could raise opposition from rivals such as Electronic Data Systems. It also may draw some from reseller firms, which have benefited from IBM's restraints.</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Hey, young spender - US companies are bidding for the custom of twenty-somethings and teenagers You are the US manufacturer of a product with an old-fashioned image. Teenagers and people in their twenties do not want to 'check it out'. It is not cool. It is the antithesis of radical. How do you change their perceptions? This problem, common to many businesses, was addressed by two US companies last week when they announced significant changes in image. Chrysler, the car maker which until recently came over as rather stodgy, unveiled a small car, called the Neon, which it will introduce to the US market in January. The Neon will be aimed directly at the group of consumers dubbed Generation X or the 'baby busters' by the marketing industry - young adults between the ages of 18 and 30. Procter &amp; Gamble, the consumer products company, announced a relaunch of Old Spice, which is America's best-selling men's after-shave but suffers from an image problem: young men think of it as something found in their father's bathroom cabinet - one of the least hip places on earth. P&amp;G aims to eradicate such negative connotations. Generation X is notorious in the marketing industry for being hard to sell to. Its members, many of whom have suffered long periods of unemployment, are supposed to be cynical, iconoclastic, unresponsive to traditional advertising techniques and lacking in brand loyalty. However, after extensive market research into the views of the age group, Chrysler has come up with a more positive interpretation. The company believes it is a generation which seeks 'simplicity, integrity, substance and genuineness in its lifestyles.' It is environmentally conscious and has far less desire for show and materialism than the baby boomers who preceded it. It has very high product expectations and is open to new suppliers, if they can deliver the best quality. In the 1980s Chrysler had a reputation for producing dull, boxy cars and, in common with the rest of the Detroit motor industry, it lost many baby boomers, now in their 30s and 40s, to Japanese rivals. Over the past 12 months, Chrysler has started winning back market share in the family-sized car market, thanks to a series of new vehicles of startlingly different design. The Neon is its attempt to carry this momentum into the crowded small-car market, where buyers between the ages of 24 and 30 account for roughly 50 per cent of US sales. Chrysler is keeping its advertising ideas secret, but recent US campaigns by rival car companies targeting Generation X have used off-beat humour and rock music, together with claims that their vehicles are less boring than other cars and better value for money. Chrysler seems likely to reiterate many of these themes. Chrysler's publicity machine is presenting the Neon as stylish, low-cost, roomy, fast-accelerating and environmentally friendly. (It is at least 85 per cent recyclable). With its big bug-eyed headlamps and a bubble shaped top, the car is 'huggable,' maintains the company. That is a quality to which Old Spice might also lay claim. Its TV advertisements have long featured the 'mariner man' - a whistling sailor with a magnetic power over women. He would toss a bottle of Old Spice to some poor land-lubber unable to attract the ladies. Old Spice has had a nautical theme ever since the line was introduced in the 1930s. A logo of a classic clipper ship graces its packaging and bottle. P&amp;G, which acquired the brand three years ago, is updating the image by getting rid of the mariner and replacing the clipper logo with a racing yacht. It is coupling this with the launch of two products aimed at young men. Its research found many young men do not like the burning sensation of traditional after-shaves. This stinging is produced by the alcohol used as an antiseptic against shaving cuts. However, modern razor technology means fewer facial nicks and thus little need for the alcohol. P&amp;G is introducing an alcohol-free after-shave, and a long-lasting 'high endurance' deodorant, both targeted at the under 30s. The TV advertisement for the deodorant shows a young man winning a cycle race and being embraced by his admiring woman. The only nautical reference is a short shot of a large, breaking wave at the end of the advertisement. Old Spice is changing its image by sponsoring sports, notably beach volleyball, a fast-growing televised game in the US, featuring lithe athletes clad in swimming costumes and dark glasses. Jon Hall, the brand's associate advertising manager, claims none of this is alienating Old Spice's older users, since 'we have retained the features that they identify with the mariner man.' Perhaps.</p>

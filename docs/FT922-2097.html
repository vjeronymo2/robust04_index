			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour poll row flares again THE open warfare over responsibility for Labour's election defeat flared again last night when Mr John Prescott repeated claims that the campaign had been hijacked by outsiders. The transport spokesman's charges were described as 'complete rubbish' by Mr Jack Cunningham, the party's campaigns co-ordinator. Mr Prescott, in his criticism of the campaign, complained that despite being a member of the shadow cabinet and the NEC he had to 'peer in on television to see who was on the campaign strategy team and who was making decisions'. But Dr Cunningham hit back in an interview immediately afterwards, saying: 'It comes ill from people who were a member of two, or even all three, of those bodies to say now they didn't know what strategy was being laid down.' He insisted there were regular presentations to the shadow cabinet, the campaign strategy committee and to the NEC for months before the general election. He added: 'At all times in the campaign the decisions were taken in the campaign management team which I chaired, and to suggest that a small group of people tried to subvert or circumvent those decisions is complete rubbish.' Ms Patricia Hewitt, a former aide to Mr Neil Kinnock, also counter-attacked against the 'huge cowardice' of people refusing to take responsibility for collective leadership decisions. Last night, Mr Stan Orme, Labour MP for Salford East, announced that he would not be seeking re-election as chairman of the parliamentary Labour party.</p>

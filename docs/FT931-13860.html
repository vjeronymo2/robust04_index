			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Observer: Dawn raiders Hot tip from Hong Kong: Feng Shui says the Year of the Cockerel is going to be another bumper year for the local stock market, the world's top performer last year. It's not as daft as it sounds, if a Feng Shui index invented by Credit Lyonnais Securities (Asia) for the Year of the Monkey, which ends this weekend, is as accurate as it was last year. In terms of calling the market turns it proved far more deadly than any of Hong Kong's research teams - including Credit Lyonnais' own bunch. Feng Shui, an ancient Chinese predictive art, involves study of the relationship between basic elements, such as water and wind. It also utilises the Chinese calendar. The Cockerel is an autumn animal, so punters can look forward to a much stronger second half of the year. The Feng Shui chartists are highly optimistic. Not so Credit Lyonnais' analysts who are increasingly nervous about the robed Feng Shui disciples encamped in a corner of their office.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Andreotti loses immunity, attacks Mafia probe AN Italian Senate commission yesterday agreed to waive the parliamentary immunity of Mr Giulio Andreotti, seven times Christian Democrat prime minister, bringing him one step closer to being investigated by Palermo magistrates for alleged collusion with the Sicilian mafia. It is the first time the commission has agreed to waive the immunity of such a prominent politician in a case of alleged links between the world of politics and organised crime. Mr Andreotti, aged 74, has been in public office since the founding of the republic and is seen in Italy as the symbol of the political establishment long controlled by the Christian Democrats. Yesterday he issued an angry statement repeating his view that the investigation by Palermo magistrates was a conspiracy to denigrate him. He added: 'I have absolutely no fear of the truth and will vigorously use every means to unmask these incredible machinations.' The 215 strong Senate, of which Mr Andreotti is a life member, must conduct a secret ballot to validate the decision. Yesterday,the voting of the 23 person commission was split according to political loyalty. The eight Christian Democrat members abstained, backed by two Socialists and the president of the commission, while one Liberal voted against him losing his immunity. Mr Andreotti revealed on March 27 that he had been notified by Palermo magistrates they wished to investigate him for alleged links with the mafia. The Senate commission has been hearing the case since April 14, and has four times been sent extra documentation from Palermo. The thrust of the Palermo magistrates' case is that Mr Andreotti has acted as the point of reference for the Sicilian mafia, Cosa Nostra, in Rome especially to influence the course of court cases against senior mafia members. The evidence is based extensively on testimony of former mafia members co-operating with the authorities. Mr Gabriele Cagliari, the former chairman of Italy's publicly-owned Eni energy and chemicals group, yesterday admitted to having paid L26bn (Pounds 11.05m) in illegal contributions to the Christian Democrat and Socialist parties, Haig Simonian writes from Milan. Mr Cagliari said the system of illegal funding preceded his tenure as chairman, which began in 1989, but admitted he had not sought to stop the payments. Earlier this month, Mr Franco Reviglio, his predecessor as chairman between 1983-89, was notified by magistrates that he was under investigation for allegedly receiving illicit funds. The news triggered Mr Reviglio's resignation as finance minister in the former Amato government. Mr Cagliari has been detained in Milan's San Vittore prison since March 9 on allegations of corruption and illegally funding political parties. At the weekend, magistrates investigating political corruption added new charges of falsifying company accounts.</p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Savoy censures director over leak The controversy over the control of Savoy Group took another twist yesterday when the luxury hotel company publicly censured one of its directors over a leak of confidential information. Savoy was angered by weekend press reports citing a study by Mr Giles Shepard, its managing director, which had been circulated to certain directors, restating the company's need to fight off the attentions of Forte, its rival and largest shareholder, and to remain independent. A Savoy statement yesterday said: 'The board of the Savoy Group is dismayed that one non-executive director, for his own reasons, has decided to discuss confidential papers with the press. This is unsettling for employees and does nobody any good.' A company source said the story had been leaked by Sir Michael Richardson, who announced on Friday his plan to retire as chairman of Smith New Court, the securities house. 'There will be pressure on him to resign (from Savoy) after this,' said the source. Sir Michael yesterday admitted the story emerged from his office, but denied it was a deliberate leak. 'I did not show the report to anyone, it did not happen like that at all.' He said the report had been spotted on his desk by a journalist who was interviewing him about his retirement. When questioned, he had given a brief outline of its contents. 'That is not a leak,' he said. He described the question of his resignation as 'ridiculous'. Mr Shepard said yesterday: 'Nothing has been discussed by the other directors in relation to anyone resigning.' The policy document at the centre of the row, written by Mr Shepard, was circulated to Sir Michael and three other non-executive directors. It outlined Savoy's trading and corporate strategy after the company's interim results due on September 13. It also restated the company's intention to remain independent and questioned Forte's performance and strategy. Sir Michael and Mr Shepard admitted the row reflected tensions on the board over Savoy's future. Forte, which has fought a 13-year battle for control, holds 42 per cent of voting shares. It has discussed with other shareholders the creation of a joint venture which would pool the two groups' luxury hotels. Savoy also owns Claridge's and the Connaught. Forte agreed in November 1989 not to increase its stake in Savoy for five years and to give 12 months' notice if it wanted to do so. The latter requirement remains even after the five-year standstill ends.</p>

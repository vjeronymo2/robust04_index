The  companies NEC, Ericsson, and STC (an association between the Sid  company and the American giant AT&amp;T) were beaten during the  technical requirements stage. Alcatel prices were 25 percent  cheaper than those of its main adversary, the company Equitel,  representing Siemens.    "The intelligent network is a new concept in communications  networks and will represent a revolution in the automation of  telephone services, which will become more agile and flexible,"  Telebras President Adyr da Silva said. "Strategically the  victory constitutes an important bridge for the company, because  it will superimpose a new network on the one already built by  Telebras," Alcatel President Manuel Octavio Lopez said.    Lopez said the network will offer three new services in the  first stage, besides permitting 20 million simultaneous calls,  by installing access points to the systems installed in Rio de  Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Brasilia, Salvador, and  Curitiba. The number of simultaneous calls will climb to 60  million when the system is completely installed.    The first benefit for consumers will be the possibility of  using a new kind of 800 service (charge calls) which eliminates  the need to call the long distance operator before calling the  company number. The system also contemplates the installation  of telephones that can be operated with credit cards. Users  will be able to pass their credit cards through the machine, and  the call will be automatically charged. The company also plans  to install an Advanced Virtual Network that will operate as  Telebras' voice channel, but with cheaper rates. In this case,  large companies will be able to use a PABX [private automatic  branch exchange] system for intercity calls.    According to the Alcatel president, the company has already  agreed with Telebras to create a technological development group  for the intelligent network, which will be based at the Research  and Development Center (CPQD) owned by the state company in  Campinas (SP) [Sao Paulo]. "It is not a partnership, but the  means to create new services, and the network standards and  testing during the system's installation will be the  responsibility of both companies," CPQD Director Paulo Pospissil  said.</p>

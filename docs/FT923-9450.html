			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Milan awaits the Mif's debut  -Haig Simonian looks at a new market in government futures ITALY's new government bond futures market will start trading on September 11, the Italian Treasury announced. This will be two months behind schedule, but still ahead of some dealers' worst expectations. The new market, which will use the existing screen-based 'primary dealers' system for cash trading, comes almost exactly a year after dealings in futures on 10-year Buoni del Tesoro Poliennali (BTPs) started at the Matif in Paris and Liffe in London. While trading in Paris has virtually evaporated, Italian bond futures have become one of Liffe's most successful products. Average trading volumes for Liffe's BTP future were running at 26,755 a day last month, while the exchange registered a new turnover record of 67,625 contracts changing hands on June 3. The arrival of a futures contract in Italy will mirror the competition that emerged when German government bund futures, devised by Liffe, were introduced on the new Deutsche Terminborse (DTB) in Frankfurt. Supported by domestic banks, the DTB last month accounted for around one-quarter of total bund futures trading, against three-quarters in London. Dealers in Milan doubt the new Italian exchange, dubbed the Mif, will quickly win such a big market share. However, the domestic venture could offer Liffe stiff competition. Contract specifications on the Mif are very similar to those in London, apart from the contract's nominal value, which is expected to be L250m against L200m in London. Dealers say the new Italian contract could appeal to a different type of user than that on Liffe. Although two Italian banks are now members of the London exchange and others trade heavily through brokers, it is expected that the new domestic market will be dominated by financial institutions. By contrast, international banks and fund managers are likely to keep their focus on London, dealers believe. That applies particularly to the handful of investment banks which have developed sophisticated arbitrage techniques between cash and futures markets in different currencies. 'With its range of government bond futures, Liffe offers arbitrage opportunities unavailable on a domestic market featuring just one government's debt,' said one trader. The Italian authorities have pushed hard for the creation of a domestic futures market, one of a string of innovations brought in under last year's umbrella law introducing the Societa di Intermediazione Mobiliare (Sim), Italy's stockbroking and fund management body. The Sims law paved the way for the creation of a new clearing house to operate in both the cash equity market and for bond futures, as well as initiating the detailed technical and legal framework for futures trading. Clearing software and technical assistance has come from ICCH, the London-based clearing organisation, while trading software has been prepared by STM, the Canadian company which worked on the cash 'primary dealers' market. Prestige apart, creating a new domestic futures exchange could have important structural consequences for the Italian economy and monetary management. During recent weeks of turbulence in the government bond market caused by doubts about the government's economic policy and uncertainty over the lira, trading in bond futures on Liffe acted as a beacon for the domestic cash market, dictating prices. With futures markets increasingly setting the pace for cash market trading, it may be that the Bank of Italy preferred to have a futures exchange operating more closely under its wary eye than in London.</p>

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / France in push for aid to Algeria France has redoubled its promises to try to win the Algerian government an increase in new international aid and a decrease in the burden of repaying old aid, amid new evidence that France is being used as a conduit for arms to anti-government rebels in Algeria. Mr Ahmed Benbitour, Algerian finance minister, met his French counterpart, Mr Edmond Alphandery, this week to discuss the preparation of Algeria's formal agreement with the International Monetary Fund, next week's discussion by European Union finance ministers of the unblocking of a Ecu150m (Pounds 115m) loan by the EU to Algeria, and the Paris Club meeting of Algeria's official creditors in late May or early June. Mr Alphandery told Mr Benbitour that, once it settles debt-relief terms with the Paris Club, Algeria will get new bilateral aid from France, probably equivalent to the FFr6bn (Pounds 697m) credit Paris granted last year. The French finance minister has written to other members of the Group of Seven, asking them, especially the US and Japan, to give Algeria maximum debt relief. Algeria is said to want to reduce by Dollars 4bn (Pounds 1.9bn) its 1994 debt service bill of Dollars 9.5bn. The anti-terrorist unit of the French police yesterday took custody of an Algerian arrested last Friday in eastern France. He was said to have with him an arsenal of weapons in his car, including, apparently, 129 sticks of explosive, 99 detonators, 5,000 rounds of ammunition, three automatic pistols, one assault rifle, night-sights and walkie-talkies. He was suspected of smuggling the arms from Germany to Algeria, probably to Islamic militants there. But so far the French interior ministry remains convinced that the Islamic Salvation Front's hold over the large Algerian community is relatively slight.</p>

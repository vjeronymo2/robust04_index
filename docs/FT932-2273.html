			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Letter: Independence and objectives of a central bank Sir, Samuel Brittan writes (Economic Viewpoint, June 17): 'I would give central banks responsibility for avoiding deflation as well as inflation.' This is exactly what the US Federal Reserve already has. 'As the nation's central bank, it attempts to ensure that growth in money and credit over the long run is sufficient to encourage growth in the economy in line with its potential and with reasonable price stability. In the short run the Federal Reserve seeks to adapt its policies to combat deflationary or inflationary pressures as they may arise.' (The Federal Reserve System: Purposes and Functions. Board of Governors, Washington DC, 1984.) The independence of the central bank and its policy objectives are thus two separate questions. A non-independent central bank can be given price stability as its sole objective, and an independent central bank can be given objectives other than price stability. The current debate often fails to recognise this point. Christopher Johnson, UK adviser, Association for the Monetary Union of Europe, 39 Wood Lane, London N6 5UD</p>

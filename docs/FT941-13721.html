			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Emerging Markets: The Yen falls under the spotlight - Currency Markets The Yen appears likely to be a focus of attention this week with the weak economy, political uncertainty, and an ongoing trade dispute with the US all impacting on the cur-rency. The market will be trying to assess the impact of the government's failure last week to pass a political reform package. If this prevents the introduction of a fiscal package aimed at stimulating the economy, this may cause the Yen to weaken. The outcome of yesterday's meeting between Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, will also be closely watched. If progress is not made in curbing Japan's trade surplus with the US, the Japanese unit will probably strengthen as an alternative means of closing the gap. The market will also be keeping a close eye on the release of fourth quarter US GDP and durable goods figures. If these are as strong as predicted, this should lend further strength to the US currency. In Europe, a focus of attention will be Thursday's meeting of the Bank of France monetary policy committee. Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan (Europe), argues that good inflation figures and some worrying trade news, allied to D-Mark weakness, give the Bank the opportunity to cut rates. Were it to do so, following last week's Danish rate cuts, this would represent an important decoupling of monetary policy by core ERM currencies from the Bundesbank. The outlook for sterling remains mixed as traders review the strength of the UK economy. The market is likely to turn its attention today towards investment in the CBI quarterly trends survey. Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW, argues that these should be quite buoyant given the healthy state of returns on investment and tight capacity constraints in the manufacturing sector. If they are not, this would be an important signal to the government about the health of the economy.</p>

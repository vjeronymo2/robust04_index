			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / C&amp;G prepares to accept new savers Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society is likely to announce before the end of the month that it will reopen to accept savings from new customers. Almost two weeks ago C&amp;G closed its doors to new customer deposits after the High Court ruling which barred the terms of Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn agreed cash bid for the society. C&amp;G said then that this was a short-term measure to prevent people trying to make a speculative gain from the Lloyds offer. The society said yesterday that it would announce its plans for re-opening for savings when it had further evaluated the judgment. It has played down the financial impact of the closure. While the court ruling would not allow new depositors to receive a windfall benefit from the Lloyds offer, C&amp;G said some potential customers might wrongly interpret the judgment in this way. Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor, said in his ruling that C&amp;G could not make cash payments to more than 220,000 C&amp;G investors who had been shareholding members of the society for less than two years. This would make it difficult to win the necessary majority in favour of the deal. C&amp;G's emphasis on the short-term nature of the move suggests that it does not see closing the society to new members as a way of getting round the terms of the judgment, by raising significantly the proportion of members of at least two years' standing, and thus improving its chance of winning the ballot of investing members. Alongside producing a revised offer, the society also has to take a decision shortly on whether to ask the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal against Sir Donald's decision. If C&amp;G seeks an expedited appeal it must launch the process within 28 days of the original judgment - before the end of the first week in July. After that date it could still seek leave to mount an ordinary appeal, but that course would carry the risk of extending the timetable for the offer beyond the end of this year.</p>

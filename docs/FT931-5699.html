			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Japan bank strengths to diverge ASSET quality problems among Japanese banks and their capacity to deal with bad loans will open up differences between the strongest and the weakest banks, says IBCA, the UK ratings agency. In a report yesterday on asset quality at Japanese banks, IBCA says city banks - or commercial banks - are in a better position, while some trust banks may not be able to make provisions in the next few years. One of the more prominent problems weighing on Japan's banks has been loans to the country's eight housing loan companies - non-financial institutions which have been hit hard by bad property-related loans. Including the restructuring scheme for Nippon Housing Loan, finally approved by its creditors last week, interest foregone by 21 banks will total about 8 per cent of projected business profits. IBCA says the average proportion of lost income opportunity for city banks will be about 3 per cent of business profits, 17 per cent for the long-term credit banks and 50 per cent for the trust banks. The opening of new areas of business for banks, due to the easing of barriers between the banking and securities industries, will also flush out the strength differences in strength between Japanese banks. Standard and Poor's, the US credit ratings agency, downgraded debt ratings of Tokai Bank and Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, two Japanese city banks. Daiwa Bank was placed under review for a possible downward revision. S&amp;P downgraded Tokai's long-term debt to A minus, from A, due to a rise in problem loans. Hokkaido Takushoku's short-term debt was lowered to A-3, from A-2, due to a decline in asset quality and a rise in problem loans.</p>

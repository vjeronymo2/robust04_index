			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / The Markets: Beware of Italian brio - Global Investor Some things - although not many - are clearer about the Italian markets. The 'meltdown' scenario which investors feared if the election winner looked unable to form a government now looks remote, although this week may see some post-election consolidation. Even for those who have scarcely dabbled with Italian assets, the markets' behaviour now deserves scrutiny. Italy offers a case study on dealing with political uncertainty at a turning point in the economic cycle when corporate prospects are particularly hard to judge. European investors are hardly strangers to political uncertainty. After the jitters in sterling markets in the last two weeks, because of worries about divisions within the Conservative party over European voting procedures, they may feel they have had their share. However, now that the marathon of German elections, which will last until the general election in October, has kicked off with the Lower Saxony parliament elections last month, they can hardly avoid it. Investors' skills at reading the financial implications of political turmoil will be at a premium. Mr Silvio Berlusconi's victory, which was welcomed by all the Italian markets, has made some of the investment parameters clearer. On the currency front, investors now have more confidence in saying that the exchange rate of L1000 to the D-Mark seen before the election is likely to be the limit of weakness. Last week saw the lira strengthen to L963 to the D-Mark. The spread between Italian and German bond yields is also narrowing, heading towards 250 basis points, from 300. Against that background, some of the leading Italian stocks continue to look excellent value fundamentally compared with their European counterparts. For instance, SIP, the domestic telephone network operator, is now valued at 3.1 times estimates of 1994 cashflow, a discount of between 30 per cent and 100 per cent to companies such as Spain's Telefonica or the UK's British Telecom. Its capital expenditure peaked in 1991, and last year it turned the corner from consuming cash to generating it. Nonetheless, although the best stocks still warrant investment, the markets' present strength offers a chance to reduce holdings across the board. Investors should seriously consider taking that chance, given the uncertainty that remains. Investors say that the former communist party of the Democratic Left (PDS) went to some lengths to win their confidence, but that Mr Berlusconi has made less attempt to cultivate the markets, and that the investment implications of his victory are unknown. While investors feel confident that the privatisation programme will continue and may even speed up, the impact of mooted tax cuts on Italy's ability to finance its debt is high among their concerns. The form of the indirect tax rises which are intended to compensate for the tax cuts also remains unclear. Before Mr Berlusconi assembles a coalition, little can be judged of the new government's plans for cutting government spending or whether these hopes are achievable. Until the answers become clearer, investors may well put caution first and take profits. Time for bonds Traders in the City are braced this morning for bond and equity markets to fall following the sharp drop in US markets yesterday. US employment figures, which showed that the American economy is forging ahead, reawakened fears of a further rise in interest rates, possibly as soon as this week. That is exactly the threat which had deterred investors from re-entering the bond markets in the two months since the Federal Reserve's last rate rise. However, the markets' immediate jitters aside, investors may well find this latest alarm marks a good point to consider buying bonds again. Fears of a sustained rise in US inflation may be premature. Commodity prices have flattened out while Friday's figures suggested that wage inflation has stayed low. Nor did Friday indicate that manufacturing industry would provide a spur to inflation; growth in employment came in the retailing, entertainment and business services sectors. Moreover, bond analysts were saying last week that the long queue of forced sellers which has kept the market down may be ending. The main wave of selling by the large American hedge funds may now have passed, as may the unloading of stock by the proprietary trading desks of banks which report quarterly and wanted to cut positions by the end of March. Gilts selling in particular now looks overdone. While the markets remain nervous of any inflationary indications, the inflation rate in the next 10 years, implied by the yields on 10-year index-linked stock, is 4.4 per cent, more pessimistic than the same houses' economists are forecasting. The UK also looks unjustifiably cheap compared with benchmark German bonds. In late January the yield on 10-year gilts was 50 basis points above comparable stocks on the Bund. The gap has now more than trebled, and much of that opened before the market's unease about Conservative party turmoil. That is not to say that German bonds are now overvalued. The wage settlements by the public sector unions and by IG Metall, the engineering union, last month have gone some way to calming fears about German inflation. Investors' worries about UK inflation picking up again, which may restrain the degree of exposure they want, are understandable. However, the discrepancy between German bonds and gilts may reassure them that most worries are reflected in the price, and that the risks of re-entering the market are lower than for some time. For some of the same reasons, high yielding UK equities also offer new attractions. They have fallen back with the rest of the equity market in the correction which has accompanied the bond market selling. While many investors have been picking over the results reporting season with an eye to high earnings growth, they may still find appeal in the high yields now available. The financial sector and utilities have been particularly hit in the setback. 'Heaven's the wrong word, but it is a great opportunity', says Mr Hilton Seely, head of the high-yield desk at Kleinwort Benson Securities in London. Those who take a more cautious view of the inflation outlook can take advantage of anomalies which have opened up during the recent gyrations. Food retailing and manufacturing stocks such as Argyll, Tesco, Unilever and Hillsdown are good examples. The UK market has broadly treated the industries as if they fare well in inflationary times. That assumes that they can edge up their prices even if economic conditions deteriorate, an assumption partly undermined by the current restructuring in the food retailing sec-tor. However, demand for food is generally insensitive to price, while many agricultural products are supplied under the European Common Agricultural Policy and prices have been flat or declining. As these raw materials can make up more than half of operating costs for domestic food manufacturers, companies are partly shielded from inflationary pressures, allowing them to raise margins. Nevertheless, food stocks have suffered during the market's recent weakness, even though that has been partly because of the same inflationary fears which have troubled bond markets. As the stocks provide something of a hedge against inflation, investors who are nervous about the economic outlook may find them attractive. Chocaholic investor Replete with chocolate after the Easter break, investors might turn their thoughts to cocoa futures. Worldwide demand for cocoa - most of which is used for making chocolate - has been rising at about 3.5 per cent a year for some time, both because of world population growth and because some people are eating more chocolate. The past year was the third in a row in which demand exceeded supply and world stocks shrank. That helped send the price from Pounds 663 per tonne last summer to more than Pounds 1,000 per tonne at the start of this year. It is unclear how much weight can be put on the five-year producers pact agreed in February. But if it has any effect, it will be to strengthen the price. Recent profit-taking has pulled the price back to Pounds 900 per tonne but that is likely to be quickly regained on any news of crop setbacks or unexpectedly high consumption levels. The present prices offer investors a chance to back the world's sweet tooth.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                TOTAL RETURN IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 31/3/94  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                      % change over period                            US   Japan   Germany   France   Italy    UK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash Week                     0.07    0.06     0.11     0.12    0.16    0.10 Month                    0.30    0.21     0.51     0.53    0.70    0.43 Year                     3.50    3.28     6.81     8.25   11.63    5.81  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year Week                    -1.68    0.96   -0.34      0.25    0.97   -2.35 Month                   -0.74    0.39    0.11     -0.21    0.81   -1.51 Year                     2.59    6.23    7.23      9.70   21.33    6.22  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year Week                    -3.42    0.63   -1.59     -0.11    1.48   -3.45 Month                   -1.47   -0.29   -0.28     -1.41    0.28   -3.21 Year                     2.67    6.43    7.11     10.62   28.45    6.83  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cash &amp; Bonds - Lehman Brothers.

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: Rio Algom sells potash division RIO ALGOM, the former uranium producer now concentrating on copper and base metals, has sold its potash division with mines in Saskatchewan and New Brunswick to Potash Corp of Saskatchewan for CDollars 160m (USDollars 120m), plus working capital, writes Robert Gibbens. Rio also retains a royalty interest. PCS, Canada's biggest potash producer, will take over a workforce of 440 miners. The potash division contributed 12 per cent of Rio Algom's operating profit in the first half of this year. Potash prices have been volatile internationally partly because of big swings in Chinese demand. Rio plans to use the proceeds to repay debt and expand its base metals activities in North and South America, including development of the Cerro Colorado copper deposit in Chile.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: J Foster cuts loss to Pounds 921,000 John Foster &amp; Son, the worsted and mohair cloth manufacturer, cut pre-tax losses from Pounds 1.9m to Pounds 921,000 for the half year to August 31. Turnover on continuing operations was lower at Pounds 8.38m, against Pounds 10m. During the period management continued to slim down the business and further asset sales, including properties, were planned in the second half. The number of employees now totalled 300 compared with 580 at this time last year and by the year end this should have stabilised at about 230. The company warned, however, that demand from traditional merchant customers, particularly in Europe and Japan, was not good, while there were a lot of cheap sellers about, particularly from Italy. Losses per share were 8.4p (16.9p).</p>

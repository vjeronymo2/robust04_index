			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, May 17 (XINHUA) -- The risk management of  assets has been introduced in all financial institutions in  southern China's Shenzhen Special Economic Zone.    By the new system, the management of credit assets will be  shifted from quantity control to qualitative control.    The Shenzhen branch of the People's Bank of China, as a  management institution, will provide loans according to the  assessment of a number of factors including assets sufficiency  rate, the ratio between deposits and loans, fluidity of assets  and structure of loans instead of controlling the total credit  line alone.    Officials said that the reform, aiming to achieve standard,  scientific and modern management in financial institutions, will  help these institutions improve security, fluidity and  efficiency of credit funds, thus establishing a flexible and  secure monetary payment system.    Experiments in such system started in 1992. Now the system  is being applied differently to financial institutions of  different ownerships. For state-owned commercial banks, assets  risk management is applied with credit put under compulsory  quota management while for regional, joint stock commercial  banks, the risk management is put under supervision, with the  credit quotas as mandatory. Only non-banking financial  institutions have instituted the standard risk management of  assets, with no credit quotas imposed.</p>

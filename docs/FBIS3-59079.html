			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Recent poll results indicate a drop in  public confidence in the economy. The 31 December independent  Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO published the results of an  EXPRESS-Euroexpansao poll conducted between 21 and 27 December  1993 among a nationally representative sample of 481  individuals. Results showed that respondents are pessimistic  about the country's economic future. When asked whether their  standard of living will improve, remain the same, or worsen in  1994, 33 percent of the respondents thought it would  deteriorate, 38 percent that it would remain the same and only  21 percent felt it would improve. Similarly, 79 percent thought  unemployment would worsen in 1994, compared to 14 percent who  believed it would not increase. Concerning the government's  assertion that inflation will hover around 5 percent, 70 percent  said it would be higher, 15 percent agreed with the government,  and 6 percent said it would be below 5 percent. Some 82 percent  thought that there would be a crisis in both the industrial and  agricultural sectors, 3 percent thought it would occur only in  the agricultural sector, with 1 percent picking only the  industrial field; 5 percent said that neither sector would be  affected. Finally, when asked whether the economy will increase  at a higher or lower rate than in other European Union  countries, 36 percent thought it would increase at a lower rate,  29 percent at the same rate, and 24 percent said it would  increase at a higher rate.    The 1 January Lisbon daily DIARIO DE NOTICIAS published the  results of a NORMA-Gallup poll conducted nationwide among 7,609  individuals over 15 (no further details), which showed that 43  percent of the respondents thought 1994 will be worse than 1993,  compared to 18 percent who believed in an improvement. While  younger respondents between 15 and 24 were almost equally  divided between pessimists and optimists (33 percent versus 31  percent), only 12 percent of respondents over 55 believed in  better days to come, with 46 percent affirming the opposite.</p>

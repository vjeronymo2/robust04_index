			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL CONSIDERS 'MANSIONIZATION' LIMITS  </P> <P> Responding to homeowners concerned about the "mansionization" of their  neighborhoods, the Glendale City Council on Tuesday introduced a temporary  ordinance that would establish size limits and a stringent review process for  the construction or major expansion of single-family houses.  </P> <P> In recent years, "mansionization" -- tearing down existing houses and building  new ones that nearly fill their lots -- has become a trend in several Los  Angeles County communities, particularly on the Westside.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills, Pacific Palisades and the city of Los Angeles have adopted  anti-mansionization measures recently. Critics contend such measures deprive  individuals of private property rights.  </P> <P> The Glendale ordinance, which council members said they will adopt Tuesday,  will last from one to two years. During that time, the city's planning staff  would work on a permanent ordinance that would regulate construction according  to each neighborhood's characteristics.  </P> <P> The proposal introduced Tuesday by the planning staff calls for limits on  height, landscaping, open space and parking. It would also limit the minimum  distance between the building's exterior and the adjacent street and property  lines and establish a floor-area ratio -- a method for controlling building  size by measuring the relation of floor space to the lot area.  </P> <P> The ordinance would also require that all new construction of more than 700  square feet be approved by the city's Design Review Board. Planning Director  John McKenna told the council that the 700-square-foot limit was proposed  because it amounts to a "sizable addition to an already existing house."  </P> <P> On Tuesday, more than 100 residents attended the debate on the council's  proposal. About a dozen addressed the council, with a slight majority favoring  the ordinance. Representatives of three homeowners associations said they  supported the proposal.  </P> <P> Tamara Campbell made an emotional plea against it. "Once again, the government  is intruding into our private rights," she said. "This ordinance would make our  homes subject to the taste of bureaucrats and our neighbors. We live in a free  society. These things shouldn't happen."  </P> <P> Mayor Jerold Milner said after the meeting: "A few years back, we all felt that  government at every level should stay out of our lives. But with the increase  in property values, many people with a whole lot of money are imposing their  desires on the rest of the city until the government has to step in."  </P> <P> If adopted next week, the ordinance would take effect within 30 days.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Reporter Li Shuxiu (2621 3219 4423) and Correspondent Gu </F> Laibin (6253 0171 6333): "A New Pattern of Simultaneously  Developing Coal and Electricity is Being Formed in Our Region"]    [Text] Being puzzled for a long time by the external  shipment, coal mines in our region are implementing the strategy  of locally converting raw coal. The 10-odd large and  medium-sized power plants that the autonomous region has newly  built and expanded or is going to build through various  investment forms during recent years have provided broad  prospects for the local conversion of raw coal. A new pattern  of simultaneously developing coal and electricity is being  formed in the region. The past situation of mainly relying on  railways to transport coal from the north to the south and  delivering coal from the west to the east has been gradually  substituted by aerial power transmission.    Being China's second largest coal base, Inner Mongolia has  so  far formed a raw coal annual production capacity of 50 million  tonnes. However, its external transport capacity is only 30  percent of the total output. More than 50 percent of the coal  pits in the three major coal mines in the western part of the  region are forced to suspend production; the coal pits under  three bureaus and one mine in the eastern part of the region are  running under capacity, and are difficult to move ahead; and  only one-fourth of the dressed coal produced by Dongsheng and  the "white coal" produced by Gulaben which are famous at home  and abroad can be transported out of the region.    To this end, guided by the state strategy of shifting energy  development to the west, the regional party committee and  government have promptly readjusted the development strategy.  Secretary Wang Qun proposed the idea of "giving priority to  developing electricity, using electricity to guarantee coal  industry and coal industry to promote power industry, and  transmitting more electricity to other localities outside the  region." From 1988 to 1993, our region made an investment of  4.8 billion yuan to help add an installed power capacity of 1.5  million kw. A large number of major power projects were  distributed and successively initiated in selected areas where  coal resources are concentrated. The first phase of the  Fengzhen Power Plant with an installed capacity of 800,000 kw  has been completed, two power generating units of Jungar Power  Plant each with a capacity of 100,000 kw have been put into  production, the first power generating unit of Haibowan Power  Plant with a capacity of 100,000 kw has been operated for  commercial purpose, and the two power generating unit expansion  projects of Huiliuhe Power Plant each with a capacity of 50,000  kw have begun to feed the power grid. Construction of the newly  built exceptionally big Dalad Power Plant and the Haibowan and  Huolinhe Power Plants, and the two expansion projects of  Yuanbaoshan and Tongliao Power Plants is making headway. A new  pattern of simultaneously building Wuhai, Wangli, Shengli,  Baorixile, Yimin, Huolinhe, and Pingzhuang large-scale coal  production bases and developing power industry is being formed  in close connection with power development.    At present, the two leading industries of coal and  electricity are unceasingly exploring ways to seek conversion in  an effort to broaden the development path. Three kinds of local  conversions of raw coal are seen. First, the mine-run  type--coal mines run power industry and build pit-head power  stations. The first phase of the Huolinhe open-cut mine project  of building two power generating units each with a capacity of  100,000 kw is in full swing. This coal mine has already formed  an annual production capacity of 10 million tonnes and its final  goal is to have an annual capacity of producing an output of 30  million tonnes of raw coal. Second, the combined-track  type--the coal and power industries make joint efforts in  operation and combine their systems together. At present,  Yiminhe open-cut mine has already formed an annual production  capacity of 1 million tonnes; the first phase of the Yimin Power  Plant which is under construction includes the building of two  power generating units each with a capacity of 500,000 kw; and  the coal, electricity, and road projects of Jungar will all be  put into production this year. Third, the simultaneously  developed type--unified plans are adopted in coal and energy  developments to seek coordinated and simultaneous development.  The construction of Wanli mining area with a final scale of  producing 45 million tonnes of raw coal annually and the Dalad  Power Plant with an installed capacity of 5 million kw is being  carried out in a coordinated and simultaneous manner.  Construction of Shengli Coal Mine with a total scale of  producing 30 million tonnes of raw coal annually and Zhenglan  Banner Power Plant with a designed capacity of 3.6 million kw is  being planned and carried out simultaneously so that the scale  and development of these two projects will keep pace with each  other.</p>

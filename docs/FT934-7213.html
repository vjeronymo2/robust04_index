			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / The Long View: Belgium's bondage WE CAN'T even rely on inflation as one of the fixtures of the British economy any more. This week the forecasters were confounded once again as the underlying rate of inflation unexpectedly tumbled by half a percentage point for the October measurement, at just 2.8 per cent. Perhaps even stranger has been the behaviour of the labour market, where annual earnings growth has dropped further to 3 per cent although unemployment fell last month. Such news has been enough to propel the gilt-edged market to new highs (or, in yield terms, lows). Last April in this column I speculated on the possibility that gilts might enjoy another annus mirabilis as they last did back in 1982. That year, long-dated government bonds produced a total return of 54 per cent as yields tumbled from 15.6 to 10.9 per cent. Perhaps 1993 cannot be so good but it is nevertheless shaping up impressively, with a total return so far of close to 30 per cent. Such a performance has left the 16 per cent return on the All-Share Index lagging far behind. Investors in equities cannot think of low inflation as an unqualified benefit. Historically the valuation basis has often been higher at times of low inflation. But low price increases may reflect the inability of companies to pass on costs. This appears to be especially true of retailing in the UK at present: as for manufacturing, look at the dull figures produced this week by well-managed manufacturing groups such as Courtaulds and BOC. The latter warned that it feels unable to raise its next dividend, for the first time in 20 years. When pay inflation is low, so is dividend inflation likely to be: over the past year dividends on the All-Share Index have fallen by more than 3 per cent, although there is a small net gain allowing for the damage done by the change in dividend tax last spring. A bond market surge on the current scale happens because there is a fundamental reappraisal of the prospects for inflation. Back in the early 1980s it was tumbling from 20 per cent to the 4 or 5 per cent it sustained through the mid-1980s (before the Lawson boom took hold). This time it has started quite low but it may be going much lower. The traditional inflationary engines of the British economy appear to have stalled. The labour market is lifeless, the housing market is drifting sideways along the bottom. In the past inflation has been persistent because governments, when faced with awkward choices, were willing to accommodate these inflationary pressures by allowing the money supply to expand. The inflation of the late 1980s, for instance, developed entirely out of the private sector's credit explosion; at the time, the government was actually running a budget surplus. Now monetary growth is comparatively weak - about 4 per cent annually on the broad money definition, M4. It does not indicate inflationary problems during the next year or two. If inflation were to return it would be for a different reason, that the government had lost control of its finances, and was being forced to pay its debts by writing cheques through the banks without funding the payments through gilt sales. In the circumstances broad money growth would accelerate to maybe 15 per cent and sterling would begin to collapse. Bill Martin, the gloomy economist at UBS, has been running this kind of scenario through a computer model. If the government cannot rise to the challenge of imposing a massive Pounds 40bn tax increase, he says, it will be overwhelmed by the twin budget and balance of payments deficits. The only way out will be through devaluation and inflation, which will return to a Lawson-style 10 per cent within five years. Such price rises, he says, would impose a severe inflation 'tax' on the kinds of investors who this week pushed long gilt-edged yields down to scarcely more than 7 per cent. Most of the computers have been giving erratic predictions lately, but can it really be true that bond investors are being caught in a trap? In the short run inflation goes down and down and they are forced to accept lower and lower interest rates (and higher and higher bond prices). In the medium term, however, the economic contradictions look almost irresolvable, except at the expense of those bond investors. This is not just a British problem, of course; the current global borrowing binge promises plenty of similar crises, with ten-year bond yields in Spain, Italy and Belgium running higher than in the UK. Even in the US there are newsletter jeremiahs predicting that it will end in hyperinflation. The questions tend to focus on whether governments can find enough finance to fund their ambitions, and at what price, but it may be that the problem is really the other way round: there is so much money easily available that governments are encouraged to undertax and overborrow. Government bond markets have fused around the time zones into a global casino worth many trillions of dollars. These international investors do not have any votes, but the crucial question is whether nevertheless they have a measure of political power. By suddenly withdrawing support from a national bond market they could cause embarrassing weakness in the currency and force the government in question to pay more for its money. Wednesday's austerity package from the Belgian government, the EU's most heavily indebted, was at least partly a response to distress signals from the financial markets. To stay in the game, governments are under pressure to pursue acceptable policies. But what happens when the limit is reached? The comforting aspect for investors in British government bonds is that there are other countries that will be earlier in the firing line. We should get an early warning of the kind of minefield that might lie ahead. In the meantime, let the good times roll.</p>

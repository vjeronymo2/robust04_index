			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / International Company News: Vard reverses into deficit NORWAY'S Vard shipping group said yesterday that in the first quarter of this year it had plunged into a pre-tax deficit of NKr37.3m (Dollars 5.53m), compared with profits of NKr104.4m in the same period of 1990. Vard said that the poor result was due mainly to a large number of cancellations by customers for Kloster Cruise, the group's cruise unit, during the Gulf war. Kloster Cruise reversed its 1990 first-quarter NKr67.5m profit into a NKr25.9m loss for the first quarter of this year. The figure includes a currency exchange gain of NKr84.1m. The group warned that Kloster Cruise's bookings in the second quarter will also be affected by a general decline in the cruise market but suggested that results would improve. Vard said that the capacity in Royal Viking Line, another cruise operation, is to be reduced by 70 per cent in 1992.</p>

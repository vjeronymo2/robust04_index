			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / IMF/World Bank in Madrid: Latin America 'in need of institutional reform' Reform of financial institutions, and encouragement of private savings in Latin American countries, is needed to reduce the volatility of capital flows into and out of the region, a group of leading bankers said yesterday. The Group of 30, a Wash-ington-based group of executive of banks and investment banks, said that capital flows into Latin American countries were more volatile than those related to the bank loans they had largely replaced. The group said the rise in US short-term interest rates this year had sown this volatility in debt instruments with Dollars 10.5bn (Pounds 6.6bn) in new bond issues during the first nine months of this year, compared with Dollars 2.3bn in 1993. The study also found that foreign portfolio investment in Latin America has substituted for domestic savings. The group recommended these reforms in Latin America, to reduce the degree of substitution, making local capital markets more liquid and better able to withstand fluctuations in external flows: Central banks should be independent and should pursue domestic price stability. The study says such stability - towards which considerable progress has been made - underpins the growth of mature local capital markets. There should be reform in the financial sector, including higher accounting and disclosure standards. Countries should try to develop pension, insurance and mutual funds, and develop longer-maturity bonds and derivatives. The study called for Latin American banks' capital requirements to be higher than the minimum laid down in the 1988 Basle accord, because of the relatively high risk of their loan portfolios. Domestic loans and investment rates should be raised from current low levels. Private sector incentives such as changes in taxation and requirements to invest in pension funds should be considered. Industrial countries should continue to support economic reform by ensuring access to their markets by Latin American goods and services, and by ratifying the Uruguay round of global trade liberalisation.

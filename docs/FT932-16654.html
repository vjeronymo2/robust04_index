			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Labour to float plan for two-tier boards THE CONCEPT of the European-style company, with a two-tier board, is being canvassed by Labour as part of its drive to bring more 'long-termism' into British industry. Labour sees some merits in the German model, in which a firm's governance is split between a supervisory board responsible for monitoring management and setting policy, and an executive board dealing with the management of the policy. Worker directors would be elected to the supervisory board, to which the executive board would be accountable. The idea is expected to be floated tomorrow by Mr Stuart Bell, the opposition's City spokesman, in a speech to the British Accounting Association. He is expected to argue that one of the benefits of this form of organisation is that the company is less susceptible to hostile takeovers. This accent on long-term planning in industry is reflected in Labour's new policy paper to be launched tomorrow. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, will use the discussion paper Making Britain's Future, as the basis for consultation with commerce and industryover the coming months. One of its elements is a proposal to shift the burden of proof when hostile takeovers are referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission so that the takeover rather than the defence has to be justified. The argument for a takeover would have to take in not only the financial rationale and the benefits to the companies involved, but include the wider impact of the deal on the economy and whether the takeover was in the national interest. The paper envisages that Britain's manufacturing base could be broadened by ensuring that pension funds could have a greater emphasis on industrial investment - and perhaps by diverting some building society funds to industry rather than property. It also proposes a change in the law to prevent banks forcing the closure of companies that could be revived.</p>

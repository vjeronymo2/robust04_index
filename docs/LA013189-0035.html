			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney reshuffled his Cabinet and announced  organizational changes that signaled a new attack on the nation's $24-billion  budget deficit. Mulroney, who led his Progressive Conservative Party to victory  in November, announced the creation of four policy committees and a powerful  expenditure panel to oversee spending. Mulroney also named six newcomers to the  Cabinet and announced an extensive series of promotions and demotions.  Mulroney's pro-business team, first elected in 1984, secured its second  consecutive majority government in the November election after a campaign over  free trade with the United States.  </P></p>

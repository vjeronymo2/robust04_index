			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: STAGE: NEA CONTROVERSY CALLS FOR ACTION ON PATRONS' PART  </P> <P> Four artists whose work has stirred the controversy surrounding the National  Endowment for the Arts are no strangers to San Diego audiences.  </P> <P> Just last week, embattled NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer barred grants to the  four, despite a recommendation for funding by an NEA panel.  </P> <P> The rejection should come as a shock to those lucky enough to have seen John  Fleck's comic performance as "The Granny" at the Old Globe Theatre in January.  Or to those who savored the work of Karen Finley, Holly Hughes and Tim Miller  at Sushi Performance Gallery.  </P> <P> Just how obscene did San Diego audiences think these artists were? The San  Diego Critics Circle nominated Finley, a fiery and passionate performer, for  its Best Actress Award, and Fleck received critical accolades for a virtuoso  performance in the Old Globe's popular "Granny."  </P> <P> Finley and Hughes also drew the largest audiences Sushi has ever had, said its  managing director, Vicki Wolf. Sushi has already booked Hughes for December and  plans to invite Finley to appear in April. Wolf said Sushi, which receives  $15,000 in NEA money, will not use any of that money to underwrite these  artists.  </P> <P> The Times reported that, according to sources familiar with the situation,  pressure to reject these artists came from the White House and Congress.  </P> <P> It's amazing that the White House and Congress have nothing better to do than  expend all their efforts in keeping a couple of thousand dollars from going  into the hands of four nationally recognized artists. And why? No one is saying  exactly, but, according to the sources, Miller got into trouble because he  attached a personal statement with his NEA application criticizing Sen. Jesse  Helms (R-N.C.), saying: "Look here, Sen. Jesse Helms, keep your Porky Pig face  out of the NEA."  </P> <P> Crude, granted. But don't we have a First Amendment anymore? Or has it been  amended like the commandments in "Animal Farm" to read that Americans can say  whatever they like as long as it isn't critical of Jesse Helms?  </P> <P> Hughes deals with lesbian subjects. Miller writes about gays. Finley is a  feminist artist who, at one point in her performance, strips and smears her  body with chocolate and alfalfa sprouts to make a point about women's bodies  being treated as objects.  </P> <P> Still, the real concern here is not whether these individuals get a few dollars  from the NEA. The fear is, considering the political clout of those against  them, whether they will get jobs in the future. Will today's NEA shutout build  the blacklist of tomorrow?  </P> <P> "I hope we are more enlightened than that," said Thomas Hall, managing director  of the Old Globe. "John (Fleck) is a consummate artist. There's no doubt that  John's work here at the Globe and as a performance artist has artistic merit  and deserved to be given every consideration."  </P> <P> But these are the times that try enlightened souls. Will someone try to cut off  NEA funds to companies planning to hire Fleck, Hughes, Miller or Finley? Will  any company in this witch-hunting climate be willing to take that risk?  </P> <P> The list of NEA recipients who are rejecting their grants grows daily. These  artists and organizations don't want to be restricted in subject matter, style  or content by what politicians tell the NEA is "obscene."  </P> <P> In coming months, San Diego's leading theaters, the Old Globe, the La Jolla  Playhouse and the San Diego Repertory Theatre, along with other arts  organizations here and across the nation, will have to decide whether to accept  or reject NEA money.  </P> <P> Most nonprofit arts organizations came into being because of NEA money. They  need it desperately. But how far should they be willing to compromise to get  it?  </P> <P> Wolf said Sushi will accept its money because "we don't believe we do anything  obscene or pornographic. To not accept it would be exactly what the people  fighting against us want us to do. It's giving in."  </P> <P> The tightly organized group railing against obscenity in the arts is becoming  drunk with its own power. The protesters are winning, and their trophy will be  either the NEA or its soul, because if the NEA lets Helms decide what is or  isn't art, or who can or can't be hired, then the organization will become  little more than a pimp for a few powerful politicians and the special-interest  groups that pull their strings.  </P> <P> Art has never needed its friends more than now. Everyone who cares about the  symphony, the ballet, the theater and freedom of expression should make his or  her voice heard, whether it's writing their legislators or organizing to  counter the attack.  </P> <P> The NEA helped build the regional arts movement in this country. It improved  quality here, and arts patrons no longer need to catch a flight to New York for  an occasional culture fix. It deserves the support of the public -- but, as the  arts benefactor it was meant to be, not as a vehicle for censorship.  </P> <P> What the NEA has helped do for everyday life in America's finest cities has  been incalculable. Now it's time to return some of that help to the NEA.  </P> <P> PROGRAM NOTES: The La Jolla Playhouse crisis campaign, which had a $1-million  fund-raising goal to be met by June 30, raised $700,000 by that date. The  campaign will continue through October. The 1990 season, which began  auspiciously with a 101% attendance for "The Cherry Orchard" (the extra  percentage point means standing room only), is secure, said managing director  Alan Levey. Subscription sales have risen to an all-time high of 9,018, with a  68% renewal rate. And the deficit, which was $703,000, dropped to $633,000 as  of Oct. 31, 1989, he said.  </P> <P> Levey also predicts that fund raising will get easier as the season continues  and patrons can see the work they are supporting. "The Cherry Orchard"  attendance figures are second only to the playhouse production of Lee  Blessing's "A Walk in the Woods," which saw 109%. . . .  </P> <P> The Del Mar Theatre Ensemble, a children's theater company that is opening its  production of "Scapan" on Saturday, is desperately looking for a permanent  home. Directed by Tony-winning William Ball, the company is working outside in  the Del Mar Plaza at 1555 Camino Del Mar. Artistic director Bonnie Tarwater is  hosting a fund-raising family dinner reception featuring Batman, Superman,  Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland and the Teenage Ninja Mutant Turtles at 2 p.m.  Saturday. . . .  </P> <P> The San Diego Repertory Theatre is extending "Latins Anonymous" through July  15. . . .  </P> <P> Underground at the Lyceum continues with "Moment to Moment" today and Saturday.  The Ensemble Arts Theatre's "V*V*N" (for Vaudeville Viet Nam), an original  work, will show at 10:30 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays from July 13-28. . . .  </P> <P> A reading of Judy Montague's "The Zhabotinsky Reactions," a story of modern  gene engineering directed by San Diego Rep artistic director Douglas Jacobs,  will be given at Words &amp; Music Bookstore at 7 p.m. July 11, and at 8 p.m.  July 23 at the Lyceum Space.  </P></p>

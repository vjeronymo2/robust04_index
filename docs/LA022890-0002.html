			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS KEEP JAIL MEASURE OFF BALLOT;  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT: SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE COUNTY'S  TROUBLE-PLAGUED CORRECTIONS FACILITIES.  </P> <P> The Board of Supervisors decided Tuesday not to place a measure on the June  ballot calling for the creation of a corrections department, instead deciding  to seek the cooperation of the Sheriff's Department in improving operations of  the troubled county jail system.  </P> <P> Frustration over Sheriff John Duffy's repeated cost overruns in running the  jails and recent reports about mismanagement spurred Board Chairman Leon  Williams and Supervisor George Bailey to draft the proposal that would strip  control of the jails from the sheriff and turn it over to a corrections  department.  </P> <P> But, with Duffy's announcement that he will not seek reelection, the remaining  three board members -- Supervisors Susan Golding, Brian Bilbray and John  MacDonald -- voted against the proposal, saying they would rather give a new  sheriff an opportunity to propose and implement jail management reforms.  </P> <P> The supervisors, however, unanimously approved a separate motion reserving the  right to place a similar measure calling for a corrections department on the  November ballot if the candidates for sheriff fail to offer solutions or  cooperate with the board to help solve the county's jail woes.  </P> <P> "We have an opportunity to hear from the candidates and the public has an  opportunity to ask some real hard questions," said Golding, who expressed  concern that the board had not had enough time to study the proposal and was  rushing unnecessarily to make a decision now. "I think this debate should be  continued vigorously until August," which is the deadline for placing a measure  on the November ballot.  </P> <P> Golding had said earlier that supporting a corrections department now would  destroy any chance of building "a spirit of cooperation" with the Sheriff's  Department, which has vigorously opposed such an action.  </P> <P> Although Bailey and Williams welcomed cooperation with the Sheriff's  Department, they insisted that the only way to ensure accountability is to have  a board-appointed civilian director running the county's detention facilities.  Unlike the sheriff -- an elected official who responds independently to voters  -- a corrections director hired by the supervisors would be under the direct  control of the board, the two supervisors argued.  </P> <P> "The new sheriff may have the good will and be very cooperative, but the  sheriff who succeeds him may not," Williams said. "It is better to have the law  clear rather than depend on somebody's good will."  </P> <P> Bailey added: "Accountability is the main thing. If it was possible to  immediately establish a department of corrections, I would."  </P> <P> J. Phil Franklin, foreman of the San Diego County Grand Jury that recently  released a report supporting creation of a corrections department, also  expressed disappointment with the board's decision.  </P> <P> "All they're doing is postponing a decision that should be made now," Franklin  said. "When the sheriff overspends by millions . . . and the county is  powerless to raise taxes, the cost (overrun) must come at the expense of other  county programs. There is a better way."  </P> <P> In addition to gaining accountability, Williams' and Bailey's interest in  creating a corrections department was piqued when they heard about the  financial success achieved by Santa Clara County, which removed control of  jails from its sheriff and turned it over to a new corrections department in  January, 1989.  </P> <P> A corrections department that employed correctional officers -- who are  lower-paid and receive less training than sheriff's deputies -- helped Santa  Clara County save $6 million during the first 18 months of operation; a savings  of more than $10 million is expected by June, according to the San Diego County  Grand Jury report that studied Santa Clara's switch in detention operations.  </P> <P> But a subsequent county staff report, stating that San Diego County could trim  jail costs by hiring correctional officers without creating a corrections  department, coupled with Duffy's unexpected announcement that he eventually  intends to replace all sheriff's deputies working in the jails with  correctional officers, derailed the move toward a new system.  </P> <P> The three supervisors who opposed placing a measure on the June ballot said  they did so not because they are against the creation of a corrections  department but because they had not been persuaded yet that a new system is  needed to achieve the board's goals.  </P> <P> "There are two issues here that must and will be addressed," Bilbray said. "One  is that whoever runs the jails must be accountable to the budgetary process,  and two, we must and will establish a correctional officers system. How we best  implement these two strategies, however, remains unanswered.  </P> <P> "Several of the (sheriff) candidates said they would be financially  accountable," Bilbray added. "I think it's time to cooperate, but if they  don't, I'll support a mandated program."  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORRISON'S LEGACY  </P> <P> If Oliver Stone is making a movie about Morrison (or anything else), he should  pay more attention to historical detail in his sound track.  </P> <P> In Stone's current film, "Born on the Fourth of July," Don McLean's "American  Pie" was played as background music while the film covered the 1968-69 era.  "American Pie" wasn't even released until 1971!  </P> <P> BOB PALMER  </P> <P> Moreno Valley  </P></p>

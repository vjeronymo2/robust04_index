			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / The hard work is still to come: Kohl must control a fractious coalition government At 11.13 yesterday morning, a hush fell over Germany's Bundestag. Mrs Rita Sussmuth, the speaker, had returned to her seat. 'Look, there go the flowers  -he's made it,' a cameraman whispered. Seconds later Mr Helmut Kohl rose out of his front row seat to acknowledge an ovation from the massed ranks behind him. There was not a flicker of emotion from the opposition benches. Mr Kohl had made it. By the skin of his teeth - with just one vote more than the 337 he needed to have an absolute majority in the 672-seat assembly - he had been elected chancellor for a fifth term. That was the easy part. The tough time is still to come. For the next four years, Mr Kohl will have to keep control of a tired and fractious coalition, with a majority of just 10 votes in the Bundestag, and a hostile majority in the Bundesrat, the second chamber of the German parliament where the 16 states are represented. He must do so with a budget that is already seriously overstretched, a continuing drain of funds to support the collapsed economy in east Germany, and a soaring public debt burden that is set to exceed DM2,000bn, or some 62 per cent of gross domestic product, in 1995. Much of what Mr Kohl intends to do is spelt out in his agenda for the coming legislative period, a 49-page document agreed in record time between his Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its more conservative Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the Free Democratic party (FDP), since they won their narrow victory in the October 16 general election. The focus is clear: it includes reducing the budget deficit, cutting public expenditure and creating jobs to counter the rise in long-term unemployment in west Germany as well as the east. But implementing this agenda may well expose the cracks in the coalition, particularly since the government's majority now depends on its weakest partner: the FDP, led by Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, saw its support slump from 11 per cent to 6.9 per cent in the election and now needs to assert its independence to regain support. Tax reform, and the whole effort to reduce the budget deficit, may prove the first test. The previous government's medium-term fiscal plan envisaged a decline in the deficit from 4.4 per cent of GDP in 1993 to less than 1 per cent of GDP in 1998. Such a reduction would lead to a decrease in the public debt ratio, from the peak of 62 per cent in 1995 to 57.5 per cent in 1998. This would allow Germany to fulfil the requirements for entering the European monetary union. Mr Thomas Mayer, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, says 'this desired deficit reduction would require keeping the annual average increase in total government expenditures to 2.4 per cent in 1995-1998', compared with a predicted nominal growth rate of 5.25 per cent a year over that period. That will be tough enough to achieve. But the need for expenditure restraint will be greatest for the 11 west German states, to allow for above-average spending growth of the five east German states to fund high infrastructure and social spending. Since most of the states are dominated by the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD), Mr Kohl will be forced to strike bargains with the Bundesrat to push through all the cuts he needs. The FDP is already chafing at the re-imposition of the so-called solidarity surcharge from next January 1, a 7.5 percentage point addition to income tax designed to raise an estimated DM28bn for investment in eastern Germany. This will curb the deficit, which Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, admits will still total DM64bn this year. But in keeping with its liberal, tax-cutting traditions, the FDP tried to negotiate a deadline by which the surcharge would be scrapped. It had to make do, instead, with an annual review, and the issue is certain to strain relations between the coalition partners. 'How long can the taxpayer tolerate high taxes?' asked a liberal deputy. The SPD, for its part, is already challenging the coalition's other taxation policies. The biggest bone of contention is the way in which the government will finance an increase in the income tax threshold - demanded by the federal constitutional court - so that no tax is paid below subsistence level. Achieving this means a rise in tax-free income from DM5,060 to DM12,000, at a cost, according to Mr Waigel, of DM15bn. An independent commission, which he appointed, argues the cost of raising the tax threshold will be closer to DM40bn. And the three coalition partners have yet to explain how the government will implement cuts in social spending while finding the money to finance their election promises. Two commissions have been appointed to assess what needs to be changed. One will examine the range of welfare benefits to see whether they are necessary; the other is to determine what can be done to encourage the long-term unemployed to return to work, even if the jobs are low-paid. Neither is expected to report until 1996 and the coalition programme contains few hints about how money can be saved before then. Cuts in social spending remain a priority for German industry which still complains about the burden of social security contributions. To underline its concerns, the employers' federation presented an ambitious programme to restructure the social security system just two days after the October election. But Mr Kohl knows the issue remains divisive within his own CDU, and faces a battle to push social spending cuts through the Bundesrat. The SPD nominally controls 41 of the chamber's 68 seats - enough to block most legislation. In practice, the states in the Bundesrat rarely vote on purely party political lines. But it will still take all the government's tactical skills to outmanoeuvre the SPD. There are political tensions as well. The SPD, the Greens, and the Party of Democratic Socialism, the one-time East German Communist party, will seize every opportunity to exploit the government's tiny majority, and especially to detach the FDP from its coalition partners. One tense issue is certain to be the government's campaign against organised crime. This would include installing electronic surveillance and bugging devices in homes, something which the liberals oppose. It was dropped from the coalition's agenda because of bitter disagreements between the partners. Given the vulnerability of the FDP, which exposes the fragility of the coalition, it will be left up to Mr Wolfgang Schauble, parliamentary head of the CDU/CSU faction, to impose not only party discipline across the ranks, but also to weaken the opposition by dividing it. He has already made tentative overtures to the Greens. Last week, it was the CDU, and not the SPD, that elected Ms Antje Vollmer, a senior member of the Greens, as one of the Bundestag's four deputy speakers. 'The last thing Mr Kohl wants is a united opposition whose policies might appear attractive to the FDP,' said a close colleague of the Chancellor. 'Given this weakened majority and a strong SPD in the Bundesrat, I just wonder if this government has enough political will to push through its policies,' said Mr Mayer. Mr Kohl only just made it yesterday. He has gone before parliament five times since 1982 to be elected chancellor - yesterday's margin of victory was his smallest ever. That in itself augurs badly for the coming four years. His greatest strength, though, remains his ability to surprise. He may do so again.</p>

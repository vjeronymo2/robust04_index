			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY FIRM TO MAKE MOVIES IN SOVIET UNION  </P> <P> A small Laguna Hills investment firm said Wednesday that it has formed a joint  venture with a Soviet film studio to produce low-budget movies in the Soviet  Union.  </P> <P> Rolan A. Bykov, president of Moscow-based All Union Movie and TV Centre, said  the agreement calls for the production of 20 movies over a five-year period,  with each picture budgeted at a cost of between $8 million and $10 million.  </P> <P> All Union Movie, which has 11 studios under its wing, is an independent agency  created in 1989 by the Soviet government to oversee the Soviet Film industry.  </P> <P> The Soviet agency and Stevenson, Abercrombie &amp; Claythorne, a Laguna Hills  investment bank, also said they have formed a joint venture bank, International  Investment Cultural Bank, to provide financing for the films.  </P> <P> "Compared to the United States, making movies in the Soviet Union is  inexpensive," said Michael Colla, president of Rico-Lion Films of Hollywood,  who will oversee the production of the films. "Our intention is to combine the  ability of the Russians and the talents of the Americans to reach the  international market."  </P> <P> Bykov, who is also chairman of the Soviet government's cultural commission,  said the venture, called Soyuz Hart, will produce films based on Soviet and  U.S. legends and folk tales. The Soviets hope the venture will give the Soviet  film industry a higher profile in the West, he said, and also help the country  obtain more foreign currency.  </P> <P> Jack Elliott, chairman of Stevenson, Abercrombie, said Soyuz Hart plans several  projects, including plans by Hart Industries Inc. of Laguna Hills to clean up  toxic waste sites in the greater Moscow area. Elliott is chairman of Hart  Industries, a publicly held firm that cleans underground gasoline storage  tanks. Stevenson, Abercrombie owns 26% of Hart.  </P> <P> Among the venture's other proposed projects is a chain of fast-food hot dog  restaurants in the Moscow area and construction of a business center near the  Moscow River.  </P></p>

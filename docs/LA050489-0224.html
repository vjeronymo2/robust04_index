			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EX-COACHES PLEAD INNOCENT IN DRUG CASE;  </P> <P> ACCUSED IN PROBE OF ALLEGED STEROID USE BY S. CAROLINA ATHLETES  </P> <P> Four former South Carolina football coaches were arraigned today on charges  stemming from a probe of alleged steroid use at the university and illegal  distribution of the drug statewide.  </P> <P> The four men, who were indicted April 19 by a federal grand jury, pleaded  innocent to the charges. U.S. Magistrate Charles Gambrell granted $10,000  unsecured bond each and said the men, none of whom live in South Carolina, will  be allowed to leave the state.  </P> <P> Former Gamecocks coaches Jim Washburn, Tom Gadd and Tom Kurucz were indicted by  the grand jury for "conspiring to conduct a program of illegal steroid use by  members of the athletic community . . . particularly by members of the  university's football team." Former players and coaches allegedly used  steroids, according to the indictment.  </P> <P> Washburn, Gadd and Kurucz were also charged with importing steroids into the  state and dispensing the drugs without a prescription. Kurucz is also charged  with lying to the grand jury.  </P> <P> Former Gamecocks strength coach Keith Kephart was charged with conspiring with  others in the university's "athletic community" to bring steroids into the  state and dispense them without prescriptions.  </P> <P> Kephart declined comment after the court hearing. Before his arraignment, he  said he would not discuss the case until it was settled.  </P> <P> "Obviously, it's been trying," he said. "That's why I'm anxious to get it  settled."  </P> <P> John Carter of Bethesda, Md., was indicted on charges he distributed steroids  to four former Gamecocks' players, including Tommy Chaikin. He was scheduled to  be arraigned later today.  </P> <P> It was Chaikin's article in Sports Illustrated on Oct. 24 detailing alleged  steroid and drug use by football players that prompted the grand jury probe.  </P> <P> A trial date has tentatively been set for June 6.  </P></p>

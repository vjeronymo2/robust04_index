			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Halstead advances 14% James Halstead lifted pre-tax profits and turnover to record levels in the year to June 30 on the back of improved exports by the core floorcovering side and solid progress at Driza-Bone, the Australian stockman's coat company. The Manchester-based group increased profits by 14 per cent to Pounds 9.9m (Pounds 8.7m) on turnover up 16 per cent to Pounds 69.1m (Pounds 59.4m). Mr Stephen Knight, finance director, said that floorcoverings contributed about two thirds of turnover and 'more than that of profit'. Some Pounds 7.5m, including Pounds 6.5m in the year was spent on vinyl flooring technology in the Manchester manufacturing base. He said this would lead to better flexibility to service customer needs, productivity gains, increased capacity, and new products with different mixes and finishes. Mr Knight said UK sales had risen 'marginally'. According to its own research, it had held its 55 per cent market share in homogeneous sheet vinyl flooring, without entering discount wars. Exports, however, grew by 30 per cent. The group sells to 46 countries, with Europe, and especially Germany, the strongest markets. Phoenix, the motorcycle accessories distributor, had turnover of about Pounds 8m. It added new products to its roster and, said Mr Knight, benefited from the 'greater number of large bikes bought by middle-aged riders'. However currency pressures 'torpedoed' profits growth. Conway saw further decline in its camping products, offset by good demand for security cabins. Driza-Bone had a record year with sales of Pounds 7m, of which 30 per cent were exported. A final dividend of 4.75p makes a total 15 per cent higher at 7.5p (6.5p). Earnings grew 11 per cent to 22.5p (20.33p).</p>

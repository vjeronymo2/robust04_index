			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Yuriy Kozlov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 16 March -- A draft convention guaranteeing  the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic,  linguistic, and religious minorities will be completed "in the  very shortest time." An ITAR-TASS correspondent was told by a  high-ranking official in the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry  that an understanding to this effect was reached at a sitting of  the CIS Council of Foreign Ministers, which ended here today.  It was attended by the heads of the Foreign Ministries of  Russia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan, and by  ambassadors and deputy ministers from seven other Commonwealth  countries.    According to the Russian diplomat, the leaders of the  foreign  policy departments considered "a huge agenda." The sittings of  the Council passed off "on the whole in a constructive spirit,"  and the discussions enabled a step forward to be taken in the  discussion of important issues, although final decisions on many  of them have yet to be taken.    Thus, experts have been instructed to put the finishing  touches to a draft declaration on observance of the sovereignty,  territorial integrity, and inviolability of the borders of the  Commonwealth states.    The high-ranking diplomat described a group of problems  connected with the sharing out of non-military marine vessels of  the former USSR with the states of the CIS and the Baltic area  as "a difficult question" that "will be looked at again." Those  attending the sitting confined themselves to deciding to set up  a group of experts.    Cognizance was taken of a paper from the Council of Border  Troop Commanders about the progress of the talks between the  Russian Federation, Central Asian, and Transcaucasian states on  cooperation on guarding the borders with third countries. Those  attending the forum decided to uphold the idea of creating  within the CIS a permanent consultative commission for  peacekeeping activities.    The sitting also discussed matters connected with NATO's  "Partnership for Peace" program. Permanent consultations  between the Foreign Ministries on the participation of the CIS  states in implementing it will now come into being. The  prospects for CIS-CSCE cooperation were examined.    A proposal put forward by Kazakhstan to hold a special  session of the UN General Assembly on problems of the  post-confrontation period "was, on the whole, supported". It  was decided, however, to continue the discussion.    Russia, Belarus, and the Ukraine were instructed to prepare  the text of a joint message from the CIS countries to the  peoples of the Commonwealth and the world community in  connection with the 50th anniversary of victory in the Great  Patriotic War.    The timing of the next sitting of the Foreign Ministers'  Council was determined. It will take place in June on the eve  of the next Council of Heads of State.    A joint sitting of the CIS Council of Foreign Ministers and  the Council of Defense Ministers of the states participating in  the Treaty on Collective Security was held in the afternoon. It  considered a package of documents regulating the activities of  the Collective Security Council and its secretariat, which were  set up in December last year. Further work on these documents  is required before they are submitted at the next sitting of the  Council of Heads of State. They must be adopted in order to set  in motion the mechanism that has been created.    Another question that the Foreign and Defense Ministers  examined concerned a protocol to the Treaty on Collective  Security. The point is that two countries, Russia and  Azerbaijan, have proposed amendments to the document. In the  course of discussion, the ministers concluded that it was not a  good idea to modify the actual text of the treaty, but that the  changes that life prompted could be expressed in a declaration.  A decision to draw up such a declaration was adopted.    Consideration was given to a number of possible measures to  boost the effectiveness of the functioning of the collective  peacekeeping forces in the Republic of Tajikistan and to  stabilize the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border.</p>

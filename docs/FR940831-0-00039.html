L. 101&hyph;239. Section 10302 added sections 202(j)(5) and 1631(e)(5) of the Social Security Act (the Act) to provide, in general, for the establishment of a ``deemed'' filing date of an application for benefits under title II or title XVI of the Act, respectively, in any case in which it is determined to the satisfaction of the Secretary that an individual failed to apply for monthly Social Security or SSI benefits because of misinformation provided to the individual by an officer or employee of the Social Security Administration (SSA) about his or her eligibility for the benefits. In general, sections 202(j)(5) and 1631(e)(5) provide that, in such a case, an individual will be ``deemed'' to have applied for monthly Social Security or SSI benefits, as appropriate, on the later of: The date the misinformation was provided to such individual; or the date such individual met all requirements for entitlement to or eligibility for such benefits, other than the requirement of filing an application.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  These rules are effective August 31, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Henry D.

L. 101&hyph;239, which added sections 202(j)(5) and 1631(e)(5) of the Act. Sections 202(j)(5) and 1631(e)(5) of the Act provide that in any case in which it is determined to the satisfaction of the Secretary that an individual failed to apply for monthly Social Security or SSI benefits because of misinformation provided to such individual by an officer or employee of SSA relating to the individual's eligibility for the respective benefits, such individual will be ``deemed'' to have applied for monthly Social Security or SSI benefits, as the case may be, on the later of: (1) The date the misinformation was provided to such individual; or (2) the date on which such individual met all requirements for entitlement to Social Security benefits, or all requirements of eligibility for SSI benefits, as appropriate, other than the requirement of filing an application. The amendment relating to applications for monthly Social Security benefits, under section 202(j)(5) of the Act, applies to misinformation provided after December 31, 1982, and is effective for benefits payable for months beginning after that date. The amendment relating to applications for SSI benefits, under section 1631(e)(5) of the Act, applies to misinformation provided on or after December 19, 1989, the date of the enactment of OBRA 1989, and is effective for benefits payable for months after December 1989.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are amending our regulations on filing an application for Social Security or SSI benefits to include rules to implement section 10302 of OBRA 1989. These final regulations describe the rules for establishing a ``deemed'' filing date of an application for benefits under section 202(j)(5) or 1631(e)(5) of the Act in a case in which an individual failed to apply for benefits because of certain misinformation provided to the individual by an officer or employee of SSA. Among other things, the regulations explain what is meant by ``misinformation'' for purposes of these rules, describe the kinds of evidence we will consider in determining whether misinformation was provided, and explain that a determination on a claim for benefits under these sections of the Act, i.e., a determination as to whether or not to establish a ``deemed'' filing date of an application on the basis that misinformation was provided which caused an individual not to apply for benefits, is an initial determination for purposes of administrative and judicial review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, our current regulations at &sect;&sect;404.603 and 416.305(a) provide that to become entitled to Social Security benefits or become eligible to receive SSI benefits, an individual, in addition to meeting all other requirements, must file an application for Social Security benefits or for SSI benefits, as appropriate. An application must be on a prescribed application form and meet certain other requirements specified in &sect;404.610 or &sect;416.310.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current &sect;404.614 provides, with certain exceptions, that an application for Social Security benefits is filed on the day it is received by an SSA employee at one of our offices or by an SSA employee who is authorized to receive it at another place. If a written statement indicating intent to claim Social Security benefits is filed, we will use the filing date of the written statement as the filing date of the application under the conditions described in &sect;404.630. Also, if an individual telephones us and advises us that he or she intends to file a claim for Social Security benefits but cannot file an application before the end of the month, &sect;404.630(b) provides that we will prepare and sign a written statement if it is necessary to prevent the loss of benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the SSI program, current &sect;416.325 provides, with certain exceptions, that an application for SSI benefits is considered to be filed on the day it is received by an SSA employee at any Social Security office, by someone at another Federal or State office designated to receive applications for us, or by a person whom we have authorized to receive applications for us. Also, under the conditions described in &sect;&sect;416.340, 416.345 and 416.350, if we receive a written statement indicating an intent to claim SSI benefits or an oral inquiry about SSI benefits, we will use the filing date of the written statement or the date of the oral inquiry as the filing date of the application, if the use of that date will result in eligibility for additional benefits.  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

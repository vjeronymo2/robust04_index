			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 29 (XINHUA) -- Russian Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev today proposed creating a collective  security system in the Asian-Pacific region, saying that a  special group of experts might be assembled in the near future  to work out a program.    After meeting with his South Korean colleague Yi Pyong-tae  in  Moscow, Grachev told reporters that they had discussed his  proposal which would be examined in Seoul.    The two ministers also discussed problems concerning the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). Meanwhile,  Grachev expressed his worries over DPRK's nuclear program.    Yi Pyong-tae stressed that the military ties between Russia  and South Korea will serve as confidence and security-building  measures both between the two countries and on the Korean  peninsula.    The two ministers' talks resulted in the signing of two  accords -- a memorandum on mutual understanding between the two  countries' defense ministers and a declaration on military  cooperation between Russia and South Korea.    Yi Pyong-tae arrived here on Thursday [28 April] for an  official visit to Russia.</p>

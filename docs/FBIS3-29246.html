			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 16 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa told a parliamentary session Wednesday [16 February] he  has yet to decide whether to reshuffle his cabinet, but failed  to rule out such a move.    "The issue is still a blank piece of paper and I am not  working on the assumption that I should conduct it immediately,"  the premier said in reply to a coalition lawmaker at the House  of Councillors plenary session.    Hosokawa said he will focus provisionally on seeking Diet  approval of the third pump-primer supplementary budget for  fiscal 1993 and revisions of a political reform package that  passed the Diet on January 29.    Hosokawa made the remarks in response to a question from  Kazuo Oikawa, a lawmaker of the Social Democratic Party [of  Japan] [SDPJ], the biggest force in his coalition, which  responded sharply to his proposal to reshape his six-month-old  cabinet.    His remarks came at a moment time when some leaders of the  ruling coalition traded sharp exchanges over the reshuffle  proposal.    Speaking at the foreign correspondents club of Japan, SDPJ  Secretary General Wataru Kubo urged Hosokawa not to reshuffle  his cabinet to fire his spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi Takemura.    "If the reshuffle is designed to oust a specific cabinet  minister, the administration will lose its solidarity," he  warned.    Hosokawa and Takemura were once close political allies, but  their relationship is now reportedly at odds.    Hosokawa said Tuesday that he intends to reshape the cabinet  that has been in place since he assumed power last August. He  also sounded out Hiroyuki Sonoda, a key figure in Sakigake, on  whether he is ready to take over the post.    Takemura heads Sakigake, one of the partners in the  coalition. He is known to be at odds with Hosokawa over the  premier's proposal to impose a new 7-percent indirect levy on  goods and services.    Takemura also clashed late last year with Shinseito  co-leader  Ichiro Ozawa and Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito,  over the handling of political reform bills. Ozawa reportedly  asked Hosokawa to dismiss takemura.    Ichikawa told a meeting of Komeito lawmakers, "it is high  time for us to seek to ensure that the cabinet can work smoothly  by eliminating differences within the cabinet."    Democratic Socialist Party Chairman Keigo Ouchi balked at  the  idea of the reshuffle, but the No.2 man in the party, Takashi  Yonezawa, another ally of Ozawa, has remained mum on the issue.</p>

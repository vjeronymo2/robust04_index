			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jorge Ivan Castro from the "AM/PM" newscast] </F>   [Text] Despite the announcement that Colombia will no  longer receive information from them, the gringo radars in our  country are still functioning, and it is not yet known whether  they will be dismantled. Many questions have been raised  concerning the issue.    According to a bulletin released by the Colombian Air Force,  the order issued unilaterally on 1 May by the U.S. Defense  Department called for the suspension of satellite transmissions  of the information obtained from the radars at the Air Force's  control center. There has been no mention of plans to dismantle  the tracking equipment or to continue supplying information to  the gringo government.    A confidential source informed "AM/PM" that the radars are  still being operated by U.S. personnel and that, in response to  Colombia's request that the equipment be dismantled, the Defense  Department requested a deadline of three months when the job can  be done within a maximum of 10 days.    The United States has decided to stop providing Colombia  with  information because it believes that Colombia has violated  several international agreements by ordering attacks on strange  airplanes, as strange as the gringo military airplanes that  frequently fly over Colombian territory without permission.    An official decision is still expected from the two  governments with regard to this situation, which is just another  case of the Gaviria administration's confusing and mysterious  international policy.</p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> EDUCATION / PALA RESERVATION;  </P> <P> PALA NUN DARES HER STUDENTS TO DREAM;  </P> <P> SHE KNOWS HERSELF IT CHANGES LIVES  </P> <P> She was an Indian girl, growing up on the Pala reservation in North County, a  lanky teen-ager who was like brown lightning on the soccer field, a budding  Pele in a pair of old shorts. She was just that graceful.  </P> <P> The classroom was a different game altogether -- a place where she sometimes  struggled with even simple concepts. But to her, it didn't matter. Book  knowledge, she said, was a tool for the outside world.  </P> <P> She was an Indian. There was no need to leave the reservation. She'd get a job  as a grocery store checker, just like others had done before her. She would get  by.  </P> <P> Well, that may have been good enough for the girl, still a student at the  school, but not for Sister Mary Yarger. The principal of the Mission San  Antonio de Pala school has seen too many such youngsters blinded to their  potential. And she knows the reason why.  </P> <P> Yarger herself is a Luiseno Indian who grew up on the Pala reservation and  attended the same mission school for children between kindergarten and the  eighth grade.  </P> <P> For Yarger, who last fall became principal of what officials call the last  missionary-run Indian school in California, helping students realize their  dreams is a daily passion.  </P> <P> She not only knows the culture, she knows the people -- the mothers and fathers  and grandparents -- and she knows them by their first names. Much of her family  still lives on the reservation, which is on California 76, about 6 miles east  of Interstate 15.  </P> <P> She also knows what it meant to her to have parents who encouraged her to get  an education, go to college, see what the world beyond the reservation had to  offer.  </P> <P> "I saw what this girl was trying to do -- she would just sit there in school  and say, 'I don't have to do anything in life,' " said the 40-year-old nun, a  member of the Sisters of the Precious Blood order. "And I wasn't going to allow  that."  </P> <P> So Yarger engaged the student in frequent after-school talks. And she made  regular visits to counsel the elderly grandmother who was raising the girl --  conversations that focused not only on the importance of being Indian, but on  opening a child's eyes to new opportunities.  </P> <P> Now, while the girl still struggles with her class work, her goal is to finish  high school. It's a good start, Yarger says -- the rest will come later.  </P> <P> "We got her to believe that she could do something," she said. "We got her to  admit that she had dreams."  </P> <P> Yarger doesn't understand why the next famous astronomer, astronaut or highly  regarded physician can't be a child from the mission school. Indians, she says,  don't always have to become secretaries or general construction workers.  </P> <P> This from a woman who left the reservation to earn a bachelor's degree in  education and a master's in physical education, who saw the outside world and  decided to return home to help her people, an Indian who knows her roots.  </P> <P> In a world where minority students often fail to reinvest in their culture,  Yarger has given an entire career to her people.  </P> <P> After years of teaching science in other Catholic schools, she returned to the  Pala school three years ago to help begin an athletic program there.  </P> <P> Last fall, she became the second Indian to ever run the 33-year-old school, a  group of adobe and red-tile roof buildings that are part of the 174-year-old  Mission San Antonio de Pala.  </P> <P> Since then, her life has become a focused struggle not only to help keep the  school financially afloat but to help teach Indian children the meaning of  being Indian, salvaging the frayed threads of their culture that she says have  been neglected for more than a generation.  </P> <P> Her message to students is simple: You'll never know what you can become until  you try. And if you believe in who you are, you can achieve anything you want,  no matter who tells you it's not worthwhile. But success comes hard, she tells  her students; you've got to work for it.  </P> <P> To the boy who wants to become a professional football player, she explains  that he must go to college. And to get to college, he must first finish high  school. To do that, she warns, he must keep his grades up.  </P> <P> To the sixth-grader who wants to be an astronomer, she advises that looking up  into the sky isn't enough -- he must take math and science courses.  </P> <P> "It's something he never thought of," she said.  </P> <P> "Too many young people become too comfortable on the reservation," she says.  "It's a very closed society with uncles and aunts and grandparents living  sometimes a few houses away. It's very easy for children to just dig in.  </P> <P> "My job is to teach kids not to just look and see where their parents have gone  with their lives but to explore the opportunities of a new generation -- things  their parents never even thought about."  </P> <P> Yarger is one of a new generation of mentors for Indian children, educators  say. She is someone who is trying to come to grips with problems that still  plague many of the about 4,000 Native Americans living in North County on any  one of eight reservations -- the Pala, Rincon, La Jolla, San Pasqual, Pauma,  Mesa Grande, Los Coyotes and Santa Ysabel.  </P> <P> "She is proof that the Indian experience has come full circle," said Sister  Eucharista Marie Mitchell, pastoral minister for the mission. "She's a role  model. She has a personal touch that forms a bond with these children an  outsider could never quite achieve."  </P> <P> Patricia Dixon, a Luiseno Indian who attended grade school with Yarger and is  now chairwoman of the American Indian Studies department at Palomar College,  says Yarger provides just the dose of reality that many schoolchildren need.  </P> <P> "She can see through the smoke screen kids throw at you, saying 'I'm just an  Indian, I don't know.' She can tell them 'Hey, remember, I grew up here, too. I  lived three doors down from your father.' "  </P> <P> For Yarger and a handful of other nuns who run the mission school, the job  isn't just motivating students, but trying to keep the nine classrooms open for  business.  </P> <P> Last year, the cost of educating each student was about $1,800. Since annual  tuition is only $600, the sisters must find other ways to find money not only  to buy books, but maintain an athletic program, fill the gopher holes that  riddle the football field and keep the termites from eating through the wooden  beams that arch over each classroom.  </P> <P> Many of the girls at the school -- which has an enrollment of 167 students --  still wear the same hand-me-down green-plaid uniforms Yarger and others wore in  the 1950s. There is no money to buy new ones, she said.  </P> <P> "Being an Indian principal of this school is both good and bad," she said.  "Sure, I have an insider's view of the problems here, but even with knowing  people so closely, there's only so many times I can go back to the well, asking  them for money for the school."  </P> <P> The school doesn't require needy families to pay the tuition each year; they  give what they can. The lack of funds has put the mission school administrators  in some dire monetary straits.  </P> <P> The school has sponsored several fund-raising efforts, including a million-coin  drive to buy a new school bus and hire an additional driver. One of the mission  school's two buses is a 17-year-old vehicle that the school purchased with  Green Stamps.  </P> <P> Students have circulated jars around the reservation, asking for donations and  some have given their own change.  </P> <P> "I'm not prejudiced, I'll take pennies," Yarger said.  </P> <P> So far, the children have collected 19,000 coins. "That's only 2% of a million  but don't tell the kids," she said. "They think we're doing great."  </P> <P> Even a million pennies, she acknowledges, would only be $10,000. "Frankly, I  don't even know what a new bus would cost. I'm afraid to look. But I'm sure  that $10,000 wouldn't buy much these days."  </P> <P> But things have come a long way since Yarger returned to the school in 1986 to  begin building an athletic program. Back then, there were only a few team  sports and the only event the school competed in regularly was an annual track  meet.  </P> <P> She started several programs, including football and soccer teams, as well as  boys' and girls' basketball. Since most of the parents had to leave the  reservation to find work, transportation to and from games was a major problem.  </P> <P> So Yarger borrowed an old van from a friend. She even coached many of the teams  -- until her energy inspired others in the community to come forward to help.  </P> <P> "One night, this older man who was home from his job on medical leave, came to  one of our girls' soccer games," she recalled. "We were getting beat but good.  He just stood there laughing.  </P> <P> "The next night, he came to a girls' basketball game and laughed some more. I  told him 'Okay, if you know how to coach so well, you coach.' " The man soon  began helping out with several teams, she said.  </P> <P> Now, as principal, Yarger has other worries. One of her chief responsibilities  is making sure students get enough encouragement and guidance, not only at  school, but at home.  </P> <P> To do that, she visits them at their houses, trying to find out which person --  whether it is the mother, father, an uncle or grandfather -- can serve as their  mentor and encourage them to keep up with their work.  </P> <P> "I have to find out who in their family is going to do them the most good," she  said, "and it's usually a different member from each family. But grandparents  are usually the best. Around the reservation, there's still a lot of respect  for grandparents."  </P> <P> Yarger says that grandparents often have the most tangible connection with  their fleeting Indian culture.  </P> <P> "During World War II, everyone wanted to be known as an American and nothing  else," she said.  </P> <P> "A lot of the Indian culture was lost as young people fled the reservation.  They were foot-loose and fancy-free and didn't want to learn. Now they're older  and many have come back to find they don't have any culture left -- for them or  their kids."  </P> <P> Yarger herself is an example of that lost Indian generation. She cannot speak  her native Luiseno language and has lost many of the other customs. She knows  part of the Indian culture within her has died.  </P> <P> "I wasn't brought up within the Indian tradition," she said. "My father was an  Indian and he was proud of that. What I carry with me are the strong feelings  that were passed down through my father's family, that's what I hold dear."  </P> <P> Now her job, she says, is to pass that pride on to her students.  </P> <P> "A lot of kids know they're Indian but they don't know what that means," she  said. "Teachers have asked kids 'What kind of Indian are you?' and they'll  respond 'I don't know, I'm Indian.' Well, that just won't do."  </P> <P> The middle school, with more than 65% of its students Indians, tries to give  students a clear picture of their Indian identities before they become lost in  the larger high school scene in nearby Fallbrook or Temecula.  </P> <P> "We try to understand the way the American Indian does things, the way its  young people think," she said. "We know that the Indian isn't a competitive  person so we take a lot of that stressful competition out of the classroom  environment.  </P> <P> "For example, we never pit the boys against the girls. We want kids to achieve  their personal best and not feel like they have to beat everyone else in the  classroom."  </P> <P> While there is much literature on certain Indian tribes such as the Apache and  Navajo, little published research exists on most of the tribes that inhabit the  Pala reservation in North County and others like it -- groups such as the  Lupeno, Diegueno, Pomo and Modoc.  </P> <P> So Yarger plans to invite several reservation veterans into the classroom to  speak about their culture not only to the students, but to the staff of 10  non-Indian teachers as well.  </P></p>

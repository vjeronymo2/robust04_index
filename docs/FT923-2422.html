			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Britain: Building chiefs warn of greater hardship - Construction CONSTRUCTION companies, already suffering from the worst recession for 50 years, recoiled in horror yesterday at higher borrowing costs for themselves and their customers. Industry leaders warned that anybody - from brick manufacturers, architects and contractors to estate agents and chartered surveyors - making a living from construction would suffer even greater hardship. Mr Graeme Odgers, chief executive of Alfred McAlpine, said higher interest rates would make it harder to sell homes while businesses would be even less likely to invest in new offices, shops and factories. Companies warned that business failures and plant closures were likely to increase, forcing further redundancies in an industry that has already lost almost 300,000 jobs since summer 1989. Many have been forced to cut dividend payments to shareholders as profits have fallen. Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers' Confederation, the industry's largest trade association, said: 'If these rates persist, the result can only be a huge increase in company failures and we could soon be contemplating the horrendous prospect of  1/2 m jobless building workers.' Estate agents said mortgage rate rises would deal the housing market 'a hammer blow', delaying recovery in property values by at least six months. Mr Michael Jones, president of the National Association of Estate Agents, said the increases would kill stone dead an already faltering market. Mr Colin Parsons, chairman of Taylor Woodrow, the contractor, housebuilder and property development group, said: 'We might as well close the sales offices this weekend until sanity returns.' The biggest fear among builders and estate agents is that house prices, which have fallen on average by 25 per cent to 30 per cent in southern and eastern England, might fall even further. Mr Odgers said housebuilders, already proffering a vast array of sales incentives to encourage reluctant purchasers, would now concentrate on offering cheap mortgage schemes. 'Builders which raised large borrowings to buy expensively priced housing and commercial property land at the end of the 1980s will be hit doubly,' he said. 'Their own interest bill will rise while it will become more difficult to reduce debts by selling products to customers.' Criticism of government economic policy by construction companies, traditionally big contributors to Conservative party funds, has intensified recently as it became apparent that the housing recovery, hoped for after the general election, would not occur until next year at the earliest. Mr Robert Napier, chief executive of Redland, one of the UK's biggest building materials companies, said: 'It has been apparent for some time that the policy of trying to maintain parity between sterling and the D-Mark cannot be sustained without seriously damaging the rest of the economy. 'If we do not devalue the pound and reduce excessive interest rates, the recession will turn into a slump. The effects will be even more damaging for the construction industry, forcing output to fall even further from the current low levels.' General contractors can also expect to suffer, with industry and commerce even less likely to invest in new buildings. Construction output, even before yesterday's announcement, was forecast to fall by 6 per cent in the UK this year. That follows a 9 per cent fall last year. According to the National Economic Development Office, commercial construction - mainly offices and shops - is expected to fall by 25 per cent this year. More worrying for contractors has been the collapse in their margins as contract prices have fallen by up to 30 per cent since the late 1980s as competition for a dwindling workload has increased. Companies are fortunate if margins on some contracts even cover overheads, according to the Building Employers' Confederation. Mr Richard MacCormac, president of the Royal Institute of British Architects, said that even more architects' practices would close or make staff redundant. He added: 'It means there will be architects who have to sell their homes - if they can find a buyer.'</p>

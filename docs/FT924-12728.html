			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (22): Land of the dream machine  -California is the Mecca of car design OUTSIDERS often deride California as a dream-world, where glitter takes precedence over reality. But car designers, hunting for inspiration, find the quirky, free-wheeling nature of the California life-style irresistible. Over the past decade 19 car design studios have set up camp in southern California. They represent many of the major manufacturers which compete in the north American market. Most are Japanese Europan car companies. Not only is California a huge life-style laboratory, it is also by far the largest and most affluent car market in the US. In 1991, 1.5m cars and trucks were sold in the Golden state, out of a national total of 12.5m: only Florida came close with just over 1m sales. Equally significant is the fact that Californians are far less loyal to American cars than people in other states: imported models account for half the cars sold in California, compared with a national figure of 30 per cent. With such diversity of cars on its roads, designers naturally gravitate to California. Jerry Hirshberg, head of Nissan's design studio in San Diego, observes: 'For me it's like living in an international design show. Unlike Detroit, Japan or anywhere else, in California you see everything and you see it right away, it's inspirational, very challenging.' Tom Tremont, chief designer at Chrysler's Pacifica studio, one of the first to be set up on the west coast, concurs: 'Southern California has always been known as a trend setting area, whether for fashion, for politics or cars. It's a unique place, so everybody is focusing here - there's really no other place in the world where you can find so many design studios.' Verena Kloos, director of Volkswagen Design at the company's two-year-old studio in California's Simi Valley, describes the scene on a typical Los Angeles freeway as 'a rolling car show'. Like the longer established Japanese studios, VW's west coast design centre exists to report back to the home office on the latest trends and fashions in California, and to develop concepts for future cars for Audi as well as Volkswagen. Although the centre is relatively new, it has already contributed towards a proposed off-road version of the Golf, inspired in part by the soaring popularity in America of 'sport utility vehicles'. 'It's intended to be a fun vehicle for active life-style buyers that can be driven off-road occasionally,' says VW. To date, most sport utility vehicles have tended to be large and luxurious, like the Range Rover. But the influence of the sun-loving Californians has led some designers to look at smaller, less expensive machines. As a result, a series of sophisticated dune buggy-like concept vehicles have been making the rounds of US motor shows. The impact of VW's west coast studio has also been felt in the choice of colours and wheel designs for the current generation Golf, which makes its debut in America next year. For the Japanese, the influence of the California studios runs much deeper and is felt around the world. Toyota was the first Japanese car maker to build a design facility, called CALTY, in California. It also has a factory located in the state, operated jointly with General Motors. Established in 1973 in trendy Newport Beach, CALTY has designed several cars, including the Celica and Previa minivan, which are sold by Toyota in most of its overseas markets. A more recent CALTY design, the sleek Lexus SC400 luxury coupe, is currently marketed only in America and Japan. The story behind the widely admired shape of the SC400 would be hard to believe had it not come from California. Rather than start with conventional two-dimensional drawings, SC400 chief designer Erwin Lui filled ballons with wet plaster, which he moulded into organic shapes as it set. The plaster forms were then photographed and projected on to a screen which was slanted to elongate the shapes. The most inspirational shape, says Lui, had the look of a bow tie, and that became the basis for the look of the SC400. 'We never touched pencil to paper until the design process was virtually completed,' Lui says. Honda employs more than 100 design and research taff at its LA Centre in Torrance, California. 'We have to design cars in the US in order to market successfully in the US,' says Honda. 'Sometimes it's difficult for the guys in Japan to design cars for American tastes.' The newly introduced Civic coupe was penned by Honda's west coast designers, as were the Accord estate, Accord Coupe and first generation Civic CRX before it. Tom Elliott, a senior American Honda executive, says that the next generation Accord saloon, a crucial car for the company, will 'reflect the influence of our US design studio'. In Nissan's case, the company's San Diego studio had a strong influence on the design of 300ZX sports coupe, which is sold worldwide. It has been solely responsible for several other models, including the Infiniti J30 and Altima saloons, intended mainly for the US market. As well as designing new cars, Nissan's Hirshberg makes sure his staff spend time travelling and observing the world around them. One life-style project involved taking photos of hundreds of 'real people' driving their cars. 'We've developed all sorts of interesting ideas in trying to conceive of vans or sports cars or some new category we haven't thought of before.' Hirshberg quotes one example of a picture of a girl with frizzy hair and a dirty, dented car. 'We felt we'd discovered a whole new category here called 'unkempt' - all those kids who are very carefully avoiding being well kept. It's a potential category for a car that you may buy - like used jeans ..' John McCormick is US editor of Autocar and Motor</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Galitskiy, Aris Zakharov, and Aleksandr </F> Frenkel, Russian State Committee on Statistics: "Production  Output and Price Dynamics"]    [Text]  <H5>  Prices for Consumer Goods and Services </H5>   Over the period 12 to 19 April 1994 prices for consumer  goods and services rose by 1.6 percent, including for  foodstuffs--by 1.3 percent, nonfood items--by 1.9 percent, and  for-fee services for the population--by 3.5 percent. The  greatest increases in prices for foodstuffs were registered in  the Urals and East Siberian regions (1.8-2.2 percent) and  Kaliningrad Oblast (3.3 percent); food prices remained at  practically the same level in the Volga region. Prices for  nonfood items went up most in the Central region and West  Siberia (2.3-2.8 percent), while in East Siberia they remained  practically unchanged over the week.    Indices of prices for consumer goods and services in the  consumer market were as follows (percentage of the preceding  date):                     04/05       04/12       04/19       Average daily price                                                       rise                                                        April       March   Consumer goods   102.2       102.7       101.6       0.32        0.27  and services   including:   foodstuffs       101.4       101.2       101.3       0.19        0.20   nonfood items    101.9       102.4       101.9       0.28        0.34   for-fee          111.9       118.4       103.5       1.65        0.45  services for  the population       Since the beginning of the month prices have risen by  6.3 percent, including for foodstuffs--by 3.7 percent, nonfood  items--by 5.4 percent, and for-fee services for the  population--by 36.5 percent.  <H5>  Foodstuffs. </H5>   Since the middle of March weekly price increases with  respect  to foodstuffs have become perceptibly smaller and amounted in  Russia as a whole to 1.3 percent as compared to 3.2 percent in  January-February. In April the rate of price increases for basic  foodstuffs in nonorganized trade was almost twice as high as  that in organized trade. Over the period 12 to 19 April prices  in nonorganized trade rose by 2.1 percent, and in organized  trade--by 1.1 percent.    Price changes by main categories of food products are shown  below (percentage of the preceding date):                         Total           Including:                                        in organized        in nonorganized                                       trade               trade   All food products    101.3           101.1               102.1   including:   Meat and meat        101.2           101.0               101.7  products   Fish and fish        100.4           100.4               99.7  products   Milk and milk        101.4           101.2               102.8  products   Eggs                 100.7           100.8               99.9   Sugar                100.0           100.0               100.4   Bread and bakery     102.0           102.0               -  products   Cereals and          102.9           102.8               105.3  macaroni items   Vodka                100.7           100.7               100.0   Potatoes and         103.2           102.9               103.7  vegetables      In organized trade, similar to preceding weeks,  vegetable prices rose at an anticipatory rate: prices for  onions, beets, fresh cabbage, and carrots rose by 4-9 percent.  Prices for some varieties of macaroni items, cereals, and bread  and bakery products increased by 2-6 percent. There has been  practically no change over the week in prices for meat, butter,  vegetable oil, sugar, eggs, vodka, and potatoes.    Since the beginning of the month prices for macaroni items,  cereals, salt, fruit, and vegetables have increased by 8.5-13  percent; milk and milk products--by 4.9 percent; meat and fish  products--by 2-2.6 percent. The average level of prices for  sugar, eggs, and vodka changed insignificantly.    Similar to organized trade, the greatest price increases  in nonorganized trade were registered with respect to  fresh produce: for onions and garlic--by 11-13 percent, fresh  cabbage and carrots--by 5-7 percent. The rate of price rises  with respect to meat products increased somewhat in April (1.7  percent). Since the beginning of the month prices for these  products have increased by 5 percent. Prices for milk products  and eggs remained practically unchanged.    The cost of the consumer basket of 19 basic  foodstuffs increased over the week by 2.1 percent and as of  19 April amounted to 46,900 rubles [R], calculated on a monthly  basis. The price differential between monitored cities measured  a factor of 4.4; the highest cost was registered in Magadan  (R126,200), the lowest--in Ulyanovsk (R28,500). In terms of  consumer basket cost, Moscow and St. Petersburg and Moscow  ranked 32d and 40th among 132 monitored cities (R51,600 and  R49,900 on a monthly basis).  <H5>  Nonfood Items </H5>   Since February prices for nonfood items have been rising at  a  somewhat higher rate than those for foodstuffs. Over the elapsed  week of April gasoline prices rose more significantly--by 5  percent. Prices for garments, knitwear, fabrics, and footwear  rose over the week by 1.9-2.3 percent. Price rises with respect  to cultural and household goods and tobacco items were  insignificant (0.5-1.4 percent).    Since the beginning of the month prices for main categories  of nonfood items rose by 4-6 percent.  <H5>  For-Fee Services for the Population </H5>   There were no significant price increases with respect to  for-fee services over the elapsed week. Fees for consumer  services increased by 2-3 percent; the cost of rail  transportation, communication services, and sanitariums and  resorts increased by 1.3-2.5 percent.    Since the beginning of the month rates have increased almost  1.4-fold. Intercity train fares doubled, and rents in  municipally owned apartments increased 1.5-fold. Electric power  rates and notary fees changed insignificantly.  <H5>  Industrial Production. </H5>   Over 17 days of April 1994, of the 163 most important  categories of products counted in periodic reports, average  daily production, as compared to the corresponding period of  1993:    --increased with respect to eight items,  (including metal-cutting machine tools with numeric program  control, city telephone cables, video cassettes, school  notebooks, pencils, and tea), or 5 percent of the total number;    --decreased with respect to 149 items, or 91  percent of the total number;    as compared to the corresponding period of March 1994:    --increased with respect to 86 items (including  coking coal, diesel fuel, steel, finished rolled metal, mineral  fertilizer, synthetic ammonia, tires for trucks and agricultural  vehicles, large electric machinery, alternate-current and  low-power electric motors, self-propelled cranes, woodworking  machine tools, freight railcars, automotive graders, buses,  truck trailers and semi-trailers, tractor hitches, friction-free  ball bearings, paper, matches, high-grade asbestos, cement,  rolled roofing and insulation materials, decorative ceramic  tile, refrigerators and freezers, washing machines, electric  vacuum cleaners, electric irons, radio receivers, tape  recorders, bicycles, motorcycles, silk fabrics, nonwoven  fabric-type materials, hosiery, coats and short coats, light  coats, jackets, suits, dresses, slacks, shirts, skirts,  footwear, meat, butter, high fat-content cheeses and feta  cheese, canned meat and milk products, cereals, macaroni items,  and vegetable oil), or 53 percent of the total number;    --decreased with respect to 71 items, or 43  percent of the total number;    Based on the dynamics of production of the most  important varieties of industrial output, it is estimated that  average daily production in industry over the elapsed period of  April 1994 amounted to 74 percent of that for the corresponding  period of last April.    Output of main categories of industrial products over 17  days  of April 1994 is characterized by the following data:                               Produced over     As % of corresponding period (in                             17 days of        terms of average daily                             April 1994        production) of                                                April 1993       March 1994   Electric power--billion    41.1              93               85  kw-hr   Oil, including gas         13.2              82               98  condensate, million  tonnes   Natural gas, billion       30.0              98               97  cubic meters   Coal, million tonnes       11.9              85               98   Steel, million tonnes      2.2               80               110   Finished rolled ferrous    1.7               81               112  metals, including  destined for export,  million tonnes   Steel pipe, thousand       86.7              30               68  tonnes   Large electric             127               57               168  machinery, units   Metal-cutting machine      169               29               94  tools, units   Passenger cars, thousand   36.3              77               92  units   Tractors, thousand units   0.8               16               83    Chemical filament and      7.9               43               93  fiber, thousand tonnes   Mineral fertilizer         410               83               136  (recalculated as  100-percent nutrient),  thousand tonnes   Automotive tires for       1.0               52               110  agricultural vehicles,  motorcycles, and  motorollers, million  units   Commercial timber,         2.6               61               77  million cubic meters  solid wood   Lumber, thousand cubic     439               70               89  meters   Paper, thousand tonnes     111               78               114   Cement, million tonnes     1.5               76               116   Roof slate, million        41.2              22               68  standard tiles   Construction brick,        318               68               91  million units of  standard brick   Rolled roofing and         18.2              63               169  insulation materials,  million square meters   Fabrics, total, million    96.5              67               93  square meters   Hosiery, million pairs     14.3              72               106   Knitwear, million units    7.5               65               99.1   Footwear, million pairs    2.5               44               125   Television sets,           78.5              48               75  thousand units   Radio receiving devices,   24.2              28               110  thousand units   Refrigerators and          109               72               112  freezers, thousand units    Electric vacuum            29.0              24               120  cleaners, thousand units    Washing machines,          75.3              41               114  thousand units   Meat, including            70.8              72               108  subproducts, category I,  total, thousand tonnes   Whole-milk products,       281               80               99.0  recalculated as milk,  total, thousand tonnes   Butter, total, thousand    15.0              64               118  tonnes   Granulated sugar,          43.4              56               124  including quantities  produced from  customer-supplied  material, thousand  tonnes      Over the elapsed period of March 1994 there was no  production  of drop forges with numeric program control, processing centers,  gantry cranes with the lifting capacity of eight or more tonnes  and automotive platform-mounted cranes, bulldozers, and trolley  buses.  <H5>  Agriculture. Agricultural Producers Production Plans for 1994 </H5>   Before the beginning of spring field work (as of 1 March of  this year), statistical organs jointly with the Center for the  Current State of the Economy under the Government of the Russian  Federation conducted a survey of intentions of 1,117  agricultural enterprises and 1,510 peasant (private) farms on 20  territories of the country on the subject of production of  agricultural output in 1994. The surveyed farms account for 5  percent of agricultural land in the country and represent all  the main soil and climatic regions of Russia.    The results obtained show that the surveyed agricultural  enterprises intend to keep the planting of grain crops and  sunflower at last year's level, and to reduce somewhat the  planting of sugar beet (by 9 percent) and vegetables (by 5  percent). No expansion in the planting of fodder crops is  planned. The gross yield may be negatively affected by the  shortage of mineral fertilizer, and with respect to some crops  also that of planting material. As of 1 March of this year,  mineral fertilizer stocks at all surveyed enterprises as a whole  amounted to no more than 30 percent of need.    In animal husbandry, a slower rate of herd reduction is  envisaged with respect to all varieties of livestock except  sheep.    The survey showed that peasant (private) farms, which have a  lower level of material and technical support, show greater  economic flexibility and intend to increase by 5 percent the  planting of grain crops, particularly the planting of sugar beet  and vegetables, while leaving sunflower planting at last year's  level. The area they plan to use for planting of fodder crops is  envisaged to increase by 15 percent. In animal husbandry farmers  plan to increase the herd of main categories of livestock by the  end of the year, especially the herd of swine.    The selective survey program included evaluation of  enterprises' financial and economic status. Almost 90 percent of  surveyed agricultural enterprises believed that their financial  and economic situation had worsened in 1993, and only 5 percent  of enterprises said that it had improved. The overwhelming  majority of enterprises (97 percent) appraised the state of  animal husbandry as average or bad, and only 3 percent  considered it good. The appraisal of the state of plant-growing  was somewhat better: 61 percent of enterprises consider it  average, 32 percent--bad, and 7 percent--good. Only 4 percent of  surveyed agricultural enterprises believe that their situation  will improve in 1994; 78 percent are convinced that it will get  worse.    Peasant farms view their situation in 1994 in a somewhat  more  optimistic light: One-quarter of them believe that their  financial and economic situation will improve; however, one-half  of farmers believe that it will get worse.  <H5>  Animal Husbandry </H5>   In the first quarter of this year as compared to the  analogous period of 1993 the volume of sales of livestock  and poultry for slaughter declined at all categories of  farms by an estimated 10 percent, production of milk--by 11  percent, and eggs--by 6 percent. At agricultural enterprises,  which are the main producers of animal husbandry products, the  volume of meat and milk production decreased by 15-16 percent,  and eggs--by 6 percent:                              (in thousand tonnes)                             First quarter                             1992              1993              1994   Livestock and poultry     1,860             1,609             1,346  sold for slaughter,  live weight   as % of preceding year    78                86                84   Gross milk yield          6,790             5,893             4,982   as % of preceding year    80                87                85   Production of hen         8,189             7,284             6,844  eggs--million units   as % of preceding year    92                89                94      Production of animal husbandry products on personal plots  remained approximately at the level of the corresponding period  of last year.    The decrease in the size of the livestock herd is  occurring mainly at agricultural enterprises, where the pace of  horned cattle and swine herd reductions has stabilized at the  level of 10-13 percent as compared to the corresponding month of  last year, and cows--at 6-7 percent. An especially significant  decline has occurred in the herd of sheep and goats (by 21-23  percent).                  as % of corresponding date of 1993               For reference:                                                                 as of 1 April                 On 1 Jan    On 2 Feb    On 1 Mar    On 1 Apr    1993 as % of                                                                1992   Horned        89          89          89          90          91  cattle   Cows          94          93          93          93          93   Swine         87          87          88          87          85   Sheep and     79          78          77          77          84  goats      The remaining stocks of fodder at these enterprises as of  the  beginning of April of this year amounted on average to 6  quintals of feed units per standard head of livestock, as  compared to 5.3 quintals of feed units by this time last year.    In the first quarter of this year, 1.1 million tonnes of  livestock and poultry (26 percent less than a year ago) were  procured from agricultural producers for federal and  regional food reserves, as well as 3.4 million tonnes of milk  (22 percent less), and 5.5 billion units of eggs (9 percent  less). At the same time, agricultural enterprises increased  sales of animal husbandry products at farmers markets, through  their own stores, the public catering system, and through barter  operations. They sold 17 percent of the total volume of  livestock and poultry, 4.5 percent of milk, and 7 percent of  eggs outside the procurement network, as compared to,  respectively, 11 percent, 2.7 percent, and 7 percent last year:                     (in thousand tonnes)                    Procured for federal and regional      In addition, sold                   reserves                               by agricultural                                                          enterprises                                                          outside of                                                          procurement                                                          organizations in                                                          1994                    1992         1993         1994   Livestock and    1,679        1,458        1,076        217  poultry in  live weight   as % of          73           87           74           117  preceding year    Milk             4,993        4,349        3,391        161   as % of the      71           87           78           132  preceding year    Eggs, million    6,135        6,022        5,508        440  units   as % of the      82           98           91           102  preceding year     <H5>  Sales of Fresh Produce </H5>   By 28 March of this year agricultural enterprises sold  through all distribution channels 17,500 tonnes of greenhouse  vegetables (24,200 tonnes in 1993). Of this, 12,800 tonnes (73  percent of the total volume) were sold to procurement  organizations, which is one-third less than last year:                   (in thousand tonnes)                  Greenhouse           Including:                 vegetables                                       cucumbers           greengrocer items   1992           22.5                 18.9                3.3   1993           19.9                 15.8                3.9   1994           12.8                 10.9                1.8   1994 as %      64                   69                  45  1993      Sales of these products through other distribution channels  increased. Since the beginning of the year, 4,700 tonnes of  greenhouse vegetables (27 percent of the total volume sold) have  been sold at farmers markets, through their own stores, and the  public catering system, as compared to 4,200 tonnes (18 percent)  last year.  <H5>  The Farmers` Movement </H5>   The process of creating peasant (private) farms in Russia is  proceeding more slowly this year than last. Over three months of  this year 7,300 new farms were set up (47,000 over the first  quarter of last year) and by 1 April they numbered 277,300, with  a total land area of 11.8 million hectares (43 hectares per farm  on average). By the beginning of the spring campaign  approximately 10.9 million hectares of agricultural land were at  farmers' disposal, of which 7.9 million hectares were plowed  land, or, respectively, 5.2 percent and 6.0 percent of the total  area in the Russian Federation.    Surveys conducted by the State Committee for Statistics  indicate that farmers are in a difficult financial situation.  Production and social infrastructure of peasant farms are  extremely weak; there is no mechanism for implementation of  measures of state support for farmers, and money allocated for  these purposes frequently does not reach the intended  recipients. To a considerable extent it was for these reasons  that 4,100 private farms ceased operation in the first quarter  of this year (2,500 over the first quarter of last year). On  average, for each 100 new farms in the first quarter of this  year, 36--as compared to 14 last year--went out of business.    The dynamics of start-ups and disintegration of private  farms  by quarter in 1993 and 1994 are shown in the table (thousands of  farms):                      Started over   Ceased operations            Increase over                    the period                                  the period                                    total         per 100                                                 newly                                                 started                                                 farms, units    1992              138.9          5.1           4              133.8   1993              101.3          14.1          14             87.2   including:   I quarter         49.5           2.5           5              47.0   II quarter        31.6           3.3           10             28.3   III quarter       10.5           3.3           31             7.2   IV quarter        9.7            5.0           52             4.7   1994   I quarter         11.4           4.1           36             7.3    <H5>  Capital Construction </H5>   In the first quarter of 1994, enterprises and organizations  of all forms of property on the territory of the Russian  Federation utilized R12.3 trillion of capital investment from  all sources of financing, including R6.9 trillion, or 56 percent  of the total volume of investment, for construction of  production facilities (60 percent in 1993).    The investment dynamics are characterized by the following  data:                         As % of corresponding period of     For reference: 1993                       preceding year                      as % of                        I quarter   I quarter   I quarter   1992       1990                       1992        1993        1994   Capital investment   56          97          72          84         43  from all sources  of  financing--total   including by  facility type:   production           52          99.3        63          77         35   nonproduction        64          93          89          97         61      State- and municipally-owned enterprises and organizations  account for the greatest share (59 percent) of capital  investment utilization in the development of the Russian economy.    The structure of capital investment from all sources of  financing by the form of ownership is shown below:                              I quarter 1994                  For reference:                                                            1993 as % of                                                            total                             Billion rubles   as % of the                                             total   Capital investment by     12,294           100            100  enterprises and  organizations of all  forms of  ownership--total   including:   state                     5,533            45             53   municipal                 1,722            14             13   mixed                     3,038            25             20   private                   1,721            14             14   public organizations      10               0.1            0.2      The main source of capital investment financing is  enterprises' own resources; in the first quarter they accounted  for R7.9 trillion, or 64 percent of the total volume of  investment; means from the federal budget--R1.9 trillion, or 16  percent; and local budget--R1.4 trillion, or 12 percent.    In the first quarter of this year capital investment in  equipment, tools, and supplies comprised R1.574 trillion, or 52  percent of the corresponding period of last year, including R464  billion for equipment requiring installation (29 percent of the  total volume). As of the end of the first quarter of this year,  R3.955 trillion worth of uninstalled equipment requiring  installation accumulated in warehouses in the capital  construction sector, including R740 billion worth of imported  equipment.    In the first quarter of this year some production  capacities and facilities were put into operation: 240 km  of power transmission lines with a voltage of 35 kV or higher on  the territory of Bashkiria and the Mari Republic, Maritime Kray,  and Volgograd, Voronezh, Moscow, Rostov, Saratov, Sverdlovsk,  Tyumen, Chelyabinsk, and other oblasts; 29 km of gas pipelines  in Kursk Oblast; 83 km of intercity communication cables in  Samara Oblast; 761 oil and eight gas production wells in Tyumen  Oblast; and capacities for production of 20,000 cubic meters of  wood-chip board and 12 million units of construction brick in  Krasnodar Kray, 150,000 cubic meters of non-ore materials in  Kemerovo Oblast, 13,500 cubic meters of prefabricated  ferroconcrete components and items in Altay Kray, and others.    The limit of state capital investment financed out of the  federal budget for the implementation of measures aimed at  elimination of the consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear power  station disaster for 1994 is set in the amount of R578.1  billion (in forecast prices); in the first quarter of this year,  R33.2 billion (in current prices) has been used for these  purposes. As part of the "Chernobyl" program, 10,400 square  meters of residential housing have been built (4.5 percent of  the annual target), and a hospital for 25 beds (5.9 percent).    In the first quarter of this year, R0.9 trillion in capital  investment from all sources of financing has been used for  development of the agro-industrial complex, which is  half as much as last year. Investment of state-owned enterprises  comprised 36 percent of total investment in the agro-industrial  complex; privately owned--33 percent; and mixed Russian  ownership--29 percent. Of this, R0.6 trillion, or 62 percent,  was utilized for construction of production facilities.    Only a few facilities for processing and storage of  agricultural output have been put in operation. Over  January-March of this year, capacities for production of 3.1  tonnes of bakery products a day were put on line in Moscow and  Kurgan Oblasts, and for production of 95 tonnes a shift of  whole-milk products in Kaluga, Sverdlovsk, and Tambov Oblasts.    Of the most important agro-industrial complex projects not  completed in 1993, the only production facilities that were put  in operation in January-March of this year were production  capacities at a canning plant in the city of Urukh in  Kabardino-Balkaria and at the Rosvyanskiy repair plant in  Kurovskoye settlement, Kaluga Oblast.    In construction of social sphere projects, R5.4  trillion was used in the first quarter of this year, which is 11  percent less than the first quarter of 1993. The share of  investment in the construction of nonproduction facilities is  continuously increasing.    In the first quarter of 1994, R3.1 trillion, or one-quarter  of the total volume of capital investment in the national  economy, was spent on housing construction. Residential housing  with a total living area of 4.0 million square meters was  commissioned, which comprises 95 percent of the January-March  1993 level and 50 percent of that in 1990:                         Million square meters of total area                        commissioned in      as % of              Proportion of                       January-March 1994   January-March 1993   total volume, %    Total on the         4.0                  95                   100  territory of  Russia   including by  enterprises and  organizations that  are part of:   Russia's state and   2.3                  85                   58.7  mixed property   including housing    0.2                  65                   4.7  construction  cooperatives   municipal property   0.6                  84                   15.9    private property     1.0                  109                  25.2   including            0.7                  127                  16.9  individuals  building their own  housing      New apartments were received by 5,500 families of military  servicemen, members of internal affairs organs, and persons due  to be relocated from closed and stand-alone military bases. For  them, 330,000 square meters of general housing were built,  including 285,000 square meters in keeping with the plans of  ministries and agencies that have military units.    Construction of education and health care facilities over  the  elapsed period was not extensive. Enterprises and organizations  of all forms of ownership built general education schools for  9,000 pupils, preschool facilities for 2,600 placements,  hospitals with 1,674 beds, and ambulatory facilities for 1,960  visits a shift.    Also put into operation were nursing homes for the elderly,  disabled, and disabled children for 298 placements and  orphanages for 100 placements.    During the current year 94.3 km of operational running water  networks were put on line on the territory of Russia, or 81  percent of the level of January-March 1993; 24.2 km of sewage  lines (73 percent); 19.6 km of heat distribution pipes (111  percent); and 836.5 km of gas pipes (94 percent).    Construction organizations of all forms of ownership on the  territory of the Russian Federation performed R8.5 trillion  worth of contract work in January-March of this year, which is  24 percent less than over the corresponding period of last year.    The volume of contract work performed by  organizations of different organizational-legal forms is  characterized by the following data:                      Volume of contract       Proportion of total volume of                    work                     contract work performed (%)                     performed,     % of      construction-erection     capital                    trillion       total     work                      repairs                    rubles   Total for         8.5            100       76                        17  contract  organizations   including:   state             2.6            30        67                        27   municipal         0.1            1         51                        43   joint-stock       5.4            63        80                        13   lease             0.4            4         78                        14      As of the end of the first quarter customers had not paid  for  about 50 percent of the work performed over that period. In  state organizations the share of such work comprised 44 percent,  joint-stock--50 percent, and leased--55 percent.  <H5>  Adherence to the Timetable of Passenger Trains and Aircraft </H5>   In air transportation in the first quarter of this year the  number of actual flights declined by 15 percent as compared to  the analogous period of last year. The number of aircraft  arriving late declined from 24 percent to 22 percent. About 1  percent of scheduled flights were canceled or not carried out.    Adherence to the timetable of aircraft arrival at flight  destination by different types of air service is characterized  by the following data:                           Number of          Proportion of       Average delay,                         delayed flights,   late arrivals in    hours                         thousands          total number of                                            scheduled                                            flights, %   All types of service   26.6               22                  3.7    including:   international          3.0                26                  3.3   domestic               11.8               28                  3.8   local                  11.8               18                  3.6      More than half of the domestic flights of the Vnukovo  Airlines company arrived on average 4.6 hours late; of those  carried out by enterprises under the umbrella of the Kamchatka  regional civil aviation administration--60 percent, with an  average delay of 7.7 hours; of the Far East regional  administration--49 percent, 8.1 hours; of the Domodedovo  production association--45 percent, 8.3 hours; and of the  Mineralnyye Vody production association--42 percent, 2.7 hours.    On rail transport of the Russian Ministry of Railways, in  the  first quarter of this year 111,400 passenger trains (not  counting suburban) arrived at their final destination--2 percent  less than in the first quarter of 1993.    The number of late trains comprised 4 percent of the total  number of arrivals as compared to 6 percent over the  corresponding period of last year. Average delay time was 1.4  hours (1.3 hours in the first quarter of 1993).    The greatest proportion of late trains was registered at the  Kaliningrad (52 percent of all arrivals on that railroad), North  Caucasus (9 percent), and Moscow (8 percent) Railroads.    The greatest delays were noted in train arrivals at  destination stations of the East Siberian (average delay--2.5  hours), Kemerovo (2.3 hours), Moscow, Baykal-Amur (1.8 hours),  Sverdlovsk (1.7 hours), and South Urals (1.6 hours) Railroads.    In March of this year the number of departures of suburban  trains declined as compared to January of this year by 5,400 (2  percent). On the West Siberian Railroad 1,300 (13 percent) fewer  trains departed; October Railroad--1,100 (3 percent) fewer, and  Far Eastern Railroad--1,100 (25 percent) fewer.    Delays were registered in the departures of 1,900 (1  percent)  suburban trains. Average delay was 25 minutes. The greatest  delays in suburban train departures were noted on the  Kaliningrad, Gorkiy, Northern, South-Eastern, Volga, Sverdlovsk,  Kemerovo, and South-Urals Railroads (average delay in departures  was between 28 and 54 minutes).  <H5>  Urban Passenger Transportation Services for the Population </H5>   Currently 1,357 cities in the Russian Federation have a bus  service, 113 cities--ground electric transportation, and  six--subway.    Urban transport (excluding taxicabs) serves 110 million  passengers daily, which is five times as many as served by  suburban and intercity transportation by all types of transport.    Urban passenger transportation operates with great  difficulty; the level of passenger service is declining,  especially with respect to bus service. In 1993 the number of  bus runs performed declined by 11 million, or 5 percent, as  compared to 1992, and by 33 million, or 15 percent, as compared  to 1991.    The deterioration of transportation services is also  indicated by the results of a selective survey conducted by  statistical organs at the end of 1993 in oblast (kray, republic)  centers of Russia. Of 23,000 respondents, three-quarters noted  that the operation of urban public transportation has become  worse. Their opinion is supported by comparing it with the data  received as a result of analogous surveys conducted by  statistical organs in 1989 and 1990.    The average time spent commuting to work (school) increased  by 8 percent (from 40 minutes in 1989 and 1990 to 43 minutes in  1993). The proportion of passengers who spend 40 minutes to one  hour, or more than one hour, commuting is high: 30 percent and  19 percent of respondents, respectively (in 1989--27 percent and  16 percent, in 1990--29 percent and 17 percent).    Considerable time is spent waiting for rolling stock to  arrive. Because of greater intervals in the schedule of city  transportation, one in four streetcars and trolley bus  passengers and one in three bus passengers have to wait for more  than 20 minutes at the stop (in 1989, respectively, one in 11  and six minutes, and in 1990--one in six and four minutes).                 Of total number of passenger using a corresponding type of               transportation, waited at the stop for transport to arrive, %                 4 minutes or    5-9 minutes     10-19 minutes   20 minutes               less                                            and more   Bus   1989         9               38              36              17   1990         5               29              39              27   1993         3               22              37              38   Trolley bus   1989         20              44              27              9   1990         12              39              33              16   1993         8               32              37              23   Streetcar   1989         22              46              23              9   1990         13              40              31              16   1993         12              33              32              23      The average waiting time at a bus stop is 16 minutes,  trolley  bus--14 minutes, and streetcar--13 minutes.    The highest number of passengers waiting for buses at bus  stops for more than 20 minutes were noted in Saransk, Maykop,  Vladivostok, Astrakhan, Ulyanovsk, Yakutsk, Orenburg,  Blagoveshchensk, Nalchik, Kaliningrad, Tver, Barnaul, Kyzyl  (56-76 percent of passengers surveyed); for trolley buses--in  Magadan, Groznyy, Saransk, Tyumen, and Vladivostok (53-100  percent); streetcars--in Tver, Groznyy, Voronezh, and Ufa (50-60  percent).    Greater concentration of riders on rolling stock creates  additional inconveniences for passengers. Overcrowding of  rolling stock during rush hours was noted by 86 percent of  passengers using buses to commute to work (school), 82 percent  of trolley bus users, 67 percent of streetcar users, and 53  percent of subway users.    The main cause of such a situation is underutilization of  the  carrying capacity of the rolling stock. In 1993 more than half  of ground passenger transportation remained unused daily in  Astrakhan, one third--in Kaluga, Smolensk, Tambov, Samara,  Stavropol, Nalchik. Kemerovo, and Blagoveshchensk. Half the  buses and streetcars and one-third of the trolley buses were  idle in Moscow and Tomsk. More than one-third of trolley buses  were not sent on route runs daily in Elista, Magadan, Yakutsk,  and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, where they are the only available  kind of urban passenger transportation.    More than half of idle time is caused by repairs because of  the great wear and tear of the stock. In common carrier  automotive transportation, almost one-third of buses have been  fully depreciated, and more than 10 percent of trolley buses and  streetcars are being utilized beyond the term of their useful  life.    The unsatisfactory technical condition of the rolling stock  is causing a decline in the regularity of scheduled runs in  passenger transportation. In 1993, 85 percent of urban buses ran  on schedule, 92 percent of trolley buses, and 90 percent of  streetcars. However, in a number of cities regularity of service  was considerably below that: More than one-third of scheduled  bus runs were not made in the city of Moscow, in Vologda,  Voronezh, Kursk, Astrakhan, and Kaliningrad Oblasts, Khabarovsk  Kray, and the Republics of Tuva and Chuvashia. One in three  scheduled streetcar runs were not made in Ufa, Tomsk, Tver,  Lipetsk, and Astrakhan. One in five trolley bus runs were  canceled in Abakan, Barnaul, Vladikavkaz, and Tula.    There has been no improvement in transportation services for  people working second and third shifts, 88 percent of whom use  urban passenger transportation after work and only 6  percent--their own enterprise's buses. Dissatisfaction with the  operation of urban transportation at night was expressed by 69  percent of surveyed bus passengers and more than half of trolley  bus and streetcar passengers.    The survey showed that no work is being done to make  transportation route grids more convenient for the population.  As in previous surveys, only 46 percent of passengers surveyed  do not have to change lines in commuting to work (school); 34  percent make one change, 17 percent--two, and 4 percent of  passengers--three or more changes. One-quarter or more  passengers have to change lines twice in commuting to work  (school) in St. Petersburg, Moscow, Abakan, Novosibirsk, and  Cheboksary.    Passengers experience a certain discomfort in using urban  transportation because of lack of information on stops.  Practically all passengers of buses and trolley buses, in  response to the question as to whether the drivers announce the  names of stops, answered "sometimes" or "no." Only one in six  streetcar passengers answered this question affirmatively.    The survey conducted by statistical organs revealed  passengers' opinion on measures that would help improve the  operation of urban passenger transportation. Among them were:  maintaining schedules (noted by 32 percent of respondents),  shortening intervals between runs (27 percent), modernizing the  rolling stock (22 percent), opening new routes (11 percent), and  restoring canceled routes (8 percent).  <H5>  Migration Processes </H5>   The migration-caused increase in the population of the  Russian Federation over last year exceeded 430,000 persons and  was the highest in the postwar period. The migrant flow was  distributed as follows:                              Total, thousand    Including:                            persons                                                urban areas      rural areas   Arrived--total            925.3              566.9            358.4   including from  countries of:   near abroad               922.9              565.3            357.6   far abroad                2.4                1.6              0.8   Departed--total           495.2              380.8            114.4   including to the  countries of:   near abroad               379.3              304.0            75.3   far abroad                115.9              76.8             39.1      The high positive migration balance is mainly the result of  reductions in the number of Russians moving to near abroad  countries. The number of such emigrants was 380,000, which was  1.7 times less than in 1992. Those moving to Ukraine numbered  190,000 as compared to 342,000 in 1992; to Kazakhstan--63,000,  as compared to 94,000, respectively; to Belarus--47,000, as  compared to 64,000; to the Transcaucasus states--15,000, as  compared to 62,000; and to other states--64,000 as compared to  85,000.    As before, the population of Russia grew mainly due to the  arrival of inhabitants of Central Asian states, the  Transcaucasus, and Kazakhstan: They accounted for two-thirds  (619,800 persons) of the total number of migrants to Russia. The  number of those who have left the place of their former  residence not of their own volition among all arrivals  increased: In 1993 Russian Federal Migration Service offices  registered as refugees and forced migrants 234,000 persons, or  one in four immigrants.    A negative balance persisted in the interstate exchange  between Russian and far abroad countries, Belarus, and Ukraine.  Russian emigration to far abroad countries exceeded somewhat the  level of previous years. As compared to 1992, 10,900, or 11  percent, more persons received permission to move abroad  permanently from MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] organs,  bringing the total to 115,900 persons. As a result of a decline  in the outflow of population to Belarus and Ukraine, Russia's  migration losses dropped to 13,000 persons as compared to  170,000 in 1992.    In developing the data on foreign migration, information was  received for the first time on the gender, age, and education  level of migrants. It showed that as a result of population  migration the country got 105,000 more children under 16,  261,000 more persons of work-capable age, and 64,000 more  persons of retirement age. Migrants' distribution by age  differed as compared to the structure of Russia's population at  the beginning of 1993 in that the former had a higher share of  work-capable contingents (60.7 percent as compared to 56.5  percent) and a lower share of persons above work-capable age  (14.9 percent as compared to 19.8 percent, respectively). The  distribution of migrants by gender was more even: There are 928  women per 1,000 men, with the average indicator for Russia being  1,131.    Among the immigrants, 18.6 percent had a complete or  incomplete higher education; among the emigrants--respectively,  19.5 percent (22.8 percent of the number of those who left for  far abroad countries, and 18.6 percent of those destined for  near abroad countries). The share of persons with such education  in the entire population of Russia was, according to 1989 census  data, 13 percent. About 28 percent of migrants had secondary  vocational training (19 percent according to the census).</p>

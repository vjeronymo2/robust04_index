			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A responsible source at the General Civil Aviation  and Meteorology Authority [GCAMA] has explained that the GCAMA  is the authority responsible for issuing permits for all types  of air transportation. This is in accordance with Article 10 of  the Civil Aviation Law No. 12 of 1993. That article reads as  follows:    No plane shall be allowed to fly within the civil aviation  routes or conduct any direct flight to or from the republic  without obtaining prior permission from the civil aviation  authorities. This particularly applies to the following:    A. Crossing the republic's airspace.    B. Technical landing; that is, for purposes that have  nothing to do with air traffic.    C. Emergency flights for rescue, relief, or other  humanitarian purposes.    D. Foreign government flights.    E. Flights transporting weapons, ammunitions, or military  and dangerous materials.    F. Irregular commercial air transportation flights.    G. Group tourist flights.    H. General flights connected with labor, tourism, air  operations, or special flights.    With reference to the media reports carried by the Second  Channel and the Second Program on a statement by an official  source at Aden International Airport concerning the Boeing 707  plane which landed at al-Hudaydah airport, the GCAMA affirms  that it had not granted entry or departure permission to that  plane. It also affirms that airports are not authorized to give  such permission. The authority denounces in part and parcel the  statement that was given by an official source at Aden airport.</p>

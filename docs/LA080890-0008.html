			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO;  </P> <P> ANNEXATION OF 146 ACRES IS APPROVED  </P> <P> As part of a development plan known as Airport North, the Camarillo Planning  Commission on Tuesday approved the annexation of 146.68 acres between Camarillo  Airport and the Ventura Freeway west of Las Posas Road.  </P> <P> Seacoast Associates, which plans to develop the area, requested that the city  annex a 75.5-acre parcel and change the zoning to allow a combination of  professional and industrial offices and general commercial use.  </P> <P> Another 71.18 acres are to be included in the annexation at the request of the  property owners. All the property under consideration for annexation is now  farmed with row crops.  </P> <P> To provide for a greenbelt between Camarillo and Oxnard, an agricultural parcel  of nearly 50 acres south of the airport will be detached from city jurisdiction  under the Planning Commission's action.  </P> <P> Planning commissioners also approved a request by Mission Gelles of Santa  Barbara for the rezoning of 51.42 acres just east of the Seacoast property. The  developer has requested zoning similar to that suggested by Seacoast for the  eventual construction of office buildings and general industrial complexes.  </P> <P> All the annexation and zoning changes are subject to approval by the City  Council and the Local Agency Formation Commission.  </P> <P> In other action, the Planning Commission approved a 600-square-foot addition to  the existing 5400-square-foot First Interstate Bank in Carmen Plaza at Paseo  Camarillo and Carmen Drive. Plans include the addition of another automated  teller machine. RUSS CHARVONIA  </P></p>

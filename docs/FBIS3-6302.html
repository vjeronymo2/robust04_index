			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 16 KYODO -- Former Prime Minister  Kiichi Miyazawa denied Wednesday [16 March] being asked by  disgraced kingpin Shin Kanemaru to convey his message on the  government fair trade watchdog that he was willing to cooperate  in toughening antimonopoly law penalties in exchange for not  filing a criminal complaint in a bid-rigging case.    Informed sources said Kanemaru, a former power broker in the  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), visited Miyazawa twice between  December 1991 and January 1992 to call for his support to  prevent an accusation by the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) against  a 66-member cartel of building contractors in Saitama Prefecture  over a bid- rigging practice.    Kanemaru promised Miyazawa to cooperate with an FTC plan to  raise the maximum penalty on corporations which violate the  antimonopoly law, the sources said.    At that time Japan was urged by the United States to raise  penalties against violators of the law during the Structural  Impediments Initiative talks.    The former prime minister summoned then FTC chairman Setsuo  Umezawa to the prime minister's official residence in February  1992 and conveyed Kanemaru's message, the sources said.    Following the meeting, Umezawa met former Construction  Minister Kishiro Nakamura, who was arrested last Friday for  allegedly accepting a 10 million yen bribe from major contractor  Kajima Corp. in January 1992, the sources said.    Kajima was the key member of the cartel. Prosecutors said  the money was intended as a reward for using his influence to  help prevent the FTC from filing an accusation against the  cartel.    Nakamura, then deputy chairman of the LDP panel on  antimonopoly laws, who quit the LDP last Wednesday, reversed his  initial reluctance to support the penalty hikes.    The LDP agreed in March of that year to raise the penalty  from 5 million yen to 100 million yen.    The FTC announced in May 1992 that it would not file an  accusation with prosecutors against the cartel.    Miyazawa said, "The integrity of the FTC must be respected  and I have respected it."    Kanemaru retired from politics in October 1992 and is  currently on trial on charges of evading more than 1 billion yen  in taxes.</p>

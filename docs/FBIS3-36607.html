Three bases are supposed to be set up:  in Tbilisi in Vaziani region (Military-Air forces), in  Akhalkalaki (Motor-infantry brigade) and in Batumi  (Motor-infantry brigade). Batumi's base will have its branch  offices in Sukhumi, Poti and Gudauta. The bases will be  established from those Russian troops which located now in  Transcaucasia. They are mostly infantry troops, aircraft,  planes SU-25 and bombing aviation. It should be noticed that  Russian military bases are set up in Georgian regions  neighbouring with Turkey which are inhabited by Armenians and  Adzhars.    Military ships of the Black Sea fleet will be placed in  Poti.  The bases will be established till July 1 1994. Their goal is  to safeguard the security of Russia and Caucasian countries  which enter Collective Security Pact.    The troops located in Georgia will be led by Commandant of  the group of Russian troops in the Caucasia General Fedor Reut  excluding 345th landing regiment. This regiment is under the  control of Russian Defense Minister.    In the times of the USSR a corps consisting of three  motor-infantry divisions, units of 40th air army and units of  the 19th army was located on the territory of Georgia.    As far as the 4 point of the agreement (on equipment of  Georgian armed forces with Russian technique) concerns, the  Russian President Yeltsin said that one can not speak about  military equipment until the problems concerning ethnic  minorities of Abkhaz and South Osets are left unsolved.    According to Foreign Minister Kozyrev, the agreement can  stimulate the achievement of political settlement of the  situation in Abkhaz and South Osetia.    However, on February 4 Deputy Chairman of Abkhaz mass media  Yuriy Vorontsov said that Georgian government set South Osetia  and Abkhaz outside of Georgia.    Minister of Foreign Relations of South Osetia, Urusmak  Jioyev  stated that Russia tries to settle Georgian problems by military  way. He recalled recent developments in Western Georgia when  "Russian troops seized the whole regions and the supporters of  Zviad Gamsakhurdia committed the genocydis".    Deputy Chairman of mass media of South Osetia, Valeriy  Khubulov said that republic step aside from Georgia and joined  the Northern Osetia. "We want to live together with the Northern  Osetia", he stressed.    At the same time political and social movements of the  nations of the North Caucasus (excluding Inghush) came out  against the conclusion of Russian-Georgian treaty. According to  the opinion of the leadership of the Confederation of the  Caucasian Nations, Russia decided to back Georgia to strengthen  its positions on the Black Sea and the Caucasus. This Moscow's  policy will lead to the fact that Russia will lose its positions  in the North Caucasus which is isolated from Russia. The  officials of the North Caucasus say that the more Russia tries  to preserve the integrity of Georgia the more the nations of the  North Caucasus step aside from it.    The day before Boris Yeltsin's visit to Georgia, Russian  State Duma came out against conclusion of the treaty with  Georgia. According to majority deputies, if Moscow establishes  close relations with Tbilisi it will lose the North Caucasus.</p>

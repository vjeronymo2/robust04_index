The European Commission, which took  up the case last May at the request of Denmark, has accepted the  conclusions of a majority of experts who have been consulted on  the subject, that neither the reactors, nor the nuclear heads  with which its stock of torpedoes is armed, pose any threat to  the environment under present circumstances, whereas any attempt  to salvage the submarine could have unpredictable consequences.    In confirming the findings of over a hundred experts in the  field of submerged nuclear waste, the group of specialists from  the European Union and Norway who met recently under the  auspices of the Commission's Joint Research Centre expressed the  judgement that even assuming the most pessimistic scenario the  Komsomolets did not appear to constitute a significant pollution  risk. They agreed that radiological monitoring, studies on  sea-current variations, or indeed a thoroughgoing analysis of  the risks involved could be carried out if the need subsequently  arose.    On the other hand, the specialists warned that any hasty  moves would be more likely to worsen than to remedy the  situation, a far from unwarranted remark, given that Moscow has  been trying to obtain authorisation to salvage the wreck since  1989. The Rubin company, which built the submarine, actually  signed a contract with Dutch recovery experts, on behalf of the  Russian authorities, but the Dutch firm later reckoned that the  hull was too extensively damaged and abandoned plans for a  refloat operation. Other possible solutions have been mooted and  rejected: burying the sub in sediment, coating it in resin,  dissecting it and salvaging the titanium hulls, etc. A  confidential memorandum, confirmed by French and Norwegian  military experts, contains the view that the Russians were  particularly anxious to recover the torpedoes and their nuclear  warheads, thereby incidentally eliminating the risk of pollution  from the plutonium contained in the head cones. Given that this  submarine is of an extremely advanced design, and that the  torpedoes are also the result of the latest development, the  memorandum concludes that the then Soviet authorities intended  either to recover their equipment, or at least to prevent anyone  else from getting hold of it. This thesis is strongly supported  by Moscow's initial moves to refloat and transport the  Komsomolets in the name of the former Soviet state, and the  constant presence of Russian ships in the area of the wreck.</p>

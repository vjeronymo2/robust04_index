			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXECUTIVES' PUSH FOR FATTER PAYCHECKS IS JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF GREED IN U.S.  INDUSTRY  </P> <P> The story on executive salaries is one of unadulterated greed. How selfish can  the rich be? They ought to be ashamed.  </P> <P> Our corporate world is sick. Exorbitantly high salaries, stock options,  bonuses, leveraged buyouts and greedy pension programs for executives keep  profits from being distributed to the shareholders. It's time that our  government step in to curb the excesses.  </P> <P> What a different economy we would have if somehow the shareholders could get  their fair share of the profits. After all, they furnish the capital to make  the corporations possible.  </P> <P> WAYNE PFUNDSTEIN  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

Presenting the government's budget for 1994, Mr Penza estimated a deficit of 11bn kwacha (Pounds 11.2m), which he said would be covered by non-bank borrowing. The 1993 surplus was of K19bn. Real gross domestic product for 1993, lifted by good farm output, rose by 4 per cent, compared with a contraction of 2.8 per cent in 1992. Crop production was up about 175 per cent last year but this was offset by poor performances in mining, manufacturing, construction and energy. Exports were worth Dollars 950m in 1993, Dollars 24m less than imports. Exports of copper, Zambia's main foreign exchange earner, dropped 2.2 per cent to 400,000 tonnes.

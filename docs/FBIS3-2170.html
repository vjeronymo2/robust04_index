Addressing an extended meeting of the Russian Government,  the  president said, "this is particularly necessary in the present  situation over which the danger of confrontation is looming."    He was referring to the recent amnesty decision made by the  State Duma, or Lower House of the Russian Parliament, under  which former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy and former  Parliament Speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov were freed last Saturday  [26 February] from Moscow's Lefortovo Prison.    He said he is "fully aware of the contradictory nature of  the  decision made by State Duma and the haste with which it was  fulfilled."    The president stressed that he "believed and continue to  believe that the constitution, the law and moral norms were  violated." He warned the the amnesty could lead to  confrontation again.    "Russia is different today," Yeltsin said, "it has a  constitution and peaceful potential for resolving its problems."    The meeting, attended by government ministers, leaders of  state executive bodies, Parliament chamber speakers and local  leaders, is being held in the Kremlin to discuss the economic  performances last year and the reform tasks for this year.</p>

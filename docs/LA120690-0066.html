			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> THEATER REVIEWS HOLIDAY SHOWS;  </P> <P> 'TIS THE SEASON;  </P> <P> AN UNUSUAL TAKEOFF ON 'THE NUTCRACKER,' A POP-RAP 'RUDOLPH' AND A DISAPPOINTING  'HERE'S LOVE' TAKE CENTER STAGE.  </P> <P> Christmas -- as anyone who has been out of doors or who has perused this  edition of Ventura County Life knows -- is traditionally the time that local  dance troupes produce their versions of "The Nutcracker."  </P> <P> This year, the Magnificent Moorpark Melodrama and Vaudeville Company is  performing "Christmas Is . . . ," a theatrical version of "The Nutcracker."  There's some ballet in this one, but there's quite a bit more.  </P> <P> Credited to June Walker Rogers, with an adaptation by the Moorpark group's  Linda Bredemann, "Christmas Is . . ." includes the dream-sequence story of the  handsome Nutcracker Prince's (Mark Curry) battle with the conniving Mouse King  (Richard Zemaitis), and even a bit of Tchaikovsky.  </P> <P> But the show -- set in contemporary times -- also features a melange of silly  gags, old and new songs and audience participation of the kind that is  associated with the Moorpark Melodrama's non-seasonal productions.  </P> <P> Director Paige Newmark keeps a large, enthusiastic and attractive cast in  motion for nearly three hours, including two intermissions.  </P> <P> Kelly Marie plays Clara, the little girl who lives in a mouse-infested house,  wears high-heeled shoes with her nightgown and leans toward rather vivid  dreams. Claude Rowe is her father, Wendy Morgan her mother, and Randall Harold  is her brother, Mickey, a bratty young man who's reminiscent of a young Tom  Poston and who -- for reasons unclear -- briefly affects an Alvin the Chipmunk  get-up late in the show.  </P> <P> Debbie Peterson Munz (who has a solo spot as a ballerina) choreographed,  imaginatively; Wendy Morgan is the choral director, and Linda Bredemann  designed the clever sets and large range of colorful costumes.  </P> <P> The show itself totally eliminates references to the religious aspects of  Christmas, treating the holiday simply as a time for good fellowship, family  unity and gift-giving.  </P> <P> About as far across the county as you can get from Moorpark -- about a  45-minute drive if you know the way -- Ojai's brilliant Illusions Theater  company is presenting a one-act, one-hour version of "Rudolph the Red-Nosed  Reindeer." Essentially an expansion of the story in composer Johnny Marks' song  of the same name, this "Rudolph" features new musical material ("The St. Nick  Shuffle," a rap, and "Christmas Time," both by West Craig Smith, who plays  Santa), as well as better-known pop ("Teddy Bears' Picnic") and rock  ("Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now") songs. Phil Collins' "Another Day in Paradise"  provides the backing to the show's most poignant scene, a retelling of the  Little Match Girl (Deborah Wolk) story.  </P> <P> Illusions founder Elizabeth Ridenour adapted the story, directed the play and  plays Mrs. Claus, heading (with Smith) a cast of 25 players, ranging from quite  young to parents -- and, perhaps, grandparents -- in the company's usual style.  </P> <P> Ridenour and choreographers Cheryl Singleton and Karen Moncharsh draw amazing  performances from the youngsters, especially, and Steve Emery supplies  sympathetic and appropriate accompaniment on keyboards and guitar.  </P> <P> Typical of the Illusions company, sets and costumes are remarkable and cleverly  designed.  </P> <P> The onstage and backstage skill exhibited in both of those shows, contrasts  with "Here's Love," the current production of Ventura's Encore Dinner Theater.  </P> <P> The problems start with the book, music and lyrics by Meredith Willson, whose  prior credits included "The Music Man" and "The Unsinkable Molly Brown," both  of which are vastly superior to this unmemorable show, based on the three  Oscar-winning 1947 film "Miracle on 34th Street."  </P> <P> The fable brings one Kris Kringle to downtown Manhattan, imbuing the management  of competing merchants Macy's and Gimbel's with genuine holiday spirit and  bringing a young couple together. It's pretty thin, and Willson's 1964 score is  so unmemorable that the composer revived his 1952 "It's Beginning to Look Like  Christmas" to add a bit of hum-ability.  </P> <P> Beset with problems during rehearsal that included three replacement actors and  a change in directors, the current production suffers most of all from horrible  timing -- pauses in dialogue or during scenery changes that bring whatever  momentum the actors may be generating to a dead stop. On the plus side, this is  something that's bound to improve along the way.  </P> <P> (Fairness dictates that we confess having left the show during intermission at  Sunday's matinee, to arrive in Ojai on time for the Illusions production.)  </P> <P> Reservations are virtually mandatory for each of these shows; the Moorpark  Melodrama and Illusions Theater productions sell out quickly, and the Encore  Dinner Theater needs to plan seating in advance of each performance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHERE AND WHEN  </P> <P> "Christmas Is . . ." at the Magnificent Moorpark Melodrama and Vaudeville  Company through Dec. 23.

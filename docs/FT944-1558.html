			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Matsushita targets bad loans: Bank of Japan chief predicts slow economic improvement Mr Yasuo Matsushita, new governor of the Bank of Japan, yesterday pledged that resolving the banking system's bad-loan problems would be one of his most important tasks. Mr Matsushita, in his first public pronouncement since taking office last week, said bad loans had peaked, 'but I am not confident that the matter has started to improve in terms of the adjustment of corporate balance sheets.' Attempts to recoup some of those loans by disposing of property collateral were 'not necessarily proceeding smoothly,' he declared. The problem would not disappear until non-performing assets could be made more liquid and businesses and financial institutions had improved their cash flows. Markets to clear such loans existed in the US, he added, referring to the securitisation of bad debts, but no such system existed in Japan. 'Interest rate problems' and complex property rights were also factors. While unspecific, Mr Matsushita's remarks were welcomed by equity analysts as a sign the new governor will be sympathetic to the Japanese banking industry's problems, and so can be expected to make the financial market's stability a high priority. Japan's 21 leading banks reported Y13,300bn (Pounds 85.2bn) of bad debts, 3.45 per cent of total loans, at the end of September, widely seen as a drag on new lending. That only includes loans on which repayment is more than six months late; the total is generally estimated to be at least double if all restructured loans are included. Full disclosure would increase confidence and management responsibility, but it was premature to ask banks to do this, Mr Matsushita said. He supported the decision of his predecessor, Mr Yasushi Mieno, to use Bank of Japan capital, for the first time since 1927, to rescue two small credit co-operatives. This must have been the best option, he said. Yet the new governor appeared less optimistic on the economic outlook than Mr Mieno, suggesting to economists in Tokyo he will be inclined to keep short-term interest rates low. He saw a slow economic pick-up, helped by rising industrial production and corporate earnings and improved business sentiment, but was cautious over the recovery's sustainability. Corporate balance sheet adjustment was insufficient and personal consumption did not warrant optimism. 'We cannot be too optimistic.' He saw no big change in the current economic trend. On the strength of the yen, cited recently by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development as the main risk to Japan's recovery, Mr Matsushita said the best way to achieve currency stability was to seek non-inflationary sustained economic growth. The government's Economic Planning Agency yesterday set a 2.8 per cent target for GDP growth in the year to the end of March 1996, slightly above the OECD forecast and well above most private-sector predictions. At the same time, it revised down the growth target for the year to March 1995 from 2.4 per cent to 1.7 per cent, again well above most private-sector forecasts for growth of less than 1 per cent. The EPA expects this fiscal year's current account surplus to be higher than earlier forecast, Dollars 127bn (Pounds 79.3bn) rather than Dollars 125bn. That, however, marks a politically welcome decline from last year's Dollars 131.4bn. It forecasts that the surplus will go on falling next year, to Dollars 122bn in the 12 months to March 1996.</p>

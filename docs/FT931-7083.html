			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Levitt faces fewer charges FRAUD charges faced by Mr Roger Levitt and three other former directors of the Levitt Group, the collapsed financial services company, were drastically cut yesterday by Mr Justice Laws, the trial judge. Mr Levitt, along with Mr Mark Reed, Mr Alan McNamara and Mr Robert Price, will face just one charge of fraudulent trading contrary to section 458 of the Company's Act when their trial starts in September. After his arrest Mr Levitt was charged with 62 offences. This number was later reduced to 22. The remaining joint charge - denied by all four defendants - alleges they fraudulently produced and distributed false accounts about the Levitt Group, fraudulently injected funds into the company and misled Fimbra by stating more than Pounds 20m in fees had been earned by Mr Levitt's personal advisory work in the 18 months up to June 1990.</p>

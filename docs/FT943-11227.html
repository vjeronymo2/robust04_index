			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Auditors face more checks Chartered accountancy firms that conduct audits will be subject to more frequent inspection visits under plans being drawn up by their professional bodies. Officials at the Joint Monitoring Unit, which scrutinises registered auditors who are members of the UK's three chartered accountancy bodies, aim to visit all 10,500 firms under their jurisdiction within the next five to eight years. The action follows changes recommended in letters written earlier this month to the regulatory bodies by Mr Neil Hamilton, minister for corporate affairs at the Department of Trade and Industry. It comes in a review of the first two years since the new self-regulatory regime for auditing was established under the 1989 Companies Act. The Joint Monitoring Unit will continue to scrutinise most closely the 160 larger firms that conduct the audits of listed and public-interest companies, which are already scheduled to be visited once every five years. Officials are also considering ways to change the inspection techniques of the largest accountancy firms, in which breaches are difficult to highlight using present approaches. Mr Hamilton asked the bodies to: Target firms where there was greater risk; Ensure monitoring was linked closely to the circumstances of different practices; Use a wider variety of techniques to supervise the firms; Prevent any cost increase. They have until October to submit details of the changes.</p>

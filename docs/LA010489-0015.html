			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAGAN TO UNDERGO SURGERY ON FINGER  </P> <P> President Reagan will undergo surgery on the ring finger of his left hand  Saturday to repair a slight involuntary contracture, the White House announced  Tuesday.  </P> <P> The condition, known as Dupuytren's Contracture, was described by Army Col.  John E. Hutton Jr., the President's physician, as minimal at the time Reagan  took office in 1981, but Hutton said in a written statement that it had  progressed sufficiently to require surgery.  </P> <P> The President, who is scheduled to return to the White House Thursday after a  two-week vacation in Southern California, will be admitted to Walter Reed Army  Medical Center in Washington Friday afternoon and is expected to return to the  White House Sunday. The two- to three-hour procedure will be carried out  Saturday morning, under regional anesthesia of the arm. Hutton said that  general anesthesia is not necessary.  </P> <P> The condition is a progressive, usually painless contraction of the fingers for  which there is no treatment other than surgery.  </P> <P> The surgery requires a bulky post-operative dressing from the fingers to the  upper arm for several days, and, in some cases, the use of a splint.  </P></p>

Now is the time  to make plans to attend. These conferences are exciting learning experiences.  </P> <P> The one-day Jamboree will be April 30 at the Pasadena Center, 300 E. Green St.  This 20th annual event includes speakers on many genealogical research topics,  plus offers genealogists an opportunity to obtain material and books on many  subjects. More than 200 vendors participate, offering everything from books to  computer software.  </P> <P> Beginning classes in genealogy are presented throughout the day in addition to  the specialized lectures.  </P> <P> To place your name on the Jamboree's "Genealogy: A Cooperative Venture"  contact: Jamboree, Southern California Genealogical Society, P.O.

The educators' sessions are designed for non-genealogists who wish  to integrate genealogical instruction into their curricula.  </P> <P> The St. Paul colloquy will take advantage of the rich ethnic heritage of the  Upper Midwest, offering classes for those with Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish,  Eastern European, American Indian, Welsh, German, Bohemian, Swiss, Polish,  Irish and black roots.

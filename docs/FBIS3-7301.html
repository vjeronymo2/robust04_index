			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 25 KYODO -- The government plans to  boost the volume of rice distributed through  government-monitored channels by 89 percent, while increasing  the total production of table rice by 38 percent in the year  that starts in November, the Food Agency said Friday [25 March].    According to its basic plan for rice control, the agency  will  take various steps, including financial incentives, to encourage  rice growers to sell rice through the government-controled  channels instead of selling in the grey market outside the  government channels, agency officials said. The plan was  explained to an informal meeting of the Rice Price Council.    For the 1995 rice year that starts on November 1, the  production of rice for table use will be increased 38 percent  from the previous year to 10.58 million tons, partly by easing  the policy of cutting back rice cultivation.    The government will try to increase the amount of rice  distributed under its control by 89 percent to 7.38 million tons  to secure stable supply.    The government will also import 379,000 tons of rice in 1995  to comply with the "minimum access" agreement on the partial  opening of Japan's rice market reached in the Uruguay Round of  global trade talks concluded last December under the auspices of  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    For the 1994 rice year that runs through October 1994, the  1993 production of table rice was 7.66 million tons, of which  3.9 million tons have been or will be distributed through the  government-approved channels, the agency said.    Japan will import a maximum of 2.48 million tons of rice  this  year to avoid a possible supply shortfall, according to the  agency.    Rice to be imported by the government for table use this  year  is estimated at 1.75-2.15 million tons. In addition, the  officials said, 330,000 tons of rice will be imported for  processing.</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Technology: Making a live connection - Worth Watching Debt collectors, telemarketing agencies and the public utilities have at least one thing in common: they need to contact lists of consumers by telephone, be it to nag them, persuade them or even to warn them. It is most frustrating when the number dialled is engaged, goes unanswered or is answered by an answering machine. But technology is now available to weed out these calls. Only when the system detects a live voice will it connect the call to the caller's headset. At the same time details of the person called - name, address and so on - appear on the operator's computer screen. To help companies exploit the technology CMG, the IT management group, has launched Predics (predictive dialling consultancy service). Independent analysts believe predictive dialling can increase productivity by several hundred per cent. CMG: UK, 071 976 0066.</p>

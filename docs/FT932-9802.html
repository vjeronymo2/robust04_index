			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Reed Elsevier The administrators of Maxwell Communication Corporation's US businesses recently reported they were receiving bids for the diverse assets on a 'Chinese menu approach'. Reed Elsevier, though, is sticking to plain boiled rice by offering Dollars 425m for Official Airline Guides alone. If Reed can consummate the deal at that price, it would represent something of a coup. The assets are essentially the same as those which Reed failed to secure in 1988 when Mr Robert Maxwell weighed in with a higher Dollars 750m bid. Although OAG has suffered badly in the torrid US airline market, it still made operating profits of Dollars 44m on revenue of Dollars 154m last year. With firm management and a recovering market, Reed should be able to push margins higher. The business would also complement Reed's existing interests in airline publishing. The deal, however, is far from done. Reed will now conduct its due diligence while the anti-trust investigators scrutinise the deal. The letter of intent is non-binding and non-exclusive. The administrators may hope they can flush out a higher offer now firm numbers are on the table. They may still believe they can realise greater value by selling the assets as a package. Reed can afford to walk away again if the bidding goes too high. Its simultaneous announcement that it had agreed to buy into France's biggest legal publisher suggests plenty of other routes for expansion.</p>

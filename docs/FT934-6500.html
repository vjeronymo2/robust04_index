			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Full in-tray greets Norwegian minister - The challenging questions facing Jens Stoltenberg Mr Jens Stoltenberg, 34, Norway's new oil industry minister, faces a busy opening period in his four-year term of office. Oil companies have no less than 25 field development plans on the drawing board, for 15 of which they intend to lodge development and operation plans this year and next. According to the Norwegian Oil Review - a domestic trade journal published by Mr Hans Henrik Ramm, a former Conservative government state secretary - development concepts for 25 oil and gas fields are being evaluated by oil companies with oil fields containing recoverable reserves of between 2m tonnes and 70m tonnes and gas fields ranging from 3bn to 10bn cubic metres. A recent report warned that precious few of these fields would be profitable under Norway's current tax regime if they used conventional technology and oil prices remained low. The government recently disclosed that it was drafting changes to the petroleum tax regime that could increase the financial burden of foreign and domestic oil companies. The oil industry has expressed strong disapproval of the plans, saying they would have a negative impact on the industry and damage the government's credibility. Oil companies point out that investment decisions have already been made in the expectation that the 1992 reforms of the fiscal regime would prevail for longer than one year. Last year's reforms created a loophole for foreign oil companies, allowing them to repatriate funds to parent companies at considerable loss of revenue  -several hundred million kroner annually - to state coffers. Mr Stoltenberg does not foresee other major changes to oil industry policy during his term but says emphasis is likely to shift to gas from oil. 'We have to develop our land-based industries to be competitive without them being dependent on oil revenue to provide state subsidies,' he says. One of Mr Stoltenberg's first achievements as minister was to forge closer ties with the former Soviet state of Kazakhstan. He recently travelled there and signed a memorandum of understanding to establish an energy forum. He also promised five educational scholarships to Kazakhs under Norway's Petrad programme, which aims to enhance the expertise of the participants in the fields of petroleum management and administration. A former state secretary of environment and an environmental activist in his youth, Mr Stoltenberg does not believe he should be forced to choose between petroleum and the environment. 'The moment you choose, you lose,' he says. 'The message of the Brundtland Commission's report to the United Nations on the environment is sustainable development, and this is what we intend to accomplish but not at the expense of the environment.' Mr Stoltenberg concedes that in the long-term, Norway's production policy could be open for discussion. 'How much oil should we really be taking out of the North Sea?' he asks. 'Environmentally speaking, it's easy to defend our depletion policy because part of our production is natural gas - and gas is an environmentally friendly replacement to other fuels.' Norway's natural gas supply to Europe is the most concrete and important contribution the country can make to sustainable development, he says. 'It's good business and it's our way of helping to reduce Europe's harmful emissions.' Norway has about 40 years of crude oil production left at current levels and 80 years of gas at a rate of 60bn cu m annually - more than twice the current rate - which is expected to be achieved by the turn of the century. 'We're not just pumping oil and consuming it. . . we are investing in Norway's future with petroleum revenue in a responsible way. Norway is nearly debt free and by 1994 it is possible we will succeed in further reducing our foreign debt, thanks to petroleum revenue.' In true social democratic style, Mr Stoltenberg argues that 'it's not a question of eating up Norway's petroleum oil wealth, but more an issue of distribution of wealth to the benefit of society'.</p>

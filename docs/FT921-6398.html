			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (8): An ill wind may pump up prices  -Gilts THE GOLDEN rule to remember when it comes to investing in gilts or any fixed-interest securities - is that gilt prices rise when interest rates fall, and vice versa. So wise investors should buy gilts when it looks as though there is going to be a reduction in interest rates, because that way they will benefit from the gain in gilt prices. Gilts - or gilt-edged securities, to give them their full name - are UK government bonds. When you buy a gilt, the government is borrowing money from you. In return, it pays you interest (known as the coupon) every six months until the bond reaches its redemption date, which is the date on which the investor is repaid the face value of the gilt. Like share prices, gilt prices move up or down under the influence of a wide variety of factors; however, the main influences are economic. Since gilt prices rise when interest rates fall, any economic news that is likely to have a bearing on interest rates may move gilt prices. It is often suggested that bond dealers have sick minds, because bond prices tend to rise on announcements which most other people would regard as bad news. Hence a sharp rise in the number of unemployed people, or the announcement of weak producer prices, often prompts a rise in gilt prices, because investors believe the government will come under pressure to reduce interest rates in order to kick-start the economy. On the other hand, any news which indicates that interest rates will remain high is generally bad for gilt prices. For example, high inflation figures or high average earnings figures limit the scope for interest-rate cuts, as does any weakness in sterling. In the approach to a general election, political concerns are also likely to influence gilts. In recent months, gilt prices have tended to react positively whenever an opinion poll has shown the Conservative party ahead of Labour. This is because the market is concerned that the election of a Labour government would result in higher public spending, forcing the government to fund heavily in the gilt market. The worry is that gilt prices would then be depressed by an abundance of new issues - in other words, that supply would exceed demand. In fact, even under the Conservative government there have been worries about the level of funding necessary in the gilt market. The Bank of England started to issue gilts again in 1991 (after an absence of three years) in order to fund the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR), and is expected to continue to issue between Pounds 1bn and Pounds 2bn of gilts a month in the 1992-93 tax year, according to some economists' estimates. Gilts come in a range of maturities, and with a range of coupons. The coupon payment counts as income and may be subject to income tax, depending on your total income. Investors on a low annual income may therefore find it more attractive to buy high-coupon gilts; while higher-rate taxpayers are often advised to invest in gilts with a very low coupon, so as to minimise their liability to income tax. Although it is important to look for the appropriate coupon, what most investors are really interested in is the yield (see letter Y). For example, if you buy Pounds 100 nominal stock for Pounds 90 in the market and it has a coupon of 9 per cent, the running yield on your investment is 10 per cent (9/90 x 100). Provided you hold your gilt investments until maturity, you will be repaid the nominal value of the bonds. If you make a gain on the price of the gilt, it counts as a capital gain and will be taxed accordingly. Where you need to be careful is if you decide to sell your gilts before the maturity date, given that gilt prices can fluctuate considerably. You can buy and sell gilt-edged stock either through a broker or from the Post Office. Many small investors find it more attractive to buy and sell through the Post Office: it has the advantage of being convenient, and the income from gilts bought in this way is paid gross. However, there are certain disadvantages: not all of the available gilt issues can be bought and sold at the Post Office, and the transaction usually takes a few days to complete, so that investors cannot be certain of the price at which the deal is done.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Letter: Thorp backed by Japanese Sir, Your report, 'Ministers set to back Thorp plant' (June 16), quoted the advertisement by 'Japanese Citizens Concerned about Plutonium' and stated 'the group claimed that the Japanese power utilities no longer wanted the plant to go ahead because it was accumulating too much plutonium'. This is not a correct argument. On behalf of all the Japanese electric power companies here, I would like to explain about our nuclear strategy. Reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel and recycling plutonium is Japan's fundamental nuclear policy. According to this policy, Japanese power utilities, with a consensus, provide recovered plutonium for the government's civil R&amp;D activities and at the same time we are now proceeding with the programme to use the material in our own nuclear reactors. The plutonium to be recovered at Thorp is an indispensable part of our programme. We fully support Thorp. Naturally we do want the plant to go ahead as soon as possible. Kohji Kaneko, general manager, nuclear power department, Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan, 1.9.4, Ote-Machi, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan</p>

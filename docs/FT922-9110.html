			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / International Company News: Corporacion Banesto accounts qualified INDEPENDENT auditors have qualified the 1991 accounts of Corporacion Banesto for failing to provision correctly for a stock acquisition that led to losses and because it has five years of tax inspections pending, Reuter reports from Madrid. Banco Espanol de Credito SA-Banesto, the Spanish banking group which owns 72 per cent of Corporacion, confirmed the auditors' findings but had no other comment. Corporacion Banesto is a holding company for the industrial group of the same name. It was created in 1990 after a restructuring of the bank's industrial subsidiaries previously held through trust companies. The auditors' report states that in September 1990 Corporacion guaranteed Banesto loans to another subsidiary, Banesto Industrial Investments BII, which Corporacion then acquired in June 1991 together with the loan liability. In December 1991, BII was wound up and its liabilities taken over by the Corporacion, producing a loss of Pta9.73bn (Dollars 95m), part of which corresponds to the 1990 fiscal year. The auditors' report says that 'given the financial situation of BII at December 1990 the consolidated accounts of (the Corporacion) to that date should have included a provision for the potential losses that existed'. It said the relevant provision in 1991 should have been presented as 'results from previous years' in the profit and loss account for that year. BII's assets consisted of 972,108 Carburos Metalicos shares and an option on 841,656 additional shares in the same company. It added that with tax inspections pending for the past five years, it was impossible to quantify the company's tax liability. Corporacion made a 1991 pre-tax profit of Pta3.79bn after provisions of Pta28.4bn.</p>

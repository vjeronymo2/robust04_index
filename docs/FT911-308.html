			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Trade blocs are here to stay: America Mexico's gross national product is less than 4 per cent of America's. Its exports account for only one third of one per cent of US domestic consumption. So why does the prospect of a free trade agreement with Mexico excite so much more interest in Washington than the Uruguay Round trade talks - which affect US trade with the whole world, including economic powers such as Japan and Germany? The answer lies partly in American indifference to the wider world. Mexico has a long border with the US; the hope that free trade will encourage it to export goods rather than people is taken seriously. Mention the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), however, and you invite the blankest of stares. The man on Main Street probably could not identify Geneva on a map, still less comprehend why a bunch of European bureaucrats should exert influence over US trade policy. Never forget that international bodies count for little here: after 40 years, some congressmen still believe the World Bank is an aid agency based in New York. Gatt is obscurity squared. The deeper answer is that bilateral pacts, such as the planned agreement with Mexico, are more acceptable to the aggressive American psyche that the abstract logic of multilateral trade liberalisation. Support for free trade in the US has a short history. In the late 19th century when Britain was trumpeting the virtues of trade liberalisation (and gradually sinking below the waves as an economic power) the US was busy creating an industrial powerhouse - behind high tariff walls. The US conversion came in the aftermath of the second world war, when Europe and Japan were weak and no threat to the US market. With the loss of economic hegemony, analysts are again questioning the merits of traditional free trade. US fears are encapsulated in a recent essay* by Mr Clyde Prestowitz, a former senior official at the commerce department who heads the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington think-tank. Mr Prestowitz invents the term 'Gattism' to describe 'a belief, bordering on religious faith, in the power of ever more detailed trade rules to solve major domestic and international trade problems'. He dismisses the Uruguay Round as a 'futile, legalistic crusade to homogenise different nations'. The Gatt is based on two fundamental principles: 'national treatment' and 'most-favoured nation'. Under national treatment, members agree to treat foreign companies exactly as they treat domestic companies. Under most-favoured nation, liberal rules agreed between any two Gatt signatories must be extended to all others. Mr Prestowitz (and many others) regard both principles as unjust. This is because they do not require comparable rules to be applied in all member countries. A restrictive country can impose all kinds of barriers (provided it does not discriminate against foreign companies) while its exporters piggy-back on the liberal laws agreed elsewhere. 'Gattism' reflects a belief that unilateral trade disarmament is beneficial. (Like Christians turning the other cheek, free market purists welcome dumping and other infractions because they initially benefit the consumer.) The economic case for unilateralism, however, is weaker than often pretended. If you make the usual sweeping neo-classical assumptions - no economies of scale, no unemployment (because prices clear all markets) and no uncertainty about the future - you can show that a small country should eschew protection. But even in this fairy tale world, neo-classical theory indicates that a large country such as the US can benefit by imposing an 'optimal' tariff: at a certain level of protection, the gain from the improvement in its terms of trade more than offsets the loss of imports. Game theory suggests this remains true even if other countries retaliate. Free market purists are thus being dogmatic when they claim to have 'proved' that unilateral trade liberalisation is beneficial. It need not be even in their idealised world. Nor is the empirical evidence compelling: the huge success of Japan and South Korea suggests that, for individual countries, a combination of export promotion and import restriction can be more profitable than unilateral trade disarmament. But it is not an option for the world as a whole. The question, therefore, is how to persuade countries to pursue policies that may not always be in their own interests but which benefit everybody in the long run. One popular option is to lay greater stress on reciprocity - a principle that horrifies purists. 'I will open my markets if you will open yours' is an offer that politicians and businessmen find difficult to reject. Unlike strict 'Gattism', it seems self-evidently fair. Yet it is most easily pursued through bilateral agreements in which like-minded countries can directly trade concessions. Seen through US eyes, mercantilist Japan is dominating Asia through a network of direct foreign investment links. European Community nations, while outwardly in favour of multilateral trade liberalisation, are consolidating the advantages of preferential trading links through the Single Market programme. In the circumstances, who can blame the US for trying to forge its own regional trade bloc? Whatever happens to the Uruguay Round, pacts with Canada and Mexico mark only the beginning of a more assertive - and more selfish  - US trade policy. * The Last Gasp of Gattism.

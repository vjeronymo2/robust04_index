			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Offshore Centres (1): Outsiders come first in financial markets - An offshore financial centre must have paradoxical characteristics. It must be respectable but accommodating. It must be European, but preferably just outside Europe. Those centres that succeed in the delicate balancing act will prosper SOMETIMES IT is outsiders, rather than insiders, that can have the edge in the financial markets. At the beginning of next year the European Community is scheduled to open its much-ballyhooed Single Market. One of the most important areas for this initiative is financial services, the subject of a large number of directives in banking, insurance, investment and so forth. But there is a possibility that not only the financial industry within the EC will benefit from these initiatives. Dotted around the edge of the community, and to some extent also in pockets within it, are a number of so-called offshore financial centres. Many of these are hoping that they may benefit in some way from upheavals in the mainland financial sector. One of the biggest challenges arises from the possibility that Switzerland, the most prestigious of all the 'offshore' financial centres within the European time zone, is likely to move into a closer relationship with the European Community, and may even become a full member within the foreseeable future. Will this mean that Switzerland's key private banking centres of Geneva and Zurich, along with other EC centres such as Luxembourg and London, will become buried in Community regulations and infested with tax burdens? If so, a lot of money will leave in search of more tolerant and discreet jurisdictions. Or will the EC's regime be light and flexible? So far, for instance, Luxembourg has been able to maintain a successful role as the Community's onshore/offshore centre. It has been able to fight off the threat of a Community-wide withholding tax. It is far from clear, however, that it will be able to sustain all its advantages in the long run. Little Luxembourg has been able to argue that it needs special privileges to offset its lack of basic economic resources. But the entry of Switzerland to the EC might force the playing field to be levelled. Small jurisdictions such as Luxembourg have the advantage of flexibility. Luxembourg has, for example, managed to grab for itself the position of focus of the EC-wide mutual funds industry which has been made possible as a result of an earlier directive on Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (Ucits). Although the Grand Duchy has little in the way of tradition as an investment centre, it has set up an attractive fiscal regime for mutual funds. Bigger countries such as the UK have much greater resources and experience in the field, but their tax authorities and regulators are obsessed with domestic considerations. Foreign buyers of British mutual funds, or unit trusts as they are called, must try to recover tax which is deducted at source from dividends. Although this may theoretically be possible, few such international investors can be bothered to grapple with Britain's tax bureaucracy. They buy tax-free funds from Luxembourg or other jurisdictions instead. Only one other substantial mainland jurisdiction within the EC has seriously gone after international business. The Irish government has backed the Dublin International Financial Services Centre, a low tax base for international financial services companies. It has become a significant rival to Luxembourg in some areas such as mutual funds and offshore insurance companies. Otherwise, Gibraltar and Madeira also count as integral zones of the European Community, though they are politically subordinate to the UK and Portugal respectively. There are bigger offshore centres outside the EC, however. The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man have a special position established under a protocol to the Treaty of Rome. For the purposes of their financial services activities they are outside the Community, although their physical goods trade is within the common tariff barrier. At one stage they were concerned at the negative impact the Single Market might have on them, but now they are developing a positive strategy as 'offshore Europe' centres. Significantly, a strong link is being built up between Switzerland and Jersey and Guernsey as the Swiss banks hedge their bets. It is no coincidence that Crossair, the Swiss airline, has recently increased its flights between Zurich and the Channel Islands to daily frequency. If the EC centres become highly constrained by Single Market rules there could be much more scope for the external centres to attract business. The Channel Islands are easily reached from many European countries and are within the European time zone, although they have yet to develop the multilingual capability which Switzerland provides. But could the Channel Islands nevertheless be too close for some purposes? Might they, for instance, come under pressure to disclose confidential client information to mainland tax authorities? The provocative question is raised in a far from disinterested manner by offshore bankers in places such as Bermuda and even parts of the Caribbean. They have focused much of their attention on the western hemisphere in the past, but are now floating the idea that places such as Bermuda could be attractive centres for Europeans who would like their money to be a safe distance away from Europe. It depends, of course, on how much the clients have to hide. Offshore centres have always played down the idea that their clients are corrupt Third World dictators who have looted their national treasuries or drug barons trying to launder dirty money. Under pressure from the US authorities, jurisdictions such as Switzerland have already been forced to abandon much of their tradition of banking secrecy. There remains, however, the likelihood that many clients are evading taxes in their domestic jurisdictions. Belgian dentists do not, it can be assumed, normally declare their Eurobond interest income to the tax man. The growth in expatriate employment has also created a big market for the preservation of wealth in safe, efficient centres where it is secure not only from tax demands but also from acquisitive ex-wives and feuding relatives. Offshore financial centres offer confidentiality and privacy (although whether they can always deliver it is not so clear). There has always also been a substantial business in offering offshore services to companies, especially in the creation of complex structures which enable taxes to be avoided or deferred. Secrecy privileges may also make it possible for the ownership of corporate entities to be cloaked in obscurity. This was a notorious feature of the Robert Maxwell empire, for example, with controlling interests held through jurisdictions such as Liechtenstein and Gibraltar. The brass plate industry continues to maintain many offshore lawyers in comfortable employment. But it is private banking that provides the real growth element for most offshore centres at present. New contenders are attempting to break into this lucrative business, and they may see greater scope if existing centres are increasingly handicapped by European Community regulations. In the Mediterranean, Malta and Cyprus are seeking to expand within a market place which could take in parts of the Middle East as well as southern Europe. There is also the possibility that offshore-type centres might be created in parts of eastern Europe. Hungary, for example, has been offering attractive financial services to international clients. Offshore centres do not necessarily need the backing of a long tradition - the Channel Islands themselves have been serious offshore financial centres for only about 25 years - but they do need political and financial stability. Clients are scarcely likely to express confidence in a place threatened by revolution or invasion. Gibraltar, for example, would have a much greater opportunity for growth if only the political row with Spain could be patched up. And even Switzerland's image has been damaged just a little bit in offshore eyes by the political and economic weaknesses which have undermined the Swiss franc and have led to the flirtation with the EC by a country which previously has always been resolutely independent. An offshore financial centre must have paradoxical characteristics. It must be respectable but accommodating. It must be European, but preferably just outside Europe. Those centres that succeed in the delicate balancing act will prosper.</p>

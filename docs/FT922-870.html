			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Bill tabled to trim US banking rules THE US administration yesterday took its battle against excessive bank regulation back to the Congress, proposing a bill that would roll back many of the rules put in place by the banking bill of last November. Mr Nicholas Brady, Treasury secretary, said the bill would repeal some of the most onerous measures of the November legislation, as well as in earlier laws such as the Community Reinvestment Act. 'This legislation will remove needless statutory burdens that require banks to spend more time filling out forms and filing reports than they do making loans,' Mr Brady said. With Congress near summer recess, and an election, the chances of a banking bill being enacted this year are slim. Senior Treasury officials acknowledge this. Mr Jay Powell, Treasury under-secretary for finance said: 'It's late in the year, but I wouldn't rule out some action on regulatory relief.' But he was unable to explain why the bill had not been produced earlier.</p>

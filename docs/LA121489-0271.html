			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PREP FOOTBALL ALL-STARS 1989;  </P> <P> 4 SENIOR BACKS RUN AWAY WITH HONORS ON SOUTHEAST TEAM  </P> <P> Four outstanding running backs -- Ivan Wilson of South Gate, Charles Levy of  Lynwood, Ron Papazian of Whittier Christian and Rudy Ramirez of Bell Gardens --  head the 1989 Times Southeast All-Star High School Football Team.  </P> <P> Together, those four seniors ran for more than 4,000 yards this season.  </P> <P> Whittier High, which won its first league title in more than 20 years, placed  four players on the first team. South Gate and El Rancho each have three  players on the team.  </P> <P> First-team players from throughout Southern California will be honored at a  breakfast and awards ceremony at 9 a.m. Sunday at the Anaheim Hilton, 777  Convention Way. The featured speaker will be Stanford football Coach Dennis  Green.  </P> <P> The All-Southeast team:  </P> <P> OFFENSE  </P> <P> Memo Watkins, Bell Gardens, lineman -- "The finest pulling guard we have had in  years," Bell Gardens Coach Dave Newell said of the 5-foot-11, 255-pound  Watkins, who has good speed and a low center of gravity.  </P> <P> Chris Andresen, Warren, lineman -- "He has the size, strength and determination  to be successful," Warren Coach John Hennigan said of the 6-foot-4, 295-pound  Andresen. Despite missing some games due to an injury, he repeated on the  All-Southeast team.  </P> <P> Richard Brown, Santa Fe, lineman -- A three-year starter, Brown is quick and  strong at 230 pounds. He had 46 tackles, three sacks and two forced fumbles.  </P> <P> Ruben Rodriguez, Glenn, lineman -- A three-year letterman, the 6-foot-2,  285-pound Rodriguez was the best blocker on Glenn's Suburban League  championship team. As a center, he dominated an opponent's defensive line.  </P> <P> Aaron Rodts, Whittier, lineman -- A 270-pound senior guard, Rodts was the  Whitmont League's most valuable offensive lineman.  </P> <P> Ray Maldonado, Montebello, quarterback -- The Whitmont League's offensive back  of the year, Maldonado completed 113 of 189 passes for 1,579 yards and 15 TDs.  He was the Oilers' captain.  </P> <P> Charles Levy, Lynwood, back -- This 6-foot-2, 185-pound senior played in only  six games but still ran for 584 yards, passed for 466 and returned kicks for  238 yards. Levy had 4,935 total yards in his career. Many big colleges are  recruiting Levy, who also plays basketball at Lynwood.  </P> <P> Ron Papazian, Whittier Christian, back -- This 6-foot-2, 220-pound senior, who  is being recruited by USC, UCLA and Colorado, scored 35 touchdowns and gained  1,475 yards on 226 carries. As a linebacker, he led the Olympic League in  tackles.  </P> <P> Rudy Ramirez, Bell Gardens, back -- Only 5-foot-6 and 145 pounds, Ramirez had  1,100 yards rushing and 475 yards receiving. He also set a school record by  returning four punts for TDs. He was All-CIF in 1988 and is a repeater on The  Times' team.  </P> <P> Ivan Wilson, South Gate, back -- "He scares everyone he plays," South Gate  Coach Gary Cordray said of Wilson, a powerful runner who gained 1,290 yards and  scored 19 TDs. Cordray said Wilson reminds him of former Chicago Bears runner  Walter Payton. USC and Washington are among the schools recruiting Wilson.  </P> <P> Scott Alvarez, California, wide receiver -- The 6-foot, 170-pound Alvarez used  a great ability to focus on the ball while being tightly covered to catch 62  passes for 750 yards and four TDs. Coach Tom Tereschuk said Alvarez is very  disciplined in running patterns, has great hands and the ability to find the  open field.  </P> <P> Jessie Carrillo, El Rancho, kicker -- Last year's leading kicker in Southern  California, Carrillo made 22 of 23 extra points and hit five of eight in field  goals this season. His kicks won two overtime games.  </P> <P> DEFENSE  </P> <P> Chris Emch, Whittier, lineman -- He was Whittier's defensive player of the game  four times this season. He led the Cardinals in tackles for three years and  used his 6-foot-8 height to block nine extra-point attempts, three field-goal  attempts and two punts.  </P> <P> Puna Peko, Whittier, lineman -- Peko moves up after making the All-Southeast  second team last season. The 6-foot-2, 270-pound senior was the Whitmont  League's most valuable defensive player.  </P> <P> Raul Garcia, El Rancho, lineman -- At 5-foot-11 and 250 pounds, Garcia can  bench-press 340 pounds. Because of his strength, he seldom was successfully  blocked. He made the Whitmont League first team on offense and defense.  </P> <P> Mike Cardona, La Mirada, lineman -- This 6-foot-4, 275-pound college prospect  also made the All-Suburban League team.  </P> <P> Kali Williams, Lynwood, linebacker -- Joe Hembrick, who coached Williams, said  that Williams is "beyond his years in maturity." A three-year starter who also  played running back, Williams was a sure tackler and the leader of the Knights'  defense. The University of the Pacific is interested in Williams, but he is  leaning toward attending Howard University.  </P> <P> Frank Ozuna, El Rancho, linebacker -- "He has great instincts and does things  you can't coach," El Rancho Coach Dick Shelko said of Ozuna, who had 66 tackles  and also starred as a running back.  </P> <P> Valentino Hanks, South Gate, linebacker -- An all-around athlete, Hanks led the  Rams in tackles and also averaged 29 yards on kickoff returns and 13 yards on  punt returns. He reads defenses very well.  </P> <P> Travis Carter, Glenn, back -- Willie Norman, Glenn's coach, said Carter has the  "ability to find the football and the end zone." The 6-foot, 170-pound senior  had six interceptions, returning two for TDs. He also starred as a kick  returner and wide receiver. He made the Suburban League's first team on offense  and defense.  </P> <P> Chuck Stafford, Norwalk, back -- A junior, Stafford had seven interceptions,  returning one for a TD. He also returned two kicks for touchdowns. Stafford  played "center field" on defense and also excelled in man-to-man coverage. As a  wide receiver, he caught 27 passes for 625 yards.  </P> <P> Miguel Cortez, Montebello, back -- A 6-foot, 180-pound senior, Cortez had 33  tackles and two interceptions as a defensive back and also caught 28 passes for  777 yards as an All-Whitmont League wide receiver.  </P> <P> Carlos Martinez, South Gate, back -- South Gate's captain, Martinez made 50  tackles and always covered the other team's best receiver. He also played  quarterback and was on special teams. He ran for a first down on a fourth-down  play in two big games.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prep Football All-Stars 1989  </P> <P> </P> <P> Offense  </P> <P> Name: Memo Watkins  </P> <P> Position: Lineman

He is being allowed to stay 48 hours in Manhattan, but is  forbidden to venture beyond a 25-mile radius of New York.    Mr Adams is also banned from engaging in any "direct or  indirect" fundraising for the IRA. Huge security is expected  for the visit.    A White House statement said the decision represented the  administration's effort to "support this important peace  process." Assurances had been sought from Mr Adams that he would  renounce violence and support the joint declaration.    The IRA gets its money through NORAID in America. The  organisation said: "The announcement means that the long  censorship by visa denial has been broken."    White House advisers to President Clinton apparently  overruled State Department hawks who persuaded him to stop Mr  Adams visiting Manhattan last year because of his suspected  direct involvement in IRA operations.    Mr Adams has been banned for 20 years and it was the  persuasive power of two Democratic Irish-American politicians --  Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Senator Edward Kennedy --  that swayed Mr Clinton.    The pair joined 38 other politicians to urge Mr Clinton to  reverse his opposition, arguing that the Sinn Fein leader's  appearance at a critical juncture of the peace process could  help by easing Sinn Fein into the mainstream and showing IRA  hard-liners that there is credibility to be gained through  negotiation.    Mr Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionists, has also  been invited to the conference, organised by the National  Committee on American Foreign Policy, but said that if Mr Adams  attends he will stay in Belfast.    Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, Mr James Molyneaux, the  Unionist leader, and Dr John Alderdice of the Alliance Party are  also invited.    Mr John Taylor, the Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford,  condemned the visa decision as "despicable" and accused the  Clinton administration of giving in to Washington's Irish lobby.</p>

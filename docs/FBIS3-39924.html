After talks with Mate Granic,  his Croatian counterpart, Kinkel told journalists in Bonn today  that it is now important to increase efforts to find a political  solution to end the civil war. The prerequisites for this are  good. Granic pointed out the negotiations taking place between  the Croatians and the Muslim Bosnians in Zagreb today.    Kinkel emphasized that "Sarajevo" had been "a first small,  but very important step." Now they will, as if working on a  mosaic, try to bring peace to the other main crisis areas in the  conflict. It is important to open Tuzla Airport. It must be  possible to transport humanitarian aid to the people in the  disputed areas.    The foreign minister announced he would be explaining the  overall situation in the former Yugoslavia to the cabinet on  Thursday [24 February]. A "new momentum" has entered the  negotiations over the past few days that must be exploited. He  also spoke to Granic about the repatriation problem regarding  Croat refugees in Germany. Both sides are interested in a joint  solution.</p>

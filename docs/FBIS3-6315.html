			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Usani Mongkhonpon] </F>   [Text] Now is not a good time for Thailand to resume  negotiations on aviation rights with the United States because  the existing temporary agreement is efficient and fair to both  countries, an aviation industry source said. But Permanent  Secretary for Transport and Communications Mahidon  Chantharangkun confirmed, "We'd better talk to them."    A Thai delegation headed by Mahidon will go to Washington  April 5-6 following a US invitation. The United States wants  Thailand to adopt its "Open Skies" policy allowing for  unrestricted cargo and passenger capacity on a mutual basis.  Mahidon said the Thai delegation is unlikely to go along with  the US Open Skies idea but stand firm in defending this  country's interests first.    The industry source said Thailand is now in an advantageous  position vis-a-vis the United States since there is now no  permanent agreement obliging this country to make any  concessions. The latter has tried to help its airlines gain  more access to the growing Asian markets. Thailand would be at a  disadvantage in an openly competitive competitive [as published]  situation. Thai Airways International is the only large  international carrier based here and it does not have the  capability to fight with the four strong US airlines flying  here, including United, Delta, Northwest and Federal Express.    The United States successfully concluded open-skies  agreements with the Netherlands for an unlimited time frame and  with Germany for a four-year term. Negotiations with the United  Kingdom are now under way. He emphasized however that it is time  for the two countries to resume talks, four years having passed  since the cancellation of the last aviation pact. "How could  people be angry for four years? We should have a little bit of  talking. If the negotiations show no sign of accomplishment, we  will just quit," Mahidon said.    The United States on March 11 informed Thailand that it  wants  to see three main topics discussed, including Thai restrictions  on seat sales by Delta and United Airlines, possible capacity  limitations by Thai and US carriers and more flexibility for  cargo carriers.    Asked if the US might impose sanctions under the US  301-trade  law on Thailand for not consenting to its demands, Mahidon said  that he believes the US would not, without however giving a  reason. "It depends on who is leading the negotiations," he  added.    A source in the Aviation Department pointed out that the US  has already softened its stance on Thai Airways International's  operation in the US market in the hopes of Thailand easing its  resistance.    Another temporary agreement between the two countries, valid  from Mar 7 to Sept 1 was just completed.</p>

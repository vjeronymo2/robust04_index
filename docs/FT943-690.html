			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Spotlight on the World Bank board Sir, Martin Wolf ('Taming the beast of H Street', September 26) was right to question the effectiveness of the World Bank's executive board 'in supervising the bank's management'. When I was the director of the bank's health services department in 1989-90, the board was generally regarded contemptuously by its senior staff. For example, I remember being at an internal seminar in May 1989 when Robert Picciotto, then vice-president for corporate planning and budgeting, stated that often the 'mushroom approach' was taken with the board - 'keep it in the dark, and feed it garbage'. The World Bank's executive board is in an unusual position. With the exception of its American director, all its members receive generous salaries and benefits direct from the World Bank; and these are always adjusted according to rises in the bank staff emoluments. Is there any incentive to control staff salaries when one's own income would be affected? Michael Irwin, 26 First Street, London SW3 2SD</p>

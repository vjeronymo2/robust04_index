			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS DEPLOY NEW NUCLEAR SUB  </P> <P> The Soviet Union, continuing a major modernization of naval power, has deployed  one of its newest nuclear attack submarines with the key Arctic northern fleet  for the first time, Norway said Saturday.  </P> <P> "The Soviets are upgrading the quality and firepower of the northern fleet all  the time and there is little sign of disarmament in that area," said Col.  Gullow Gjeseth of Norway's Defense Command.  </P> <P> An observation plane from Norway, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization, spotted the Akula-class submarine, which carries SS-N-21 nuclear  cruise missiles as well as torpedoes, while on patrol in the Barents Sea two  weeks ago. It photographed the vessel after it surfaced.  </P> <P> Gjeseth said the Soviet Union had previously deployed only three Akulas, all in  the Pacific Ocean.  </P></p>

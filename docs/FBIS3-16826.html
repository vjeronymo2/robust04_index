However, the Russian command refuses to  meet the demand, a senior spokesman for the Ukrainian naval  command told INTERFAX-Ukraine.    He described as provocative another refusal by the naval  command to inform the Ukrainian defense ministry of the warships  putting to sea.    INTERFAX earlier reported that on 17 March, 25 warships, two  submarines and five auxiliary ships put to sea for training  purposes.    The spokesman said that the Ukrainian Defense Ministry will  force the command to comply with Ukrainian laws.    Sources close to the Ukrainian naval staff have told  INTERFAX-Ukraine that on 17 March one Ukrainian warship set out  to sea.    Commenting on the statement by the Ukrainian Navy senior  spokesman, Andrey Grachev, the acting chief of the Fleet's press  center, said that "it is not command actions but such statements  that are provocative."    Firstly, in line with Ukrainian and Crimean laws on troop  movement "we must warn the Crimean parliament and its speaker  and this we did."    Secondly, the Fleet commander, Admiral Baltin, in a telegram  to Ukrainian Defence Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy, warned him back  in February that ships were planned to put to sea in March 1994,  and this was done too, said Grachev.    Speaking about one of the four ships of the Ukrainain Navy  putting to sea, Andrey Grachev voiced the hope that it would  return safely to the base.</p>

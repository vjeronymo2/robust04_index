			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ET TU, E.T.?  </P> <P> An enormous number of trained observers (astronomers, pilots, police) have seen  UFOs in daylight, and very close, so that there was no mistaking the craft for  swamp gas or Venus.  </P> <P> That is why the government's chief advocate, astronomer J. Allen Hynek,  switched sides.  </P> <P> Take "The Gulf Breeze Sightings" by Ed and Frances Walters. Klass alleges that  the photos therein are fakes, even though the book contains extensive expert  analysis to the contrary. Some photos were taken with a tamper-proof camera,  were taken in the presence of others and were shot by other than the authors.  There were also 200 eyewitnesses, so the photography issue is irrelevant.  </P> <P> SCOTT S. SMITH  </P> <P> THOUSAND OAKS  </P></p>

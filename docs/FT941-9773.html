			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Lloyd's may ease deadline for Pounds 900m settlement Lloyd's of London may extend the deadline on its Pounds 900m out-of-court settlement offer to lossmaking Names. The insurance market had set a Monday deadline for the deal, designed to end litigation by some 17,000 individual members seeking compensation for losses. Lloyd's said the proposed settlement would be withdrawn unless at least 70 per cent of the value of the offer was taken up by the lossmaking Names. However, it is now understood that if a significant number of Names - the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market - accept the deal, a short extension of the offer period will be considered. It seems likely that at least half the value of the offer would have to be taken up before that option went ahead. The deadline for the deal has already been extended once, from January 31 to February 14. But under the original conditions of the offer, announced in December last year, Lloyd's may vary the deadline again. Leaders of action groups - who are organising legal action on behalf of lossmakers - remain confident that the offer will be rejected. At meetings last month, lossmakers voted by majorities of at least five to one to reject the settlement in favour of legal action. Only one out of 38 action groups has voted to accept. Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action group, which is organising the biggest legal action, says that his group will go ahead with legal action irrespective of the overall response from Names to the offer. Mr Colin Hook, chairman of the Feltrim Names Association, whose case is scheduled to come to court in October, said he could not see any value in keeping the offer open. 'It just prolongs the agony,' he said, although he acknowledged that some Feltrim Names who had voted in favour of rejection last month might have subsequently accepted the offer.</p>

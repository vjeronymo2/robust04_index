Determination  of an accurate value by direct computation of change in average  molecular weight is also complex. Therefore, it is more  expedient to use other average molecular weight values, such as  average viscosity and average weight. However, an estimate of  rupture density of this type may be executed simply only for  some particular molecular weight distribution, e.g. Flory  distribution. For any other molecular weight distribution the  problem becomes significantly more difficult, owing to the  change in form in molecular weight distribution during the  destruction. In the present work a generalized formula advanced  by Charlseby is examined. With this formula, it is demonstrated  that for a given polymer having an initial Schultz distribution,  the computation may be completed only for a limited interval of  index of destruction values, and this interval becomes narrower  as the index of distribution increases. This formula is not  suitable for logarithmic-normal distribution. Figures 2;  references 6 (Russian).</p>

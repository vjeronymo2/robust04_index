			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> DELIVERY OF BOEING 747 JET MODIFIED FOR PRESIDENTIAL USE DELAYED AGAIN  </P> <P> Delivery of the first of two high-tech Boeing 747 jetliners assigned to shuttle  U.S. Presidents around the world has been delayed again until at least the  middle of next year, the Air Force said today.  </P> <P> "We're not going to make this year's November deadline," Lt. Col. Darrell Hayes  said. "Boeing, the Air Force and the (Federal Aviation Administration) are now  working on a firm delivery date of mid-1990 or later."  </P> <P> The first of the two new White House aircraft, which will be designated Air  Force One when the President is aboard, was originally scheduled for delivery  last November.  </P> <P> But that date was subsequently delayed a year until this November by wiring  problems and fire-control regulations for the jets, which are much bigger than  the aging Boeing 707s used by President Bush.  </P> <P> The 747s, being modified at a total cost of $249 million, will include 238  miles of electric wiring and amenities from an exotic television system to 85  telephones and giant food storage compartments.  </P></p>

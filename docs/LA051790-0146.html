			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> EL CAMINO REAL'S PECK MASTERS SAN PEDRO  </P> <P> Like an artist, Chrissy Peck has taken pains to master her medium. Peck, the  ace pitcher on the El Camino Real High softball team, has learned to brush back  batters, canvass her domain on defense and paint the corners of the strike  zone.  </P> <P> And, as Peck displayed Wednesday against San Pedro, she also has learned to  whitewash.  </P> <P> Behind Peck's one-hit, 11-strikeout performance, El Camino Real defeated San  Pedro, 7-0, to advance to the semifinals of the City Section Division 4-A  playoffs. The Conquistadores will play Cleveland next Wednesday at South Gate  Park. Cleveland beat Granada Hills, 14-4, Wednesday.  </P> <P> Peck, the City 4-A Player of the Year last season who recently committed to  play for Barry College in Miami, Fla., threw just 76 pitches. She retired the  first nine batters and did not throw a ball through the first 2 2/3 innings.  </P> <P> "When she's in a groove like she was today, she's just impossible," said  Conquistadore Coach Neils Ludlow, whose top-seeded team improved to 21-3, also  Peck's record.  </P> <P> Peck, evidently a perfectionist, was not elated by her effort this season.  </P> <P> "During the season, I did enough to get by," said Peck, who hurled three  no-hitters. "I was satisfied but I knew I could do better.  </P> <P> "After the third or fourth inning, I usually slow down and lose my  concentration."  </P> <P> Peck has been running wind sprints and taking extra pitching practice in  preparation for the postseason.  </P> <P> "She's committed," Ludlow noted.  </P> <P> The defending 4-A champion, El Camino Real defeated San Pedro, 1-0, in last  year's title game with Peck pitching. The Pirates (14-8) lost five All-City  players to graduation and have struggled.  </P> <P> "We were expecting a lot more," Peck said. "We weren't sure what they had. No  one had seen them."  </P> <P> Even with his standouts from last season, San Pedro Coach Tony Dobra conceded,  Peck would have been tough to crack.  </P> <P> "We hadn't seen anything like this in a month and a half," Dobra said. "She  combines physical skills with mental skills and that's hard to beat."  </P> <P> El Camino Real, which amassed eight hits, scored two runs in the first inning.  </P> <P> Cathy Balint came home on an overthrow and Jenny Flemming singled in Alisha  Knopf. Flemming also drove in Ann Antis with a sacrifice fly in a two-run  second.  </P> <P> Peck led off the fifth with a walk, advanced on an error and scored on a single  by designated-hitter Heidi Crocker.  </P> <P> Later in the fifth, Carrie Reulbach scored on Erin McGuire's infield single and  Laurie Bischoff, who walked, came home on a fielder's choice.  </P> <P> San Pedro's lone single -- a chopper by Michelle Harper over first baseman  Flemming -- came with two out in the third.  </P></p>

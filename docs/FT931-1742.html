			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Arts: More embarrassing questions, please - Television Billions of pounds are spent on Aids, television personalities jump eagerly on the bandwagon (did anybody at the BAFTA Awards have the courage to defy the herd and leave the 'Aids awareness ribbon' on the table?) and in the whole of British television, it seems, there is just one woman willing to do a journalist's proper job and keep on asking embarrassing questions. Tonight in Dispatches on Channel 4 Joan Shenton does it again. She visits Africa and dares to throw doubt on the central plank in the religious faith of those who are determined that the disease shall be an equal threat to us all: she asks whether the sub-Saharan 'pandemic' really exists. Her answer is that it probably does not. It seems that many cases of Aids are routinely diagnosed in Africa not from tests in the pathology lab (too costly) but from medical observation. Fever, persistent cough and diarrhoea are enough to get you listed as an Aids victim, though your real trouble may be malaria or TB. Why should medical staff be so casual? Shenton points out that Uganda, for example, can afford to spend less than a dollar a head on annual health care and just Dollars 57,000 a year on malaria prevention while foreign agencies are now pouring in Dollars 6m in Aids funding. Anyone who watches tonight's programme after seeing the recent pair in BBC2's Assignment on malaria and Aids in the far east will surely conclude that we need another Jonathan Swift to illustrate this problem. As well-meaning hysterics in the first world dash from one television studio to another demonstrating how to put a condom on your finger, people in the third world continue to die not in their thousands but in their millions . . . from malaria. There has surely never been a programme on television more ponderous than the BAFTA Awards on BBC1 on Sunday. Why do we need Griff Rhys Jones to introduce Mel Smith to introduce Amanda Donohoe to introduce the winner of the award for Best Supporting Actress? The BBC's own recognition of the ghastliness of these evenings was proved on the previous day by BBC2's screening of the BOFTY (Bore Of The Year) Awards. The trouble is that the real thing is beyond parody; the spoof was itself a pretty tedious occasion. The only interesting awards night this month has been The British Television Advertising Awards on ITV. For an hour Alastair Stewart stood in front of the prize ceremony and introduced interviews with those who make commercials  -Ridley and Tony Scott, for example - and bits of film showing how they do it. The 'how to throw a car out of an aeroplane' routine was wholly engrossing, and the programme was made enjoyable because we were never subjected to the actual presentations. Given that the clips are the real attraction, perhaps that is the answer. ITV's high-class sentimental romance on Mondays, September Song, benefits from much the same trick as Dad's Army. In the comedy, role reversal in the casting created extraordinary strengths: instead of the languid public school type, John le Mesurier, playing the officer while Arthur Lowe, with all the necessary stereotyped characteristics, took the NCO, the tables were turned to wonderful effect. In September Song you might expect professional comedian Russ Abott to play the ageing stand-up comic Billy Balsam while RSC actor Michael Williams played the middle aged school teacher who loses his wife. Once again the reversal has succeeded: Williams turns out to be a splendid stand up comedian and Abbot a highly professional straight actor. It is time the BBC stopped describing Carla Lane's work as 'comedy'. Her idiosyncratic view of life gives great strength to her writing, but since Butterflies in 1978 little of her material - Bread was an exception - has been consistently funny enough to be categorised with such series as Drop The Dead Donkey (which supplied much the best TV awards ceremony of the week) and Red Dwarf as situation comedy. Her new series, Luv, on BBC1 on Tuesdays has, as ever, whimsical situations such as the wife's attempts to get a divorce without telling her husband for fear of offending him, and unusual characters such as Darwin, one of the adopted children, who sleeps all day in order to have his nights free to release rabbits from laboratories. But you would not describe Hamlet as a comedy, despite the inclusion of the gravediggers and some funny lines, and Luv is, once again, closer to situation tragedy. Having taped last week's Without Walls I read the reviews of Camille Paglia's essay on the Princess of Wales, 'Diana Unclothed', before watching it. Judging from those what I had in store was a farrago of psycho-babble and feminist bile. What I actually found was a somewhat chaotic and confusingly gabbled analysis of the princess as photographic icon which, however, included two debatable but fascinating assertions: that she combines motherhood and sexuality in a way that has scarcely been seen since the goddesses of antiquity; and that she has achieved world fame without uttering a single memorable word so that we might regard her as the last of the silent film stars. It is true that Paglia's language can be opaque with jargon (she says 'auto-eroticism' when the context suggests she means eroticism, talks repeatedly of the princess's virginity which seems plain daft, and so on) yet there is a lot of thought behind what she says, much of it original. It seems significant that, once again, it is Channel 4's culture magazine which carried the provocative item. We are told repeatedly that the new director-general, John Birt, intends that the BBC will give more attention to programme quality and distinctiveness. These are admirable aims, but when do we start seeing the evidence on screen? At present we keep on getting new series such as BBC1's Entertainment Express which looks like nothing so much as a television version of the showbiz gossip page from a pop paper, and BBC2's Soundbites in which the pretty presenter introduces snippets of music even shorter than those on Classic FM and then frequently talks across the music, like a DJ on the worst sort of commercial pop network. Surely the intention is not to be distinctively awful? The best parts of Dennis Potter's Lipstick On Your Collar are the set-piece mimes where the stuffy desk wallahs from the War Office lip-synch to some magnificently inappropriate hit from the 1950s such as 'Blue Suede Shoes' or (funniest of the lot so far) 'I See The Moon'. There is so much in this production which is memorable (Roy Hudd's performance as the crazed cinema organist Harold Atterbow) or new (the unknown Louise Germaine in an astonishingly polished performance as the tart/goddess Sylvia) or eerily accurate (the entire fifties' ethos) that it seems unfair to complain. But we have learned to expect a lot from Potter and while this is, of course, better than any other drama on television at present, it does seem uncharacteristically slow, at times even plodding, a word you might have thought would never be applied to Potter. Could it be that he is now so eminent and putting so much detail into his scripts (this one has been published as a Faber paperback, Pounds 8.99) that the power of the director, in this case Renny Rye, is damagingly circumscribed? Take out all the slow-motion activity, cut the running time by about a third, and it would surely be improved.</p>

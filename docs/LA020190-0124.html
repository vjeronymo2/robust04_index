			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON THE REBOUND;  </P> <P> JUNIOR COLLEGE TRANSFER KEVIN CUTLER IS FINDING HIS NICHE WITH 49ERS, AVERAGING  7 REBOUNDS AND 11 POINTS A GAME  </P> <P> The view from the motel room window in Logan, Utah, held snow-covered  mountains, but Kevin Cutler, a Cal State Long Beach basketball player, looked  toward a TV that showed the Flintstones.  </P> <P> "I like cartoons," he said, resting his 6-foot-8, 220-pound frame on a bed.  </P> <P> It was mid-afternoon last Thursday, four hours before the 49ers would play Utah  State.  </P> <P> "I hate the snow with a passion," said Cutler, a 21-year-old junior forward who  grew up in Pomona. "I like shorts and tank tops."  </P> <P> So he was trying to endure the cold first leg of a five-day, two-game trip that  would conclude in San Jose. The 49ers had flown to Salt Lake City late  Wednesday and spent the night there. They rode a bus 84 miles to Logan on  Thursday morning, checked into the motel, then went to the Spectrum for a noon  practice. At 3:30 p.m. they would eat at an Italian restaurant. Then they would  wait to go to the game.  </P> <P> Cutler is adjusting to this regimented life and the tough competition of  Division I basketball after transferring a year ago from Arizona Western  College, where he averaged 17 points and 14 rebounds and was a junior college  all-American.  </P> <P> In his first season with the 49ers, he is leading the team in rebounds with an  average of seven a game, and is second in scoring with an 11-point average.  </P> <P> With his short haircut, thin mustache and powerful-looking upper body, Cutler  resembles a younger, shorter Wilt Chamberlain.  </P> <P> "I always had broad shoulders," Cutler said. "I never worked out (with weights)  till I got to Long Beach. People thought I played football. I couldn't stand  football."  </P> <P> He played football, briefly as a sophomore, at Ganesha High School in Pomona.  </P> <P> "Until I got crunched," he said, laughing. "In practice my teammates blitzed me  and hit me just as I was throwing the ball. I took the pads off and walked off  the field."  </P> <P> Cutler can loom as a man among boys on the court, when he leaps with a long arm  extended to grab a one-handed rebound, or when he rushes to the offensive  backboard to dunk after grabbing a teammate's missed shot. Coaches like to call  these "big-time" plays.  </P> <P> "In junior college, it was kind of easy," said Cutler, who likes to shoot a  soft jumper and a half-hook. "I usually would be going up against a guy 6-6.  Now, every night I have to go out and pick myself up because other teams have  guys who may be taller or a little stronger than me."  </P> <P> He has had to adjust in other ways, too. In junior college, he said there were  no long trips, on which studying was required. "It's strictly business here,"  he said.  </P> <P> After transferring, Cutler went almost a year without playing. When he began  practicing with the team 13 months ago, he was overweight.  </P> <P> "He could hardly make a move inside," Coach Joe Harrington recalled.  </P> <P> An All-CIF player at Ganesha High, Cutler was recruited by Cal State Fullerton  but did not meet the academic requirements under the NCAA's Prop. 48. Now, as a  criminal justice major, he recorded a 3.0 grade-point average last semester, he  said.  </P> <P> He spent two seasons at Arizona Western in Yuma, where he enjoyed celebrity  status.  </P> <P> "It was an older crowd there," Cutler said. "They like basketball, they make  you feel like a professional athlete. They have a TV station in Yuma. To see  yourself on TV a lot made you feel good."  </P> <P> Cutler would like to play in the NBA. "Coach Harrington says I have a chance,"  Cutler said. "But if I don't make it, I won't be committing suicide."  </P> <P> He said he was mistaken for a pro player the day before at the airport. "A guy  came up to me and said, 'Where's Patrick Ewing and the other guys?' I told him  I don't play for the Knicks." The New York Knicks had arrived in Salt Lake City  the same day for a game with the Utah Jazz.  </P> <P> Although he looks menacing on the court, Cutler is pleasant, outgoing and  upbeat off it.  </P> <P> Harrington remembers watching Cutler in a game at Yuma.  </P> <P> "He got the whole crowd fired up, he was running around, slapping hands with  the fans." Harrington said. "He's totally positive. He's serious about being  successful."  </P> <P> Cutler's main problem, however, other than occasionally missing easy shots, has  been a tendency to get in foul trouble. As a result, his playing time has been  curtailed drastically in recent games.  </P> <P> "I don't think I foul," he said. "It's frustrating. All you can be is a  cheerleader when you're sitting on the side."  </P> <P> Seth Greenberg, Harrington's assistant, believes Cutler is called for so many  fouls because of his physical stature and aggressiveness. "His arms are so long  that they create like a visual illusion and the refs (believe) that his blocks  can't be clean," Greenberg said.  </P> <P> Greenberg recruited Cutler at Arizona Western. "He's a perfect example of our  recruiting philosophy," Greenberg said. "We stopped recruiting him and we  befriended him. I think he trusted us."  </P> <P> "He seemed to be interested in me more as a person than just as a player," said  Cutler, who was also recruited by Oklahoma. "He seemed to care more. He  promised my Mom I would graduate. I'll graduate (a year from) May."  </P> <P> Greenberg said he is confident his promise will be fulfilled because: "We put  him in an environment where education is important, where we know his every  move academically."  </P> <P> Tyrone Mitchell, the 49ers' senior guard, has had a big influence on Cutler.  </P> <P> "He's competitive on and off the court, and that's carried over to me," Cutler  said of Mitchell. "I was upset because I had a 3.0 (GPA). I thought I should  have closed the gap more than that."  </P> <P> That night, in a 79-78 Long Beach victory, Cutler got into foul trouble again  and played only 12 minutes. That upset him more than the cold air outside did.  </P> <P> But the next morning, his optimism had returned. He was on the way to San Jose,  where a new game and warmer weather awaited.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Up to Date" newscast] </F>   [Text] Opposition deputies today agreed that the U.S.  Congress' decision to withhold economic aid for El Salvador  Congress is unfair. Congressman John Joseph Moakley announced  that the United States will withhold $20 million of annual aid  to pressure the Salvadoran Government to investigate a sizable  swindle conducted by a domestic bank.    The opposition deputies do not agree with the U.S. Congress'  decision to withhold aid in light of a swindle that took place  in a domestic bank more than six years ago. Jorge Avear of the  PDC [Christian Democratic Party] and Guillermo Guevara of the  MAS [Authentic Christian Movement] agreed that it is regrettable  that a private matter has a bearing on such U.S. decisions,  because this falls outside the purview of foreign policy.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified speaker] What happens in a  bank is clearly a financial matter; it is not related to the  central government's actions. It does not seem logical to me to  say that because this incident took place and has not been  cleared up that economic aid should be suspended. It is not  fair, suitable, or appropriate for an entire nation to be  punished by denying the aid it needs because of a private matter  that, to a great extent, is criminal in nature. [end recording]    The $30 million swindle took place at a domestic bank when  the PDC was in power. In the case, the swindle involved a  number of companies, including some shrimp harvesting companies,  that received credits without giving any guarantees when the  financial system was controlled by the state. This situation  prompted the suspension of U.S. aid to El Salvador, according to  Congressman Moakley. Deputy Juan Jose Martell said this  situation exposes a larger problem.    [Begin recording] [Deputy Juan Jose Martell] [words  indistinct] a problem, $20 million are retained. Our nation's  problem is a banking system that does not operate properly. [end  recording]    In Martell's opinion the swindle places the national  financial system -- which, by the way, he does not consider  reliable -- in a difficult position. According to Martell, this  is not the first time that incidents such as these have taken  place, recalling the fraud committed by [word indistinct]  against the Salvadoran banking system.</p>

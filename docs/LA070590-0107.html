			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON / ON RESTAURANTS: EAST HAPPILY MEETS EAST IN VISTA  </P> <P> Natives of China and Japan will agree that their respective cuisines intersect  at certain points.  </P> <P> Both, for example, like the range of excitement that fresh ginger can bring to  a dish. Both also agree that soy sauce cuts the mustard. And there is  absolutely no question that the Chinese and Japanese not only insist upon the  freshest ingredients, but make them taste as if they were picked or caught just  moments before cooking.  </P> <P> So much for similarities. The cuisines are enormously divergent, partly because  the Japanese willingly adopt Western influences (their tempura batter-fried  foods are of Portuguese origin, and their mayonnaise-based dressings borrowed  from modern America), while the Chinese have such an enormous repertoire of  recipes that the French, by comparison, seem remarkably narrow in their tastes.  </P> <P> A Vista restaurant called Mandarin Shogun offers a menu of both Japanese and  Chinese dishes, but the alliance seems one of convenience since the sushi bar  is what dominates the dining room. The page of kung pao, Szechwan and  sweet-and-sour items at the end of the menu seems to be a mannered alternative  to the teriyakis, tempuras and sukiyakis.  </P> <P> The sole hybrid dish is an appetizer, called pork dumplings, that finishes the  Japanese gyoza pastries with the hearty, appetizing fried crust associated with  Chinese pot-stickers. Served with a decidedly Japanese sauce of soy garnished  with snippets of scallion, these make a much better starter than the indelicate  tempura (vegetables and bananas cut in oversized pieces) and the age dashi  tofu. These hunks of fried tofu that trail streamers of batter coating, were  immersed in a soy-scallion sauce of some merit but tasted unpleasantly of  over-used cooking oil.  </P> <P> The lengthy Japanese entree list hits many high spots, and some offerings are  quite good. One exception was the beef sukiyaki, perforce a signature dish at  most Japanese houses, but here a lackluster bowl of dry, crumbly beef and tired  vegetables in a sauce that lacked the sweetness and robust appeal of the usual  sukiyaki. The guest who ordered it turned her attention to the rice and salad  after taking a third tentative taste of the pallid preparation.  </P> <P> The chicken teriyaki, served in great abundance, was a far happier expression  of the kitchen's talents and featured truly tender chicken brushed with the  classically sticky-sweet, deeply flavorful sauce. The meat was diced rather  than served whole, which is the more usual method. But this departure made the  teriyaki even more agreeable.  </P> <P> The one outstanding entree sampled, the ginger pork, was immersed in a fiercely  sweet, richly soy-flavored sauce that by rights should have been the basis of  the sukiyaki dish. Basically a stew, the entree differed markedly from those  commonly encountered on Japanese menus and was a delight to the bottom of the  bowl. The shreds of pork were joined by tender onion and zucchini rounds in a  broth finely flavored with fresh ginger.  </P> <P> All entrees, including those from the Chinese list, are accompanied by soup  (the Japanese miso is typical, tofu-enriched and tasty); sticky rice and  lettuce in a heavy dressing of seasoned mayonnaise. Other Japanese entree  choices include tonkatsu (deep-fried pork cutlet); sesame chicken; shrimp,  scallop and chicken tempuras; swordfish teriyaki; the soup-stew of many  ingredients called yosenabe and a long list of fish choices ranging from  Canadian salmon to Utah trout to Mississippi catfish (these three, perhaps as a  sign of the times, all are farm-raised).  </P> <P> MANDARIN SHOGUN  </P> <P> 600 E. Vista Way, Vista  </P> <P> Calls: 758-8288  </P> <P> Hours: Lunch and dinner served daily Monday through Saturday, closed Sunday.  </P> <P> Cost: Dinner for two, including a glass of wine each, tax and tip, $25 to $40.  Credit cards accepted.  </P></p>

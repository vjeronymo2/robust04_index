			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / MoD secures cost cuts in multinational arms project BRITAIN has negotiated changes in a joint project with France and Germany for a new anti-tank weapon fired by helicopters after objecting to the cost of UK participation. The decision to remain in the long-range Trigat project was announced by Mr Kenneth Carlisle, junior defence minister, and greeted with relief by British Aerospace, the main UK partner. It came a week after the company's Dynamics guided-weapons division secured a crucial Pounds 570m order to supply a new air-combat missile for the RAF. Mr David Laybourn, the division's managing director, said Trigat promised to provide 'major production opportunities' in the mid 1990s. The Ministry of Defence said details of the agreement were confidential, but savings had been achieved by cutting test firings by using more simulation. Almost two thirds of the estimated Pounds 750m development cost has been committed. The new plan is expected to reduce the cost to the UK of carrying out the remaining development work by about half to Pounds 45m over the next five years. The decision maintains intact a three-nation programme agreed in 1988 covering both this long-range weapon and a medium-range weapon carried either by troops or on vehicles. Each partner undertook a third of the work. It is the only collaborative weapon development programme involving the UK with both the French and Germans. UK withdrawal from the longer-range weapon was mooted a year ago by Sir Peter Levene, then chief of defence procurement. He also proposed that the UK and France should pursue the medium-range weapon on their own, but this was flatly rejected by Paris and Bonn. An option is being retained to mount the longer-range weapon on special vehicles with folding masts, but priority is being given to the helicopter role. France and Germany intend to use the Trigat weapon on their new Tiger attack helicopter. This craft may interest the British Army, but it will have to compete against the US Apache helicopter proposed by the pairing of McDonnell Douglas of the US and Westland of the UK. BAe has reached preliminary agreement to act as prime contractor for the Tiger bid.</p>

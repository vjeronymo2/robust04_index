			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anatoliy Polyakov in Kiev and Vladimir Pasyakin </F> in Sevastopol: "Crimean Knot: Should It Be Cut or  Untied?--Nationalists in Ukrainian Parliament Demand That  Additional Troops Be Sent to Crimea"]    [Text] All last week the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet heatedly  debated the situation on the peninsula. President Leonid  Kravchuk, who spoke first, proposed the appointment of a  Constitutional Court that would issue a ruling on the Crimean  Supreme Soviet's last law. Kravchuk pointed out that he himself  does not have the right to rescind the Crimean parliament's  decision, that he has such a prerogative only with respect to  decrees issued by Yuriy Meshkov.    At the same time, he emphasized that "Russia will never give  up its influence in the Crimea, just as the Russian population,  which makes up a majority on the peninsula, will never give up  close relations with Russia." "We realize," the president  continued, "that Russia has no realistic alternatives to basing  the Black Sea Fleet and must secure its southern borders. We  must divide basing zones between the Ukrainian and Russian  fleets, establish temporary leasing terms, and at the same time  uphold the principle that the Russian Fleet must eventually be  based on its own territory."    National-democratic deputies, without bothering to analyze  the factors that have led to the current situation in the  Crimea, blamed everything on Russia. They demanded that the  Crimean knot be cut in the following way: make power-wielding  structures subordinate to Kiev and remove the Black Sea Fleet  from Ukrainian territory by January 1, 1995. Deputies  representing the Ukrainian National Assembly-UNSO [Ukrainian  People's Self-Defense Forces] demanded that the Crimean Supreme  Soviet be dissolved immediately and that additional troops be  sent there to "protect the population from extremists. Although,  we should point out, leftist deputies reminded the "loggers" (as  one deputy referred to his more zealous colleagues) that at  stake is the fate of thousands of people, and that politicians  just don't go swinging axes. Deputy Mikhail Doroshevskiy  stressed that he knows of plans for a forcible change of power  in Crimea, as he had seen documents in the working presidium  confirming this.    Many deputies believe that some of the causes of the current  flare-up of tension in and around Crimea are the imposition of  ideological stereotypes of a nationalist slant, a  self-isolationist policy on the part of the Ukrainian  leadership, and ill-considered decisions on borders that have  divided the Slavic peoples.    A decision which was adopted states that it is essential to  submit proposals on bringing current Crimean legislation into  conformity with the Ukrainian Constitution within two weeks. The  Crimean Supreme Soviet is ordered to adopt a decision to the  effect that Crimean legislation must conform to the Ukrainian  Constitution within 30 days. Leonid Kravchuk is instructed to  propose a list of actions he will take to normalize the  situation in Crimea within six days. A Ukrainian parliamentary  delegation led by Boris Oleynik left for Crimea on Thursday  morning. That same day, as was to be expected, Leonid Kravchuk  proposed that parliament postpone the presidential election to a  later date.    The situation with respect to dividing the Black Sea is  developing in an interesting way, in our opinion. At a press  conference in Kiev on Wednesday, Ukrainian Defense Minister  Vitaliy Radetskiy said that where the Ukrainian Navy will be  based is Ukraine's internal affair and is not subject to  discussion. The Crimean problem, he said, should be solved  through dialogue. "We are taking Russia's interests into account  with respect to its southern flank, but it is not taking our  interests into account and allowing itself to engage in  unilateral pressure," the minister said.    Meanwhile, negotiations on dividing the Black Sea Fleet are  under way in Sevastopol, albeit behind closed doors and in the  absence of the delegation chiefs--Russian Special Ambassador  Yuriy Dubinin and Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy  Shmirov. This has significantly lowered the talks' level, but it  is a logical move: The military experts are at work. But we have  learned from a well-informed source of an agreement to divide  the ships 50-50, after which Ukraine would sell an agreed-upon  number of ships to Russia.</p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Ukraine to end credit guarantees from July THE Ukrainian National Bank plans from July 1 to end government guarantees on enterprises' payments from creditors, in a major step forward in piecemeal efforts at market reform. The move, which is scheduled to coincide with Ukraine's new law on bankruptcy, is backed by parliament. It comes as part of an effort being made by Mr Vadim Hetman, the tough new head of the Ukrainian National Bank, to end a practice which has allowed Ukrainian enterprises to rack up a Rouble546bn internal debt. Under the current system, when purchasers do not pay, sellers are compensated with credit issued by the National Bank. Moreover, according to Mr Hetman, Russian enterprises have amassed a one trillion-rouble debt to Ukrainian enterprises, although other government officials concede that the size of the debt between Ukraine and Russia depends on whether it is calculated in 1991 or 1992 prices. At the most recent meeting of the leaders of the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, Ukraine pressed for an assessment and settlement of inter-republican enterprise debt, but the proposal was rebuffed by Russia. Mr Hetman said that debts between Ukrainian enterprises and debts between Ukraine and all CIS republics, with the exception of Russia, will be calculated at a meeting on June 11 and 12.</p>

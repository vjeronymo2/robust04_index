			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Morning after awaits the drinks market: FT reporters investigate who will bear the brunt of the price effects of devaluation in five sectors that affect the retail prices index. Will it be retailers, consumers, UK manufacturers or suppliers abroad? IT'S not the low pound which has dampened the spirits of drinkers and partygoers. The price effects have hardly filtered through. Thanks to the recession volumes are under pressure and competition is intense. Producers, shippers and retailers have tried to absorb the extra costs rather than raise prices. Champagne sales recovered slightly last year after a 34 per cent fall in 1991 and champagne houses, facing increased competition from manufacturers of cheaper sparkling wine, are keen to protect themselves in their biggest export market. Mr Nicholas Strachan, marketing director of Mentzendorff, the wine shippers, says a 15 per cent reduction in the cost of grapes last year has enabled Bollinger to avoid raising prices so far. 'However, prices have been largely unchanged for two years, and I think it is unlikely they can be maintained through the second half of this year.' Moet &amp; Chandon has raised prices by 6 per cent, and others are expected to follow. 'But I do not expect anyone to try to recoup the entire cost of devaluation,' says one shipper. 'It's difficult enough to sell champagne at the moment.' Prices of most French and German wines rose by between 5 per cent and and 10 per cent soon after the sterling depreciation last September. Ms Jayne Bridges of the Threshers off-licence chain says: 'When Britain joined the ERM we stopped buying foreign currency forward-payment. As a result, we were caught without cover last September when the pound was devalued while about 100,000 cases were being shipped to us. 'We have absorbed some costs and a few suppliers and agents have done the same. But most of our producers are just too small to do so. The further depreciation of the pound is adding to the strain.' French and German wines have been losing sales to products from Australia and New Zealand, California and South Africa. But abundant harvests in 1992 had been expected to ensure more competitive prices this year. 'Devaluation has hit the industry hard,' said Ms Tan Harrington, of the German Wine Bureau. 'The pressure is to keep prices down, but something may have to give.'</p>

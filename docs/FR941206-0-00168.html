			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Inspection and Monitoring <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The subpart CC standards provide exemptions from inspection and monitoring for specific circumstances defined in the rule. In the case of an underground tank, only those portions of the tank cover and those connections to the tank cover or tank body (e.g., fill ports, access hatches, gauge wells, etc.) that extend to or above the ground surface and can be opened to the atmosphere must be inspected and monitored. Leak monitoring using Method 21 in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, is not required for the following: (1) Drums that meet applicable DOT regulations specified in the rule; (2) tank trucks and tank railcars that are annually demonstrated to be vapor-tight by Method 27 in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A; and (3) closed-vent systems and control devices operated in vacuum service (i.e., equipment that is operated at an internal pressure that is at least 5 kPa below ambient pressure) or closed-vent system connections that are permanently or semi-permanently sealed (e.g., a welded joint between two sections of metal pipe or a bolted and gasketed pipe flange). Also, semiannual leak monitoring is not required for a cover opening that has continuously remained in the closed, sealed position for the entire period since the cover opening was last monitored. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure that emission control equipment is properly operated and maintained, the subpart CC standards require the TSDF owner or operator to visually inspect certain emission control equipment items semiannually. For example, emission control equipment covers on tanks are to be checked semiannually by facility employees to ensure that equipment is being used properly (e.g., covers are closed and latched except when an opening must be used to add, remove, inspect, or sample the waste in the tank or to inspect, maintain, replace, or repair equipment located inside the tank or to vent gases or vapors from the tank) and the equipment is being maintained in good condition (e.g., no visible holes, gaps, tears, or splits have developed in covers). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Continuous monitoring of control device operation is required under the subpart CC standards. This involves the use of automated instrumentation to measure critical operating parameters that indicate whether the control device is operating correctly or is malfunctioning. Semiannual leak detection monitoring using Method 21 under 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, is required for certain cover components to ensure gaskets and seals are in good condition and for closed-vent systems to ensure all fittings remain leak-tight. In addition, with the previously noted exception of permanently or semi-permanently sealed connections, each closed-vent system must be monitored for leaks using Method 21 at least once per year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Special inspection and monitoring provisions are included in the final subpart CC standards for cover fittings that are unsafe or difficult for facility personnel to inspect and monitor. A TSDF owner or operator may designate a cover fitting as ``unsafe to inspect and monitor'' if a worker would be exposed to dangerous, hazardous, or other unsafe conditions when performing the inspection or monitoring. A cover fitting that is designated as unsafe must be inspected and monitored as frequently as practicable during those times when it is safe to inspect and monitor the fitting. Similarly, a cover may be designated as ``difficult to inspect and monitor'' if in so doing a worker would be elevated to a height more than 2 meters above a support surface and the cover was installed before June 5, 1995. A cover fitting that is designated as difficult must be monitored and inspected at least once per calendar year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The subpart CC standards require that the TSDF owner or operator repair a cover fitting found to be leaking within 15 days of detection. Repair of control equipment on a tank or surface impoundment may be delayed beyond 15 calendar days under certain circumstances. To delay repair, the owner or operator must document that the repair cannot be completed without emptying the contents of the unit and also that removing the unit from service would result in the unscheduled cessation of production from the process unit or operation of the waste management unit that is generating the hazardous waste. Repair of this control equipment must be completed the next time the process unit or waste management unit that is generating the hazardous waste managed in the tank or surface impoundment is shut down. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Recordkeeping Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final subpart CC standards require the TSDF owner or operator to record certain information in the on-site facility operating logs or files. This information is to be readily available for review by authorized representatives of the EPA. Consistent with 40 CFR 264.73 and 40 CFR 265.73, the rule requires that air emission control equipment design records and certain other records be maintained in the facility operating record until facility closure. Records and results of waste determinations, inspections, and monitoring are required to be kept for at least 3 years from the date of entry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

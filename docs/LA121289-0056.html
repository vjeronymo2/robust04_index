			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAIWAN GAINS FOOTHOLD IN U.S. COMPUTER FIELD WITH PURCHASE OF WYSE;  </P> <P> TECHNOLOGY: THE $262-MILLION DEAL IS TAIWAN'S LARGEST IN A GROWING STRING OF  U.S. ACQUISITIONS.  </P> <P> A Taiwanese government-business investment group said Monday it has agreed to  buy personal computer supplier Wyse Technology in the latest and most dramatic  indication of that island nation's growing acquisitions in the United States.  </P> <P> The deal, valued by Wyse at more than $262 million, will represent Taiwan's  largest purchase of a U.S. company and its first acquisition of a publicly  traded American firm.  </P> <P> The agreement calls for Channel International Corp. to pay $10 per share for  Wyse, an 8-year-old company best known for its personal computer screens. The  deal with Channel, an investment group created specifically to acquire Wyse,  had been expected for more than a month.  </P> <P> Although San Jose-based Wyse, whose most recent annual sales were $452 million,  has run into considerable troubles and a fair share of red ink over the last  year, the company offers its Taiwanese buyers a much sought after brand-name  position in the U.S. personal computer market, including a nearly 50% share of  the U.S. market for PC terminal screens.  </P> <P> "This is a tremendous business opportunity for us," said Nelson Chang,  Channel's chairman. "Wyse has a very well-known name and a solid distribution  channel for its products. It should give us a strong entry into the U.S.  market."  </P> <P> The purchase, subject to approval by the Taiwanese government as well as  potential review by the U.S. government, is expected to be completed within the  next several months. The deal is expected to provide Wyse with a much needed  capital infusion to help it overcome its problems, which stem largely from its  late entry into the PC clone business.  </P> <P> The deal is perhaps the best illustration to date of the accelerating push by  the Republic of China on Taiwan to acquire what it considers to be  strategically important U.S. businesses with its growing foreign currency  reserves of $75 billion, the second largest in the world.  </P> <P> Although their investments have spanned the spectrum from textile plants to  savings and loans, the Taiwanese say they are most interested in buying stakes  in U.S. high technology companies and retail and wholesale distribution  operations.  </P> <P> The overall goal, Taiwan trade representatives say, is to modernize  manufacturing on the island to produce goods that will command higher prices  worldwide and to better penetrate the U.S. consumer market, the world's most  prosperous.  </P> <P> "Taiwanese companies want to be aware of the most advanced technology and learn  marketing so we can speed up manufacturing advances at home," explained Eric  Hwang, a marketing specialist with the Institute for Information Industry, a  Taiwanese business- and government-supported research institute with offices in  the Silicon Valley and Washington.  </P> <P> "And we need to learn how to sell in the United States so we can get closer to  the customers of our products," Hwang added.  </P> <P> Hwang said one of the best examples of his country's investment strategy is the  $20-million purchase earlier this year of Pactel Co., a small telephone and  electronics retail chain in the San Francisco area.  </P> <P> The buyer, Great Electronics, makes facsimile machines, telephones, personal  computers and a variety of other electronic gear sold in Pactel outlets. Great  Electronics had been looking for a way to bring its products to the attention  of the U.S. market.  </P> <P> "So they bought the channel to sell their existing products and for any other  products they want to sell in this country," Hwang explained.  </P> <P> The Wyse purchase represents a similar opportunity. Wyse is a recognized brand  name, both in PC terminals and IBM-compatible personal computers, and  distributes its products through such established retail chains as  Businessland. Channel officials said Monday that they intend to maintain Wyse's  headquarters, marketing and related operations in San Jose, and they do not  plan any changes in the existing product line.  </P> <P> The members of Channel International are China Trust Group, a privately held  entity whose principal operations include China Trust Corp. and Taiwan Cement;  the Development Fund, a Taiwanese government investment arm; Mitac Group, a  personal computer maker, and USI Far East Corp. The Development Fund's stake in  Channel will be 20%.  </P> <P> The Channel-Wyse deal alone exceeds the total that Taiwanese companies have  invested in the United States in recent years. According to market researchers,  Taiwanese companies, with the blessing of their government, invested nearly  $250 million in U.S. businesses from 1986 through 1988, either acquiring them  outright or buying minority stakes.  </P> <P> According to research analysts, cumulative direct Taiwanese investment in the  U.S. companies (with an ownership level officially defined as a minimum of 10%  of a target company's voting shares) was at least $330 million as of the end of  last year, the last available date for which figures are available. In  addition, the Treasury Department reports that Taiwanese citizens and  corporations hold another $27.1 billion worth of all types of U.S. securities.  </P> <P> In all, analysts and trade representatives estimate, total Taiwanese investment  in the United States exceeds $30 billion, including real estate holdings.  </P> <P> Although this total pales in comparison to the holdings of the British and  Japanese -- the two largest foreign investors in the United States -- analysts  say the Taiwanese are among the fastest-growing investors in this country and  are likely to accelerate their buying spree, particularly because the Taiwanese  have recently relaxed their foreign investment rules.  </P> <P> "Taiwan is becoming a real player in our economic life," said Linda Spencer, a  policy analyst with TRW Inc. in Reston, Va., and author of "American Assets," a  study of foreign investment in the United States. "It looks like they've made a  real commitment to this country. And as their economy strengthens, they will  have more money to invest here."  </P> <P> However, Daniel Heiler, an analyst at the San Jose market research firm of  Dataquest, said the rising Taiwanese investment rates could set off a backlash  among American industry leaders, as have continuing investment moves by the  Japanese.  </P> <P> Heiler said the rising cost of manufacturing on the island is forcing the  Taiwanese to open factories in other Asian countries with lower labor costs and  to acquire technology that will reduce production costs and speed the  transportation of goods to consumer markets. In addition, he said, Taiwanese  manufacturers would like to circumvent existing trade barriers to the U.S.  market, particularly those on textile products, and to avoid potential new  restrictions on other products.  </P> <P> Further, Heiler said, Taiwanese companies are looking to develop market  strategies that will allow them to offer brand-name products that emphasize  quality rather than price, as has been the case.  </P> <P> Analysts said the Wyse deal, although in the prized high-technology sector,  stands out for two reasons: its size and the fact that the investors purchased  the entire company rather than a minority share.  </P> <P> Typically, analysts said, Taiwanese investors have preferred to sprinkle their  money around in a variety of companies in the hopes of gaining the most  information about a variety of U.S. businesses.  </P> <P> But the more familiar the Taiwanese have become with the American economy, the  more they have been willing to invest.  </P> <P> For example, Acer, a Taiwanese manufacturer of low-cost personal computers,  spent just $4.4 million for Counterpoint Computers, a small start-up it  purchased in 1987. But more recent deals, such as Continental Engineering's  acquisition of American Bridge, a former USX Corp. subsidiary in Pittsburgh,  for as much as $100 million, have demonstrated Taiwan's increasing interest in  U.S. businesses.  </P> <P> At the same time, Taiwanese trade representatives say, their government has  been trying to discourage their citizens and corporations from buying U.S. real  estate, traditionally one of the most attractive American investments for  foreigners.  </P> <P> "When we invest, we want to learn something," said Eric Chiang, a spokesman for  the Taiwanese government's Coordination Council for North American Affairs, the  equivalent of a general consulate. "Real estate just involves capital; we want  to learn manufacturing and marketing techniques from the United States. And the  way to do that is to get involved in their businesses."  </P> <P> </P> <P> TAIWAN'S GROWING INVESTMENTS  </P> <P> A sampling of U.S. firms wholly acquired by Taiwanese investors  </P> <TABLE CWL="6.07IN:2.66IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Purchase price  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> U.S. company  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> (in millions)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Wyse Technology (computers)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> more than $262  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> (pending)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> American Bridge (construction)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $70-$100  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Eight Texas S&amp;Ls  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $37.5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> National Bank of Detroit  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $21.2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Pactel Co.

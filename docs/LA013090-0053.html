			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE DIVISION: UC RIVERSIDE HAS TALENT BUT NEEDS TO AVOID INJURIES  </P> <P> The UC Riverside baseball team started last season as one of the favorites to  win the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. championship.  </P> <P> A series of injuries, which resulted in nine players missing 10 or more games,  squelched the title hopes of the Highlanders, who finished with a 24-26-1  record.  </P> <P> If the Highlanders stay injury-free, they may make up for 1989.  </P> <P> Riverside is led by outfielders Scott Einhorn and Pete Weber and infielders  Matt Davis, Logan Ostrander and Ty Murphy, who batted .338.  </P> <P> Pitchers Bill Jordan and Doug Pierce also return.  </P> <P> It may be too much to ask Cal Poly San Luis Obispo to repeat its remarkable  success of last season, when the Mustangs won their first NCAA Division II  national championship and finished with a 38-25 record. But with five top  offensive players returning, the Mustangs are still among the CCAA contenders.  Leading the way are All-Division II West Region selections Doug Noce at catcher  and Pat Kirby at first base. Another top hitter is third baseman Matt Drake.  </P> <P> In its final year in the CCAA and Division II before moving up to Division I  next season, Cal State Northridge appears ready for one last bid at a  conference title. The Matadors, who were 30-19-1 last year and barely missed a  playoff berth, are led by sophomores Mike Solar at shortstop, Greg Shockney in  center field and Denny Vigo at third base.  </P> <P> Northridge's pitching staff revolves around Craig Clayton and Scott Sharts, a  transfer from Miami.  </P> <P> There will be several new faces in the starting lineup for Cal Poly Pomona,  which finished with a 24-28 record last season, but Coach John Scolinos is  returning for his 42nd season. The Broncos, second in the CCAA last season,  will build around the pitching of seniors Wayne Koklys and Bret Lachemann.  </P> <P> With a surplus of newcomers on his team's roster, Coach Mike Weathers is hoping  Chapman will bear little resemblance to the team that finished 24-28 last  season. A key will be the development of catcher Mike Kelly, first baseman Doug  Yates and shortstop Mark Landeros -- all junior college transfers. The top  returning players are infielders Chris Cutliff and Tom Allison, pitcher Pete  Coleman and outfielder Jody Garcia.  </P> <P> Cal State Dominguez Hills expects improvement from a 16-29-1 season. The Toros  are led by outfielders Robert Campbell and Marty Williams, and have good  pitching prospects in newcomers Vincent Aguilar and Armando Placencia.  </P> <P> Cal State Los Angeles, after posting a 23-31-1 mark last season, should be  competitive in a difficult conference. The Golden Eagles have solid pitchers in  Abdom Pinon and Steve McGovern, plus shortstop Brent Bish and catcher Marty  Tourville.  </P> <P> After a 20-year wait and consecutive second-place finishes, Westmont finally  won an NAIA District 3 title last season. It does not figure to take the  Warriors as long to win their next championship.  </P> <P> The Warriors, who finished 34-16 and won 26 of their last 30 games in 1989, are  led by first baseman Tim Viohl and shortstop Tim Kimmel. Viohl had nine home  runs and 48 runs batted in, and Kimmel had a .335 batting average in his fourth  year as a starter. Pitcher Rich Ebarb was 4-1 with a 3.31 ERA.  </P> <P> Azusa Pacific, which finished second to Westmont last year at 30-20, has first  baseman Carlos Salazar, outfielder Tim Norman and second baseman Tim Williams.  Salazar had 12 homers and 50 RBI last season. The pitching staff is topped by  Fred Whatley and Jose Gallardo.  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran finished 31-18 last season -- best record in the school's history.  The Kingsmen have five starting pitchers returning, including Mike Clark and  Kevin O'Neill. The lineup includes all-district infielder Jeff Brouelette and  outfielder Darnell Mitchell.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most improved team in the district is Cal Baptist, which returns  all of its starters from a team that was 25-25 last season. The Lancers should  have an explosive offense, led by NAIA All-American outfielder Tim Lopez, who  batted .368 with 15 homers and 67 RBI last season, and all-district players  Darin Burton at third base and DH Greg Chizek.  </P> <P> Southern California College, 30-21 last year, is led by pitcher Jim Dedrick and  has an outstanding transfer in Ralph Garcia. The Vanguards also return two  all-district players -- third baseman Alex Andrade and catcher Denny Berni, a  .400 hitter last season.  </P> <P> Biola has one of the top pitchers in the Southland, Tim Worrell, whose brother  plays for the St. Louis Cardinals. Worrell was 9-5 with a 3.48 ERA last season  and had 110 strikeouts in 93 innings. The Eagles, 20-27-1 last season, will  also rely on Brett Carter to form a solid one-two pitching combination. Leading  the attack are first baseman Bob Keller and shortstop Fred Speck, who batted  .371 last season.  </P> <P> There are signs of improvement for The Master's, which suffered through a 15-32  season. The Mustangs have good offensive personnel, including shortstop Mark  MacArthur, first baseman Jeff Preston and third baseman Russ Henzie. Pitching  is a major concern.  </P> <P> La Verne appears to be stronger than last season, when the Leopards won the  Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference title and finished  20-20 overall. La Verne has reliable starters in Matt Solters and Paul Janssen  and catcher Ben Cordova.  </P> <P> Claremont-Mudd-Scripps was 24-14 last season -- best overall mark in the SCIAC  -- and should produce plenty of offense with the return of shortstop Paul  Urrutia, center fielder Marc Sherman, first baseman Andy Sallee and catcher  Greg Ratkovic. The Stags have a solid pitcher back in Pete Young.  </P> <P> Redlands finished third in the SCIAC at 12-6, and 19-18 overall. The Bulldogs  are solid offensively with first baseman Rick Bennett, center fielder Scott  Begg and infielders Jeff Sofro and Bobby Windver. The pitching includes Wade  Rockwood and Keith Perry.  </P> <P> Occidental, 22-17 in '89, is led by brothers Tom and Mike Bonetto in the  infield -- both All-SCIAC selections last year -- and shortstop Mark Harris and  catcher Mike Kniseley. All-conference pitcher Dave Stoll was 8-3 with a 3.39  ERA.  </P> <P> Whittier has 11 freshmen, including shortstop Louis Benbow, pitcher David  Berliner and outfielder Cody Nelson. Returning for the Poets, 10-27-2 last  season, are catcher Todd Fujimori, outfielder Alika Kauleinamoku and pitcher  Scott Gill.  </P> <P> Pomona Pitzer will be searching for respectability in its first year under Jim  Barker after finishing 11-23 overall last season. The Sagehens have outfielder  Gregg Silver, second baseman Steve Fenton and All-SCIAC pitcher Chris Nelson.  </P> <P> Cal State San Bernardino, an NCAA Division III independent, was 28-8-1 last  season. Pitchers returning are Joe Glasscock and Darren Kay, 7-2 with a 3.46  ERA last year. Paul Gonzalez batted .336.  </P></p>

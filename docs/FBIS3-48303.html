"Looking at the relationship between President (Boris)  Yeltsin and the Russian Parliament, we cannot expect rapid  progress on the northern territories issue," said Issei Nomura,  director general of the ministry's European and Oceanian Affairs  Bureau, in a speech at a Sapporo Hotel. Nomura was apparently  referring to Yeltsin's troubles with anti-reform  ultranationalists who won big in last month's parliamentary  elections.    The Ultranationalists strongly oppose Japan's demand that  Russia transfer to its sovereignty the four islands, which were  seized by Soviet Forces at the end of World War II. Japan calls  the Islands -- Kunashiri, Etorofu, Shikotan and the Habomai  group -- its northern territories, while Russia refers to them  as the South Kurils.    Nomura said that in the absence of an atmosphere conducive  to  major progress, Japan and Russia should work to improve their  relations on the basis of the Tokyo declaration signed during  Yeltsin's visit to Japan last October. He said the two  countries should also further promote exchanges of visits  between Russian residents of the disputed islands and Japanese  from Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost main island.    The exchanges, which have taken place over the past two  years, are aimed at increasing mutual understanding between the  two sides and conditioning Russian residents in advance of a  future territorial settlement.</p>

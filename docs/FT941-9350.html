			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: Endesa lifts profits by 9.9% to Pta116bn Spain's largest utility, Endesa, the partially privatised state-controlled electricity distributor and generator, lifted consolidated net profit in 1993 by 9.9 per cent to Pta116.8bn (Dollars 819m). This was despite slack domestic demand and a drought-induced fall in hydraulic production which forced a switch to more costly coal-fired operations. The results, which brought earnings per share up to Pta449.3 from Pta408.8, were marginally ahead of forecasts. They are likely to raise expectations that INI, the state holding company which owns 75 per cent of the utility, will further reduce its equity through an international share offer. Endesa said it owed its profitability last year to lower overall debt - long-term debts fell sharply by 24 per cent while short-term borrowings increased by 16 per cent - to falling interest rates and the devalued peseta, and to internal cost controls. These compensated for a modest 0.8 per cent increase in energy sales to electricity distributors and an increase of 1.8 per cent in direct sales to consumers and for a 5.1 increase in operating costs. Consolidated revenue rose by 4.7 per cent to Pta752.5bn. The company, which has a 2 per cent stake in Germany's RWE and owns 7 per cent of the Venezuelan utility, Electricidad de Caracas, has been an active buyer of equity in private Spanish utilities. The aim is to boost its distribution network ahead of the formal deregulation of the domestic electricity sector. Endesa is understood to be negotiating the sale of 6 per cent of its equity to RWE and to the UK's National Power and the placement of a further 4 per cent among institutional investors. Following a 1988 partial privatisation, 23 per cent of the utility is listed on the markets and, since 1992, some 10 per cent of the free float is in the form of ADS on the New York stock exchange.</p>

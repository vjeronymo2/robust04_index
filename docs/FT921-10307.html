			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / International Company News: Miniscribe bondholders win Dollars 550m in damages A TEXAS jury has awarded more than Dollars 550m in damages to former bondholders of Miniscribe, the now defunct disk drive manufacturer. The investors had accused Miniscribe's former chairman, as well as its accounting firm and investment bankers, of fraud. The defendants were found guilty of fraud and negligence and ordered to pay punitive damages. The suit was filed by Kemper Management, representing investors who had bought about Dollars 20m in Miniscribe bonds. Mr Q. T. Wiles, chairman of Miniscribe during the period of the alleged fraud, was ordered to pay Dollars 250m. Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the international accounting firm, was ordered to pay an additional Dollars 200m; damages against Hambrecht &amp; Quist, the San Francisco investment banking group of which Mr Wiles is a former vice chairman, were assessed at Dollars 45m. Mr William Hambrecht, chairman of Hambrecht &amp; Quist, was ordered to pay Dollars 35m. All the defendants said they would appeal against the verdict and damages award. The judge has given them until next week to file arguments before he approves or revises the jury's award. The judgment is the first in connection with several pending lawsuits which followed the bankruptcy of Miniscribe in 1990.</p>

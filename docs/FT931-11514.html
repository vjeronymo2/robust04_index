			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / EC warns of action to counter US trade threats THE European Community warned yesterday that it would take 'whatever action is necessary' to counter US threats to bar EC companies from government contracts. As Community trade ministers warned the Clinton administration against sliding towards protectionism, they confirmed they had discussed retaliation in Brussels, but had decided against immediate action. Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, Danish foreign minister and current president of the EC Council of Ministers, said: 'We decided that this was not the time. It is time now to tell the Americans they are on the wrong track.' Every EC member state was concerned about 'the uncertainty of the trade direction of the new Clinton administration', he added. At the same time the US signalled it intended putting its concern about free trade and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade behind its determination to ensure what it sees as fair play for its companies. 'We do not want to close our procurement market, but we must insist that our major trading partners show an equivalent commitment to open and nondiscriminatory procurement policies,' said Mr Mickey Kantor, the new US trade representative. The EC trade ministers also denounced as 'unacceptable' Washington's imposition last week of heavy anti-dumping duties on EC steel. Mr Petersen dismissed suggestions that Monday's US threat to freeze EC companies out of American federal contracts was simply the bureaucratic outcome of a move set in train by the Bush administration. 'This is not just some minor trade dispute,' he added. 'What we are talking about is absolutely the wrong signal for the world economy.' But President Bill Clinton, who has been forced to backtrack on a number of his election campaign pledges, appears intent on fulfilling promises to open foreign markets to US exports and enforce US trade laws. Mr Kantor recently told the Senate finance committee: 'The days when we could afford to subordinate our economic interests to foreign policy or defence concerns are long past.' Sir Leon Brittan, EC external economic relations commissioner, said he would be meeting Mr Kantor in Washington on February 11 'reassured and reinforced' by the uniform view of the EC. 'The only possible solution to such questions is a negotiated one, which is fair and balanced,' Sir Leon said. The Community 'will not allow itself to be bullied'. Ministers and senior officials said the EC would act multilaterally through the disputes procedures of Gatt, as well as through bilateral negotiations with the US.

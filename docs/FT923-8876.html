			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Mortgage lenders put caution first - Sally Hamilton discovers there are several types of property on which loans will not be made at all FIFTEEN years ago, the path to getting a mortgage on your home was strewn with obstacles. Most lenders operated a 'red-lining' policy. This meant they took a map of the country and circled undesirable towns or types of property with a red pen. The 1980s' property boom as good as eradicated red-lining, replacing caution with a credit free-for-all. The drop in the housing market has not seen a return of the red pen but lending is growing more prudent. The spiralling number of repossessions has reinforced the trend as lenders fear being lumbered with unmarketable assets. All mortgage lenders, whether building societies, banks or centralised lenders, assert that they will look at each property earmarked by a buyer 'on its own merits.' Yet, many have a hit-list of categories which could mean a blanket refusal on lending. The country's biggest mortgage lenders, the Abbey National and the Halifax, claim to maintain a flexible lending policy. Yet, they admit that market forces have made them more careful. 'We are more liberal than most but we won't accept any old rubbish,' says John Cox, group chief surveyor of Abbey National. 'Properties acceptable three years ago may not be acceptable now. We rely on our local surveyors to advise us on marketability.' Which properties should you avoid if you need a mortgage? All mortgage companies will avoid lending on flats with leases which have less than 25 or 30 years remaining after the mortgage period is up. This means leases of under 50 years are undesirable except in the most sought-after areas, such as London's Knightsbridge. The Leeds Permanent, in common with many other lenders, will not normally offer mortgages on freehold flats, which became more common in the 1980s as the converted flat sector grew. What this usually means is that one flat in a building carries the freehold, instead of an external property company or individual, and the other flats carry leases. 'The problem with them is enforcing repair covenants,' said John Graves, chief valuation surveyor of the Leeds. Similar problems may arise in a block of flats which has been leased by the freeholder to a third party - if the third party lives in one of the properties. The third party holds what is called the 'head lease' and is responsible for maintaining the common areas. If the third party decided to do a bunk, the lender could be left with responsibility for these repairs, explained David Hudson, chief surveyor of the Woolwich. If, however (as in the freehold case), the third party lives off the premises and all the flats have leases, mortgages become no problem. Government reforms are due soon which should clarify the flat owner's position and create a form of lease called the commonhold. The Leeds has further guidelines on flats. 'Old blocks of four storeys and above must have a lift before we consider them,' according to Graves. 'We will accept six storeys in a modern block and in London we will go up to 10 storeys, but not really elsewhere in the country,' he adds. And what about that cosy flat above the fish and chip shop you saw last week? The Leeds and many other lenders take a dim view of flats over commercial properties which could pose a fire risk; or are situated near public houses, which can affect resale value. Regional problems are also something to watch out for. Parts of Cornwall and Devon are blighted because thousands of homes, which were built on foundations made from waste materials from the local tin mines, are suffering from a concrete disease called mundic. The impurities in the waste materials, including arsenic, have caused the concrete to crumble. 'If we knew a house had mundic concrete, we would say no to a mortgage,' says Graves. 'There is no cure except demolition.' Andrew Hambleton, Bradford and Bingley chief surveyor, says he is wary of British Iron and Steel Federation houses, which were popular in the 1950s. They are steel-framed rather than built from reinforced concrete and can lose stability because the metal tends to rust when moisture gets in. Nor will B&amp;B offer loans on flats built from high alumina cement, a controversial cement used in 1970s' flats which was found to lose integrity if exposed to damp. This is a problem all lenders examine closely. Hambleton is also cautious about lending on homes built on reclaimed land. This is not because they are unsound but because they can become unmarketable, particularly if methane gas starts to seep through as has happened recently in south Sheffield. Homes carrying a so-called 'flying freehold' are also unpopular. This occurs where, for example, a first floor property lies across an alleyway, making it unclear who owns the land beneath. Some lenders will consider this kind of property if solicitors can disentangle the complexities of ownership. Others, such as the Royal Bank of Scotland, refuse to consider them. All lenders are concerned that they should not be left with a white elephant, if your property is repossessed. 'We're concerned about being able to dispose of a property should it come into our hands,' says Matthew White, chief valuer at the mortgage division of the Bank of Ireland, which admits to having become more cautious in its approach to lending recently. 'Anything could sell in 1986-87 because the market allowed for it. Now the market is tough, the fringe properties suffer. The good-looking properties, with the long leases and so on, have become the most marketable.' Finally, think twice about that nice, pre-fabricated, reinforced concrete dwelling you have your eyes on. The lenders speak with one voice on these properties, which were thrown up in their thousands by local councils during the post-war years. The 1984 Housing Defects Act listed around 30 types of pre-fabricated homes that were defective. A mortgage will be made available only if the property has been repaired under one of about 70 licenced repair schemes and carries a 10-year warranty on the repairs. It sounds like a simple solution, but the repairs can cost tens of thousands of pounds. Some lenders, including the Royal Bank of Scotland, take a harsher line and will not lend on these homes at all. The Leeds Permanent Building Society, which is more open on its lending guidelines than some of its competitors, will lend on repaired pre-fabricated houses but not on flats made of the same material. Nor will the Leeds lend on all-timber houses (as opposed to timber-framed houses), because they are unpopular in the UK, and pose an increased fire risk.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev at the signing </F> ceremony of the Israeli-Palestinian Self-Rule Agreement at the  International Convention Center in Cairo -- live; Kozyrev speaks  in English with simultaneous translation into Arabic]    [Text] I would like to start by congratulating the Egyptian  president on his birthday. I think, [applause] Your Excellency,  that your foreign minister did not give you a present. But I  believe that your being here amid this audience and this process  to sign the agreement illustrates the prominent and leading role  in the peace process played by your country under your  leadership. I believe that the signing of the agreement in  Egypt is very significant, because Egypt paved the way for  reconciliation in the region. I hope that on your next birthday  we will meet in the same hall with the same gathering to witness  the signing of not only the Gaza-Jericho First agreement, but an  agreement involving all the territory [applause]. By then we  will have laid the foundations for three new pyramids: First,  agreement on self-rule for the Palestinians; second, agreement  for peaceful coexistence and mutual respect, and I hope the  Palestinians and Israel will cooperate; and third, comprehensive  peace in the Middle East. We all believe that we can achieve a  comprehensive peace soon by making progress in the coming  dialogue and negotiations.    I believe that President 'Arafat and Prime Minister Rabin  know how much Russia wants peace in the region. This region is  near to Russia. The trip from Moscow to this region is a  four-hour flight, while the journey from Moscow to Vladivostok  takes eight hours. We are eager to achieve peace and stability  in the region. Russia would like to be a sponsor of this  process along with the United States. I hope that this day will  mark the start of the implementation of this agreement. There  will be difficulties on the way but they must be overcome with  good faith and resolve.    I congratulate you on this great effort today and I reassure  you that Russia, the United States, Egypt, the European  Community, and the whole world will be on the side of Israel,  the Palestinians, and Arabs in the peace efforts. Thank you.  [applause]</p>

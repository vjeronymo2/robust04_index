			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY;  </P> <P> EMULEX CORP. CONSTRUCTING NEW BUILDING DESPITE SLUGGISH BUSINESS  </P> <P> Emulex Corp. has run out of room at its Harbor Boulevard headquarters in Costa  Mesa and is erecting a new structure nearby to provide some breathing space for  its 600 Orange County employees.  </P> <P> The computer products company plans to move its administrative offices into the  new building when it is completed in early 1990. The 80,000-square-foot,  two-story facility is under construction at the corner of Harbor and Sunflower  Avenue in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> The firm currently operates out of a 214,000-square-foot facility that houses  its engineering, manufacturing, marketing and administrative operations.  </P> <P> "We're extremely crowded right now," a company spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Emulex said it will go ahead with the building despite its recent  acknowledgment that business has been sluggish.  </P> <P> Late last week, the company said earnings for its fourth quarter ended June 2  will be lower than the $2.8 million reported in the same quarter in 1988.  Revenue is expected to be between $35 million and $37 million, up from $34.2  million in the 1988 quarter.  </P> <P> Emulex, which makes computer storage devices and data communications equipment,  said that competition in its market has become "less favorable" and that sales  to a major customer will be about $2 million below earlier forecasts.  </P></p>

Two other students -- men aged 18 and 20 -- are being  treated  for the disease which can be passed on by close contact such as  kissing or by sharing a glass.    Doctors have reported eight cases of meningococcal  meningitis  and septicaemia since the beginning of October instead of the  normal two to four cases for the time of the year.    Of the eight, three are students at Southhampton Institute  of  Higher Education and two at Southhampton University.    Two further cases involved a young girl and a baby, and the  eighth case was brought in from outside the area.    A spokeswoman for Southampton University Hospitals' Trust  said two of the five students were now well.    Of the other three students both the men were improving, but  the 19-year-old woman was "critical" in intensive care. None of  the other cases was said to be in any danger.</p>

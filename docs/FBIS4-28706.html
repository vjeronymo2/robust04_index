			<p>BFN     [Text] Senior officials from major Japanese and U.S. firms  in the semiconductor industry held a meeting on 9 June, followed  by a joint news conference later on. The Japanese and U.S.  Governments are to hold discussions to make a decision by July  on whether to terminate the bilateral semiconductor agreement  ahead of its scheduled expiration in July 1996. However,  differences in opinion between the two nations have come into  the picture, for Japan is calling for an early termination of  the agreement while the United States insists that it remain in  effect.    At the news conference, Hidehiko Yoshida (vice president of  the Toshiba Corporation), chairman of the Users Committee of  Foreign Semiconductors, who represented the Japanese side,  emphasized that "the situation between the Japanese and U.S.  industries is satisfactory in terms of cooperative ties." Gil  Amelio (president of the National Semiconductor Corporation),  chairman of the U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA),  also pointed out that the "U.S. and Japanese semiconductor  industries have become more and more mutually dependent."    As for the bilateral semiconductor agreement, however,  Yoshida said: "The foundation has been laid for the industries  of both nations to continue cooperating. The private sector  should be left alone to look after its own affairs." He thus  indicated that the private sector wants the Japanese and U.S.  Governments to promptly terminate the semiconductor arrangement.    However, Amelio clearly indicated opposition to terminating  the arrangement, saying: "The semiconductor agreement has  brought progress in establishing cooperative ties between the  U.S. and Japanese industries. Therefore, the arrangement should  be continued."    A "20-percent" share of Japan's market for foreign  semiconductors has been designated as a target goal in the  semiconductor agreement. Regarding this point, Yoshida said: "In  the past, this figure has tended to take on a life beyond the  purpose for which it was originally intended. I feel it is no  longer necessary to set figures." In contrast, Wilf Corrigan  (chairman of LSI Logic), a member of the SIA Board of Directors,  stressed, "Figures are needed to measure progress."</p>

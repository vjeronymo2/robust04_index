			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Private View: Laughing all the way across the Atlantic - Don Taffner, the man who sold Benny Hill to the Americans, believes competition for the mass audience leads to a poverty of ideas His laugh is the happy sound of money rattling down the bank-teller's chute. He chortles over his latest art nouveau capture at the saleroom, cackles while describing his battles with the television moguls, hoots as he tells you that one of his tailored-for-America British sitcoms has grossed Dollars 500m. Don Taffner, the Brooklyn newsvendor's son who sold Benny Hill to American audiences, laughs like a tickled hyena. It is the sound they put in cans for TV comedy shows. Indeed, it was his laugh which got him noticed when he began as a humble messenger boy for the William Morris talent agency in New York. He even laughs - respectfully - about his wife. For the first thing you see as you step inside Taffner's London office is a Brooklyn version of an Andy Capp joke: a blue plaque framed by little yellow curtains hanging from a brass rod. Picked out in white are the words 'Eleanor Taffner Lives Here' and, underneath, 'She Who Must Be Obeyed'. 'We had this office at 1430 Sixth Avenue,' said He Who Does the Obeying, 'and they wanted to up the rent on our lease. So I said to Eleanor: 'Would you go look for some space for us?' 'So Eleanor - she's really a partner in all of this - she says to me, 'Don, how much have we got coming in?' And I said to her: 'I don't really know. All I'm doing is getting it. Talk to our accountant, Marty Jaffe.' And he said to her: 'Eleanor, it's coming in so fast you can't spend it all.' 'Within 24 hours she found a building. He called up the next day and said: 'Eleanor, I take it back]'' Taffner cackled, heh-heh-heh. 'So, she knows how to spend it]' Taffner's speciality is selling British sitcom to Americans, developed while acting as agent for Thames Television, the production company and former London area broadcaster. He takes the basic idea and modifies the scripts to suit the culture. So, for example, the Jewish tailor and Irish tailor in Never Mind the Quality, Feel the Width became Jewish and Irish bartenders - the little tailor shop was already extinct in the US. What is the difference between British and American audiences? I asked him. 'I don't know how to answer the question, but instinctively I think I know what it is, what will work and what won't,' he said. 'But Benny's humour was so visual, he could go anywhere. I call him an adult animation.' But all those smutty jokes? 'No, no, the broad-based Americans (his euphemism for the mass market) just sat down and enjoyed it. That's what makes me worry about research. There is what people think they should say, and what they do.' He has a framed cartoon in his office: a viewer is watching Benny Hill on TV and saying to a market researcher on the phone: 'Of course, I'm looking at Masterpiece Theatre'. 'No,' Taffner continued. 'I don't think the people are different. I think the pressure groups are different.' That is one reason why DLT Entertainment, Taffner's production and distribution company, sold Benny Hill area by area. 'If we were on the network the pressure groups who wanna get publicity would go after it much bigger than if I went market by market.' What about Good and Evil? I said. It's said that to sell to America you have to make it very clear who the goodies are and who the baddies. 'I will say it's halfway to being true. I don't think it becomes a yes or no, but I do think they need more of a clear picture of the goodness of a person. But I don't think it can become so good so that it becomes milk-toast, ya know. I am almost convinced that even in the UK there is a demographic of people that need a black and white situation.' Taffner is no cultural snob; by 'a demographic' he means 'the unsophisticated'. And the shorter attention span? That, said Taffner, might not be the audience at all but a function of the cost of air-time. 'All I know is that in America shows tend to have to hit their point faster (he punched his palm, thwack) than they do here. 'I believe that a show grows, rather than instant. But commercial power is such that it has to be instant. They can't afford to let it grow. Here it isn't as much like that, but it will be as competition comes in.' Sometimes Taffner gets it wrong. His Miss Winslow And Son, an adaptation of Miss Jones And Son about an unmarried mother in a block of flats proved 'ahead of its time'. He is now trying to reintroduce it. 'You see, I don't like to put things in catalogues because it ages them. To me something is brand-noo until it's been sold there, no matter how long ago it was produced.' Even 'Allo, 'Allo , the camp parody of the French Resistance which did not take in the US the first time, should have been tried again with the D-Day anniversary looming. Were British sitcoms then more daring than American? 'They certainly were then. I looked upon it that I was bringing freshness of ideas. Most of Hollywood has an incestuousness to it. If a success comes they copy each other. It is still that way. Only unfortunately there aren't too many formats here now; it's more sketch comedy and stand-up comedy stuff than thoughtful situations.' Competition for the mass audience was to blame for a poverty of ideas, he said, and Britain was following the US. 'It's going to be threatened but I hope you fight the threat,' he said. 'There's no doubt about it because you can see it - and I have no criticism because I do game shows myself - in the formats that people are looking for. What I'm suggesting to you is it's going to come around to the least common denominator, right?' Yet minority audiences for subjects such as opera might prove viable markets in a country as large as the US. 'Here, I don't know.' Taffner has put money back into the pool of British comedy talent from which he has earned his living. He is the majority shareholder of Ray Cooney's Theatre of Comedy in London, based at the Shaftesbury Theatre which it owns. But the investment is not only philanthropic. 'It all has to do with programming. I'm sure experts in the field of finance will tell me I'm wrong, but I'm pig-headed enough to keep on going. Television has peaks and valleys: you're selling shows, you don't have a show. Theatre has peaks and valleys. My theory is that if I can just not have them happen simultaneously the theatre can bring a return to help me during the valleys of television.' Though Taffner says he gets his fun from earning, he manages to spend a little too. He and Eleanor are collectors of Arts and Crafts or art nouveau furniture, with a special penchant for Glasgow and the work of Charles Rennie Mackintosh. They make a point each year of buying work from Glasgow Art School students. He led me round the office basement, pointing out some favourite pieces and modestly dropping the names of painters such as John Duncan Fergusson and architects of the Wiener Werkstatte and Bauhaus schools. 'It's kinda the things my mother and grandmother in Brooklyn threw out,' he joked. 'It may sound like bragging, but the appeal to me is that we might have helped start something. Some of it is just absolutely lovely.' He also has a steeplechaser, Ghofar, 1987 winner of the Hennessy Gold Cup, once owned by Sir Hugh Dundas, chairman of Thames. ('Just how much does a horse corst?' he had asked his English racing friends.) 'I planned to have a flat racer too but we weren't coming over to England so much, so we got out of the flat business.' Do you indulge any childhood cravings? 'No. There was one but I changed my mind. When I was growing up in Brooklyn I wanted to own a sports team. Now that I can afford to buy one I've decided that if I get close to those people I'll find out that they're just people and they won't be the glorious images of sport. 'One thing I've learned from the showbusiness world: sometimes when you get close to personalities, that aura melts away.' It is easy to believe Taffner when he says he makes money for the fun of it. 'I just wanted to keep on doing things. If I thought too much of the return of everything I wouldn't enjoy the things.' Just describing his deal-making technique creases him up: 'I talk to the networks in America and I wanna be a partner with them and I say: 'Let's take advantage of something: you're the big guy. If we're partners, you'll be the big guy and I'm the small guy. If you're the big guy and you can step on the person and get what we want, let's do that. But if we can go to somebody and I show him the frayed collar, (heh-heh-heh) and we can get it that way, let's go get it that way.'' Taffner is rocking in his chair, beside himself. 'So I kinda say I get involved in those businesses that fall between the slats of the big guys, ya know. I usually have found I could make a living out of the things that the Warner Brothers and the Paramounts didn't want to get involved in. 'I also like to be at home at night, at 10.30 or 11.00 before I sleep and putting everything in my mind, I like being the underdog saying: 'OK, you big bastards, I can make a living too at this, ya know.'' Taffner yelped with glee. 'And I feel satisfied I have done that, and I can have a good night's sleep.' But still laughing.</p>

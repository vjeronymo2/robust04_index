			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Peru telecoms go to Spanish bidder A consortium headed by Telefonica de Espana yesterday became the new owner of the Peruvian telecommunications systems. The Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.34bn) bid by the consortium it led had surpassed the most optimistic expectations, easily outbidding groups headed by GTE and South Western Bell/Korea Telecom, which offered Dollars 803m and Dollars 857m respectively. The sale expands the role of Telefonica de Espana in the expanding Latin American telecommunications market. It already has big stakes in Venezuela, Argentina and Chile. Hundreds packed the auditorium of Lima's National Museum yesterday for the opening of the bids in Peru's largest privatisation so far. The sale was considered a success and should boost forthcoming privatisations. It was run by UK-based Morgan Grenfell, with Coopers &amp; Lybrand as management consultants. The winning consortium has three Peruvian partners with 5 per cent apiece - the Wiese Bank, construction company Grana y Montero, and brewer Backus and Johnston. Telefonica Peru, as the new operator will call itself, acquires 35 per cent of Lima's telephone company, CPT, after capital increases in the original 20 per cent state holding. The remaining shares are held privately and are actively traded on the Lima stock exchange. Also, Telefonica wins a 35 per cent controlling interest in Entel, the Peruvian state provincial and long-distance monopoly. The new owner will continue to enjoy monopoly on the long-distance service for the next five years. It is expected that Telefonica will have to invest Dollars 1bn-Dollars 1.5bn over the next five years to meet the sale conditions, which call for a virtual trebling of Peru's 630,000 lines. The company will also have to ensure that every Peruvian town of more than 500 inhabitants has a telephone service.</p>

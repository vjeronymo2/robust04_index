			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / People: Non-executive directors Robert Wilkinson (above), the Stock Exchange's surveillance supremo during the 1980s, has joined the board of Tradepoint Financial Networks as a non-executive director. Tradepoint, whose founders include a core of former Stock Exchange electronic systems gurus, intends to operate as a screen-based system for the trading of equities and other financial instruments in direct competition with the Stock Exchange. It plans to become a Registered Investment Exchange, like its competitor, a regulatory status which will require it, among other things, to maintain a surveillance function to detect market manipulation and to ensure that its own requirements for listed companies and members are met. Wilkinson says he will be assisting Tradepoint in setting up a surveillance capability, familiar territory to him. In 1966 he joined WI Carr and Co and subsequently became an equity partner. In 1978 he was elected to the Stock Exchange Council, serving a term on the Financial Accounts Committee which monitored members' solvency. 'It was not a popular committee,' he recalls. In 1981 he became Stock Exchange Inspector and, in 1984, the Exchange's first surveillance director, a post he retained until retirement in 1991.</p>

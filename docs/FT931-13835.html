			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Exceptionals leave Kunick Pounds 12.5m in loss KUNICK, the leisure company which recently sold a 50 per cent stake in its nursing home business to County NatWest Ventures, plunged into the red last year, amid unexpectedly high reorganisation charges and property write-downs. Exceptional charges of Pounds 12.9m left the fruit machine company with pre-tax losses of Pounds 12.5m for the year to September 30 against a profit last time of Pounds 8.6m. Sales fell by 6 per cent to Pounds 109.5m. At the operating level, profits were hit by a Pounds 6.8m fall to Pounds 2.7m in the group's fruit machines business, once the cash cow which was to have funded investment in the care services business. Overall operating profits fell from Pounds 14.6m to Pounds 6.5m. Mr Christopher Burnett, chairman, said 1992 had been the 'most difficult (year) ever experienced in the UK amusement machine industry'. He blamed the recession and the disruption caused by the restructuring of the brewing industry following the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's inquiry into beer supply. The exceptional charges covered a range of Kunick's efforts to meet the downturn, from a Pounds 5.4m write-down on property to Pounds 4.9m for the closure of a cd/juke box manufacturing business. The setting up of the nursing home joint venture resulted in costs of Pounds 2.6m. Mr Burnett stressed the potential for Kunick following the care services deal in October. Debt had been cut from Pounds 47m to Pounds 10m, with gearing from 89 per cent to 19 per cent. The reduction was achieved through the transfer to the joint venture of Pounds 24m in bank borrowings, secured against the care services assets, and the Pounds 12.5m paid by CNWV for the 50 per cent stake. The chairman said the two investors intended to float the joint venture, Goldsborough Holdings, within one to two years. Mr Burnett said the visitor attractions business in France would be closed down or sold. In March, Kunick sold its London and York Dungeon attractions for a profit of Pounds 4m. This was offset, however, by a Pounds 3.4m extraordinary write-down on the French attractions. Losses per share were 7.61p (0.38p earnings). COMMENT Kunick has managed to survive thus far, leaving many to speculate that the real danger has passed. Certainly the recent rise in the preference shares add weight to that view. The question now, however, is whether one wants to invest in a fruit machine business - even one as lightly geared as Kunick. The upside depends on economic recovery. Although the potential for such an operationally geared company could be good, it will never be quite as exciting following the brewing shake-up. Kunick has had to give up its quality earnings and growth to satisfy the bankers. Potential investors might want some indication of a long-term business strategy before stepping in. Forecasts range from break even to Pounds 2m pre-tax. Either way, the shares are highly speculative.</p>

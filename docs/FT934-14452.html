			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: Francs under renewed attack THE French and Belgian currencies fell sharply on the foreign exchanges yesterday as dealers became increasingly convinced that the two countries' strong franc policies were dead, writes Peter John. Attempts by the French authorities to convince investors that the French franc would be held firmly in line with the D-Mark were beginning to look stale as dealers remembered propaganda campaigns that have preceded previous attacks on the currency. Mr Jean Claude Trichet, the governor of the Bank of France, stressed the importance of monetary convergence in a speech at a financial conference yesterday. But cracks were beginning to show towards the end of the week, particularly after Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, said a weaker franc had helped the economy over the past year. This was followed by reports that Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, said he was not unduly worried about the currency. Many dealers believe the French authorities must cut key short-term lending rates to avoid seeing the economy spiral into a vicious circle of high interest rates and high unemployment at the same time as having a weak currency. Yesterday the franc hit a new low of FFr3.5480 against the D-Mark. It recovered to FFr3.5410, down more than a centime on the day on the previous close of FFr3.53. Dealers expected sellers to return when financial markets reopen on Monday. The Belgian franc also hit new lows in spite of continuing intervention from the Belgian National Bank. It replaced the Danish krone at the bottom of the European Monetary System ladder. Belgian short-term rates of 10 per cent are considered unsustainable against headline inflation of only 2.8 per cent and many investors are sceptical about the short-term benefits of the social pact on wages and jobs, details of which are expected next week. The Belgian stock market, on the other hand, hit a new high buoyed by US investors switching from peak-level US stock and bond markets. Early strength for the US dollar was undermined as the most recent economic data failed to give much heart. The August US trade deficit of Dollars 9.71bn was lower than expected but reports covering production, inventories and consumer sentiment failed to inspire. The dollar closed steady against the D-Mark at DM1.6145 and against the pound at Dollars 1.5125. Sterling was sidelined after disappointment over recent industrial production figures and ended flat against the D-Mark at DM2.4425.</p>

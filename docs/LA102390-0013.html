			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ILLINOIS;  </P> <P> JUSTICE HALTS WORK ON NOV. 6 BALLOTS  </P> <P> U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens halted printing and distribution  of ballots for the Nov. 6 elections in Cook County, saying the full court  should hear a dispute over third-party candidates. The ballots did not have the  names of candidates from the Harold Washington Party, named for the city's late  black mayor and representing some blacks disenchanted with the Democratic  Party. Stevens stayed an Illinois high court order that knocked the candidates  off the ballot in the county, which includes Chicago and some suburbs.  </P></p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / World Trade News: India and US sign series of energy agreements India and the US yesterday signed a series of agreements to establish long-term technical co-operation programmes in the fields of power generation and sustainable energy development. Eleven new private sector ventures between Indian and American companies to build energy projects in India were also signed. The agreements result from a nine-day visit to New Delhi by Ms Hazel O'Leary, the US secretary of energy, who led 40 US companies on the first cabinet level visit to India in 20 years. Ms O'Leary's mission follows closely on the heels of Indian prime minister PV Narasimha Rao's visit to Washington, a visit hailed by both sides as the 'beginning of a new era' of trade and diplomatic relations between the two countries. On the commercial side, the visit resulted in agreements between Solec International of California and Pentafour Solec Technology of India for low-cost photo-voltaic technology, Spectrum Technologies, USA, Elgin National Industries and Spectrum Washeries India, and Jaya Foods to apply advanced US coal-washing technologies to India's high-ash coals, targeting a Dollars 1bn coal washing market. The US will also assist India in the oil and natural gas sector, in the fields of advanced exploration, production, and upgrading technology transfer. The World Bank and several other donors have urged India to accelerate its infrastructural development to enable the success of its reform programme.</p>

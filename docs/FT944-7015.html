			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Bristol Post ahead at Pounds 4.78m The sale of a shopping centre helped lift interim pre-tax profits at the Bristol Evening Post by 54 per cent, from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 4.78m. Excluding the Pounds 1.24m profit from the sale of the New Broadmead site in Bristol, the pre-tax figure rose 14 per cent to Pounds 3.54m in the 26 weeks to September 30. Turnover rose only 1 per cent to Pounds 30.4m (Pounds 30.1m), in part because of a reduction in the number of Kiosk retail stores from 78 to 62. Retail activities recorded an increase in operating profit of Pounds 398,000 (Pounds 215,000), up 85 per cent. Operating profits from newspaper publishing and printing rose 26 per cent from Pounds 1.31m to Pounds 1.66m, on turnover of Pounds 17.3m (Pounds 16.1m). Mr Keith Sadler, finance director, said advertising revenues for the half were up from Pounds 10m to Pounds 12m, after a good first quarter but poor second quarter. Earnings per share increased from 8.47p to 12.28p, with the underlying figure up 9 per cent at 9.3p. The interim dividend is 4.5p (4.25p).</p>

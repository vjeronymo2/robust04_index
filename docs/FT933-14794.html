			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Employee share scheme 'failed' A GOVERNMENT scheme to boost share ownership among ordinary employees by allowing executives to buy share options at a discount has failed to achieve its objective, Incomes Data Services, the independent pay group, said yesterday. Almost all the companies examined which had taken advantage of the discount for their executives had schemes for other groups of employees in place before the discount became available, IDS found. Under a measure in the 1991 Budget, executives became eligible from January 1 last year to buy shares at up to 15 per cent below the market price. Until then, to qualify with the Inland Revenue, the price paid when the option was exercised had to be no less than the market value of the shares when the option was granted. The new discounts were conditional on the setting up of company-wide employee share schemes. IDS said: 'The introduction of this substantial tax benefit was explicitly linked to a need to provide top executives with an incentive to spread share ownership to the shopfloor.' The research shows that only two of 28 companies that had issued discounted executive share options needed to set up a new all-employee scheme - 26 already had share schemes covering all employees. A total of 108 separate options had been issued by the 28 companies, 41 of them by seven FT-SE 100 companies. The average value of the discounted options was Pounds 17,930, calculated as the difference between the market price on the day of grant and the option price. IDS concludes that, while few companies have issued discounted executive options, many more have amended the rules of their schemes to allow for them, most of which already have all-employee share schemes. 'For this reason, the growing use of discounted options is unlikely to further the government's stated aim of spreading share ownership to the shopfloor.' Management Pay Review 149.

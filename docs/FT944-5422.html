			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (2): Top up your income for retirement - Additional voluntary contributions Nine out of 10 employees retire on a lower pension than the maximum permitted by the Inland Revenue, yet few take advantage of a readily available, tax-efficient method of topping up their retirement income. The simplest and cheapest way to top up is through your employer's additional voluntary contribution (AVC) scheme, which runs in conjunction with the main pension scheme. Almost without exception, all company pension schemes must offer an AVC facility, although in most cases the investment and administration is sub-contracted to a third party - usually a life office, unit trust group or building society. A second option is an individual arrangement known as a 'free-standing' AVC. FSAVCs are sold by the same providers as the in-house variety, but in this case your employer is not involved. The Inland Revenue allows you to pay up to 15 per cent of your pensionable salary into your main company scheme and AVC scheme combined (restricted in the case of some higher earners). Most employees pay about 6 per cent to their main scheme, so this leaves plenty of scope for additional contributions. Under Revenue rules the only time you can pay in to an AVC or FSAVC is when you are a member of a company pension scheme. Both arrangements qualify for full tax relief on employee contributions (employers cannot contribute) and tax-free growth of the fund. AVCs may also provide a tax-free cash lump-sum at retirement if contributions were started before April 1987. There is no tax-free cash option with FSAVCs. Performance is critical with additional contributions. Your main company scheme is likely to provide a pension linked to salary, but in most cases your top-up fund will be used to buy an annuity from a life office to provide regular (taxed) income in retirement. The level of income you secure is largely dictated by the size of your fund. It is also important to check for flexibility - you should be able to pay what you like, when you like, without penalty (within Revenue limits, of course). In theory, your employer's AVC scheme should provide better value than an FSAVC, because employers usually bear some or all of the provider's costs. With an FSAVC you pay all these charges yourself. However, AVC investment choices can be limited - for example, you may only be offered a building society deposit account. If you have more than five years to go to retirement you might want a with-profits, unit-linked or unit-trust fund, which provide various degrees of exposure to stock market growth. Do check the level of charges and the performance, though. With more than 100 FSAVCs on the market - each offering a range of funds - it is essential to seek independent advice. Finally, bear in mind that AVCs and FSAVCs usually lock away your money until you retire from your main company scheme. If you want more flexibility, consider a personal equity plan, available from stockbrokers and independent advisers, or, for the very cautious, a tax exempt special savings account (Tessa), from building societies and banks.</p>

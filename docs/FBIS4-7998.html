			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] You have heard at the beginning of the program  what the momentary situation in Gorazde is like. A radio bridge  with Gorazde has been organized for foreign and domestic  reporters in Sarajevo this afternoon. Our reporter Mediha Colo  listened to the radio bridge and prepared the following  reportage:    [Begin recording] [Colo] Riad Rasic, president of the  Gorazde district assembly; Esad Orhanovic, president of the  Gorazde district executive council; and Alija Begovic, director  of the Gorazde war hospital, were answering the questions of  domestic and foreign reporters via radio link. Riad Rasic,  president of the Gorazde district assembly, gave a brief [word  indistinct] of the latest situation in Gorazde. [passage  omitted]    [Rasic] The situation is also difficult in the hospital,  regarding the number of beds, accommodation space, lack of  medication, and so forth. At 0800, that is to say, from the  beginning of the offensive until 0800 this morning 67 people  have died and 325 have been injured. Of these, 10 were children  and 19 women and older people, while 38 children and 49 women  have been injured. [passage omitted]    [Colo] One of the reporters' questions referred to the  critical line on the right bank of the Drina River in the  vicinity of Vidkovic and the aggressor's current intentions.    [Rasic] Yes, the lines have been consolidated a little there  and most probably we will hear better news from Gorazde.  Ferocious battles are being fought in that direction and our  defenders are holding well, therefore, we can expect better news  from that part, which is the only [word indistinct] at this  moment, as all other lines are holding (?extremely) well.  [passage omitted]    [Colo] Alija Begovic, director of the Gorazde hospital,  answered questions about the situation in the Gorazde war  hospital. Dr. Begovic said the following about the most urgent  requirements of the Gorazde hospital:    [Begovic] In brief, we need sanitary articles, [word  indistinct] material, gauze, bandages, and powerful analgesics.  Regarding [word indistinct], also surgical implements, string,  certain substances to stop bleeding such as [word indistinct] or  similar. We have not had oxygen for a year and a half almost,  we had it only at the beginning for a short while. Therefore,  we do not even have oxygen for [word indistinct] and, therefore,  I cannot even talk about this. We more or less have the most  basic antibiotics, therefore, we (?need more sophisticated)  antibiotics for bone infections and so forth, we lack this.  Then, [words indistinct] in the present situation when there is  a great number of injuries. Otherwise, we suffer constant  shortages of medication for chronic patients, for example, eye  patients with glaucoma, for patients with diseases of the  thyroid gland, patients in need of cancer therapy, and so forth.    Regarding blood plasma, we have not received any. However,  since we have a marvelous response of volunteer blood donors,  mostly women, who at any moment... [pauses] It has not happened  yet that we would not have enough of any blood type, therefore,  we more or less supplement blood with blood and we use very  little blood plasma. Actually, at the beginning when we had  some we used it for a while but now not any more.    I must say that the number of medical staff in Gorazde has  been cut down to a third of that before the war, therefore, far  below the requirements. The scope and the type of work [words  indistinct]. There never was a hospital, a surgical department,  and this secondary aspect of medical care here. There are  really very few physicians and we all do three or four jobs at  once.    [Colo] According to the information that we have obtained  via the radio bridge, the latest offensive at Gorazde resulted  in the number of refugees in this town increasing by 2,000.

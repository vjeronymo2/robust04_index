			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Patten to meet teachers' unions MR JOHN Patten, education secretary, agreed to meet the six teachers' unions yesterday in an attempt to diffuse the controversy over this year's compulsory English tests for 14-year-olds in England and Wales. However, he ruled out any changes to the tests, and the agreement to meet the NASUWT, the second largest teachers' union, is conditional on its calling off a ballot on a boycott of all this year's tests. Mr Patten said the tests 'must go ahead', claiming that they were 'vital' to improving standards. He added: 'For too long, too many of our children have left our schools without the ability to express themselves properly.' He recognised, however, that taking account of the 'genuine concern' of teachers had been 'critical in helping to iron out wrinkles in the system' in the past. Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, the leading moderate teachers' union, welcomed Mr Patten's response. He said: 'Dialogue aimed at resolving a difference is better than rhetoric which opens up a chasm. It is a sign that Mr Patten takes this matter seriously.' Teachers' unions claim that the English tests, to be taken for the first time in June, have been inadequately prepared, and that material for them arrived at schools too late. Mr Patten said he would meet union leaders to 'discuss ways in which we can build on the lessons that will be learnt this year in order to ensure the successful rolling implementation of the national curriculum'.

			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / International Company News: Honda weighs quitting Formula One HONDA Motor may withdraw from Formula One car racing at the end of this year. A final decision is to be made in September. The company insisted yesterday the decision would have more to do with protecting the environment than with the harsh economic environment or the trouncing McLaren-Honda cars are receiving at the hands of the Anglo-French Williams-Renault team on the world's race tracks. Speculation has been growing within racing circles that Honda was considering withdrawing from Grand Prix. However such a pull-out had been expected because Honda, after six successive years of powering world championship-winning cars, wants to transfer its motor racing resources to Indianapolis-style racing in North America, where it is regarded as being in need of fresh marketing initiatives. The company's hint that it might quit racing all together comes as a surprise, particularly given the deep motor sport culture suffused through Honda by the company's founder, Mr Soichiro Honda, who died last year. There has been little sign of the debate which Honda now indicates has been waged internally for some time. At issue has been whether the costs of participation outweigh the technological and public relations benefits. Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, Honda's president, said yesterday that making cars more environmentally-friendly was the most important challenge for manufacturers. If the company does quit, the some 100 engineers and other workers directly preparing Grand Prix racing engines will devote their energies to making engines cleaner and more fuel-efficient. The company would also be able to reallocate the annual costs of Grand Prix involvement, indicated to be around Y10bn (Dollars 80m). While Honda insisted cost was not the most important consideration, the outlays have become more of a burden with the slowing of the once-lucrative domestic car market. The company reported a 1 per cent fall in consolidated pre-tax profit last year, and a 21 per cent fall in parent profits. Honda claims the present decision is similar to that made in 1968, when it withdrew partly to devote more resources to making a cleaner engine to meet tighter US emissions standard. However the company's return to F-1, a move strongly supported by Mr Honda, had been a resounding success until the present season. Despite the best efforts of world champion driver, Mr Ayrton Senna, the McLaren-Honda team is well down the manufacturer rankings. 'This review has nothing to do with our performance in F-1 this year,' Honda said. 'We have been racing for 10 years and the times have changed. The environment has become the key issue.' Some Honda executives are known to have been concerned that the image of F-1 racing in Europe appeared to be souring, while support for F-1 in Japan also seemed to have peaked with the retirement last year of leading Japanese driver, Mr Satoru Nakajima. Executives of McLaren International, operator of the McLaren race team, were unavailable for comment on Honda's potential withdrawal. If Honda were to quit, McLaren would be under considerable pressure to find an alternative power unit in time to recover its fortunes next year. Ford said it would be prepared to supply its own Cosworth-built units if enough capacity existed. Other possibilities include BMW, which may be considering re-entering Grand Prix and which already has a link with McLaren.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Salvador, Brazil, 12 May (PL) -- Brazilian President  Itamar Franco has welcomed Cuban President Fidel Castro and  reiterated the appreciation and friendship he feels for the  Caribbean island.    In a message delivered to the Cuban leader by state  government officials upon arriving in this city, Franco recalled  his personal meeting with Castro during the third Ibero-American  summit of 1993 and expressed his satisfaction that they will  meet again during the fourth meeting of this forum to be held in  Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, in June.    In a reply note, Fidel Castro was deeply grateful for the  welcome given by his counterpart and noted he and the delegation  accompanying him felt good to be surrounded by the warmth and  unrivaled friendship of the Bahia people.    I carry with me the unforgettable memory of our days in this  city that hosted the Latin American summit, and I will gladly  greet you again in Cartagena de Indias, the statesman noted.    My stay has been brief but my fondness for this friendly,  exceptional, and extraordinary country will be eternal, Castro  added.    Upon arriving yesterday evening, the Caribbean leader met  with Bahia State Governor Antonio Imbassahy, during the only  official meeting of his stopover on his return from South  Africa, where he attended the inauguration of Nelson Mandela.    Castro, Imbassahy, and Former Governor Antonio Carlos  Magalhaes, who stepped down to work on his electoral campaign  for the general elections in October, held a cordial  conversation and dined together at Salvador's government palace.    They discussed the U.S. embargo on Cuba, which the  Brazilians  flatly rejected, matters of bilateral interest, and other issues.    The Brazilian media highlighted the brief visit by the Cuban  head of state, who has visited this South American country on  three previous occasions.</p>

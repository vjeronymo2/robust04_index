			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Pangs of delight for Hong Kong cartoonists A hairdresser recently asked her view of Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's new governor, furrowed her brow and said: 'Hmmm, Mr Patten; a very important man.' 'Why?' 'Well, he's the chairman of Britain. Hong Kong is lucky to have such an important man.' The former chairman of the Conservative party might be taken aback by his elevation, but then, to the Chinese, the word 'chairman' has a singular ring to it. An altogether different grassroots perception of the new governor is provided by cartoonists in the leading local newspapers. They have lighted on Mr Patten's somewhat corpulent demeanour and nicknamed him 'Fat Pang' - Pang being the Chinese surname he has taken. This is not a case of lese majeste as such - the Chinese will pick on someone's most distinguishing feature be it a stammer, squint or limp and turn it into a nickname - but more a piece of well-intentioned and irreverent teasing. But it is a nickname the governor will have to live with for the rest of his time in Hong Kong. One newspaper, the Hong Kong Economic Journal, has begun to run a daily comic strip entitled 'Fat Pang's Theatre'. Mr Patten's desire to run an 'open and accessible' administration - one element of which will be a form of prime minister's questions in the local legislature - will no doubt provide fertile material for the colony's local wags. So may his desire to run a 'presidential' style of government. Yesterday, he held one of the largest press conferences the colony has seen in the garden of his official residence. It was not quite the White House Rose Garden, but the tone was unmistakable. Mr Patten intends to lead from the front.</p>

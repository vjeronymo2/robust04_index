			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Not Her Grade: Country music legend Dolly Parton received an honorary degree  from Carson-Newman College in Jefferson City, Tenn., and brought down the house  when she called herself "Dr. D.D.," a reference to her married name, Dolly  Dean, as well as her bust size. "I'm trying very hard to hide it underneath  this robe at this fine Baptist ceremony," she said Sunday.  </P> <P> Books, Not Boris: Long lines of people outside Boris Yeltsin's Moscow home set  off false rumors about the health of the Russian leader. The crowd had not come  to mourn Yeltsin but to buy the first Russian translation of Mario Puzo's novel  "The Godfather" at a bookstore in Yeltsin's building. Yeltsin's well-being has  been a concern since a car accident a month ago.  </P> <P> Prison Perks: While deposed Panamanian ruler Manuel Noriega awaits trial on  drug charges, he is staying in what is called the "dictator's suite" at the  Metropolitan Correctional Center in Miami. It has a bedroom, conference room  and office, and is furnished with a color television, computer, exercise bike  and paper shredder. There also are two safes containing documents, but Noriega  doesn't know the combinations.  </P> <P> Cast of Character: The plaster cast Prince Charles wore after he broke his  right arm playing polo raised the equivalent of $3,230 at a church raffle  Sunday in London. St. Thomas of Canterbury church will use the money to repair  the roof, which sustained $87,000 damage in storms in February. "I will pass it  through my family like an heirloom," said Elizabeth Schofield, who won the cast  with a 95-cent raffle ticket. The prince broke his arm in a fall June 28 and  donated the cast.  </P></p>

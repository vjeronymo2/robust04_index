			<p>BFN     [Text] On 21 June, the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry [MITI] announced a report stressing the need to promote  direct investment in Japan by foreign-affiliated enterprises as  a way to help revitalize local economies. In its report, MITI  points out it has become difficult for foreign-affiliated firms  to advance into Tokyo due to high land prices, among other  factors. Among key points which the report stresses will help  promote efforts to attract such firms to rural districts are the  following: 1) to draw up a program regarding attracting  foreign-affiliated firms to Japan in which local governments  will play the main role; 2) to implement more measures which  offer financial and other incentives to foreign- affiliated  firms; and 3) to build an information network. As a new policy  for fiscal year 1995, MITI now plans to work out details of its  program for promoting foreign investment in Japan based on this  report.    The report was compiled by the "Committee for Promoting  Smoother Domestic Investment in Rural Districts" (a private  study panel under the director of MITI's Industry Policy  Bureau). In its report, the panel asserts that the advance of  foreign-affiliated firms into Japanese markets will promote  competition within the domestic economy and help increase  productivity. It asserts this will consequently contribute to  rectifying the gap in commodity prices in Japan and abroad. It  stresses that in rural districts, in particular, extensive  exchanges among firms with differing customs and traditions will  lead to the increased possibility of the birth of new local  industries as well as to the internationalization of rural  districts, and an increase in employment opportunities.</p>

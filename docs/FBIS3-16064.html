The ruling is in effect from March 11 till 27. If the  Ostankino company hasn't renegotiated its contract with Estonian  Telecommunications or paid its debts by March 28, transmission  of its programs will stop altogether.    Ostankino owes Estonian Telecommunications about 105,000  Deutsche marks for 1993 and another 80,000 marks for January  transmissions.    Under the contract concluded between the Ostankino  television  company and Estonian Telecommunications, Ostankino itself pays  for the transmission of its programs in Estonia.</p>

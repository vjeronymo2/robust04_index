			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Washington sets date for Tokyo progress on trade The US told Japan's new government yesterday that the two countries must make progress on trade before the July meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries in Naples, and Japan promised to seek a solution, Reuter reports from Cairo. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, delivered the message during a meeting in Cairo with Mr Koji Kakizawa, Japan's foreign minister. It was the first high-level contact between the two allies since a new government was installed in Tokyo. The two were in Cairo for today's scheduled signing of the Israel-PLO agreement on Palestinian self-rule. Mr Christopher said the US was prepared to be understanding during this transition phase as the new government established itself and developed its policies. But at a news conference with Mr Kakizawa, he said: 'It's quite important that we make as much progress as possible before the G7 meeting in Naples so we have a good report to give to the other leaders of the world at that time.' Mr Kakizawa said: 'We agreed that the two countries have to make further efforts' following talks between then-foreign minister Mr Tsutomu Hata, now Japan's new prime minister, and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, in Marrakesh at a recent meeting to conclude the Gatt Uruguay Round. Mr Christopher noted that Mr Kantor raised with Japan in Marrakesh three questions on the framework agreement that the two sides are negotiating to provide greater access to Japan's markets for American businessmen. He said Mr Kakizawa told him the answers would be forthcoming. Japan has a trade surplus of more than Dollars 50bn with the US, which has been trying to force Tokyo to open up its markets.</p>

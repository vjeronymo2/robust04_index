			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- Russia has her own way of  entering the market, her own model of development, announced  Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on Thursday at a meeting with  the heads of enterprises and organisations in the spheres of  industry, construction and transportation. The meeting was held  immediately after another signing ceremony during which business  and organisation heads affixed their names to the Treaty on  Social Accord.    Chernomyrdin stressed that the treaty is a historically  important document which creates the conditions for the  stabilisation of Russia's political and economic life. Russia  is paying a steep price for reforms, the premier noted, and gave  a detailed account of the economic situation in the country.    The prime minister declared that the government's number one  task was to keep spending within the parameters of the budget.  A series of presidential decrees and governmental resolutions  have already been prepared with the goal of improving the  economic situation and strengthening the Policy of Social  Accord. These steps are designed to "redirect the restructuring  of the economy in favor of the domestic producer", he said.    The premier reffered, in particular, to the lowering of  several tax rates this year, to the cancellation of taxes on  investments, to the significant lowering of customs duties on  oil, gas, aluminum, pulp and the other main components of the  Russian export, as well as the cancellation of quotas and  mandatory licensing for exports. This summer will already  witness the lowering of the amount companies are required to put  into the social security fund, which is one form of taxes. As  the government implements its plan to sharply improve the  efficiency of the tax-collecting agencies, it hopes to be able  to reduce the over-all tax load by 10 to 20 per cent next year.    According to Chernomyrdin, the government envisions  requiring  banks to report the opening of an account by a firm, and also  taking additional measures on debt circulation, including the  possibility of extinguising the debts of unviable enterprises by  confiscating their property.    The premier especially pointed out the necessity of  strengthening executive discipline on every level. "Without  discipline we will not be able to do anything in this country",  he emphasized.    He said that regulatory measures would be adopted to  decrease  the salary gap in various sectors of the economy, including in  the government.</p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: Share fall prompts Hewlett report HEWLETT-Packard said orders grew by 19 per cent during the first six weeks of the current quarter. The growth rate, although down from the 26 per cent order growth of the first half of the year, was within management's expectations, the computer and electronics company said. The unusual interim performance report was issued by HP after a sharp drop in its share price yesterday. The shares fell Dollars 7.50 to Dollars 79.50 in heavy early morning trading following a report that Mr Lewis Platt, HP president and chief executive, had warned of slowing order and revenue growth in the second half. HP executives, including Mr Platt, spoke with financial analysts in Frankfurt, Germany, yesterday, the company said. 'One news report on the Frankfurt meeting erroneously mentioned that we discussed the possibility of slower revenue growth in the third quarter,' said Mr Robert Wayman, HP chief financial officer. 'We didn't comment on revenue, since it is far too early to say anything meaningful about revenue for the quarter.' Company officials expressed surprise at the reaction to cautionary comments regarding order growth, which reiterated similar remarks made by company executives at an analysts' meeting in New York last month. At that meeting, Mr Wayman told analysts: 'Customers will buy strong products even in a difficult environment, but I don't think we can extrapolate our first-half order-growth rates out into the future.' He noted that the worldwide economic environment was very mixed, with several leading economies in recession. HP's shares regained some early losses after it issued the interim order growth report, and closed down Dollars 3 3/8 at Dollars 83 5/8 . HP last month reported first-half net income of Dollars 608m, up from Dollars 293m in the same period of 1992.</p>

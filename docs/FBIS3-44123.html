			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Another meeting of the General Peace Accord's  Supervision and Control Commission [CSC] took place in the  country's capital today. Edmundo Galiza Matos reports:    A very good evening, dear listeners! The peace process  experienced new developments here in Maputo today. The General  Peace Accord's CSC met, under the chairmanship of Aldo Ajello,  special representative of the UN secretary general in  Mozambique, to examine the confinement and demobilization of  troops from the government and the Mozambique National  Resistance [Renamo]. The parties centered their discussions on  delays allegedly being observed on the government side. The  concern of the international community was conveyed by the  respective ambassadors. Let us hear what Armando Guebuza, head  of the government delegation to the CSC, had to say on the issue.    [Begin recording] [Guebuza] We, the government, agree with  the report presented by the president of the Cease-Fire  Commission [words indistinct] delays in confining troops. The  government evidently [words indistinct] made a move last week,  confining more troops [words indistinct].    [Unidentified correspondent] Did the international community  express any concern regarding delays [words indistinct]?    [Guebuza] The international community expressed concern over  the delays observed and expressed satisfaction that [words  indistinct] as well as a warning of the dangers that these  delays in the implementation of the accord can represent [words  indistinct] can jeopardize the elections date. But, obviously  the [words indistinct] the last date for elections.    [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] delays [words  indistinct]?    [Guebuza] We shall work [words indistinct] to prolong a  situation of this nature.    [Correspondent] No money, no elections. This is what [words  indstinct] Dhlakama said. What do you think of that?    [Guebuza] I think that we have to hold elections, taking  into  account the reality in the country, with our limitations, with  our economic and financial [words indistinct]. The country does  not have sufficient money [words indistinct]. We have to work  in this way. Nothing can replace the stability of the country,  particularly relating to money [words indistinct] additional  financial resources [words indistinct] and we have asked the  international community to see whether it will carry out its  promises to allow us to hold elections, without many  difficulties.    [Correspondent] But, in your view, this statement [words  indistinct] no money, no elections, [words indistinct] Renamo  will not take part in elections. What does this mean for the  government?    [Guebuza] It is dangerous [words indistinct]. We think that  the important parties in this process should be moved by the  objectives [words indistinct] respecting the freedom of men  [words indistinct] and to advance to a situation of  participation in economic process, without [words indistinct].    [Correspondent] [words indistinct] Renamo in elections?    [Guebuza] I hope Renamo will reflect on this demand. It  cannot be used as a blackmail [words indistinct] our people want  money but are aware that money can [words indistinct] with the  country's stability. [end recording]    In turn, Renamo's Jose de Castro says his movement is not  happy with delays by the government in confining troops and went  so far as to propose that the international community should  condemn the government for this delay.    [Begin recording] [Castro] Renamo is not happy because the  government has slowed, I can even say halted, the confinement of  its troops. We do not know the reasons which make the  government act in this way. Accordingly, we propose that there  should be a declaration condemning this action, because in the  past when there were no justifiable reasons to condemn Renamo  [words indistinct] if it was Renamo to delay or halt the  confinement of troops, the whole world would be shouting at this  time.    [Correspondent] This means Renamo wants the CSC to condemn  the government delays?    [Castro] Exactly, exactly, exactly.    [Correspondent] The recent statement by Renamo President  Afonso Dhlakama that without money, there will be no elections  [words indistinct]?    [Castro] [Words indistinct] he was very clear when he said  that with or without conditions, we shall participate in  elections. This means that even with the difficulties that we  are facing, with regard to logistics and transforming our  movement into a party, our president has already said that we  shall take part in elections [words indistinct].    [Correspondent] [question indistinct].    [Castro] [Words indistinct] without money, the statement has  already been made [words indistinct]. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / A flawed character: The man who saved Fisons but fell foul of the City The saddest comment on Mr John Kerridge's career came yesterday from the stock market. When the news broke of his resignation as head of the drug company Fisons, the shares jumped 6 per cent. Yet Mr Kerridge was, by common consent, one of the outstanding British managers of his generation: the man who, 11 years before, was credited with saving Fisons from extinction. Over the years, the City has made a fortune out of Mr Kerridge. Now it is glad to see the back of him. Where did it all go wrong? The immediate cause is clear enough: the announcement in December that a regulatory foul-up in the US has cost the company about a quarter of last year's profits. In recent months, the share price has fallen by nearly a third. But the problem goes deeper than that. Mr Kerridge is described by those who have worked with him as a highly complex personality: a brilliant strategic thinker, but obsessive over detail; self-confident and at times apparently arrogant, but abnormally thin-skinned. This sensitivity to criticism has undoubtedly played its part in souring relations with the investment community and the press. Going by his record, Mr Kerridge had little to be sensitive about. When he was appointed chief executive of Fisons at the end of 1980, the company had just gone through the most disastrous year in its history. Chiefly because of the fertiliser business which had formed the bulk of its operations since the mid-19th century, it had plunged to a net loss of Pounds 17m and was about to slash its dividend. The top management was in turmoil. The chairman, Sir George Burton, was about to retire after 47 years with the company. The previous managing director, Mr Ron Bounds, had just departed with a massive payoff. The new chairman, Sir Ronald McIntosh, declined to take up the post on discovering that the company was about to shut its Mayfair headquarters and move back to its historic base in Ipswich. Before becoming chief executive Mr Kerridge had run Fisons' fertiliser business, which had its roots deep in the company culture. His crucial contribution was to realise that, for strategic reasons which he was later to expound with admirable clarity, the company had to get out of fertilisers once and for all. The successful sale of the business to Norsk Hydro a year after his appointment was the turning point. Fisons went on to enjoy the growth and stock market rating of a successful drug company. Norsk went on to do bloody battle with the other giant of UK fertiliser production, ICI, which ended with losses all round and ICI shutting up shop last year. The two businesses which Mr Kerridge concentrated on - pharmaceuticals and scientific instruments - were not there by accident. Sir George Burton, when he was made chief executive in 1966, had decided that Fisons must reduce its dependence on fertilisers - then 80 per cent of the business - and develop research-based businesses, chiefly pharmaceuticals. The stroke of luck which was eventually to save Fisons came shortly after, with the discovery of the asthma drug Intal. But it was only in the 1980s that the potential of the drugs business was fully realised. Since 1982, when the company was stabilised by the sale of the fertilisers business, earnings per share have risen six-fold. And from a professional manager's viewpoint, perhaps the most telling statistic from the Kerridge years is the group's return on operating assets. In his first year in charge, in 1981, it was 9.3 per cent. It has risen every year thereafter, the latest figure being 37.3 per cent. But there were other aspects of Fisons' managerial adroitness which the City found less compelling. It could never understand, for instance, how Fisons managed to make a profit on borrowing money: in 1990, it made Pounds 0.9m of net interest receivable on net debt of Pounds 116m. Nor could it work out how the group tax charge was kept so low. Mr Kerridge's response to this was invariable: that it was the result of hard work and good management. It was open to other companies to do the same, but he was not going to help them by showing them how. When the news of the company's US fiasco broke last month, it also did not help the City's temper that it felt it had been here before. Mr Kerridge's appointment in January 1981 had coincided with the announcement that a supposed blockbusting drug, Proxicromil, was being scrapped at the last moment because of side effects. The City complained that the company had been reassuring right up to the moment of disaster. Again, in the mid-1980s, hopes had been raised too high over another new drug, Tilade, at least partly with the company's encouragement. The tendency to fatal optimism may fairly be blamed on the Fisons culture rather than on Mr Kerridge alone. There is also no denying that despite its history of success, Fisons has always been accident-prone. In the 1960s, in a curious anticipation of its latest problems in the US, the company so botched the US launch of its first big drug Intal that by the mid-1970s its US sales were actually falling. But the latest upset, which turns on Fisons' failure to pass US quality standards in drug manufacture, may be Mr Kerridge's fault in another sense. 'One of his great strengths,' a City analyst says, 'was that he ran the business on purely commercial lines, whereas most pharmaceuticals companies don't. But if you look at Fisons' margins by comparison with the bigger drug companies, they may actually be too high. He may have pushed the company too hard, and not spent enough on manufacturing and infrastructure.' However that may be, the refusal to explain things is eminently in character. 'He could never relax with the City and the media,' a close observer of the company says. 'He always felt that by explaining he might lay himself open to further criticism. And adverse criticism was something he couldn't bear.' This again raises the question of why so successful a man should be so thin-skinned. There may be a clue in Mr Kerridge's origins. Like Fisons itself, he comes from Ipswich, where his father is variously described as having been a garage owner or a car mechanic. Either way, when the young Kerridge won an Oxbridge scholarship he could not afford to take it up, and went into the army instead. From there he made his way into marketing, and joined Fisons in 1969. On becoming chief executive 11 years later, he moved the headquarters back to Ipswich. As the base for an international drug business, Ipswich is not an obvious choice. It perhaps makes more sense as the setting for a local boy made good. It seems clear that the company's expressions of regret at his departure yesterday can be taken at face value. 'He could have ridden out the storm, and I believe he should have,' says one of his colleagues. The new chairman, Unilever veteran Mr Patrick Egan, says 'when John took over the company, it had a market value of Pounds 40m. He brought it up to Pounds 3bn. That's a marvellous record.' Mr Egan defends Mr Kerridge over the US fiasco. 'We have been criticised for not sounding a cautionary note sooner. There was certainly a good deal of wishful thinking in our pharmaceutical department. But I didn't feel as a non-executive director that I'd been misled. We were collectively confident as a board that things could be sorted out.' All the same, it sounds as if the Fisons tradition of secrecy and sensitivity is to change as well. 'I have a more open style,' Mr Egan says. 'With the benefit of hindsight, we should have got closer to opinion-formers in the City.' A City analyst agrees: 'This could open the doors. Fisons could learn to love its shareholders and its shareholders to love it.' Conceivably, it could also open the door to takeover or merger. As a drug company, Fisons is still a minnow in a world of whales. Not surprisingly, Mr Kerridge was adamantly opposed to the idea of Fisons losing its identity in a merger. For a long while, this was an effective barrier. In the pharmaceutical industry, hostile bids are conventionally seen as too risky and expensive to be feasible. If that were now to change, the situation would be deeply ironic. When Mr Kerridge took the company on, it was being widely touted as a bid candidate. Now that he is leaving, it is in the same position all over again.</p>

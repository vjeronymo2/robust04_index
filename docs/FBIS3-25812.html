			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "40 New Aircraft for 1994"] </F>   [Text] China's aircraft imports will remain buoyant this  year on the wings of sustained economic growth, a top corporate  manager says.    "We'll receive more than 40 planes for civil use this year  from the United States and Europe," Ye Yigan, President of the  China Aviation Supplies Corp (CASC), said in an interview with  BUSINESS WEEKLY.    Most of the planes are made by the Boeing Co of the United  States and Airbus Industrie, the France-based European  consortium, Ye said.    The world's civil aviation generally grows twice as fast as  the global economy.    "But China's civil aviation has grown by a larger margin,"  Ye  explained.    "That means we will buy at least several dozen aircraft per  year."    China has lowered its 1994 target for economic growth to  between 8 percent and 9 percent from last year's 13 percent.    However, the demand for civil aircraft remains brisk,  especially with the mushrooming of local airlines.    Ye has said that China's imports of aircraft have averaged  nearly $2 billion annually over the past several years.    China Aviation Supplies Corp, the country's leading trader  in  aircraft and ground equipment, has imported more than $10  billion worth of aircraft since 1980.    The company is the designated main importer of civil  aircraft, engines and other equipment, although a number of  airlines can buy certain products from overseas by themselves.    For example, Air China, China Eastern Airlines and China  Southern Airlines can import some spare parts through their own  trading arms.    Economists said China should retain unified management of  aircraft imports, although the industry is being decentralized  some.    Ye said the construction of local spur lines was in full  swing, generating a great demand for short- and medium-range  aircraft.    Many international aircraft makers are vying for sales and  local manufacture of their planes.    Ye said China would give priority to buying locally-made  planes if prices are reasonable.    He added that China is choosing appropriate partners for  local production of aircraft, but he declined to give details.    Ye said competition among foreign companies for a share of  China's local airline manufacture is tough.    China is one of the world's fastest growing markets for  civil  aviation, while many developed countries and regions remain  bogged down by stagnant economies.    Imports of ground equipment will also continue growing, Ye  said.    Last year China Aviation Supplies Corp signed $3.2 billion  worth of contracts for imports of aircraft and related  facilities. About $2.5 billion of the goods have been delivered.    Ye said the recent normalization of Sino-French relations  will help improve China's business with Airbus Industrie.    "We will further develop and improve relations with the  company in the future," he said.    Ye pointed out that if Airbus Industrie completes scheduled  deliveries this year, it will have provided China with 17 planes  altogether.</p>

			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EUROPEANS WANT JAPAN TO CUT ITS TRADE SURPLUS;  </P> <P> COMMERCE: MOST HAVE A FAVORABLE VIEW OF THE PACIFIC POWER, A SURVEY SHOWS. BUT  THEY DON'T THINK IT IS FULFILLING ITS GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITIES.  </P> <P> A majority of people surveyed in major European countries have a favorable view  of Japan but believe that it is not fulfilling its international  responsibilities, the Foreign Ministry reported Tuesday.  </P> <P> Among the chief criticisms was that Japan needs to correct its trade imbalance.  However, many respondents said creation of the single European market planned  for 1992 will improve relations between Japan and the European Community, the  ministry said in a news release.  </P> <P> The sixth such poll since 1977, it was carried out from September through  October by private research organizations in Britain, France, Germany, Belgium,  Italy, the Netherlands and Spain.  </P> <P> In all seven countries, "the degree of trust in Japan is rather high," ranging  from 71% to 91%, the ministry said.  </P> <P> In every country except Italy, however, a majority of respondents thought Japan  was not fulfilling its international role.  </P> <P> Japan, the world's No. 2 economic power, has come under criticism for not doing  more to assist U.S.-led forces in the Persian Gulf and to ease its chronic  trade surpluses.  </P> <P> Many respondents called for a prompt correction of Japan's surplus with the EC,  which totaled $1.49 billion in November. The most commonly cited recommendation  was for Japan to open its markets more and expand domestic demand.  </P> <P> Among other findings of the survey:  </P> <P> * Expectations of direct investment from Japan were high in every country.  </P> <P> * Business development by Japanese companies in Eastern Europe was "generally  desired." Most respondents said Japanese companies should invest only in  cooperation with Western European countries. In Germany, however, 71% said the  Japanese should get involved on their own.  </P> <P> The survey, sponsored by the Foreign Ministry, was conducted by mail in  Britain, western Germany and Belgium. Responses came from 1,543 of 6,550 people  to whom questionnaires were mailed.  </P> <P> In the other countries, interviews were conducted. A total of 1,936 people  participated.  </P> <P> The poll did not give a margin of error. Japanese pollsters do not calculate  such margins, contending that they might mislead readers into thinking a poll  is more accurate than it really is.  </P></p>

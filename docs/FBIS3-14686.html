			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd- al-Salam </F> al-Majali in Amman by Nicole Tannuri in London; date not  given--recorded]    [Text] [Tannuri] A U.S. spokesman has stated that the  United States is considering amending the procedures for  searching ships bound for the Jordanian port of al-'Aqabah to  curb the economic impact on Jordan resulting from the sanctions  imposed on Iraq. Dr. al-Majali, how do explain the Jordanian  stand?    [Al-Majali] The Jordanian economy has been considerably  affected. In such an atmosphere and with that massive impact on  conditions in Jordan, how can we go to peace negotiations? A  negotiator must be relaxed; he must feel at ease about  negotiating for peace because it involves benefits for all.    [Tannuri] The United States has said that there are  proposals  and ongoing negotiations about searching ships. What are these  proposals; and is it possible for the government to respond  positively to them?    [Al-Majali] First of all, I would like to affirm that we are  hiding nothing. We are a committed state that has good  credibility. When we say that we import nothing that violates  the UN resolutions, we really mean that. But they have to  conduct searches. Hence, we proposed several methods to handle  this. One of these is to entrust the task to an international  nonprofit firm, like Lloyd's Register. This firm's  representatives in al-'Aqabah can monitor things and report  directly to the United Nations.    More than three months have passed. We understood that the  parties concerned had approved this proposal. Nothing has  happened yet. On the contrary, the number of ships searched or  intercepted this year is almost equal to all the ships searched  in the past years.    [Tannuri] Are there guarantees in monitoring violations and  ensuring Jordan's commitment not to violate the UN resolutions  imposing the embargo on Iraq?    [Al-Majali] We are committed. We are a member of the United  Nations. If we do not comply we will be violating the  resolutions of an organization to which we belong.    [Tannuri] Thank you Mr. prime minister.</p>

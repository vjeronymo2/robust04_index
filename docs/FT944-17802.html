			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Servisair achieves target Pounds 54.3m value in float Servisair, the independent aircraft and passenger handling company, has announced that despite current market indigestion for new issues its flotation was fully underwritten at its target price, valuing the company at Pounds 54.3m. The company's parent, Securum, is selling 60 per cent of its stake. Servisair is offering a further 7.4m new shares, making a total offer of 24.12m shares priced at 135p. The company is forecast to make profits of Pounds 4.2m before exceptional items, putting the shares on a price-earnings ratio of 14.7, which is roughly the stock market average. It is offering 6.03m of the shares to intermediaries. This portion of the offer should get a boost from the news yesterday that Servisair has won a 10-year baggage-handling contract at Glasgow airport, the UK's fourth largest. Servisair already operates passenger and cargo handling services at Glasgow, which should contribute about Pounds 5m to this year's revenues. The baggage-handling contract should add at least 10 per cent to that figure. The company has also secured 10-year contracts for its other operations in Glasgow. Servisair will pay a notional dividend of 3.8p for 1994, representing a notional gross dividend yield of 3.5 per cent. The offer to intermediaries closes on October 12 and trading is scheduled to start on October 18. COMMENT Servisair has done well to achieve a high price in an unfavourable market, but does not appear to have left much for the stags. It offers the advantages of a long management track record, a decade of profits growth, and a relatively dependable source of earnings. It also has a strong argument for new business. Airlines in the UK and Europe are starting to contract out lower margin, non-core activities such as passenger and aircraft handling. The old monopolies are being broken, as at Glasgow, providing a convincing medium-term picture. As most of the short-term attractions are well accounted for in the offer price, it must be classed as a stock for the patient.</p>

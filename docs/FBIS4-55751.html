			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by </F> Xavier Gautier in Paris; date not given: "We Will Abolish The  Border"]    [Text] Former Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik was in  Paris early this week. His message was clear: Even though  Slovakia has broken off its relations with the Czech Republic,  it not does not want to be ejected outside Europe.    [Gautier] Your government, which opposed the nationalist  policy of Meciar, managed to convince the Bratislava government  to deal with the issue of the Hungarian minority. How did you  do that?    [Moravcik] We had prepared an acceptable solution for the  Slovaks, the Hungarians, and the other minorities. It was not a  problem to convince the deputies.    [Gautier] Will you be the first prime minister to take down  the "iron curtain" that has appeared between the Czech Republic  and Slovakia?    [Moravcik] The two republics of the former Czechoslovakia  are  young countries. They are going through an unnecessary period  of restricted freedom of movement. It is difficult to persuade  Prague to avoid that kind of obstacle. There is a real problem  of migration. But we will abolish the border as soon as it has  become unnecessary.    [Gautier] Within the framework of a Slovakia integrated into  Europe?    [Moravcik] Yes. This is the message that we have brought  with us to Paris. Slovakia envisages an integration into the  European Union. My message is clear: Bratislava must not be  ejected outside Europe. This is very important for the  stability of the region.    [Gautier] Why did you chose France for you first visit as a  head of government?    [Moravcik] I chose your country because France has  understood  the importance of Central Europe within Europe.    [Gautier] What was your message to President Mitterrand?    [Moravcik] We want relations with France to be fruitful for  both countries. I stressed that we are working to establish the  basis of a stable economy and political system.    [Gautier] The elections are scheduled for the end of  September. The deposed prime minister has already launched his  campaign. Do you think you will survive the election next fall?    [Moravcik] A large number of the electors have not made up  their minds. Vladimir Meciar's popularity, which had been  falling, has started to rise again since he was evicted by the  parliament. But this time, it seems that a large part of the  electors support our European and democratic policy.    [Gautier] What do you think of the scheduled return of the  communists and Gyula Horn to power in Hungary?    [Moravcik] I have just had very interesting talks with Gyula  Horn. I can envision cooperating with him.    [Gautier] Better than the cooperation with his predecessor,  Peter Bross?    [Moravcik] (laughing) The search for solutions to the  problems between Bratislava and Budapest is in our mutual  interest.    [Gautier] Does Slovakia, which sent Blue Helmets to Bosnia,  intend to follow the example of France and withdraw its troops?    [Moravcik] No. We want to continue with our peacekeeping  mission in that region. It is in our interest.    [Gautier] Do you have a solution to the Bosnian conflict?    [Moravcik] It is a simple solution. We intend to apply the  principles of a multiethnic society in Slovakia. These  principles must be reintroduced in former Yugoslavia, as they  have been in South Africa and the Middle East.</p>

			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Big states plan stronger presidencies for EU: Plans to exploit an 'astral coincidence' France, in concert with its three big continental European partners, is seeking a stronger and more coherent leadership for the European Union during their successive presidencies in 1994-96, according to Mr Alain Lamassoure, France's European affairs minister. The French initiative did not appear to be a bid to establish a big-country directorate of the EU, nor intended as a slight on the current Greek presidency, though it may be taken as such. Rather, Mr Lamassoure describes it as an attempt to exploit the 'astral coincidence' that - starting with Germany this July, and continuing with France, Spain and Italy into 1996 - the rotating six-month presidency of the EU will be held by 'four important countries of the Union which, in addition, share the same conception of Europe'. 'We have proposed to the Germans, Spanish and Italians that we should prepare together a common timetable, an agenda over these two years,' Mr Lamassoure said. This period was likely to see the EU admitting Nordic countries and Austria, preparing its 1996 constitutional revision and hosting its conference on European stability as well as dealing with key neighbours to the east and south and pursuing economic and monetary convergence. The joint consultation, evidently still at a very early stage, 'has been accepted by the Germans and Spanish. . . though we are still waiting for Italy to have a durable and stable government', he said. But the initiative meshes with what Mr Lamassoure described as France's growing preoccupation with the lack of any proper structure to 'prepare, propose and execute' the EU's common foreign and security policy prescribed by the Maastricht treaty. 'We have 12 (foreign) ministers, but no ministry' to implement their EU decisions, he said. 'The problem is one of management.' But France was not prepared to see the foreign policy management role filled primarily by the European Commission - despite the effort by Mr Hans van den Broek, political affairs commissioner, to set up a Brussels policy unit  - or by the Council of Ministers secretariat. The minister claimed that Britain, with its similar tradition of diplomatic activism, 'is as preoccupied as we are' with the EU's lack of an efficient and acceptable foreign policy executive. Joint Franco-German initiatives were no more acceptable as standard practice than two of a government's ministers always hatching national policy, he said. On general policy, Mr Lamassoure said: 'There is no one to carry out analysis on behalf of the Twelve, to present proposals before the Council, and once a decision is taken, no one charged with its implementation.' The minister admitted the difficulty of implementing Maastricht's foreign policy as well as its internal justice, police and immigration policies could have been foreseen, 'but it is only when one moves into action that one realises the true problems'. Mr Lamassoure insisted that 'there could no European foreign and security policy without common defence'. He underscored French hopes that Germany would soon find the political will and obtain the constitutional freedom to allow its forces to operate outside the Nato area. France is evidently concerned the Europeans will not be able to exploit fully Nato's new willingness to let its assets be used on occasion for purely European operations - endorsed at last week's alliance summit - unless Bonn takes a bolder line on defence. He also went out of his way to stress Paris's common interest with London in 'subsidiarity' - the repeal of unnecessary EU legislation in preference for national regulation. In reviewing some 70 EU measures last year, the French and UK governments were able to agree on a common list of 20 laws for scrapping. Indeed, 'our approach to the single market is now closer to Britain than to Germany,' he said. But the Franco-German relationship remained the key to the overall success of the EU, said Mr Lamassoure. It had weathered last year's strains over Gatt, monetary policy and Bosnia - which was just as well, he said, because if France and Germany were to take different sides on issues, 'there would be two Europes'.</p>

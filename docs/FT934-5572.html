			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (31): VAT officers go electronic / Customs and Excise application Portable computers have replaced report forms in the briefcases of VAT control officers visiting VAT-registered businesses and traders, writes John Kavanagh. The VATPACE system, developed by HM Customs and Excise and running on Toshiba computers, helps officers check VAT returns and payments by providing programs to handle tasks such as cash reconciliation and margin calculations. The officers write up their reports of their visits using an electronic form, displayed on the computer screen. The Fillaform system is based on the Formware software product from UK company European Printing Systems. Formware can include facilities for validating information as it is keyed in, for example to check numeric calculations. VAT officers use this facility to check the likely validity of VAT registration numbers. Formware prints the completed forms on plain paper, printing graphical items such as a logo, boxes and ruled columns at the same time as the textual and numeric information. Before HM Customs and Excise introduced VATPACE and Fillaform, the visit report forms were supplied on pre-printed stationery and were filled in by hand. The form includes details of all aspects of the visit, from the people interviewed and the items checked to any over or under declarations and action that was taken - 'managers can now read the completed forms more easily,' says the VATPACE deputy project manager, Mr Phil Townsend. 'In addition, if a manager asks for extra information the form can easily be amended. By the same token it is easy to change the form design through the system.' Other benefits arise from the fact that the system uses plain paper. 'Pre-printed stationery is expensive and takes storage space,' Mr Townsend says. 'When the form design changes, the old stationery is wasted. We can now use plain photocopier paper, which is much cheaper. And we only print the forms we need, and when they are complete.' The project team looked at using a standard word processing package before settling on Formware. 'We needed a package with a powerful macro programming language which would enable us to put in a front-end to the word processor to prompt the users through the system,' Mr Townsend says. 'We decided the Fillaform idea was easier and it's certainly worked out no more expensive.' HM Customs and Excise has 1,500 VATPACE computers and its bulk purchasing means it pays around Pounds 90 per computer to use Fillaform.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 27 (XINHUA) -- At a time when China  is beset by a fast unemployment growth, the country's booming  collective sector is considered by experts to be the best  channel for the promotion of employment.    According to official forecasts, the workforce employed in  China's collectively-owned enterprises will reach 65 million by  the turn of this century. They will then make up 33 percent of  all people employed, compared with 23 percent now.    In the last fifteen years, since the start of the  reform-and-opening up policy, one third of the country's 100  million newly-employed urban workforce have found jobs in the  collective sector.    More significantly, in the township and village-run  enterprises, over 90 percent of the 110 million working staff  have been employed in the collective sector.    "It is an inevitable tendency to resort to the  non-state-owned sector to promote employment," said Zhang  Xiaojian, head of the Employment Department of the Labor  Ministry, in an interview with XINHUA here today.    Zhang noted that the state-owned enterprises are at present  weak in their ability to absorb workers, due to the ongoing  transformation of these enterprises' whole set-up.    Now the national unemployment rate stands at 2.6 percent, he  said, adding that he expects the number of unemployed to reach 5  million by the end of this year.    "The best way to curb the jobless growth is to give full  play  to the collective sector," said Zhang, the leading official  charged with resolving China's unemployment problem.    He explained that the collective enterprises have the  advantages of public ownership and the adaptability to the  market economy. There is huge employment potential hidden in the  collective sector, he said.    Experts expect that the proportion of the employed  population  in the state-owned enterprises will drop from 70 percent to 55  percent by the year 2000, to the tune of 110 million people.    While in the collective and other non-state sector, the  employed population will double to 90 million, with the  proportion in the state's total employed figure rising from 30  to 45 percent.</p>

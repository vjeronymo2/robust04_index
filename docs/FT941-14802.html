			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Bonn unveils its plan to open up labour market Germany's government yesterday unveiled far-reaching measures intended to deregulate the labour market, promote new businesses and stem rising unemployment. Key measures include the legalisation of private employment agencies to end the state monopoly on job placing, special inducements for long-term unemployed to take seasonal jobs or low-paid work in the community, and moves to promote more part-time work in both state and private sectors. At the same time, the government plans to cut the wages paid to workers on so-called job creation schemes, where thousands who would otherwise have been unemployed (especially in east Germany) have been kept in their factories with state subsidies. In future they will only get 80 per cent of their former wages. The plan was instantly attacked by the opposition Social Democratic party as a dangerous initiative to create different classes of labour: the qualified, unqualified, and the long-term unemployed. Only on promoting more part-time working do both sides of the political establishment apparently agree. The programme was approved yesterday by leaders of the three partners in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government, along with a new package of budget cuts, totalling DM5bn (Pounds 1.9bn), intended to keep the 1994 government deficit below DM70bn. Key measures in the 30-point programme, drawn up by the Economics Ministry, include better start-up incentives for small-time entrepreneurs, among them low-interest rate loans from the state's Bank for Reconstruction. There will also be special measures to encourage the unemployed to set themselves up as self-employed, guaranteeing them a transitional period of six months' unemployment benefit while they do so. Similar incentives will be introduced to encourage the long-term unemployed to take seasonal jobs, by allowing them to keep part of their unemployment benefit, or to take jobs serving their local communities. The thinking behind the government proposal is to create greater flexibility and mobility in finding jobs for workers. However trade unions and the SPD are bitterly opposed, on the grounds that private agencies will cream off the best jobs and workers, leaving the rest to compete in a second-class state-run labour market. The government plan also aims to clamp down on illegal employers of cheap foreign workers, above all in the construction industry. Fines will be introduced for principal contractors who allow their sub-contractors to employ such workers, and the employers themselves will be banned from tendering for future public sector contracts.

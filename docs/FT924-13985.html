			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Carlton TV ready to take on franchise CARLTON Television, winner of the London weekday franchise, put on a glitzy face yesterday for its first presentation to advertisers at the London Palladium. Carlton will take over from Thames Television at midnight on January 1 and is putting Pounds 92m into the ITV national network schedule plus Pounds 11m into regional programmes apart from a Pounds 7m contribution to setting up a seven-days-a-week news operation with London Weekend Television. Mr Nigel Warmsley, chief executive of Carlton Television, promised to offer 'both continuity and change'. The changes include a daily one-hour magazine programme about life in the capital. There is continuity in the reappearance of entertainers such as Dave Allen and the transformation of Nicholas Parsons and his radio programme Just A Minute into a television programme. Current affairs will include a documentary on Vietnam 20 years after the Paris Treaty and there will be education in the form of the Good Sex Guide. The typographical Carlton, the designers have decreed, will in future will have a small 't' tucked into the capital 'L' and the company will be branded on screen by 70 people, famous and not so famous, emphasising the theme 'Television For London'. Ms Christine Walker, chief executive of Zenith Media, the UK's largest media buyer, and one of those appearing in the Television For London promotions, was relieved at what she saw yesterday. She said: 'I was afraid they would go for designer television. They haven't. It's safe but I don't think they'll match the ratings of Thames this year.' Not surprisingly, the franchise losers have been maximising their audience figures and their advertising earnings in their final year as broadcasters.</p>

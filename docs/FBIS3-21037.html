VDI-N, Duesseldorf, 17 Dec  93. Parallel computers have crossed the threshold from research  stage to industrial utilization. With the help of this key  technology, users want to solve a series of problems that until  now had been reserved for the considerably more expensive  high-performance computers.    "If technical progress in car making had been as speedy as  in  the computer field, then you could buy an S-class limousine for  DM5, including air conditioning, car phone, and air bag." This  is how Dr. Andreas vom Hemdt, business manager of the Center for  Industrial Uses of Massive Parallelity (Ziam, Herzogenrath),  described the tremendous jumps that occurred in the price/output  ratio.    What does the future of the high-performance computer look  like? Do we need any more improvements in the output? "It seems  as there are no limits to what people want the computer makers  to come up with," commented vom Hemdt. This is because, when it  comes to the "great challenges," such as nuclear physics, the  genome project, or improved weather forecasts, basic researchers  demand more and more computer power. And users from all fields  of activity, such as engineers, physicians, car makers, aircraft  makers, or city planners right now need computer output in the  200-GFlops class, in other words, 200 x 10[.sup]9[/]  floating-point operations per second.    The Ziam boss is convinced that the required high and also  payable computer output cannot be attained by the next decade  with conventional computer technology. Nevertheless, he argues,  the limit of the output in the conventional sequential computer  era is in sight in spite of all of the progress that has been  made at work stations and supercomputers. Only a few powers of  ten today separate processor technology from the final physical  barrier of the speed of light when it comes to signal transport.  Besides, the financial border has long been crossed: Very few  university computer centers and big corporations could afford  supercomputers with a price tag of DM20 million and more.    Parallel computers are increasingly replacing the  traditional  vectorial high-performance computers and, according to vom Hemdt  "will become the industrial key technology in the coming years."  Massive parallel computers with hundreds and thousands of  processors can adapt their computation output to the particular  problem because the number of processors can be increased  theoretically without limit. This extreme scalability and the  resultant good price/output ratio open up new fields of  employment and opportunities on the market as did personal  computers 15 years ago. Many hardware makers are preparing  products for the new basic technology of parallel processing and  more and more conventional user programs are ready for  industrial employment.    For example, the big system maker Sentec Software, Hilden,  which specializes in parallel computer technology, developed an  image processing unit that ensures constant quality in filling  beer bottles. Figuring on an output rate of 80,000 bottles per  hour, it may well happen that bottles are equipped with tops and  labels of the preceding beverage, particularly after a switch to  a different beverage type. High-speed image processing  recognizes such errors in real time and causes a claw to remove  these bottles from the flow of material.    Sentec emphasizes the quick ability to learn and the  manifold  employment possibilities. Project manager Peter Plapper noted  that, when it comes to starting the system up, the sample of the  objects to be investigated could be learned "in a simple  teach-in step." Since the system generally recognizes writing  and geometries, it is also useful for quick analyses in the  textile industry, precision mechanics, or testing technique.    Another example is a process developed by Condat GmbH,  Fernhag, that can be used to simulate the dynamic failure of  composite materials under shock and other stresses. In the auto  industry, for example, one can use this method to analyze the  elastic behavior of high-strength fiber materials and the  gradual transition between intact and destroyed material. A  neuronal software sees to it that one of the fastest ZIP code  number conversions in Germany can be successfully accomplished  on a parallel computer, that is, the Parsytec-GC with 1,024  processors. In May 1993, around 4.4 million customer data of the  Company for Payment Systems, Frankfurt/Main, were updated within  a few hours during this spectacular demonstration.    Ziam business manager vom Hemdt is convinced that "new high  technologies, such as massive parallel processing (MPP) cannot  be used in research and development in the context of  international competition without government subsidies." For the  "Real World Computing" Project--in whose context MPP is being  promoted--Japan spends DM2.2 billion, while in the United  States, the government in 1993 is funneling DM1.3 billion in as  direct government subsidies, and the growth rate keeps going up.  In addition, American MPP makers reportedly are getting massive  support as a result of the procurement policy pursued by public  research institutions and the military establishment.    When an English Meiko parallel computer was ordered by  Lawrence Livermore Lab, there was a massive wave of protests in  the United States; or when Parsytec of Germany wanted to deliver  machines to the universities of Chicago and Moscow, the United  States Administration slowed the European competition down with  CoCom blockades dating back to the time of the Cold War.    Vom Hemdt mentioned other negative examples: One of the  biggest German industrial enterprises referred to as "Bank With  Electronic Workshop," is combining job positions and instead  sells supercomputers from Kendall Square or Fujitsu under the  trademark Siemens to German universities in Munich or Aachen.  Thinking Machines installed its computers in Wuppertal or St.  Augustin; Intel hits the competition from Aachen with a machine  delivered to the Juelich research facility.    As a result of this procurement policy pursued by German and  partly also European institutions, taxpayers are bound to find  themselves in the rather odd situation of subsidizing American  computer makers and promoting the development of the next  American computer generation. On the other hand, it is charged,  European supercomputer makers depend on direct subsidies for  development.    The research policy pursued in the EC, in the Federal  Republic, and in North Rhine-Westphalia reportedly took these  needs into account by means of programs and specific individual  measures, for example, by means of Cardinal Point 3.1 in Esprit  III, the Suprenum Project, which is worth mentioning in spite of  commercial disaster, or the North Rhine-Westphalia initiative  entitled Parallel Data Processing.  <H5>  Parallel Computers </H5>   Parallel computers attain their high computer output, which  can exceed the output of conventional supercomputers, by  allowing a number of microprocessors to work together.  Theoretically, the number is unlimited; starting as of 100  microcomputers, experts speak in terms of "Massively Parallel  Processing" (MPP systems).    To be sure, each individual chip is much slower than the  very  core of a conventional supercomputer, but their large number  more than makes up for this. The mostly simple microprocessors  can be produced in vast numbers and make parallel computers much  more cost-efficient than conventional supercomputers that, in  their simple version, already cost about DM0.5 million.

Massive parallel systems already account for a considerable  portion for difficult research tasks also among large computers.  Photo: Sentec, Image: VDI-Nachrichten.</p>

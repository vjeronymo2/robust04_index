			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of The Philippines (2): Property points the way - The economy / The growing optimism The current scramble for a large property development project in the Philippine capital indicates the level of confidence in the country's economy. Some of the leading local business groups have teamed up with foreign companies to bolster their bids for the project, a 214-hectare parcel of land in a military camp, Fort Bonifacio, which is being converted into a commercial and trading centre for metropolitan Manila. At a price which some describe as stiff, the winning group will need to put up at least 11.8bn pesos for a 55 per cent share of the undertaking, in partnership with the government. No fewer than 25 local firms and several respected names in the real estate business in Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand and Japan have formed alliances to bid. Over the past couple of years, investors have taken note of the economic liberalisation initiatives being pursued by the Ramos government, which have resulted in a more level playing field and competitive costs of doing business. 'The country feels a surge towards (economic) recovery, fully supported by such factors as low interest rates, single-digit inflation, a stable foreign exchange rate, rising investments in housing and construction, rising consumption, and the vigorous development of new growth centres outside the capital region,' according to Mr Jaime Zobel de Ayala, chairman and president of Ayala Corporation, whose property development arm is among those bidding for the Fort Bonifacio project. The significance of Mr Zobel de Ayala's comments lies in the fact that the conglomerate that he heads has been around for 160 years - longer than any other Philippine business enterprise. The Ayala group has seen it all - wars, rebellions, prosperity in the 1950s, the rise and fall of a dictatorship, the rebirth of democracy - and survived. That it continues to seek avenues for expansion illustrates the prevalent sentiment in the local business community. Economic growth this year is targeted by the government at 4.5 per cent, although the record in the first half indicates that this could be exceeded. By the end of the current medium-term economic programme, which in June got the backing of the IMF, the growth rate should be closer to those of the high-growth economies in the region. The recent end to the electricity shortage, which in 1992-93 impeded economic recovery, should allow the industrial sector to become the engine of growth. Agriculture, which employs 45 per cent of the labour force, is also expected to recover from first-quarter stagnation caused by last year's typhoon damage. Official policies will continue to be biased towards deregulation and liberalisation, according to Mr Roberto de Ocampo, the finance secretary. The shift towards more outward-looking policies 'has put our economy on a path towards rapid growth,' he said in a recent interview. Mr de Ocampo acknowledged that this year's target rate remained modest compared with those of other south-east Asian economies. However, Philippine growth 'is in fact a little more dramatic', given that it comes from a lower base. Philippine GNP increase in 1993 was 2.3 per cent, from a plateau in 1992 and 1991. The finance secretary cited other factors that now make the Philippine economy more attractive: the large pool of English-speaking, highly skilled workers, and a culture that has a close affinity and familiarity with western business practices; as well as the country's strategic location at the gateway of the Asia-Pacific region. In July, Mr de Ocampo led a Philippine team of economic managers to the meetings with the Paris Club of official creditors and the consultative group of donor nations and institutions, at which new economic concessions were granted to the country. Participants in these meetings were largely optimistic about Philippine prospects. The Ramos government's reform initiatives started barely two months after it had assumed office, by widening the relaxation of foreign exchange controls on current transactions, started by the previous administration. In August 1992, the government allowed the free flow of foreign exchange and gold, and removed the requirement for exporters to remit foreign exchange revenues to be sold only to Manila banks. These have since been relaxed further, by raising to Dollars 3m the maximum amounts that Philippine residents may buy from local banks for investment abroad. If secured from sources other than banks, a resident may take out any amount of foreign exchange. Also lifted were restrictions on the flow of funds into and out of the local capital markets, which helped bolster the level of foreign participation in the stock exchanges. In July 1993, a new central monetary authority, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (Central Bank of the Philippines) was established after the old central bank had ceased to be effective in its tasks of stabilising inflation and the exchange rate, owing to heavy losses incurred from mismanagement during the Marcos administration. Mr Gabriel Singson, the Bangko Sentral governor, listed the following as the monetary agency's principal accomplishments in its first year: Inflation has been reduced to 7.6 per cent in 1993 from 8.9 per cent in 1992. It rose above 10 per cent briefly in early 1994, but slowed to about 9.6 per cent by mid-year. It is targeted to fall further to 8.5 per cent by end-1994. The overall balance of payments has consistently reflected a surplus, which at the end of the 1994 first quarter was Dollars 616m. International reserves have risen steadily. At the end of July, they were estimated at Dollars 7.74bn, equivalent to nearly four months' imports. The exchange rate has been largely stable, with fluctuations noted during an escalation in debates on whether the local currency should be devalued. By July, the peso was actually 6 per cent higher against the US dollar. Interest rates declined, with the closely watched 91-day Treasury bill rate falling below 10 per cent in early August for the first time in many years. A reduction in the reserves requirement on bank deposits, from 20 per cent to 17 per cent on August 15, resulted in a drop in bank intermediation costs that pulled down lending rates. Above all, through a variety of debt-reduction measures pursued over the past five years, the country's debt service burden had gone down to 19.5 per cent of annual exports in 1993, compared with a crippling 90 per cent at the height of the local foreign exchange crisis in 1983-85. Most of the country's foreign exchange obligations are now to bilateral creditors (39.4 per cent) and multilateral sources (22.9 per cent), with only about 18.7 per cent owed to commercial banks and other financial institutions. The biggest obstacle to economic recovery, the chronic budget deficit, is also being tackled more decisively, according to the fiscal managers. In the first seven months of this year, the government recorded a surplus of 7.4bn pesos; and it projects that this can be sustained until the year-end. If that materialises, it will be the first budget surplus in over two decades. It will also bolster the budget proposal for 1995, now being scrutinised in Congress, which projects a surplus of 15.5bn pesos. However, overall public sector spending, covering both the national government and the state-owned corporations, is still expected to show a deficit. In 1995, this is forecast to level off at 1 per cent of GNP, from an estimated 2.2 per cent this year.</p>

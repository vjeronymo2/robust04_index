Aeronautical Radio, Inc., and the Air Transport Association of America (ARINC/ATA), Rockwell International Corporation (Rockwell), and the FAA argue that both GLONASS and GPS operations, as potential components of the GNSS, must be protected during all phases of flight over the United States. To that end, they proffer additional limitations on Big LEO operations. ARINC/ATA argues that the Commission should clarify that the RR 731E limitation of &hyph;15 dB (W/4kHz) for MSS mobile terminals should apply only after GLONASS moves to frequencies below 1610 MHz. Until then, they contend, the limit should be &hyph;78.5 dB (W/MHZ). <FOOTCITE>156</FOOTCITE>  Similarly, Rockwell states that the RR 731E limit is insufficient for protecting GLONASS operations at 1610&hyph;1616 MHz. Rockwell claims that the RR 731E power density level is about 140 dB above the maximum interference level that can be tolerated by a typical GLONASS receiving system. Rockwell asserts that shared use of this band segment is impractical absent significant constraints on either MSS or GLONASS. Therefore, it maintains that MSS operation should not be permitted in the 1610&hyph;1616 MHz band segment until GLONASS operations are shifted to frequencies below 1610 MHz. <FOOTCITE>157</FOOTCITE>  The FAA states that the Commission indicated that use of the 1610&hyph;1616 MHz band by MSS is premised upon moving GLONASS below 1610 MHz. It maintains that the e.i.r.p. density specified in RR 731E is too high to protect in-band GLONASS for anything but high altitude enroute communications. <FOOTCITE>158</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 156 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ARINC/ATA Comments at 2&hyph;3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 157 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Rockwell Comments at 2&hyph;3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 158 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> FAA Comments at 2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 126. Several of the MSS applicants also disagree that more restrictive limits should be placed on MSS uplinks pending a GLONASS frequency shift. Constellation states that more realistic interference criteria and models must be developed before any requirements other than the RR 731E uplink e.i.r.p. density limit can be adopted. <FOOTCITE>159</FOOTCITE>  Ellipsat contends that no additional requirements should be adopted because the aviation community has not provided a legitimate basis for overly stringent requirements on MSS uplinks. Further, Ellipsat maintains that even if GLONASS becomes a component of the GNSS, the aviation community has not provided a showing that GNSS performance would be impaired if degradation were to occur to the small number of GLONASS satellites that would operate above 1610 MHz. <FOOTCITE>160</FOOTCITE>  Motorola claims that the proposed limits advocated by the aviation community are based on flawed assumptions and unsound analysis. Additionally, Motorola asserts that the protection the aviation parties claim as necessary is based on the erroneous assumption that corrupting a single measurement from a GLONASS satellite will cause unacceptable degradation in the ability to navigate. <FOOTCITE>161</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 159 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Constellation Reply Comments at 47. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 160 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Ellipsat Reply at 11. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 161 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Motorola Reply Comments at 51. Motorola notes that a study conducted for LQP by Sat-Tech Systems demonstrates that loss of a single satellite will never cause a loss of GNSS (LQP Comments at Technical Appendix, para. 2.2.1 at 12). In addition, the Committee performed an analysis of the availability of GNSS satellites if the GLONASS constellation operated only on frequencies below 1610 MHz. It concluded that a minimum of five satellites would always be available for GNSS. In addition, it noted that this minimum would occur for only 14 minutes in every 51-day period. It noted further that since only four GNSS satellites are required for navigation and an additional one satellite for system integrity, it appears that GLONASS satellites operating above 1610 MHz might not be required for either navigation or terminal approach communications.

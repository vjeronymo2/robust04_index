The company, PASAT, delivered a room for three persons 10 minutes from  the center of Prague for the equivalent of $7 a night. PASAT also pointed out  the city's many attractions. The owner speaks English. His list of offerings:  rooms in private homes or hotels, tickets for cultural and sports events,  language programs, exchanges between sports teams and cultural groups, etc. In  addition, PASAT helps with plans for vacationers wishing to go horseback riding  or needing car rentals. Contact PASAT, Vaclav Blaha, Na Vyspe 8, 14700 Prague  4, Czechoslovakia."  </P> <P> San Francisco's Chinatown: Shirley Fong-Torres, who teaches Chinese cooking, is  leading walking tours of San Francisco's Chinatown. Groups explore back alleys,  peek in on a fortune cookie factory, Chinese produce markets, herbal and noodle  shops, delis. Free snacks in a number of restaurants. Fong-Torres' flock joins  a Chinese tea ceremony, visits with an artist (brush paintings). The tour winds  up with a dim sum lunch at one of Fong-Torres' favorite restaurants. During the  walk (no hills to climb), Fong-Torres spins anecdotes about early Chinese  settlers. Groups are kept to a maximum of a dozen persons. Price: $30 with  lunch, $22 for the tour only.  </P> <P> Shirley Fong-Torres, Wok Wiz Tours, P.O. Box 1583, Pacifica, Calif. 94044.  Telephone (415) 355-9657. Note: afternoon/evening tours also offered.  </P> <P> New York on a Budget: Hotel prices have soared in New York, but there's still a  way to do the Big Apple without taking out a loan. It's the bed-and-breakfast  routine. Rates from $50 single, $70 double. B&amp;B Network of New York is in  its fifth year. Represents more than 250 properties. Everything from modest  apartments and artists' lofts to town houses and high-rise condos. Both hosted  and non-hosted accommodations. Weekly/monthly rates available. Travelers are  urged to make reservations a minimum of two weeks in advance. (Most  accommodations require a two-night minimum stay.)  </P> <P> Contact Leslie Goldberg, B&amp;B Network of New York, 134 West 32nd St., Suite  602, New York 10001, (212) 645-8134.  </P> <P> Mexico Without Stress: C.E. of Del Mar asks for the name of a "quiet village in  Mexico that's low-key but with atmosphere." Our vote goes to Copala. In the  Sierra Madre range about 40 miles east of Mazatlan. Takes about an hour by car  or bus. Donkeys share the cobbled streets. Visitors check in at the little  five-room Hotel Posada San Jose. Excellent Mexican meals. You dine in the  patio. The menu lists eggs ranchero, enchiladas and a plate that's loaded with  tortillas, tacos, tamales. The beer is cold and the service is top-notch.  Others choose Daniel's, a restaurant on the approach to town.  </P> <P> Hotel Posada San Jose faces a plaza and the church of Copala. After 400 years,  little has changed in this village, which was founded by the Spaniards.  Wrought-iron lamps line the square. The tolling of bells can be as startling as  thunder. A fine retreat for travelers looking to escape crowded coastal  resorts. No night life. Only one cantina. Copala is the colonial town that  Puerto Vallarta once was -- only without an ocean.  </P> <P> For the latest on Copala, contact the Mexican Government Tourism Office, 10100  Santa Monica Blvd., Suite 224, Los Angeles 90067. Telephone (800) 262-8900 or  (213) 203-8191.  </P> <P> Reader Recommendations  </P> <P> Washington -- Natalie and Chet Miller, Flintridge: "On Whidbey Island, a truly  superb B&amp;B called The Victorian, 602 N. Main, Coupeville, Wash. 98239.  Delicious breakfast. Rates: $75/$95 double. Worth much more."  </P> <P> Switzerland -- Mr. and Mrs. S. Penn, Beverly Hills: "A charming hotel, the  Swiss Inn, General Quissan Str. 23, CH-Interlaken 3800. Fantastic view of the  snow-covered mountains. Twin-bedded rooms priced at $75/$90 U.S. The hotel  charges an additional $5 for a sumptuous buffet breakfast."  </P> <P> Hungary -- Nell Thomas, Long Beach: "Pension Herold in a village about 20 miles  outside Budapest. Operated by Max and Maria Herold, H2023 Dunabogdany, Hungary.  Marie bakes bread for breakfast in an outdoor stone oven.

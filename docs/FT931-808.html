			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Property: How to be a landlady - Renting your house or flat can be very profitable, but there are pitfalls. Judi Bevan offers a trouble-free guide to letting your home ACTIVITY may be picking up in the housing market, but many homeowners still have an unsaleable house or flat on their hands. When personal circumstances change, and the need to move becomes imperative, one solution is to let the property on a furnished basis. With lower mortgage rates and stable rents, it can even be profitable. But there are pitfalls. Agents can go bankrupt, tenants can disappear, cause damage or run up huge telephone bills. Here is a guide to trouble free letting: AGENTS. Most established estate agents have letting divisions. Smaller agents may give a more personal service, but as one month's deposit is normally held by them, it is important that they are solvent. Visit them in their own office for an idea of the size and permanence of the business. Check out at least two agents and compare rates. Read the terms thoroughly. For 10 per cent most agents will find tenants, obtain references, show tenants round the property, take an inventory, and draw up six months' assured tenancy agreements. For a fuller service, such as the cleaning and maintenance of the property, servicing of the appliances and rent collection the fee is likely to be 12.5 per cent or 15 per cent. TENANTS. Usually portrayed as the victims, bad ones can make a landlord's life hell. They should be employed, or registered students attending a recognised academic institution. Obtain written references from employers or university or college and insist on meeting them. Make it clear that only those who sign the contract are entitled to live there. Tenants have a way of inviting their friends to stay permanently. Tenants and landlord should sign a six-month assured tenancy agreement approved by a lawyer. Incorporate a clause in the agreement, stipulating the number of people who may live in the property. MOVING IN. Have the gas and electricity meters read, or read them yourself with the agent. Make sure the new tenants register their names with the gas, telephone and electricity companies. Take time to show the tenants round and explain how various appliances work. Your washing machine may be simplicity itself, but if they do not know how to clean the filter, there could be problems. If you are not available, leave clear written instructions stuck on to the appliance. Remember, it is the landlord's responsibility to pay for repair bills and it is often difficult to prove negligence. MOVING OUT. Two weeks before tenants are due to move out, arrange to have the meters read and the telephone disconnected. Ask them NOT to have the gas or electricity cut off. (It can be a nightmare to try and be reconnected at short notice.) Inspect the property with your agent immediately they move out and before the deposit has been returned. Check the heating and test all the appliances. Do NOT rely on the tenant's word that everything is working. Check the inventory with the agent and assess any damage and cleaning. Tenants should leave the property as they found it. Return the deposit to them, minus any expenses. Make sure you have all the keys back. FINANCE. In order for the property to pay for itself, the rent - minus tax - should meet the mortgage repayments. One factor in the equation is that once you are letting, the property ceases to be your main residence and you will lose your Miras tax relief. Tax on the rental income is payable at your top marginal rate and is assessed in advance. Legally, you must inform your building society of your intention to let the property. They will tell the Inland Revenue. Some building societies charge an additional half percentage point in interest when properties are let. Often, the threat of moving your mortgage will deter them. Rent is paid in advance. Outgoings include the mortgage repayments, tax less 10 per cent wear and tear plus any decoration. For example a house or flat worth Pounds 100,000 will fetch around Pounds 800 a month. At a mortgage rate of 8 per cent that will finance a Pounds 55,000 loan assuming tax at 40 per cent minus 10 per cent of the rent on wear and tear. On a tax rate of 25 per cent the loan financed would be Pounds 65,000. If you plan to rent for more than a year or so, it may be worth getting a fixed rate mortgage. Adjust your insurance which should now be for the building only. Tenants are responsible for any damage and may take out their own contents insurance. HOUSE. The better maintained, the higher the rent you can ask. Do not expect tenants to take care of the property, no matter how nice they seem. Do not leave valuable ornaments, pictures and furniture in the property. Do not leave non-essential electrical appliances such as televisions or sound systems. Impress on tennants the need to telephone you or the agent immediately there are problems. Be a good landlord or landlady and they are more likely to be good tenants.</p>

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / ANC supporters march in Durban About 100,000 supporters of the African National Congress marched yesterday through the streets of Durban, in Natal province, to demand the freedom to vote in South Africa's April elections. The march was the first event in the ANC's planned mass action campaign aimed at increasing popular pressure on KwaZulu homeland leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who is boycotting the poll. Political moves are also afoot to try to avert a threatened confrontation between the multi-party Transitional Executive Council and Chief Buthelezi. President FW de Klerk is expected to meet Chief Buthelezi at the weekend to seek a political solution to the Natal crisis. He is expected to warn the KwaZulu leader that if he does not ensure free political campaigning in the homeland, and perhaps accept that his Inkatha Freedom party participates at least in provincial elections, the president will have to allow the TEC to intervene in the homeland's administration. ANC officials said they did not believe Chief Buthelezi could be legally removed from power, but that his control over areas such as homeland policing could be withdrawn. This would be tantamount to toppling him, while leaving him nominally in control. They did not believe his government would be overturned by popular protest, as happened in the Bophuthatswana homeland a fortnight ago. About a quarter of South Africa's voters are in Natal, raising the risk that a spoilt poll in the province could cast doubt on the national result.</p>

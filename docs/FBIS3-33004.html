Immediately afterward, his main contender, Costa Rican Foreign  Minister Bernd Niehaus, said he regretted the president's  anticipated defeat. The first vote will be held on 27 March.  Gaviria must garner at least 18 votes. Otherwise, there will  have to be a runoff election.    [Gaviria] "I will work to make a reality of the Bolivian  dream of integration, reflected initially in the creation of a  great free zone, which will link the vast territories from  Alaska to the Patagonia and which will show the world the  grandeur of America."    With that as his principal goal, President Gaviria announced  his candidacy for the post of OAS secretary general. The  consultation phase to present his name for consideration by the  countries of the hemisphere began early this year. After  requests by countries such as Mexico, Canada, and the United  States, Gaviria sent Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin to Central  America and the Caribbean to explore his possibilities. Today,  he is certain of the support that he has and is therefore  running in the race.    [Gaviria] "If by the decision of the countries who are part  of the OAS the Colombian president is elected secretary general,  I would like to see my fellow citizens regard it also as a  triumph which undoubtedly belongs to all of us."    Gaviria invited his contenders to engage in a calm debate,  devoid of rhetoric and without divisions between large and  small, or poor and rich countries.    [Gaviria] "I have great respect for my contenders. I invite  them to express our respective views in such a manner that  rather than reflect a race, which would be futile, it will  demonstrate our desire to contribute to a prosperous and  peaceful future which we want for our peoples."    Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus told CMI this  evening that he has 20 votes for sure, as opposed to 12 for the  president. The foreign minister had this to say:    [Niehaus] "The fact that the name of a president, a  president  as respected as President Gaviria, the president of such a dear  and beloved country as Colombia, is naturally.... [pauses] it  makes one think about how this process is evolving. How will it  continue? Well it will continue with respect for the president,  with love for Colombia, but with support for Costa Rica. I have  no reason to object to the Colombian president's decisions.  What I must do is respect them. I don't think he will do so.  If he does, with all due respect, I don't give him any chance."    Tonight in Mexico City Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus  reacted  to the official announcement of the candidacy of President  Gaviria.    [Niehaus] "I believe that President Gaviria may have 10 or  12  votes. I think that reality has probably been kept from him,  otherwise he would not have announced his candidacy officially.  We will see the end result five weeks from now."    [Unidentified Reporter] "How many votes do you have Mr.  Foreign Minister?"    [Niehaus] "I have 23 votes at the present time."    According to Colombian Foreign Ministry estimates, President  Gaviria has 20 votes for sure. That is two more than are needed  to be elected on the first vote. Foreign Minister Niehaus today  has only 14 votes. Colombian estimates indicate that the  Colombian foreign minister's mission in Latin America was  successful. President Gaviria has the certain votes of countries  such as Paraguay, Uruguay, Bolivia, the United States, Mexico,  Peru, and Brazil -- the majority of influential countries in the  international context.    Meanwhile, Niehaus has the support of Central American and  Caribbean countries. Chile has also announced its intention to  vote for the Costa Rican foreign minister, but President Frei's  inauguration on 11 March could tilt the balance in Colombia's  favor. These countries have signed a document of support.  Countries that have announced they will change their vote have  done so only privately. Publicly, Niehaus, who is on a  Caribbean tour, appears to have the majority. There is  certainty, however, that when voting time comes around, the name  of a president will have more relevance. Today's official  announcement was made based on the certainty of triumph.    Miguel Angel Burelli, Venezuelan foreign minister, has only  the vote of his country and its neighbor, Suriname. With the  launching of President Gaviria in the race, the Narino  Government Palace believes that the numbers will lean toward  Colombia. The results will be seen on 27 March.</p>

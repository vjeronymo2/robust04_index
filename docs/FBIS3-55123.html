			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Danish Defense Minister Hans Haekkerup, who is  visiting Latvia, said at a meeting with reporters today that  NATO would most probably turn down Lithuania's request for  admittnce to that organization. Haekkerup explained that he has  that impression knowing the attitude of NATO member states  towards the involvement of new states in the organization.    A special program proposed by the United States for states  which wish to cooperate with NATO will be discussed at a  conference of the heads of NATO member states scheduled to take  place in Brussels on 10 January. Participation in this program  would be a mandatory condition to become a NATO member state.    The program provides that countries will be able to conclude  bilateral cooperation agreements with NATO. NATO will provide  necessary consultations for such countries in cases when their  territorial integrity, security or political sovereignty might  be threatened.    NATO is also ready to cooperate with the Baltic states and  Russia within the framework of such a program. Haekkerup drew  journalists' attention to the fact that the conclusion of  bilateral agreements would allow NATO to cooperate individually  with each state taking into account its peculiarities and wishes.</p>

			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / International Bonds: European Community limits issue to Ecu220m The European Community had the eurobond market to itself yesterday for the launch of its widely-expected Ecu-denominated offering of seven-year bonds, although the amount raised, Ecu220m, was below expectations of Ecu300m. Proceeds are expected to be on-lent to countries in eastern Europe and northern Africa. It is believed that the issue's smaller than expected size resulted from the failure of one of the loan beneficiaries to complete the paperwork in time. However, syndicate managers expect the issue to be increased to Ecu300m later. An EC official said competition to arrange the deal had been fierce, with 10 houses bidding for the mandate. However, since the EC wanted to take advantage of strong retail demand, which has been fanned by high redemptions of Ecu bonds this year and the Ecu's good performance recently, it decided not to pick the most aggressive bid. The official said other factors had been taken into consideration, such as the lead managers' large retail networks in continental Europe and their commitment to the secondary market in Ecu bonds. 'It was not the time to experiment with new people,' he said. As expected, the bonds were priced to yield well below the the French government's Ecu bonds, at 11 basis points through the interpolated yield curve. The pricing dulled the bonds' appeal to institutions but the current coupon of 7 1/4 per cent and the short payment date were clearly designed to attract retail investors. According to joint lead manager SBC, Ecu9.5bn worth of bonds have been redeemed so far this year but there has only been Ecu4bn of new issuance. A further Ecu5bn is expected to be redeemed by the end of the year. In addition, the Ecu has been performing well against other European currencies, reflecting a resurgence in belief among investors that the core European states will not give up on monetary union and the single currency. In the past week alone, the yield spread between five-year French government Ecu notes and five-year Treuhand D-Mark notes has narrowed from 118 basis points to 102 basis points. Elsewhere, favourable swap opportunities prompted a flurry of Swiss franc issues, with BNG raising SFr250m through an offering of four-year bonds and Sweden launching a SFr150m five-year issue. Portugal has signed a Dollars 2bn global multi-currency medium-term note programme. Lehman Brothers acted as global arranger.</p>

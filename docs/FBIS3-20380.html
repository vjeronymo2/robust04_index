At a news conference he held in parliament, Turkes said that  even though certain circles expected the NAP to weaken because  some deputies had left it, the party increased its votes in  municipal councils by 250 percent and the number of its mayors  by 300 percent, to 155.    Turkes said that the citizens in eastern and southeastern  Turkey showed in the elections that they do not want to secede.  He added: The election results are a good lesson to those who  try to interfere in Turkey's domestic affairs.    Turkes pointed out that the NAP received good results in  eastern and southeastern Anatolia. He said: The elections were  held in a mature way, with a high rate of participation. They  resulted in a victory for democracy.    The NAP leader stated that the citizens voted in favor of  maintaining the coalition, adding: The election results show  that the people do not want chaos, or the state business to be  delayed through frequent elections. They show that the people  want the present coalition to remain power. That is my  conclusion.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 19 Jun (MENA)--UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi met  today with a group of senior south Yemeni officials led by  'Abdallah al-Asnaj, foreign minister of the self-declared  government in Aden.    Brahimi said the meeting is part of the efforts being made  to  establish a cease-fire and set up the necessary mechanism for  its verification.    Al-Asnaj said that Egypt's position is continuing to be that  of a big brother concerned about the stability of the Arab  region and eager to protect pan-Arab security. He noted that  President Husni Mubarak has repeatedly tried to achieve peace  and end the fighting in Yemen.    Al-Asnaj said: We are responding, but Sanaa is not, to the  voice of reason and the virtuous call made by President Mubarak,  underlined by Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan of the United Arab  Emirates, and expressed by the Saudi Government.    He added: If a delegation from Sanaa comes here committed to  the requirements of peace, Security Council Resolution 924, and  the call of conscience that prohibits a Muslim from killing his  Muslim brother, it will find a full response from us.    Al-Asnaj expressed hope that the Sanaa delegation will  arrive  and be able to make a decision that will be binding on officials  in Sanaa.    He said that the Aden delegation will maintain its contacts  with Brahimi. We are anxious to assist his mission and make it  successful, he said.    He said the "Democratic Republic of Yemen" will remain in  constant touch with the envoy of the UN secretary general to  advise him on developments. He added: It was natural for us to  come to Cairo to continue the talks to restore peace in Yemen  and to observe Security Council Resolution 924, which calls on  the concerned parties to stop firing immediately. We have  expressed readiness to implement the resolution as soon as  possible, but the government in Sanaa keeps evading the  resolution and refrains from complying with it.    Al-Asnaj said Sanaa has to abide by the requirements of the  Security Council resolution, respond to the world community's  will, and end the ongoing aggression against defenseless Yemenis.    He noted that more than a month ago Sanaa said that it was a  few kilometers away from Aden and that it would enter the city.  He said that Sanaa will find in Aden strong resistance,  valiance, and steadfastness because the entire south rejects  invasion and occupation and views Sanaa troops as an occupation  force that lacks any legitimate justification for its genocidal  war.    He said that Aden's separation announcement reflected the  people's right to self-determination. If Arab political  recognition has not yet been announced, he said, it is because  the fraternal countries are evaluating the situation. I do not  think this will take long, he said.    Meanwhile, Lakhdar Brahimi said that if a delegation from  Sanaa arrives in Cairo today, he will meet with it separately.  A meeting between the northern and southern delegations, he  said, will depend on the results of the talks with each side  individually.</p>

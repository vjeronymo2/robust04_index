			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Venezuela president seeks pact THE president of Venezuela, Mr Ramon Jose Velasquez, has called for a national accord to ensure economic development and political stability, writes Joseph Mann from Caracas. Speaking in Venezuela's capital, Mr Velasquez warned that the accord must be reached over the next few months, if a new president, to be elected on December 5, was to have enough support in Congress to continue with essential economic reforms. The accord would be similar to Mexico's 'social pact', with Venezuelan political parties, organised labour and business agreeing a set of economic and social goals. The president added that a reform of Venezuela's 1961 constitution was necessary, and called for establishing the post of prime minister, a double round of voting for president, and greater power for state and municipal governments, in a country where presidential power has always been dominant.</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / People: Hodkinson in surprise move Jim Hodkinson is making a surprise return to the Kingfisher retailing group to head its do-it-yourself business B&amp;Q, only two months after leaving the company for Home Depot, the US DIY giant. This time he moves on to an expanded main board, as does Philippe Frances. Frances had run Darty, the French company acquired by Kingfisher last year, and is now chief executive of the entire electrical retailing sector, including both Comet and Darty. Hodkinson, 50, was taken on by Home Depot in July as a consultant to examine expansion opportunities for the US group in Europe. 'This is a remarkable move,' commented on City analyst. 'How many other FTSE companies have lost an executive in July and reappointed him as a board director in September?' Kingfisher said that after an extensive search for a new head for its DIY business, it had concluded Hodkinson was the best man for the job. This coincided with Hodkinson's decision to return to the UK from Home Depot's base in Atlanta because he was unhappy about being separated from his wife and children, who remained in Bournemouth. Hodkinson joined B&amp;Q as a store manager in 1972, and became operations and personnel director in the 1980s before becoming chief executive and deputy chairman. He was responsible for launching the DIY price war of 1992, with a series of promotional weekends offering huge savings. He moved on to the post of director of international development in June 1992, amid apparent disagreements between him and the chairman, Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, over strategy. His return to B&amp;Q suggests those differences have been patched up, and may presage a renewed international push for B&amp;Q. However, the priority is likely to be improving the performance of the UK operations in a difficult market, and opening more of the large-format B&amp;Q Warehouse stores. Kingfisher's said its appointment of Frances, 48, to the main board was a further indication that it now sees itself as a 'Franco-British business'. The two new directors will strengthen the depth of retail experience on a board dominated by non-career retailers, analysts commented. 'We wanted to make sure the same emphasis was put on retail skills as on strategic skills,' Kingfisher said.</p>

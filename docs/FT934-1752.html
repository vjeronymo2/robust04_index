			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Industrial orders 'improved' Order books in manufacturing have improved but expectations about output have slipped, says a Confederation of British Industry survey published today. Export orders are still ranked below normal by a third of companies, but are still at their highest level for six months. Inflationary pressures continue to be extremely weak, with more manufacturers expecting to cut domestic prices in the next four months than to raise them. The results from the CBI's latest poll of manufacturers indicate that output should continue its recent patchy rise in the next few months. The survey covered 1,383 companies across 50 industries. It was conducted between November 26 and December 14, with most of the replies coming after the Budget. Overall orders covering both the UK and export markets were ranked below normal by 37 per cent of companies, with 18 per cent saying they were above normal. The difference between the two readings of 19 percentage points establishes an improving trend compared with the negative balances of 23 points and 31 points in the CBI's November and October surveys. A balance of 9 percentage points of companies said output volumes were likely to rise in the next four months. The balance was 12 points last month and 8 points in October. This month's survey is the twelfth in a row to point to higher output volumes. Although considered unsatisfactory by most companies, the export outlook improved on November, with a negative balance of 14 points of companies saying export order books are below normal. This is the best result since the negative balance of 10 points recorded in June.</p>

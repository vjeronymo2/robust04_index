			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 26 May (INA) -- An official spokesman today  accused some U.S. circles and the Jewish lobby in Washington of  trying to mislead the U.S. Congress and to hide the causes of  the mysterious illness that has afflicted thousands of U.S. and  British soldiers that fought in in the Gulf war.    Commenting on the report presented to the U.S. Congress by  Senator Donald Riegle alleging that the Iraqis used chemical  weapons against the U.S. forces during the Gulf war, the  spokesman said: Medical circles throughout the world can easily  diagnose chemical weapons injuries, therefore, it is illogical  that U.S. medical circles, which are known for their scientific  and technological progress, have failed to diagnose the cause of  this illness.    He said: The political pressure groups in the Congress seem  to have decided to exploit this case to realize political  objectives against Iraq.    The spokesman added: Senator Donald Riegle's report consists  of a host of personal testimonies by soldiers, and is not a  technical and scientific report. This report conflicts with  what had been announced by Senator John Rockefeller, head of the  committee that investigated this issue. Rockefeller said that  his committee had carried out research into this mysterious  illness for six months, and the results showed that the U.S.  Defense Department had used for its soldiers medicines that were  still being tested. These medicines include vaccines and pills  that are still in the research stage.    Senator George Mitchell, leader of the Democratic majority,  demanded that an investigation be carried out by the U.S.  Defense department and concerned quarters. There was also  another reason for this illness, which the U.S. Administration  is trying to hide: that is, the extensive use of munitions that  contain depleted uranium. Preliminary investigations, that were  suppressed by the U.S. Defense Department, showed that the U.S.  soldiers had not been warned against exposure to this radiation,  and had not been trained to avoid radiation from such munitions.</p>

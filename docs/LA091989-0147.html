			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COMPUTER-AIDED ENGINEERING UNVEILED;  </P> <P> IBM SEEKS TO AUTOMATE SOFTWARE DESIGN  </P> <P> International Business Machines Corp. today announced a system for writing  computer programs with the help of computer programs.  </P> <P> The world's biggest computer company held a news conference to announce its  commitment to "computer-aided software engineering," which is intended to make  software more reliable and faster to develop.  </P> <P> More than 30 companies expressed support for IBM's blueprint, demonstrating  IBM's influence in the computer business.  </P> <P> Disorganized writing of software has led to sprawling, patched-together,  unmanageable programs that take up valuable programmers' time and stall  innovation. The problem has become so acute that corporate chief executives are  pressing their computer chiefs for a solution.  </P> <P> "The real driving force behind our industry is that we have got to figure out  how to build better software, faster," Kim Addington, vice president for  marketing at KnowledgeWare Inc. in Atlanta, said.  </P> <P> Sales of tools for computer-aided software engineering already total about $300  million a year, even though fewer than 10% of customers are even dabbling in  it, according to CASE Research Corp. of Bellevue, Wash.  </P> <P> CASE Research expects sales to start jumping about a year from now when  software toolmakers have brought their products into line with IBM's de facto  industry standard.  </P> <P> At least five years will be required to achieve largely automatic programming,  but IBM's commitment at least legitimizes the concept of it, consultants say.  </P> <P> IBM said it will come out next June with a "repository," a library containing  the information that all the different software engineering tools need to do  their jobs. Strict rules will ensure that all toolmakers structure their  information in a consistent way.  </P></p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Wimpey halves interim dividend WIMPEY, Britain's second largest housebuilder, yesterday announced a Pounds 7.2m first-half pre-tax loss and halved its interim dividend to 2p. The company also proposed to halve its final dividend to 3.25p but did not rule out a deeper cut if trading conditions deteriorated further. The share price, which fell a fifth the previous week, fell another 6p yesterday to 71p compared with a peak of 188p four months ago. It was Wimpey's first dividend cut since it went public. The first-half loss compared with a Pounds 200,000 pre-tax profit a year ago. Turnover fell from Pounds 887m to Pounds 731m. Mr Roger Wood, finance director, said every division apart from commercial property had made lower profits. In particular, he blamed further weakness in the UK and North American housing markets. UK house sales, which began the year well but fell after the general election, fell from 3,131 to 2,803. US sales fell from 673 to 540. Margins remained under pressure with house prices continuing to fall and the group was still working through land bought expensively in the late 1980s. The average price of a UK home had fallen from Pounds 65,000 to Pounds 60,000 since the first half of last year, said Mr Dwyer. The value of the group's construction order book fell from Pounds 800m to Pounds 600m during the 12 months on the decline in residential and commercial property markets and a fall-off in work on the Channel tunnel. Property profits were helped by the sale for Pounds 45m in February of St Alphage house, a London office block, one of a string of disposals made by the company to reduce borrowings. Interest paid fell from Pounds 15.4m to Pounds 12.2m. Net debt of Pounds 232m, representing gearing of 43 per cent, would be reduced further in the second half following the receipt of Pounds 110m for the company's 50 per cent stake in the Little Britain office development in London. Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive, declined to comment on the financial crisis at Eurotunnel caused by claims for extra payments of more than Pounds 1bn by Channel tunnel contractors. He said negotiations with Eurotunnel were at a delicate stage. Lex, Page 20; Recession warning, Page 8; Market, Page 40</p>

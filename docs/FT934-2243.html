			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Anger over change to new agency rules British companies which have sacked their commercial agents and renegotiated their agency agreements to reduce the impact of new rules bringing UK law into line with Europe may lose money following last-minute changes. Companies had been advised, on the basis of draft regulations issued by the Department of Trade and Industry in June, to consider renegotiating their agreements because cancelling them after January 1 could cost between Pounds 5,000 and Pounds 80,000 per agreement in compensation. The regulations, which will apply to any agency agreement in force on January 1, are designed to give self-employed commercial agents greater protection. They make it harder for companies to terminate agreements and guarantee agents compensation if sacked. The draft regulations provided that compensation should be paid for any damage suffered by the agent following termination of the agreement. But after complaints that this left companies open to pay unlimited damages the government has made a last-minute change to the regulations to allow industry to cap compensation. Instead of paying damages companies can agree to indemnify the agent for a sum equivalent to a maximum of one year's commission if the agreement is terminated. The change, which was set out in the final regulations published on Monday, gives companies greater flexibility in negotiating new agreements. Mr Ian Campbell, director-general of the Institute of Export, welcomed the change but said: 'I can imagine a lot of companies will be annoyed if they have acted on advice and changed their agreements, and will now have to spend money to change them again.' Mr Colin Dawson, managing director of Frank Whitelegg, which makes coil winding machines and equipment for electric-motor repairs, said: 'It must be a good idea to limit the compensation. Many companies could have been in for an expensive time if the directive went through unchanged.' Mr Tim Foster, of City solicitors Warner Cranston, said companies which renegotiated agreements in anticipation of the new law were annoyed that they had to change them again before January 1. The DTI said yesterday it had been made clear that the regulations published in June were only a draft and that changes could be made to the final text. It added: 'We would never advise people to give advice to industry on the basis of a draft.' But Ms Rebecca Attree, an agency law specialist with London solicitors Laytons, pointed out that even those clients who had held back from renegotiating their agreements in case there were last-minute changes to the rules were irritated. 'They now find they have very little time left to meet the deadline - 10 days to be exact,' she said.</p>

			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> RACING CREW CHIEF SUSPENDED  </P> <P> Roush Racing has suspended crew chief Robin Pemberton for 30 days for using an  illegal engine part on Mark Martin's winning car at the Pontiac 400.  </P> <P> Martin's victory on Sunday at Richmond, Va., was allowed to stand, but the  racing team was fined $40,000 and lost its championship points.  </P> <P> The record fine by NASCAR was assessed because the team's Ford was found to  have an illegal 2 1/2-inch spacer on the carburetor. Spacers up to 2 inches are  legal.  </P> <P> Team manager Steve Hmiel disagreed with NASCAR.  </P> <P> "We don't accept the notion that it was an illegal part," Hmiel said. "That is  a gray area as far as we are concerned."  </P> <P> Team owner Jack Roush has 30 days to appeal. If he does, a three-person panel  would be selected from the Stock Car Racing Commission to make a ruling.  </P> <P> Hmiel said that Pemberton was suspended without pay because Hmiel was not  informed that the 2 1/2-inch spacer was being used at Richmond and that Roush  knew about it but was assured by Pemberton that there would be no problem.  </P></p>

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Minding Your Own Business: How gypsies proved a site's salvation - Keith Wheatley visits a holiday complex that is weathering a West Country recession GYPSIES were Peter and Liz Heywood's salvation when they took over a run-down Cornish caravan site. 'We had to get rid of 32 ancient Bluebird caravans before Easter,' recalled Heywood. 'We thought giving them to gypsies was the answer. Unfortunately, when you tried to tow them, they fell apart.' Eventually the gypsies solved the problem - dismantling the Bluebirds for scrap at a fee of Pounds 10 each. The experience was an early indicator for running Trewince - no problem or solution has been predictable. The 1750 manor house, dominating the glorious Roseland peninsula south of St Austell, is a unique holiday mixture. The acres of gardens and woods surrounding the house shelter dwellings ranging from Pounds 80,000 timber lodges to pup tents containing hikers walking the adjacent south-west coastal footpath. Sea views surround Trewince and, with the National Trust owning most of the Roseland, the landscape is unspoilt. But the business outlook cannot be isolated from the trauma affecting the rest of the West Country holiday trade. All along the magical Cornish coast, hotels are closed or for sale at ridiculous prices. 'My worst guess is that we are going to be 20 per cent down on last year's turnover,' said Heywood, a former technical director of a pioneering British robotics company. In 1991, the turnover at Trewince was about Pounds 190,000, with only a very small profit. Unlike many families, the Heywoods had no dreams of leaving their comfortable suburban lives in Hertfordshire and fleeing to Cornwall. 'I was enjoying my very conventional life and my job was stimulating,' said Heywood. 'I came down in 1984 just to oblige a neighbour who was thinking of buying the place. It was terribly dilapidated but I heard God telling me to live here.' Both the Heywoods are committed Christians. Trewince cost Pounds 300,000 for just the asset. 'There were no books available so you couldn't buy it as a going concern. It was just finger in the air stuff - against all my technical and business training.' Heywood recalls his managing director 'going white' when he heard of the scheme and begging him not to do it. In the early days, it was a partnership. Both families sold their homes in Hertfordshire for Pounds 100,000 and the bank put in Pounds 100,000 plus a Pounds 24,000 facility for working capital. Early omens were not good. 'We were snowbound for weeks and it never snows in Cornwall,' said Heywood. 'We had to be operating by Easter to get some cash in, and all we had for forward bookings was a scruffy piece of paper with nine names on it. 'We discovered that Trewince had a terrific reputation - for being dirty and run-down. Some regulars in the chalets brought camp beds so that they wouldn't have to sleep on the mattresses. Yet they came because there is a kind of magic here.' The first couple of years were the usual story of undercapitalised small businesses owned by people learning the hard way. In the first year they made a loss and were too broke to go to Sainsbury's, but the second year was break-even and then a small profit began to peep through. Crisis was just around the corner, though. For personal reasons, the Heywoods' partners wanted to be bought out - and even the ever-helpful Royal Bank of Scotland was not going to turn another third of the Trewince equity into debt. Heywood's long-term plans began to appear a short-term necessity. 'It was obvious that we had to sell our assets forward to survive,' he said. Plans were submitted to put 10 timber lodges - highly-equipped three-bedroomed units - in the orchard adjoining the walled garden. They would sell for Pounds 79,000 each on a 999-year lease. The National Trust objected, and it took months and an appeal to secure permission. The delay was to prove nearly fatal. 'Our timing was perfect - it couldn't have been worse. We put up our show lodge in June 1990 and by September we had 10 firm prospects,' said Heywood. Then came the NT objection and 15 months of delay - during the worst property recession in living memory. Meanwhile, the Heywoods' partner had already been bought out with borrowed money. 'We could see ourselves going broke rapidly. It came very, very close.' The loan on the property went up to nearly Pounds 500,000 at one point, compared with a bank valuation of Pounds 950,000. At the same time, holiday cancellations were starting to come in, often accompanied by a letter telling of redundancy or family hardship. In the past 12 months, though, things have started to turn around. Three more lodges have been sold, easing some financial pressure, and good summer weather has brought in casual visitors. Providing accommodation for Christian groups and youth clubs has been useful. 'It's a good niche market and one that we're already in touch with,' said Heywood. Word-of-mouth has generally been more successful than advertising at promoting Trewince. 'It's not a holiday park, it isn't a caravan site. The Cornwall Tourist Board don't know which category to put us in.' Heywood's next goal is to put a small restaurant into the main house, where the family has a flat. 'This place is something very special and everyone who comes here feels it.' Trewince, Portscatho, Nr. Truro, Cornwall. TR2 5ET. Tel: 0872-580289.</p>

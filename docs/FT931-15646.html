			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: IRA tactics futile, claims Mayhew PRESSURE within the IRA for an end to violence is growing, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said yesterday. Leaders of the republican terrorist organisation knew no British government, either Labour or Conservative, would talk to those who resort to violence, Sir Patrick said. He added: 'There is no way out. I believe the Provisional IRA's leaders increasingly realise this, and many of them wisely want to stop.' Sir Patrick's comments, which voiced publicly what the Northern Ireland Office has long sought to argue in private, followed a speech before Christmas setting out the benefits that would arise if terrorists in the province renounced violence. He wants to portray himself as a neutral referee between aspirations of Unionist and nationalists aspirations while keeping pressure on terrorists. Sir Patrick said fresh political talks on the province's future would re-start once the new Irish government was in place. The last initiative collapsed in November. Speaking at the Belfast Rotary Club, Sir Patrick said that security forces had to strike a balance. Those calling for even tighter security, had to consider, whether, 'they are content to see all normal, commercial life strangled, to say nothing of the implicit but unjustifiable condemnation of the entire Catholic community.' But he said the IRA faced, 'further fruitless years . . they feel driven by their dead and by those 'behind the wire'. I must tell them that unless they abandon violence there will be more dead, more lives spent behind the wire, and another blighted generation.'</p>

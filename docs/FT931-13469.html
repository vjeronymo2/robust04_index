			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Lloyd's chief promises sharp cost-cutting LLOYD'S OF LONDON is poised to launch a radical assault on its cost base, Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, told a meeting of Names yesterday. Mr Middleton said neither he nor Mr David Rowland, the chairman of Lloyd's, would be prepared to continue in their jobs if the cuts were not implemented by agencies and brokers. He told a meeting organised by the Society of Names, which acts as a pressure group for lossmaking Names: 'The market must accept them or it will continue to slide. I don't want to be connected with an enterprise that doesn't want to be the best.' Mr Middleton intends to produce a detailed business plan by the second half of April. He said: 'The changes are going to be very painful, but they are very necessary. Unless we implement them, we will have no basis on which to attract capital.' Failure to implement the changes would condemn Lloyd's to 'mediocrity and growing irrelevance in the world of insurance. It is that serious.' Potentially far-reaching changes to the Lloyd's agency system - which connects the market's individual traders or Names with their underwriting syndicates - are under consideration as part of the business plan. In particular Mr Middleton will look carefully at the future of members' agencies, which deal directly with the affairs of Names. He said: 'I think it would be better to centralise everything other than investment advice and recruitment of Names.' He was bitterly critical of the way the market processes claims. 'A flow-chart of the claims payments system resembled a combination of the New York subway, the London Underground and the Paris Metro, with a map of the European railway network superimposed.' Lloyd's had managed to 'make a very simple system terribly complicated', he said. The market needed to revamp the way it collected and analysed data, added Mr Middleton. He said: 'Some of the ways information is collected are 10 times more costly than need be.' Mr Middleton has already announced a cut in the budget of the corporation, which administers the market, from Pounds 145m to Pounds 117.9m. Mr Middleton intends to tell corporation staff how the cuts will be implemented by the end of February. Lloyd's has welcomed a US court judgment in a multi-million dollar dispute involving pollution at a site operated by Shell Oil at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal in Denver, Colorado. The California Court of Appeal ruled that liability for pollution at the site is excluded from the company's insurance policies, where Shell manufactured chemicals from 1952. Underwriters at Lloyd's were among a number of insurers which provided liability coverage to Shell. Shell was obliged to clean up the site with the cost estimated at more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m). The London market's potential exposure is estimated at several hundred million dollars. The case is one of dozens involving insurers, including Lloyd's and companies in the London market, and US policyholders. Shell originally filed suit against its insurers in 1983, seeking to show that its insurance policies made insurers liable. In 1988 insurers won initial judgment in the San Francisco court. Lloyd's said: 'This is a very welcome decision in important and extremely complex litigation.'</p>

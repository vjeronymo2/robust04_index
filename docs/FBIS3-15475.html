He declared about this at  the press conference held on Friday evening in Moscow. As he  said, subventions to territories "represent the greatest problem  today."    He also pointed out that due to privatization which is being  implemented in a wrong way, currently "many important  enterprises have appeared without a real owner." "A working  staff cannot be an owner," emphasized Soskovets and said that  respect towards working staffs should be demonstrated in timely  issuance of wages and several other measures but not in the  transfer of enterprises to them.    Soskovets laid great hope for the second stage of the  privatization which, as he said, "will help to remove many  problems" by means of organizing large investment funds for  industry.    Soskovets mentioned defense, state borders guarding, and  security of domestic producer as the major functions to be  preserved by the state. "This security is an extremely  important measure which has been unjustly forgotten," said he.</p>

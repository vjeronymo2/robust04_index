			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Authorities in Mexico City have recovered scores of priceless jade, gold and  stone artifacts taken in the 1985 Christmas Day robbery of the National Museum  of Anthropology. Federal agents found 133 of the 140 stolen treasures from the  ancient Mayan, Aztec, Zapotec and Mixtec civilizations in canvas sacks stashed  in a home in suburban Mexico City. Ten people were arrested after a series of  raids on several residences. Among the items recovered were a Zapotec mask of  the bat god Murielago and an obsidian Aztec sculpture of a monkey. Experts have  described them as two of the most valuable pieces in a museum crammed with  irreplaceable objects from civilizations dating back thousands of years. ALEENE  MacMINN  </P></p>

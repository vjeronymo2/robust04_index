			<p>BFN     [Text] The strategic area of Yerganik is completely in the  hand of the forces of the Islamic Army, and the mojahedin are  defending it confidently. Quoting a responsible security  source, a BAKHTAR INFORMATION AGENCY correspondent reports:  After their consecutive defeats in the northern provinces of the  country, the militia recently mounted a failed assault on the  Yerganik Pass. As a result of the bravery of the Islamic Army  units and the mojahedin, the attack was repelled and heavy loss  of life and damage was inflicted on the aggressors. The report  adds: The militia began their attack at a time when Islamic Army  units had confronted the enemy with humiliating defeats in  various parts of Baghlan Province and conquered their positions  one after another.</p>

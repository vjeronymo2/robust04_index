			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Profit-taking follows weaker bond prices Wall Street After three consecutive record closes, US stocks paused yesterday as a sell-off in bonds gave investors an excuse to book profits, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 14.35 easier at 3,964.01 and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 1.99 at 479.62. The American SE composite inched 0.31 ahead to 485.99, but the Nasdaq composite receded 3.23 to 797.24 after crossing the 800 threshold for the first time on Monday. New York SE volume, at 322.5m shares, remained heavy. The day's economic data was generally positive for stocks. The National Association of Purchasing Management revealed that its January index of business conditions rose to 57.7 per cent, from 57.1 per cent in December. The figure, a little better than expected, showed the economy continued to expand last month, after an especially robust December. The overall impression was supported by the Commerce Department, which reported that December construction spending rose by 2.6 per cent, well ahead of expectations. But both sets of data rattled the bond market, and the NAPM report, a better leading indicator, was particularly unnerving. It included evidence of a sharp rise in prices paid by manufacturers, rekin-dling the inflationary fears of fixed-rate investors. As a consequence the price of the benchmark 30-year government bond was down by a point to 99 3/16 late in the session. After a positive opening, stocks quickly followed the lead of bonds. The setback included some of the high-flying cyclical issues which have led the market's recent rally. 3M shed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 105 7/8 , United Technologies Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 66 5/8 and Bethlehem Steel Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 22 3/4 . Tenneco, a diversified industrial group, fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 56 in spite of its announcement of strong fourth-quarter operating results. However, Caterpillar, the heavy equipment manufacturer, showed no sign of flagging. The stock was Dollars 1 1/2 higher at Dollars 105 5/8 . Allied Signal added Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 79 3/4 and International Paper Dollars 1 at Dollars 76 1/8 . Allegheny-Ludlum, a steel products supplier, climbed into the NYSE's most active list after disappointing investors with its fourth-quarter results. The issue retreated Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 20 3/4 , in part because of a downgrading by JP Morgan. Retailing shares were mixed after the Johnson Redbook Service said poor January sales would hurt earnings of some store groups. Sears lost Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 53 3/4 , but JC Penney rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 53 3/4 . Among regional telephone operators, Bell Atlantic declined Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 55 amid growing concern over its proposed merger with Tele-Communications, Dollars  1/2 easier at Dollars 26 3/4 . On the Nasdaq, technology stocks were generally weaker. Canada Toronto stocks rose in active trading, hitting a record high for the eleventh time this year. Precious metal issues were to the fore as Comex gold rose on fund buying and rallying silver prices. The TSE 300 index closed 36.4 stronger at 4,591.3 and advances outpaced falls by 476 to 369 after volume of 96m shares valued at CDollars 1.16bn. Ten of the 14 stock groups ended higher. The golds and real estate indices climbed 3.7 and 2.1 per cent respectively, while the energy group gained 1.6 per cent.</p>

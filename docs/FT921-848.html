			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Panel seeks backing for US high-tech development A PANEL representing academia, business and government yesterday said the US government should pour billions of dollars into high-technology development and into programmes which would speed the commercialisation of new discoveries. Foreign companies would be allowed to share in pre-commercial research programmes if they make 'substantial contributions' to the projects and to US gross domestic product. Mr Harold Brown, panel chairman and former US defence secretary, called for 'a new alliance between government and industry in pre-commercial areas'. The panel - appointed by the National Academies of Sciences and Engineering and the Institute of Medicine - called for a Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.8bn) Civilian Technology Corporation to hasten commercialisation of new products. The time lag between product design and commercialisation in key US industries 'significantly exceeds that of foreign competitors', according to the report, which was ordered by Congress. The panel did not call for an 'industrial policy', but if implemented, its recommendations would lead to the use of vast government resources for the advantage of US industry. In its report, The Government Role in Civilian Technology*, the panel said the new CTC would be financed by a one-time outlay to create joint R&amp;D ventures with the private sector. Industry would initiate the projects, and they would be 'insulated as much as possible' from political influence. The report followed a day after Mrs Barbara Franklin, the new US commerce secretary, presented her department's considerably less ambitious technology policy. *The Government Role in Civilian Technology: Building a New Alliance.

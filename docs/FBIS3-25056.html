			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Z.B. du Toit] </F>   [Text] A strange document claiming to be coming from the  South African Communist Party [SACP], and in which a detailed  conspiracy is spelled out to establish a communist state in  South Africa, surfaced late this week and had Transvaal farmers  fuming.    An altercation ensued yesterday between Transvaal  Agricultural Union [TAU] President Dries Bruwer and the SACP's  Jeremy Cronin after members of the TAU's general council  unanimously expressed their opposition to allowing political  parties on Transvaal farms for their election campaigns.    Such action brings Transvaal farmers in conflict with the  electoral constitution as it will prevent free access by  political parties to the hundreds of thousands of black voters  on Transvaal farms. Mr. Bruwer told RAPPORT outright: "If the  electoral constitution conflicts with law and order, then we  choose law and order. All hell will break loose should they  dare to touch one farmer."  <H5>  Challenge </H5>   Yesterday Mr. Cronin directed a challenge at Mr. Bruwer to  publish the document. "There is no such document," he added.    Bruwer, convinced of the document's authenticity, faxed it  to  RAPPORT.    In the document are detailed particulars on how the SACP  grabbed the opportunity to negotiate with the government in  order to promote its conspiracy to put into place a communist  state, and how it is going ahead with these plans. Some of the  sensitive statements in the document are as follows:     -  "We have not as yet altered our objectives. We have said,  well and good, we will negotiate to reach a few compromises, but  negotiations will be a form of struggle to weaken the  government. We looked for ways to weaken its security forces  while we build up our political force. It is also important for  us to build up our armed capability. This is the reason for our  double agenda."    -  "Negotiations have become the most important terrain of the  struggle."    -  "The armed struggle has been suspended so as to confuse the  security forces and give the SACP room to maneuver in the  confusion that resulted."    -  "We have to organize MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- ANC Military  Wing] more effectively within the National Peacekeeping Force.  Meanwhile, we must spare no trouble in bringing our weaponry  into the country."   <H5>    Two Phases </H5>    -  The "national democratic revolution" is taking place in  two phases: The first stage is up to election day and the  second will come with the introduction of the policy of  reconstruction to transform South Africa into a workers' state  and to manipulate the constitution-writing process with the view  of establishing a socialist South Africa.    -  "The armed struggle has always been a 'golden thread' right  through the national democratic revolutionary phase and will be  as such during the transitional phase after the election. This  strategy of a low intensity war in the townships and to arm the  masses fits in with our strategy."   <H5>    Authenticity </H5>   Mr. Bruwer told RAPPORT yesterday he does not doubt the  authenticity of the document. It has apparently been received  from someone in the 'intelligence community." The Defense Force  also has a copy of it, he said.    This week he is to see SACP Chairman Joe Slovo about the  matter, Mr. Bruwer added. "It all means that a party which  still engages in violence and has a secret agenda has access to  farms. Anxiety is rife among farm laborers, with tension among  especially Zulus and others mounting. Political parties now  want to visit them to campaign for votes, thereby setting the  scene for unrest and intimidation. Farm laborers are free to  exercise their political rights, but political parties must not  come and meddle with us farmers. The electoral constitution is  draconian."  <H5>  `Blatant Lies' </H5>   Yesterday Mr. Cronin said that Mr. Bruwer's allegation that  the SACP is preparing itself for armed action is a "blatant lie."    "This allegation gives rise to the real question: Who  exactly is preparing for an armed struggle? Over the last six  months thousands of white farmers have been armed by the Defense  Force's commando network. Right now it is not the farms of  Bruwer's members, but the offices of our allies, that are being  bombed," Mr. Cronin said.    At the time of going to press RAPPORT had not yet  established  the authenticity of the document, but security experts point out  that certain elements in the document "do not rhyme with the  style of the SACP."</p>

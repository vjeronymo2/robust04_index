A survey shows that 130 transnational corporations have  established 300 projects involving contractual investment  totalling three billion U.S. dollars in Shanghai, China's  largest economic center, and Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Hubei  provinces.    Included are one quarter of the world's 100 largest  transnational industrial corporations.    Shanghai has witnessed the establishment of 204 projects  with  a total contractual investment of 2.4 billion U.S. dollars by  128 transnational corporations; and Jiangsu, one of China's most  economically-developed provinces, has approved the setting up of  60 projects funded by transnational corporations.    Ningbo, one of China's 14 open coastal cities in Zhejiang  Province, and Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei Province,  have reported an increase in the numbers.    These projects funded by transnational corporations are in  the fields of motor vehicle manufacturing, electronics and  telecommunications, computers, biochemicals, new materials,  precision instruments and port construction.    Economists here agreed that transnational corporations have  boosted their confidence in making investment in the Chang Jiang  river valley.    Robert Allen, chairman of the board of directors of the  AT&amp;T  company of the United States, said that China is developing  toward a modern society and is in need of a host of advanced  products. Therefore, his company will pursue a long-term  investment strategy in China.    According to the chairman, the first project, the Shanghai  AT&amp;T company, has become a key enterprise through four years'  hard effort. Its products now occupy one-fourth of the market  on the mainland.    According to the latest statistics, the Chang Jiang river  valley has more than 30,000 foreign-funded projects involving  more than 35 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for one-fourth of  the total foreign investment on the Chinese mainland.    So far over 10,000 projects have gone into operation, and 80  percent of them are profitable.    Investments made by transnational corporations in the Chang  Jiang river valley are concentrated on pillar industries,  infrastructure facilities, real estate, tourism facilities and  the land development by large tracts.    At present, a number of Hong Kong companies are cooperating  with Shanghai in improving its urban transport facilities and  constructing a commercial center.    The Shanghai municipal government plans to open more markets  and construction of infrastructure facilities including a power  plant, a subway and an airport to attract foreign investment,  from transnational corporations in particular, this year.    Construction of the Suzhou Industrial Park, a  Singapore-Chinese joint venture, is proceeding smoothly.    The largest Sino-foreign project in Jiangsu Province, the  industrial park, which covers 70 square kilometers, is receiving  streams of overseas investors.    So far the park has concluded cooperative contracts on more  than 50 projects with a sum of three billion U.S. dollars on  contract.    The projects are in the electronics, machinery, textiles,  and  tourism industries.    Port construction in Shanghai, Nanjing, Lusi, Ningbo and  Wuhan along the Chang Jiang river has attracted strong  investment from Hong Kong.    According to some investors, the Chang Jiang river valley,  in  particular the Chang Jiang river delta consisting of Shanghai,  Jiangsu and Zhejiang, has been provided with a better economic  foundation, talented people and improved infrastructure  facilities.    The densely populated area will offer conditions and market  for foreign-funded enterprises to prosper.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Singapore, May 20 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia's ban  on British firms from bidding for government contracts cannot be  compared with American trade policy in Asia, Deputy Prime  Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Friday. He said the Malaysian ban  was not an attempt to impose its standards and values on the  British.    Malaysia had no choice but to impose the ban because the  country was made a victim and falsely accused of wrongdoings in  Anglo-Malaysian trade by the British media, he said.    We suffer in every single decision that we made... Every  contract awarded to the British will create problems for the  government, for the leaders and the people, he told reporters at  the airport here before returning to Kuala Lumpur.    Anwar was asked whether Malaysia's action against British  companies could be compared to the United States' policy to link  trade with human rights issues such as towards China.</p>

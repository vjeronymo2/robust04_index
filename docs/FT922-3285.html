			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Technology: Wide-eyed at the view: A new type of television is taking shape If you've just bought a new television set with a 36-inch square screen to show off to the neighbours, you're out of luck. Consumer electronics manufacturers say that the latest hot product is wide-screen TV. As the name implies, it offers pictures that are much wider than deep. Many European manufacturers, and the Japanese in their home market, have introduced wide-screen TVs in the hope that the premium prices which the new technology commands will boost their profits. 'This is the biggest step for television since colour was introduced,' says Timo Ellila, TV product group manager of Nokia, the Finnish electronics group. Consumers, however, are being told that wide-screen TVs are desirable not only because they are eye-catching and different, but because they are more natural. 'Humans have a horizontally-oriented field of vision,' says Philips, the Dutch electronics manufacturer. Gravity also plays a part. Because it holds us to the surface of the Earth, everyday activities usually take place along a horizontal plane. Wide-screen makers also believe the shape of the screen will appeal to viewers who enjoy the cinema, where the screens are generally wider than high. They claim this type of screen offers more involvement for the audience. Whether or not wide-screen TV is really more natural or dynamic, there are advantages to a wider format. For example, the wide screen is better suited to transmitting films on to television. Given that films make up as much as 70 per cent of television output at peak periods, this is no small advantage. Television has had a roughly square-shaped screen for as long as it has been in the home. The screen aspect ratio - the relationship between the width and the height of the picture - has been 4:3. In other words, the screen width of a conventional set is only 33 per cent more than its height. By creating an aspect ratio of 16:9, wide-screen TV can be more faithful to the original film. The wider aspect means that the width of the screen is nearly 80 per cent greater than the height. The 16:9 ratio was chosen because this is the most commonly used aspect in the cinema, according to Philips. The new technology will operate on the D2-Mac standard for satellite broadcasts agreed by the EC. The standard is an interim stage in the move towards full HDTV. It gives clearer pictures than the conventional Pal standard used in Europe but is inferior to HDTV. The main difference between D2-Mac and Pal is that while Pal transmits colour, brightness and sound signals simultaneously from the broadcasting centre to the TV set, the Mac system - both D2-Mac and HD-Mac for full high-definition TV - transmits them sequentially. The simultaneous broadcast of colour and brightness can cause complicated patterns, such as tartans and checks, to become distorted. Mac broadcasts overcome the interaction of these signals by transmitting them consecutively, which provides clearer pictures. It does so by using advanced digital technology called 'time division multiplexing'. Wide-screen TV pictures also have more picture elements, or pixels, which make them brighter and sharper. While today's TV pictures have 120,000 pixels, wide-screen TV pictures broadcast in D2-Mac will have about 180,000 pixels, or 50 per cent more. HDTV, meanwhile, will have about 700,000 pixels. Sound on D2-Mac broadcasts is digital, and the system is capable of carrying eight soundtracks for every channel. This allows for multi-language translations. Manufacturers are confident that the wide-screen format will eventually become the norm. The problem is that few programmes on TV are made to suit the wide screen. In continental Europe there are about 10 channels transmitting programmes in wide-screen style. In the UK, BSkyB, the satellite broadcasting company, has been working on a test wide-screen channel but has yet to announce when it will start transmitting in the new format. Despite the spread of satellite TV most viewers in Europe still receive conventional broadcasts, which use the Pal system. The Commission is committed to providing funds to encourage broadcasters to switch over to D2-Mac. In the meantime, those who are eager to test the new technology can buy a wide-screen TV and watch conventional 4:3 programmes. Since the transmission will not fill the entire screen, black bars - which now often appear when a film is broadcast on TV - will fill the sides of the screen which are not used up. To overcome the problem, manufacturers have introduced a 'movie expand' feature which widens the picture until it fills the screen. This has drawbacks too because it chops off part of the top and bottom of the picture. Another problem is that the wide format is only impressive if viewed on a large screen. Manufacturers say they are unlikely to bring out sets below 24 inches in size, which means they will remain at the high end of the market. Wide is beautiful not only on the screen but for amateur photographs as well, judging from the popularity of cameras that shoot pictures several times wider than are high. Although first introduced about three years ago by Kodak as a disposable camera, the wide-angle cameras have become so popular in Japan that manufacturers have introduced compact cameras made specifically to take only wide-angle pictures. Canon, Minolta, Olympus allhave their version of wide-angle compact cameras, which are known in Japan as Panorama cameras. The cameras use conventional 35mm film but the trick is to use a wide angle lens and a masked film. Instead of filling up the whole film, a photograph taken with a panorama camera uses just the centre half of the film by masking parts of the top and bottom sections. Although a roll of 36 shots will produce all 36 pictures the resultant negative will be smaller than a conventional one. The negatives are then printed on a wide photographiformat. But since they need to be enlarged considerably the end product is fairly grainy. Panorama cameras have become such a hit in Japan that camera manufacturers have had to produce panorama adaptors that fit on to normal cameras to give the same effect, says Jonathan Brandon at Canon UK.

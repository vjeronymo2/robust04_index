			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Masstrict treaty approval by Danish voters Danish voters would approve the Maastricht treaty by a comfortable majority in a second referendum, according to an opinion poll yesterday, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. The poll showed 51 per cent would be in favour with 37 per cent against and 12 per cent undecided if the government reached a settlement with its Community partners along the lines of the Danish compromise proposal. The Yes vote rises to 61 per cent if the left-wing Social People's party backs an Edinburgh settlement. Mr Poul Schluter, Denmark's prime minister, has said Denmark would have to leave the EC if the treaty was defeated in a second referendum.</p>

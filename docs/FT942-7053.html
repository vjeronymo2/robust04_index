			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / US sued in airbase pollution claim Anglian Water is suing the US government for allegedly polluting its water supply in a legal action which tests the findings of a recent landmark case in the UK on pollution liability, Peggy Hollinger writes. Friends of the Earth, the environment campaign group, revealed yesterday that Anglian is alleging in the High Court that a water supply was polluted by a US military petrol station at RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk. Anglian is suing the US government for more than Pounds 500,000, which it claims is the cost of treating the water and installing protective systems to prevent further pollution. The action comes just six months after Cambridge Water lost a similar suit against Eastern Counties Leather, the tanning company, although it was ruled that some polluters could be liable if they could reasonably have foreseen the effects of their actions. Anglian's writ alleges that the US military authorities were negligent in allowing petrol to escape into the soil and for failing to check for leaks. Friends of the Earth said yesterday that several other military bases were polluters.</p>

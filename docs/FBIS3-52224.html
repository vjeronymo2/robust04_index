Commenting on the explosions, a Foreign  Office spokesman said this is a manifestation of the alienation  of the people of Kashmir with Indian rule and their response to  brutal repression by occupation troops. The situation in Jammu  region is reported tense following the bomb blasts at various  places. Indian troops have shot dead another five people during  siege and search operations in Ganderbal, Khaniyar, Badgam, and  (Laulab) areas. A number of people were also rounded up during  the operations. Mojahedin in retaliation have attacked bunkers  and other military targets in nine localities of Srinagar.  Several troops were injured when Mojahedin launched a surprise  attack on an Indian army contingent near Kulgam area. Two  bridges of military importance were also destroyed by Mojahedin  in Jammu region.</p>

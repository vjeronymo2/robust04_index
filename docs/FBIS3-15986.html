			<p>Language: <F P=105> International </F>Language: &lt;f 105&gt; Lithuanian  Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Lithuanian Foreign Ministry states that recent  utterances by Seimas member Romualdas Ozolas personally insult  ambassadors of some foreign states. Ozolas publicly labelled  the Polish and Belarusian ambassadors in Lithuania security  officials. He also expressed his astonishment at Lithuania  agreeing to the diplomats'appointments, disregarding their  services to the former system. The Foreign Ministry stated on  10 March that such statements are irresponsible and without  foundations. This harms the right of choice by a neighboring  state, complicates mutual relations between states, and  humiliates the prestige of the Lithuanian state.</p>

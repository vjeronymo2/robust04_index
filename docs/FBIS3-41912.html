For years she has been quietly  battling weapons exports. After comparing DE MORGEN's articles  with her own records based on numerous parliamentary questions,  Senator Maes claims that the data perfectly match her  information. [passage omitted summarizing referenced DE MORGEN  articles]    In her opinion, some blatant samples of hypocrisy are the  delivery of mortars to Zaire on 4 December 1991, the delivery of  guns and munition to Angola on 3 April 1991, or the export of  808 crates of kalashnikovs to Saudi Arabia on 19 July 1991.

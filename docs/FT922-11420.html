			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Sins of commission - The switch to fee-based advisers RECENT concern over the role of commissionbased advisers in the pension transfer market has led an increasing number of consumers to seek fee based firms. In 1991 alone, new business for individual single premium pensions was valued at Pounds 4.2bn - a 250 per cent rise on the 1989 figure, and due mainly to sales of personal pension transfer plans. At the same time, regulators found that the number of complaints about transfers increased dramatically. There are three basic options for job-changers who have built up a pension benefit in a former employer's scheme, only one of which involves transferring the benefit to an insurance-based product such as a personal pension. The first two options - namely, leaving the benefit in the old scheme, and transferring the benefit to the new employer's scheme - may not be considered fully, if at all, by a salesman who depends on commission from sales of products. The division between fee and commission based advisers is not always clear-cut. For example, many firms charge a modest fee but retain a percentage of the commission. This hybrid charging structure can be one of the most difficult to understand, and leaves plenty-of-scope for pulling the wool over a client's eyes. To give an idea of the cost to the consumer it is worth putting a price on the two main ways of paying for advice. Fee based advisers charge anything from Pounds 50-Pounds 250 an hour depending on whether you go to a local high street adviser or a leading firm of consulting actuaries. As a rough guide, however, you can expect to pay Pounds 80-Pounds 130 an hour for good pensions advice with an overall minimum of about Pounds 300-Pounds 500, depending on the nature of the case and the seniority of the adviser. If this sounds like a lot of money, consider how much a commission based adviser might receive on the sale of a personal pension used to take a transfer value of Pounds 50,000. Most providers pay about 5.6 per cent of the value of the transfer in commission. In this example, the cost would be Pounds 2,800. Looking at these figures, it is hard to justify the life industry's argument that consumers feel more comfortable with commissions. Where the hybrid charging structure is used, an adviser might make a modest charge of, say, Pounds 200 and offer to rebate '100 per cent of Lautro commission.' The old Lautro commission rate for transfers was 4 per cent, so this means that the adviser is still getting a healthy commission on the product sold. In the example given of a transfer value worth Pounds 50,000, the override retained would be worth Pounds 800 which, when added to the fee, gives the adviser Pounds 1,000 for selling a personal pension plan. Mitchell Philpott, director of Norex communications, says: 'Given the general paucity of understanding of pension transfers, coupled with the growth of this market, we do not believe commission based advisers can demonstrate impartial advice.' Of course, it is wrong to suggest that the consumer is guaranteed expert advice by going to a fee based firm. Clearly, the firm also must specialise in pensions and be able to demonstrate at the first interview that the analysis will include: A thorough examination of the benefit options of the previous company scheme. What the new employer's scheme offers in terms of benefits. In particular, it could offer good inflation proofing and excellent protection for the scheme member's family in the form of widows' and children's pensions. An assessment of the rate of growth necessary to match the benefits of the previous scheme. This helps the adviser and the client to make a meaningful comparison between the benefits of a company scheme and those of a personal pension. Any quotations from a life office must mirror exactly the benefit structure of the previous scheme. If the scheme offers 5 per cent inflation proofing and widow's benefits, the personal pension quotation also must do so. If a life office quotation ignores these benefits, it can offer a much higher projected pension. If a transfer value is recommended, check that the commission charged is rebated in full. Where the commission exceeds the fee - as will often be the case with a transfer - the excess commission should be returned to the client, either as a cash refund or in the form of enhanced policy terms. If the latter is preferred, check that the entire amount is re-invested in the policy. If the fees charged by actuarial firms are beyond your means, it is worth using the register of fee based advisers run by the monthly Money Management magazine*. Its data bank holds details of more than 1,440 firms and has handled more than 4,000 inquiries since it was launched less than 18 months ago. Money Management will send a free list of six firms in your area and the details supplied include a contact name. One adviser on the register, Fraser Marr Financial Services, charges between Pounds 80 and Pounds 150 an hour depending on the seniority of the consultant and whether the business is conducted by the London office or one of its regional branches. Tony Murrell, the managing director, says: 'Where the commission generated exceeds the fee charged, we either rebate the excess to the client in the form of a cheque or ask the product provider to enhance the value of the policy.' Russell Kitchen, managing director of Personal and Corporate Financial Planning Ltd (also on the register), offers clients the same choice and adds: 'The important point about fee charging is that the advice is separated from the end result.' *Money Management Fee Based Adviser Register, Financial Times Business Information, Greystoke Place, Fetter Lane, London EC4A 1ND.

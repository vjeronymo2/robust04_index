			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / EC growth could see Maastricht stillborn JUST hours before EC ministers yesterday put their pens to the European Union treaty in the southern Dutch town of Maastricht, an announcement to the north underlined the probable transience of the treaty's institutional provisions. In a speech to the parliament in Helsinki, President Mauno Koivisto made clear Finland would shortly become the seventh country to make a formal application to join the EC. This means that soon rules and structures set up originally for a club of six will have to be re-designed for a membership approaching 20. Indeed, the Brussels Commission has already embarked on a study of the implications of enlargement for EC institutions. By another irony, the idea of such a study was conceived by President Mitterrand in the hope that it might put a brake on rapid enlargement. Instead, it has prompted virtually every would-be applicant to think it must make its EC entry bid before the study is completed. Thus, Prime Minister Harlem Gro Bruntland of Norway is now expected to express her personal preference for EC entry in early April, and even the Swiss government is contemplating knocking on Brussels' door. So far, the issues thrown up by enlargement are being soft-pedalled by all concerned. It will fall to the British presidency in the second half of this year to preside over the launching of the first enlargement negotiations with countries of the European Free Trade Association (Efta). A bloated EC executive will not be the only problem. A European parliament ofmore than 700 deputies, with communication in more than a dozen languages, would result in 156 cross-translation permutations. The key question will be whether EC members can agree to take more of its decisions by speedier, majority vote, just when enlargement will make their interests even more diverse. Volkswagen and its unions yesterday signed a landmark agreement setting up a European works council, moving ahead of stalled European Commission proposals on EC-wide consultation of workers in cross-border companies, David Gardner reports from Brussels. It is the first such agreement in Europe's hard-pressed car industry, and was described as 'absolutely crucial ..in a climate of increased competitivity' by Mr Martin Posth, the VW board member in charge of human resources. The accord covers Volkswagen and Audi in Germany, Seat in Spain and VW Belgium and will eventually extend to VW's operations in Czechoslovakia, including Skoda. The VW board undertakes to consult an elected council of 17 members on investment, plant structures, labour transfers, productivity, costs, hours, wages and conditions, new technology, safety and environment conditions. The agreement also enshrines confidentiality clauses and upholds the right to manage. Mr Karl-Heinz Mihr, a German Euro-MP on VW's Kassel works council, called the deal 'a milestone in the defence of workers' rights in Europe'.</p>

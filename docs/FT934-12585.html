			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Observer: Female pitch Kim Campbell's future may not lie in baseball, pace Observer's helpful suggestion yesterday, but another woman apparently features on the shortlist to take over as the sport's next commissioner. She is Lynn Martin, formerly a Republican congresswoman from Illinois, George Bush's labour secretary and, though now a university teacher, still a player in national politics. She would certainly need all her political wits about her in a position that has been vacant for over a year, since the owners of baseball's 28 teams summarily dismissed Fay Vincent for being insufficiently solicitous concerning their imperious wishes. Most of those previously considered, as well as those still in the race, have political backgrounds. George Bush and James Baker graciously declined to apply, and so last week did George Mitchell, top Democrat in the US Senate. But Paul Kirk, former national Democratic party chairman, and Richard Thornburgh, ex-US attorney general, are still in there pitching. Baseball has had some powerful, and wondrously named, commissioners over the years - Judge Kennesaw Mountain Landis, A B 'Happy' Chandler, Bowie Kuhn and A Bartlett Giamatti, a former president of Yale. The commissioner may get the best seats in the house, but he, or she, now operates on the shortest of leashes from the owners, as Vincent, an honourable man, discovered. In comparison, politics begins to look easy.</p>

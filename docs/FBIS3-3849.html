			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Shanghai, March 23 (XINHUA) -- An additional air-  corridor has been opened here to ease the congestion of the  skies above the China's leading metropolis.    Air-traffic control first started in Shanghai in May, 1992,  with two sectors opened, one extending to the south and the  other to the north.    But the sharp rise in the number of flights has far exceeded  the ceiling limit in a single regulatory sector, which could be  a threat to safety.    The new fan-shaped control area stretches to the east to  strike a balance of flight numbers.</p>

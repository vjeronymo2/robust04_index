			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 28 March within its  regular seven-minute newscast carries several reports on the  situation in the republic.    Mirza Sadikovic reports from Bihac that ``the (?Serbian)  aggressor continued to attack the front lines of the Bihac  region last night and this morning. A particular [word  indistinct] is on the Grmusko-Srbljanski Height -- that is, the  Hasin Vrh -- where they attempted new infantry breakthroughs,  which our defenders managed to reject. Artillery and  antiaircraft weapon activity is incessant on the Bihac, Bosanska  Krupa, and (Budzin) sections of the front. Sniper activity has  become more intensive since this morning and chetnik regroupings  have been observed.    "There is no peace on the lines of separation with the  paramilitary formations of the so-called Kladusa autonomy. In  the Cazin regions of Krivaja, Crnac, and Liskovac, they were  [word indistinct] with mortar and mountain guns and provoking  infantry clashes all the time." The 3d Corps Press Center  reports the ``more frequent defeats on the battlefield were a  reason for the chetnik artillery to retaliate on the defense  lines and civilian targets. This time they recorded a defeat on  (Terijsko) battlefield, where fighters of the Bosnian Army  repressed them by 1 kilometer at Debelo Brdo. Mortar bombs of  82 and 120 mm fell on Zeljezno Polje and the defense lines. An  enemy recoilless gun and a Bofors gun were used to pound defense  lines. The only consequence was material damage. Chetniks were  frequently hitting civilian targets in Krusac: five shells were  launched from (Bornici) and inflicted new damages on buildings.  Two shells launched from Kalinovac fell on Travnik yesterday  afternoon but fortunately had no consequences.''    Hamiz Deronjic reports that "the situation on the Brcko  battlefield was somewhat calmer compared to the past several  days. At the moment, the Serbian aggressor has resorted to  artillery operations from a safe distance, which are regularly  accompanied by antiaircraft and antiarmor weapons with intensive  work by chetnik snipers. Last night, enemy 60- and 82-mm  mortars were most active from the direction of Sekulici, Stari  Brod, and Cadjevac and were pounding Brcko defense lines on  Djukici, Kladje, at the Omerbegovaca-Vranovaca line, and the  central battlefield section. Air space in the Bijeljina, Brcko,  and Pelagicevo is still the most used for enemy aircraft. At  2000 last night, Serbian transport helicopters were flying  overhead."    Amira Salibasic reports that "the free Olovo territory was  the target of occasional artillery attacks yesterday. The  morning passed with provocative enemy attacks from (?infantry)  weapons, while in the evening, the aggressor intensified his  attacks by using long-range arms."</p>

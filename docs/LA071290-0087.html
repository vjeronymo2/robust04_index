			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE SENATE OKS AIRPORT LAW EXEMPTION  </P> <P> The state Senate has approved on a 22-8 vote a bill by Sen. Robert G. Beverly  (R-Manhattan Beach) to exempt Los Angeles County from a tough new airport  land-use law.  </P> <P> The bill now goes to the Assembly for consideration.  </P> <P> Under the current law, the Los Angeles County Regional Planning Commission is  required to develop comprehensive land-use plans to ensure that proposed  building projects are compatible with development patterns around the county's  17 airports. Earlier this year, the Legislature extended the deadline for  county compliance with the law by six months, to Jan. 1, 1992.  </P> <P> Beverly's bill seeks to exempt the county from the law. The bill's supporters  say the law's required review of all developments near airports will place an  unfair burden on county planners.  </P> <P> Beverly said his proposal may be modified to establish a new commission that  would be charged with reviewing airport-related planning issues in Los Angeles  County.  </P> <P> Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), who authored the current law, opposes  Beverly's measure. She has criticized the bill as inappropriate because it  would make Los Angeles the only county in the state without a plan for dealing  with construction around airports.  </P> <P> Among the bill's supporters are Los Angeles County and the cities of Torrance,  Long Beach and Culver City. It is opposed by the city of Los Angeles.  </P></p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Emap buys clutch of French magazines Emap, the UK media and exhibitions group, has agreed to spend a total of FFr914m (Pounds 108m) on four acquisitions which will make it the third largest consumer magazine publisher in France. The main deal is the purchase for FFr710m of Editions Mondiales, a Paris-based publisher with 8 per cent of the market. Emap is also buying France's biggest selling motoring magazine, L'Auto Journal, from Mr Robert Hersant, the press baron who owns Le Figaro newspaper. Mr David Arculus, Emap managing director, said it had been planning a big expansion in France after first entering the market in 1990 via a joint venture with Bayard Presse. 'At one leap this gives us 10 per cent of the French consumer magazine market with a further 1 per cent in the joint venture.' He said the French titles were similar to those it owns in the UK. They were being acquired at the right point in the economic cycle. 'The prospects for the French economy are now looking as healthy, if not healthier, than the UK with some signs of advertising starting to pick up.' French publishing has had a severe recession with advertising and circulation falling off sharply and new launches intensifying competition, particularly in the newspaper market. A number of magazines, including Conde Nast's French Vogue and Le Point, the political weekly, have cut their cover prices in an attempt to bolster flagging sales. The pressures have posed serious financial problems for a number of companies, notably Mr Hersant's huge media group. Its sale of Auto Journal as part of a disposal programme heightened speculation about the fate of the group's remaining titles, such as France-Soir, the loss-making evening paper. Emap has long had its eyes on Editions Mondiales, a Paris-based publisher whose 28 titles include Tele Poche, one of the leading TV listings magazines which sells 1.4m copies a week. Mr Arculus said that combining the acquisitions with Emap's existing French operation would result in lower overheads and purchasing benefits. The acquisitions made total operating profits of Pounds 1m on turnover of Pounds 138m last year. Emap said the deals would enhance group earnings in the first full year if, as it intends, they are funded by debt. Mr Arculus said the slim returns partly reflected the fact that they had been privately owned and had been run 'with tax rather than profits in mind'. Emap's UK consumer magazines made Pounds 24m on turnover of Pounds 169m last year. Mr Arculus said this indicated the scope for improvement in the French businesses, though their margins would never quite reach those in the UK due to higher costs of employment and a less efficient distribution system. This was reflected in the purchase price being less than annual turnover. Emap, the second largest magazine publisher in the UK behind Reed Elsevier, becomes the third biggest in France after Hachette and Prisma Presse. Details, Page 22</p>

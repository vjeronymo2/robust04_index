			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Pickets protest over Timex sackings PICKETS demonstrated last night outside the Dundee plant of Timex Electronics, the US-owned multinational, to protest at the company's decision to sack all its 320 production workers and replace them with a new labour force. The sackings followed a dispute over lay-off provisions. It is the largest case of a mass dismissal of workers by a company in Britain since News International fired its print workers in 1986.

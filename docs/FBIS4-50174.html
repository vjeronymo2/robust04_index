			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>   [Text] The New China News Agency (XINHUA) Hong Kong branch  -- China's de facto embassy in the territory -- is re-organising  its work to focus more closely on promoting reunification with  Taiwan.    With the handover of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty in  1997, cross-strait relations with Taiwan will become the main  task of Xinhua's former united front department which was  recently renamed the "co-ordination department".    In Chinese communist parlance, "united front work" refers to  liaison, penetration, and control of "friendly" or neutral  organisations whose cooperation can advance party objectives.    Zhou Zhekai, the newly appointed head of the coordination  department, was formerly a deputy secretary of Beijing's body  handling cross-strait affairs, the Association for Relations  Across the Taiwan Strait.    Zhou's appointment, revealed in the Beijing run TA KUNG PAO  earlier this month, marks a break with past practice when the  department head was appointed from the Communist Party's United  Front Work Department (UFWD) .    The UFWD, which competes with Taipei around the world for  the  minds and hearts of overseas Chinese has only been allowed to  appoint a new deputy head to the department -- Tian Jin in the  current round of middle-level reshuffles taking place at  XINHUA's headquarters in Happy Valley. Until the end of 1992,  Tian served as personal secretary to former UFWD head Ding  Guangen, a politburo member and close associate of Deng Xiaoping  who currently heads the party propaganda department. In the  three years remaining before the handover of Hong Kong, Tian is  expected to handle local tasks of the coordination department,  including the appointment of Hong Kong advisers and members of  the Preliminary Working Committee as well as local delegates to  China's two quasi-parliaments.    The eventual plan is for the State Council's Hong Kong and  Macao Affairs Office (HKMAO) to take over all united front work  in Hong Kong. This was signalled by the internal restructuring  of the HKMAO last month, which saw the formation of a new social  and cultural affairs department, ostensibly to breathe new life  into grass-roots united front work in the territory, which  XINHUA has neglected in recent years.    This will leave Zhou free to devote more time to Taiwan  affairs. Jousting between Beijing and Taipei is expected to  intensify in Hong Kong itself as Taipei takes steps to  strengthen its propaganda work in the territory. Zhou's brief  could also involve working on more sensitive areas, including  possible meetings between senior Beijing and Taiwan officials in  Hong Kong.    In his previous posting as head of the general affairs  department at the Chinese Communist Party's Taiwan Affairs  Office, Zhou handled cross-strait fishing disputes and illegal  mainland immigration to Taiwan, the kind of "practical issues"  which Taipei says could be discussed in Hong Kong.    Zhou's work is also likely to involve prodding Taipei to  allow senior Chinese officials and heads of large Chinese  companies based in the territory to visit Taiwan. But it is  unclear whether the coordination department's expanding role  will conflict with XINHUA's low-profile Taiwan affairs  department.    Meanwhile, the shake-up of the coordination department under  Zhou has left a bad feeling in the agency. This was because of  the unceremonious removal of a former department head, Lin  Keping, who has returned to the UFWD in Beijing. Lin is  understood to have learned of his removal from the local press.</p>

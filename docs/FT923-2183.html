			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Polypipe advances to Pounds 15.4m POLYPIPE, the fast growing Doncaster-based manufacturer of plastic pipes and fittings, raised annual pre-tax profits by 11 per cent, from Pounds 13.9m to Pounds 15.4m. Turnover in the 12 months to June 30 increased by 33 per cent to Pounds 108m (Pounds 81.2m), buoyed by a full-year contribution from activities bought during 1990-91. The three businesses acquired earlier this year contributed Pounds 10m. Mr Kevin McDonald, chairman and managing director, said the disproportionate rise in turnover disguised 'a strong performance by our core plastic pipe and fittings interests.' He added that the inclusion of the newly acquired businesses, including some acquired from receivers which historically operated on lower margins, helped explain the apparent decline in overall margins. Operating profits increased to Pounds 15.4m (Pounds 13.7m) and included a Pounds 200,000 loss incurred by GCA Windows and Aquapipes, two businesses acquired in October last year which contributed Pounds 6m to turnover. The core plastic pipes and fittings business increased its market share and posted operating profits of Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 11.2m), while other plastic products, including the Oasis Leisure garden furniture business acquired in early 1991, recorded operating profits of Pounds 3.95m (Pounds 2.51m). Since the end of June, Aquapipes, which makes single and twin-wall drainage and ducting systems for civil engineering, construction and land reclamation projects, had achieved 'acceptable margins.' GCA Windows, which makes PVCu double glazed window units for industrial and local authority applications, is expected to produce acceptable margins shortly. The Fordam cistern business, which was acquired from Spring Ram in August last year, had been transferred from Wolverhampton to Doncaster and 'successfully merged' with Polypipe's subsidiary, Derwent MacDee. Interest charges of Pounds 54,000 in the 12 months compared to Pounds 205,000 in receipts previously. Despite increasing capital expenditure to Pounds 12.6m (Pounds 8.1m) and assuming Pounds 4m of debt through acquisitions, Polypipe had net cash of Pounds 800,000 at the year end. Earnings per share were 6.69p (6.63p), on capital increased by the Pounds 13.6m share placing earlier this year to fund the acquisitions. The proposed final dividend of 1.34p (1.275p) lifts the total for the year to 1.97p (1.875p). COMMENT Polypipe has managed to shrug off the recession so far, and pick up some cheap acquisitions with good growth prospects on the way. One reason why it has been able to buck the trend is that only 12 per cent of its business comes from new buildings. Among its recent acquisitions the purchase of Aquapipes should help extend its business in the water industry where plastic is slowly replacing clay and concrete, particularly as new investment in equipment to produce large diameter twin-wall pipes comes on stream. The management is confident that it can improve efficiency further and plans another Pounds 12m in capital expenditure this year. Together with the restructuring of its recently acquired businesses this should help improve margins. The full year pre-tax profit forecast of Pounds 17m looks reasonable. On yesterday's close of 100p, the prospective multiple is about 13.5 and the stock still looks attractive.</p>

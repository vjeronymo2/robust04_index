			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN BECOMES NO. 1 IN MANUFACTURING SALES;  </P> <P> TRADE: THE REVELATION RAISES MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ABILITY OF AMERICA'S  INDUSTRIAL SECTOR TO COMPETE.  </P> <P> Add another No. 1 to the list for Japan.  </P> <P> The nation that outstripped the United States to become the world's leading  creditor and leading aid donor is now also the world's leading manufacturer in  terms of sales.  </P> <P> Although the American gross national product is still nearly 1.9 times larger  than Japan's, sales by Japan's manufacturing firms in 1988 surpassed sales of  all manufacturing firms in the United States for the first time. Japan's  statistics for 1989 won't be available until December.  </P> <P> The 1988 score card read $2.783 trillion for Japan to $2.612 trillion for the  United States, according to the U.S. Bureau of the Census and Japan's Economic  Planning Agency.  </P> <P> Apparently no government official in either nation has commented publicly about  the development, and most appear to be unaware of it. But coming on the heels  of growing qualitative competition from Japan in high technology and concern  about the competitiveness of American industry, Japan's unheralded quantitative  clout in manufacturing raises serious new questions for the United States.  </P> <P> Takashi Sakuma of the Economic Planning Agency's research division said sales  of Japan's manufacturing corporations amounted to 357 trillion yen in fiscal  1988. At the average 1988 exchange rate of 128.26 yen to the dollar, that  equaled about $2.8 trillion.  </P> <P> The U.S. figure of roughly $2.6 trillion was provided by the Current Business  Analysis division in the Bureau of the Census in Washington.  </P> <P> Both figures were given in response to queries from The Times. Neither agency  has made any announcement comparing the two countries' manufacturing sales.  </P> <P> In 1987, the last year for which the Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development issued figures for both countries in one report, the United States  held a slight edge over Japan, $2,390 billion to $2,352.3 billion.  </P> <P> Sakuma noted that the sales compilation is somewhat misleading, because it  includes an undetermined amount of double accounting. Goods that Japanese or  American manufacturing firms procure from suppliers are counted once as sales  of the supplier and again as part of the final manufacturer's sales, Sakuma  said.  </P> <P> Counting only the "value-added" portion of manufacturing, the United States  remains ahead of Japan -- at least in 1987, the most recent year for which  comparable statistics are available, he said.  </P> <P> Japanese manufacturers, Sakuma said, tend to rely upon outside suppliers for  parts more than U.S. firms.  </P> <P> Last year's OECD National Accounts report showed that in 1987 "value-added"  manufacturing in the United States was worth $862.3 billion, compared to $689.3  billion in Japan.  </P> <P> Even without statistical knowledge of Japan's quantitative gains in  manufacturing, executives on both sides of the Pacific have expressed concern  about the future of American manufacturing.  </P> <P> Nobuyuki Nakahara, president of Tonen Corp., an oil-refining company affiliated  with Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp., recently predicted that "differences between  the United States and Japan will grow further in terms of investment, stocks,  and productivity -- all in favor of Japan."  </P> <P> The strong American service industry "is a buffer to (the United States')  economic difficulties. Therefore, it is hard to define the course of the future  for the U.S. economy. But I think the American economy faces a very difficult  future," Nakahara said.  </P> <P> Asked about Japan overtaking the United States in manufacturing sales, Earl  Harbeson, president of Monsanto Co., said during a recent visit here that "we  have spent 10 years moving toward a service economy. Obviously, we have a  manufacturing decline."  </P> <P> "The whole consumer electronics industry has been removed from American  ownership and has never been replaced by other manufacturing. It concerns me a  great deal that American manufacturing presence is on the decline relative to  other countries, particularly in long-term investments in manufacturing  assets," he said.  </P> <P> Harbeson blamed the decline on the "system" in the United States that "puts a  very high premium on short-term results" and "takes it out of the hide of your  stocks if you don't produce."  </P> <P> "It's going to take the leadership of Congress and the President" to turn the  tide, he said. "Many people are worried about the future of American  manufacturing, but it's not addressed."  </P> <P> "Graduates of American business schools don't want to go into manufacturing . .  . and engineering schools in the United States are filled largely with foreign  students. . . . We are not raising people educated in engineering."  </P> <P> Sakuma said the main reason manufacturing has remained strong in Japan is that  businessmen here "expect a future decline in their competitiveness in producing  a certain product and include the cost of developing a next-generation product  in calculations of current manufacturing costs." As a result, when production  of radios became uncompetitive, Japanese electronics manufacturers began  television production, then moved on to videocassettes and compact discs.  </P> <P> Factories don't close; rather, they produce new products, he said.  </P> <P> By contrast, when American manufacturers move production overseas, the domestic  plants often don't put out a new product; they are merely closed, he said.  </P> <P> Since the dollar started losing its value in 1985, Sakuma noted, many American  manufacturing industries have regained competitiveness. He cited steel and  chemicals as examples. But in consumer products, "production doesn't come back  (to the United States) from overseas factories, even if exchange rates return  to appropriate levels."  </P> <P> A white paper on the Japanese economy issued by the Economic Planning Agency  said technological development has enabled Japan to maintain a strong  manufacturing base, despite a 67% gain in the value of the yen since 1985. The  yen appreciation should have made exporting more difficult for Japanese  manufacturers.  </P></p>

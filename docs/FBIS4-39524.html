			<p>BFN     [Text] According to People's Deputy Syarhey Navumchyk, who  is also the coordinator of the Belarusian Popular Front  parliamentary opposition, Henadz Karpenka, a former contender  for the presidential post, has agreed to join Zyanon Paznyak's  presidential team. It is not ruled out, Navumchyk stated, that  in the event of Paznyak's victory in the presidential elections  Henadz Karpenka will be appointed prime minister.    The joining of Paznyak's team by this politician, in  Navumchyk's opinion, is helpful in three ways: First, such a  political personality would do credit to any democratic  organization; this will also be helpful to the state in general.  Second, this is an important step in unifying democratic forces  in Belarus. Finally, Karpenka has good connections in Russia's  political circles, which is also of great importance.</p>

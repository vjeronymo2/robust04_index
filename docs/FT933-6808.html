			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Crop worries push cocoa prices to 22-month highs COCOA PRICES climbed to 22-month highs in London yesterday on growing expectations that world supply will fall short of demand for the third season in a row. Reports suggesting a poor 1993-94 crop in Ivory Coast and Ghana, which produce about 30 per cent and 10 per cent of world output respectively, underpinned the buying mood. The December futures contract pushed through resistance at Pounds 800 a tonne to reach a day's peak of Pounds 819, its highest level since October 1991. It eased slightly to close up Pounds 21 at Pounds 815. The next resistance point is expected to be around Pounds 832, which would take it to a level last reached in June 1990. In New York, the December contract, which had risen by Dollars 24 on Monday, was quoted at Dollars 1,060 a tonne in late trading, up another Dollars 6. 'People are a bit worried about the crop development, particularly in west Africa,' said a London analyst. 'It looks very likely that there will be a deficit, it's just a question of how big. If the crops don't improve, it's going to be bigger than people expected a couple of months ago.' Ms Judith Ganes, softs analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York, said she expected the market to go higher. 'The fundamentals have been much more clear cut than for coffee in terms of the erosion of stocks and the potential for a third deficit,' she said. The International Cocoa Organisation's buffer stock stands at about 230,000 tonnes. On Monday it sold 1,086 tonnes at prices between Dollars 974 and Dollars 1,080 a tonne. ED &amp; F. Man, the London broker, has estimated the the current season's shortfall at 96,000 tonnes, based on production of 2.36m tonnes. Gill and Duffus, the trade house, has a similar estimate, after a 90,000 tonne shortfall in 1991-92. However, GNI, the London trade house, which earlier this month put the production deficit at about 100,000 tonnes, suggested the shortfall in supply to world markets was actually about 244,000 because Ivory Coast, the world's biggest producer, had banned mid-crop exports. It forecast another big supply deficit next season of some 241,000 tonnes, and said this continuing scenario, with further reductions in world stocks, could lead to a repeat of the 1970s bull market. Robusta coffee prices also had a buoyant day in London yesterday, supported by a strong performance by arabica futures in New York the previous day. The Latin American coffee retention scheme, which gained the backing of African producers last week, continued to underpin sentiment. The November contract ended up Dollars 22 at Dollars 1,242 a tonne, after reaching a high of Dollars 1,258.</p>

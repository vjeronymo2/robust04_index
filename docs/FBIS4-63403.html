			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Georgiy Satarov commentary: "The Commission's Purpose Is </F> to Ensure a Process of Constant Conciliation"]    [Text] The Russian president's message to the Federal  Assembly is effectively the first document of its kind to  contain a separate section dedicated to the civil society.    Back in March a group of independent experts was formed to  prepare a concept for the president's legislative initiative in  this sphere. A parallel movement to achieve accord in our  society has begun.    The Treaty on Social Accord includes proposals on the  coordinated discussion of the major problems. Hence the idea  has arisen -- both in development of the message and of the  Treaty on Social Accord -- to discuss jointly a range of  problems connected with support for the establishment of a civil  society in Russia and, in fulfillment of that Treaty, to try to  advance that area of legislative work organizationally,  professionally, and in a skillful way.    However, bearing in mind that there are quite a few sources  of legislative initiative and that to date, unfortunately, they  are operating in a completely isolated and uncoordinated way,  there must be some kind of blueprint which makes it possible to  link the legislative process and sets of laws.    Work is now being completed on the creation of a mechanism  for the activity of a conciliation commission, whose main task  is to ensure a process of constant conciliation in accordance  with the Treaty. The commission will have to support the work  of the permanent "roundtables" which correspond to the various  sections of the Treaty -- "Political Stability in Society,"  "Socioeconomic Policy," and "The Security of the Citizen and  Society."    It is on the activeness of all the parties signatory to the  Treaty that the speed of the formation of the conciliation  commission and the "roundtables" will depend. The president's  structures are working on this problem, and working pretty  strenuously.</p>

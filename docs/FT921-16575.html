			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Bonn toughens stance on civil service pay: Mollemann seeks to keep wage increases to less than 5 per cent THE German government should use its legislative powers to limit civil service pay rises this year to less than 5 per cent, according to Mr Jurgen Mollemann, economics minister. This would send a clear signal to the private sector, he said yesterday. It was not the time to iron out pay inequalities, he said. Economic stability and full employment were greater priorities. The economy stood at the crossroads. 'The next weeks and months will decide if we are to resume growth or to suffer deep and painful cuts,' Mr Mollemann said. Representatives of the 1.8m civil servants in west Germany, traditionally the first public sector workers to settle their wage deals, said yesterday they would not to be singled out for 'a special sacrifice'. 'We shall be seeking a two-figure increase,' said Mr Werner Hagedorn, chairman of the Deutsche Beamtenbund civil servants' association. The OTV union, which represents public sector workers, said the minister's proposal would only hinder negotiations. It was surprising that a 'self-styled free-market, liberal minister should suddenly become a proponent of a statutory incomes policy', the union said. Mr Mollemann's renewed intervention, following calls from Chancellor Helmut Kohl for moderate settlements, is likely to aggravate already bitter negotiations over 10 per cent claims from unions representing steel, banking and public service workers. Further bad news from the steel and engineering industries over the holiday highlighted pressures on the economy. Voest Alpine, the Austrian group, announced it was to close its only German special steel works by the end of the year. The 400 employees at Edelstahlwerks Bohler in Dusseldorf would be deployed elsewhere, the group said. Engineering and plant makers, second only in industrial rankings to the car industry, said yesterday they expected real falls in production and sales this year. 'All the threads have been cut virtually simultaneously,' said Mr Alexander Batschari, of the VDMA manufacturers' association, referring to the effects on orders of recession in the west and political and economic turmoil in east Europe. The only markets showing signs of life were those in south east Asia, where Japanese engineering had a share of more than 50 per cent, the US 21 per cent and Germany only 12 per cent. German exports to the region had increased 20 per cent to DM1.2bn (Pounds 410m) last year, the association said. Total overseas deliveries, which account for 60 per cent of the industry's sales, had fallen 20 per cent in the first 10 months of 1991; inland deliveries were up only 1 per cent over the same period, while orders were down 10 per cent. More than 70,000 engineers were working short-time in November, compared with 3,000 a year earlier, the VDMA said. Companies in the worst-hit sectors, textile machinery, machine tools, motors and agricultural equipment, were all planning to reduce their payrolls.</p>

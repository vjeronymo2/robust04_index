			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: New Volvo board heads agenda with Renault link Volvo's new board will focus on talks with France's Renault on the future of their three-year-old alliance, Mr Bert-Olof Svanholm, Volvo's new chairman, said yesterday. His comments come in the wake of the collapse last month of plans by the two companies to merge. Speaking shortly after his election, Mr Svanholm was careful not to say what the result might be. However, he intends to inform shareholders of the outcome - and of the new board's long-term strategy for Volvo - at the annual general meeting in April. Mr Svanholm, who heads the Swedish operations of Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, succeeded Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, who resigned after two decades in charge of Volvo when confronted with a shareholder and senior management revolt against the merger plan. The new chairman insisted Volvo would rebound from the trauma. 'It is a company with big possibilities for the future,' he said. Mr Svanholm was proposed by a group of Swedish institutional shareholders representing 40 per cent of the voting capital. The meeting accepted their other six board nominees, including Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo chief executive, and Mr Louis Schweitzer, the chairman and chief executive of Renault, which remains Volvo's biggest shareholder with 10 per cent of the voting capital. Mr Gyll said Volvo last year achieved its first increase in car sales since 1986, in spite of recession in Europe and the upheaval caused by the merger uproar. Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm adds: Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar is stepping down as a vice-chairman of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken. 'It is natural that after leaving Volvo, I should also leave the SE-Banken board so that I remain free for the future,' he said.</p>

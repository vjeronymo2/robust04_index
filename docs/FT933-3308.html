			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (14): Costs in a new light - Case Study / Osram / Andrew Baxter on a switch to save energy COMING TO the UK has been an eye-opener for Mr Robert Caban, who took over in April as managing director of the Wembley-based Osram UK lighting business after 12 years as finance director at its Italian sister company. 'I was surprised at how many old-fashioned light fittings there were in the house I moved to,' he says. 'People are much more aware of the cost factor here. In Germany the emphasis is on energy saving. In Italy saving energy is important but consumers also want innovation and a high image product. I think that wouldn't work in Great Britain.' But Mr Caban is determined to try to make it work in the UK. Osram is already having some success in getting its message across. Part of the Siemens group, Osram UK is, with General Electric of the US and Philips of the Netherlands, one of three companies that dominate the UK lighting market. With overcapacity in the European market for standard lightbulbs, the companies use innovation as a way to differentiate their products in the customer's mind. The aim is to supply better, more appealing lighting and/or lighting that may cost more but lasts much longer, and uses less electricity too. The classic example is Osram's DULUX EL energy-saving lamp which replaces the standard lightbulb and will pay for itself in 18 months in an average household. A user with hundred of lamps to light could save thousands of pounds a year. Then there are the new generation of compact, economical fluorescent lamps for commercial lighting. 'In offices, there is a massive replacement market in fluorescent tubes alone,' says Mr Mike Swaddling, Osram's marketing communications manager. The challenge is to convince hard-pressed customers - whether companies or individuals - to see the productivity benefits from buying better lighting. There is a wider argument too: Osram calculates that if each of the UK's 22m households used one 20W DULUX EL to replace one 100W incandescent lamp, the electricity saved would be equivalent to two average-sized power stations. The quest for innovation means that 40 per cent of Osram UK's turnover comes from products introduced in the past five years. General lighting  - standard light bulbs - is down to 20 per cent of turnover. Mr Caban predicts that, in value terms, Osram's sales of energy-saving light bulbs will catch up with general lighting in two to three years, but in unit terms this will take at least a decade. However in the lighting industry it is difficult for any one producer to steal a march on its rivals technologically - if they do, competitors catch up relatively quickly - so the battle for profits cannot rely on innovation alone. Manufacturing efficiency is a key weapon, and here there has been a transformation at Osram UK in the three years since it took full control of the former GEC lighting business. In response to the overcapacity in lighting production, and to Osram's policy of having one European production plant for each product range, it closed the Wembley factory in 1991, turning it into a warehouse and shedding 270 jobs. Its factory at Shaw, Oldham, has also ceased producing general lighting, and has become Osram's worldwide centre for producing high- and low-pressure sodium streetlamps and related products. But Osram has had a battle on its hands turning it into a plant that can hold its own for competitiveness, productivity and product quality with any of the company's European plants. A painful 18-month slimming down process to cut costs by reducing the full-time workforce from 750 to 530, moving from two buildings into one, ending inefficient production and introducing more flexible working was completed six months ago. The process was controversial, and it has taken Osram a long time to rebuild morale and a sense of trust among the remaining workforce. But, says Mr Georg Marsen, Osram's technical and product director, Shaw has been in the black for the past six months. 'Material wastage has declined dramatically, product quality has improved because the whole site is healthy and the morale is there,' he says. After Pounds 7m of investment at Shaw since the takeover, and all the changes, it will now soon be producing the same volumes as with the much bigger 1990 workforce. Not only is Shaw's future assured, but the turnround has also been a factor in the improvement in Osram's results, which recovered from a 1991 loss of Pounds 17.2m to a pre-tax profit of Pounds 176,000 last year. Profits will be higher in the current year ending this month, says Mr Caban. Now the Oldham factory has a chance to reap the reward of its transformation as Osram discusses shifting some manufacturing to the UK  - to take advantage of internal changes at the factory and the cost benefits of manufacturing in post-devaluation UK.</p>

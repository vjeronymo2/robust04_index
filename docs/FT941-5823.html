			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Observer: Tucked up Those looking for portents of the death of British trade unionism as we knew it have pointed to the TUC's overtures to political parties other than Labour. Inviting the Treasury's financial secretary, Stephen Dorrell, to give a speech at TUC HQ in London yesterday was but one instance. But the final nail in the coffin must surely be that the TUC has succumbed to the wiles of public relations. The TUC has always done these things in-house before, but now seven PR firms are pitching for the account, which should be awarded by the end of March. Presumably the first press release will arrive with black borders.</p>

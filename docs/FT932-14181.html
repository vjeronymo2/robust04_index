			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / International Company News: Slowdown at US drug groups THE SLOWER pace of earnings growth for the US pharmaceuticals industry was reflected yesterday in the first-quarter results unveiled by leading drugs companies. Merck, the world's biggest drugs company, posted slightly better-than-expected profits for the quarter, but the improvement lagged the company's historical strength and reflected the impact of inflation and unfavourable exchange rates. Stripping out accounting changes last year, Merck's 1993 first-quarter net income rose 10 per cent to Dollars 613.8m, or 54 cents a share, from Dollars 559m, or 48 cents. Including accounting changes, the company earned Dollars 96.6m, or 8 cents, in the 1992 quarter. Sales advanced to Dollars 2.38bn from Dollars 2.22bn. Mr Roy Vagelos, chairman and chief executive, said price increases had virtually no effect on sales growth. Sales in the quarter were led by new products. Merck reiterated its predictions of moderate earnings growth for 1993, reflecting worldwide healthcare cost-containment measures and an increasingly turbulent and competitive environment in the US. Eli Lilly reported a 16 per cent decline in underlying first-quarter earnings to Dollars 373.5m, or Dollars 1.27, on essentially flat sales of Dollars 1.56bn. The company warned investors in March that slower sales of several important drugs could reduce first-quarter earnings per share by more than 20 per cent. Lilly's net income for the three months, including accounting changes in both years, was Dollars 362.6m, or Dollars 1.23, against Dollars 325.8m, or Dollars 1.10. American Cyanamid, the pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, turned in underlying first-quarter profits of Dollars 118.7m, or Dollars 1.32, up from Dollars 114.8m, or Dollars 1.25, a year ago. Including accounting changes, Cyanamid had a deficit in the latest quarter of Dollars 433.7m, or Dollars 4.82. Sales in the quarter to March 31 rose 1.6 per cent to Dollars 1.4bn, from Dollars 1.38bn. Its agricultural segment had strong sales of crop protection products, but the medical side posted a decline in first-quarter sales. Its chemicals arm unveiled an operating loss, largely linked to accounting standards. In February, Cyanamid said it would spin off its Dollars 1bn chemicals business to shareholders later this year. Warner-Lambert unveiled an 11 per cent rise in underlying first-quarter earnings to Dollars 181.1m, or Dollars 1.34, from Dollars 163.6m, or Dollars 1.22, last year. Including accounting changes and a one-time charge in the latest quarter, the company had net income of Dollars 182.1m, or Dollars 1.35. Monsanto, the US chemicals group, has received approval to expand the use of its Nutrasweet or aspartame artificial sweetener. The Food and Drug Administration approved four new applications for the product, allowing it to be used in most non-alcoholic drinks, confectioneries, commercial baked goods and low-alcohol beer.</p>

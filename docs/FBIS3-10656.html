			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Coluna do Castello" column by Marcelo Pontes] </F>   [Text] Planalto Palace is taking all legal precautions in  preparation for a provisional measure to put price speculators  in jail. President Itamar Franco and [Finance] Minister  Fernando Henrique Cardoso asked the government's legal advisers  to present just a legally very well-founded text.    Franco and Cardoso fear that some gap will allow an  injunction or a habeas corpus writ to have the imprisoned  speculator released in just a few hours, demoralizing the  government's action when the government strongly needs to  demonstrate energy.    The preparation of this provisional measure demonstrates  that  the government finally admits to having committed a mistake in  launching an economic program that merely takes care of wages.  The economic team, scorched by the failure of the Cruzado  Plan's price freeze in 1986, avoided meddling with prices.    Challenged by indiscriminate price increases, the government  now faces a much more dangerous threat to the economy's  stabilization than the unclear votes in Congress, where the  program's future and the future of the finance minister's  candidacy for president of the Republic are at stake. This  threat is so real that there already exists URV [Real Value  Unit] inflation, as demonstrated by any price survey at  supermarkets.    Even the cries, fiscal terrorism, threats to expose the  privacy of income taxes or open up the country to imports, and  Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's public anger have not been  enough to prevent price abuses. The government is facing the  following dilemma: Either it becomes strongly involved, putting  some speculators in jail to demonstrate that it has not lost the  economy's control mechanisms, or the economic program and the  minister's candidacy will fail.    The prices issue also has become a key issue in the  discussion of the economic program in Congress. Deputy Miro  Teixeira, the new Chamber of Deputies Economy Committee  chairman, who belongs to the PDT [Democratic Labor Party] and  obviously supports [Rio de Janeiro] Governor Leonel Brizola as a  candidate for president of the Republic, on 7 March asked for an  expert in price monitoring to advise him. In Teixeira's  opinion, URV inflation, which he believes ranges between 4 and 6  percent, has begun to destroy the reputation of Minister  Fernando Henrique Cardoso's program.</p>

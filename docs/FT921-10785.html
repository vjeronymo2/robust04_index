			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Court bars release of PPI-frozen cash The central bank of the internationally unrecognised Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus yesterday lost an Appeal Court battle to be allowed to take Pounds 6m spending money from Pounds 23m frozen in its main UK account. The freezing order was imposed in October at the request of the administrators of Polly Peck International, the fruit and electronics group, who are seeking to recover funds allegedly improperly removed from the company. The bank was ordered to pay the administrators' costs incurred in opposing the appeal.</p>

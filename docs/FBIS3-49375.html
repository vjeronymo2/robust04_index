The Slovak Republic unambiguously favours this initiative  and wants to be an active participant in it, but sees NATO  membership as the real and permanent solution," Slovak  Presidential Spokesman Anton Bodis told CTK today.    Bodis described Kovac's interview with THE WASHINGTON POST,  saying, "the president did not formulate his idea of NATO  membership for Visegrad Group countries -- the Czech Republic,  Slovakia, Hungary and Poland -- as a "counter offer," but rather  as a possible alternative to the American initiative.    "The president can imagine a much faster admission of  Slovakia and the other Central European countries into NATO,"  Bodis said. "The first step would be their acceptance into NATO  as political members, together with the granting of security  guarantees. The Visegrad countries would then be required to  become full members of the NATO military organisation as well,"  he said.    Kovac is an advocate of the view that the Visegrad Group  countries should be considered a regional whole in the NATO  membership process, which, he said, would require active mutual  cooperation. Bodis said that Kovac did not believe that the  individual admission of Visegrad countries, separated by gaps of  several years, would aid stability in Central Europe.    Bodis added that Kovac intended to discuss the problems of  the Partnership for Peace during the Prague summit meeting with  American President Clinton next week.</p>

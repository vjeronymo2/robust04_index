			<p>BFN     [Text] The State Duma's draft resolution, approved on  Wednesday urges the Russian president to suspend the decree on  urgent measures to protect the population from banditry and  organized crime.    The resolution was supported by 246 deputies and opposed by  6, with 9 abstentions.    It is expected to be adopted in the evening.    The draft resolution says that the decree seriously limits  the constitutional rights and liberties of Russian citizens  without due reasons, and is at variance with the Constitution  and a number of articles of the Criminal Code.    It also says that the Constitution and the federal laws have  supreme status in the entire territory of the Russian Federation  and that the Supreme Court must be guided by the Constitution  and the current laws in handling specific cases.    The vote followed a report by head of the security committee  Viktor Ilyukhin of the Communist faction who said the  presidential decree was in breach of as many as eight articles  in the federal Constitution. He said the measure derailed  criminal legislation and suspended the existing Criminal Code.    For his part, head of the administration's human rights  commission Sergey Kovalyev said that "we have once again run  into a situation where government departments write laws for  themselves." He spoke of having evidence that the decree was  initialled by heads of the Interior Ministry and Federal  Counterintelligence Service (FSK).    First Deputy Interior Minister Mikhail Yegorov admitted to  being one of the decree's authors and pledged to be personally  responsible for carrying it out. He called for approving the  paper and gave reassurances that any police action would be  monitored by prosecuting bodies.    Presidential representative in the Federal Assembly  Aleksandr  Yakovlev also called to approve the decree. He said President  Yeltsin was seeking to do his best to crack down on gangsters  and ensure guarantees against police tyranny.    The president plans to send a bill on amendments to the  Criminal Code next week, Yakovlev said. He said the decree  would not be workable unless the law enforcement agencies came  up with rules on how to implement it, and offered deputies to  join a working group on this matter.</p>

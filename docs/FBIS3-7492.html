In the meeting held in the Diet building, Hata explained to  Mondale a package of macroeconomic measures the government  unveiled earlier Tuesday to spur domestic demand, market-opening  measures and overtures in the framework talks, the officials  said.    The framework talks collapsed at the Japan-U.S. summit in  Washington February 11.    Mondale told Hata he will carefully study the  English-language text of the package that he received from Hata,  the officials said.</p>

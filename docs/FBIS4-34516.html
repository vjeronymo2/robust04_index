			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago del Estero (DYN) -- Eleven former members  of Peru's Shining Path organization reportedly entered Argentina  illegally and are traveling to Buenos Aires to file for  residency as refugees.    The group's spokesman, Jorge Diaz Reategui, said that after  defecting from the Maoist guerrilla organization, the 11 wended  their way south with the assistance of international agencies  including the United Nations.    "First we went to Ecuador and later Brazil and Colombia,"  said Diaz Reategui, "but those countries did not agree to accept  us as refugees."    Diaz Reategui said he was a fighter with the group, known as  Sendero Luminoso in Spanish, but had only participated in three  conflicts.    The spokesman said the UN was supporting the former senderos  in Argentina. He added that he had been detained by police in  Tucuman for 10 days.</p>

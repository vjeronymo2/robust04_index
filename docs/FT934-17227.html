			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: North Sea's 'Piccadilly Circus' opens new line - Norway's giant Zeepipe today carries its first consignment of natural gas ZEEPIPE HAS none of the romantic resonance of the trans-Alaska or trans-Arabian pipelines. Yet the world's longest offshore gas pipeline, which snakes along the bed of the North Sea for 810km from the Sleipner A production platform, 148km off the Norwegian coast, to Zeebrugge in Belgium, also bears witness to an epic struggle to link remote energy reserves with industrial markets. Today the pipeline carries the first shipment to be delivered to western Europe under the 1986 Troll gas sales agreements, the largest commercial contract in the history of the petroleum industry. By the time it is fulfilled in 2021 at least 1,000bn cubic metres of gas worth about Dollars 100bn at current prices will have been sent to markets in Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria and Spain. Norwegian offshore workers call the maze of natural gas pipelines that converge near the Sleipner platform the 'Piccadilly Circus' of the North Sea. A clear sense of relief can be detected among officials of Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, which dominates the seven-company consortium, that the gas is even flowing through the complex interchange. After all, it was only two years ago when the concrete sub-structure upon which the Sleipner platform was to be mounted sank during testing in a fjord near Stavanger. When it hit bottom the shock waves registered at Norway's seismic centre. They also reverberated around Statoil's boardroom, where a decision was quickly made to try to adhere to the original schedule by building a replacement. 'We paid for two but got one' is how Mr Peter Mellbye, head of Statoil's gas division, sums up the accident, the cost of which is still being disputed with the builders of the sunken substructure and with insurers. Company officials concede that they had no choice but to try to meet the original deadline to reassure customers. Norwegian gas exports, which account for 10 per cent of the European Community market, face a growing commercial threat from Russia, which is keen to expand its 22 per cent share of the EC market by developing its massive reserves in Siberia and elsewhere. Statoil officials were also aware that the sheer size of the Troll project had raised doubts about its viability. Critics pointed in particular to the NKr120bn (Pounds 11bn) capital costs, Norway's reputation as a relatively high-cost producer and the technical challenge of working in the 300m water depths of the Troll field itself. 'I can't say it is one of the most profitable projects ever undertaken,' says an executive from one of the consortium members, 'but it certainly is one of the largest.' Statoil has also been plagued with problems in overcoming environmental resistance to landing another key pipeline - dubbed Europipe - in Emden, Germany. An existing line, Norpipe, terminates in Emden, which the company insists is the most convenient point to supply Ruhrgas, the biggest buyer under the Troll contracts. Company officials admit that they were surprised by the scale of local protests over Europipe's potential impact on environmentally sensitive mud flats in the area. They believe it will eventually be approved, although alternatives to Emden are being studied. Emden has already been eliminated as the terminus for a possible fourth pipeline, which the company says may be needed by the end of the decade. The focus today, however, is on Zeepipe and the successful development of the Sleipner field, even though it represents only the first stage of the Troll project, which is due to reach its plateau of annual deliveries of 44.7bn cu m in 2005. In addition to Sleipner, gas will be taken from the Statfjord, Heimdal and Gullfaks fields. Deliveries from Troll itself, western Europe's largest offshore field, containing 50 per cent of Norway's proven gas reserves, are due to start in 1996. And it is the development work on this part of the project that carries some of the biggest risks. Norske Shell, which has an 8.2 per cent share in the overall Troll project, is developing the field, which it discovered in 1979. A 430m-high platform, capable of withstanding 30m waves and strong currents, is under construction near Stavanger. It will rank as one of the largest man-made objects ever moved when it is towed out to sea next year. Original plans to process the gas offshore were dropped, and the untreated gas will be piped to a processing plant 65km away at Kollsnes, near Bergen before being sent through the 'Piccadilly Circus' of pipelines at Sleipner for onward transmission to customers. Shell officials say test transmissions of untreated Troll gas have resulted in higher-than-expected corrosion of the pipes. But they insist that the problem can be controlled and that the project remains on course for the 1996 deadline.</p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Proposed merger between Volvo and Procordia 'probably a bad deal for shareholders' STOCKHOLM decided that there was scant logic in the proposed merger between Volvo and Procordia. The Swedish Shareholders Association, which represents 80,000 private investors, said the proposal was 'probably a bad deal for shareholders in both companies'. Volvo free Bs initially rose SKr27 to SKr420 but closed only SKr5 up at SKr398, while Procordia free Bs fell SKr14 to SKr198. The Affarsvarlden General index rose 2.60 to 987.30 in turnover of SKr611m after SKr632m.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 15 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- An  emergency meeting on the human rights of the Koreans in Japan  was held here on May 10.    At the meeting, Shigeru Tokoi, chairman of the executive  committee of the Forum on Human Rights of Koreans in Japan, made  a report on the recent crackdown on the Osaka Prefectural  Headquarters of the General Association of Korean Residents in  Japan (Chongnyon) and its branch offices by the Japanese police.    "The search of Chongnyon by the Osaka prefectural police  took  place against the background of the Japanese Government  authorities' moves for effecting `economic sanctions,'  `emergency legislative arrangements' and `right to collective  self-defence' on the pretext of `North Korea's nuclear issue',"  said the appeal which was adopted at the meeting.    Political suppression gives rise to new human rights  violations and national discrimination, the appeal said, adding  that the recent search and the ensuing violence and outcries  against the Koreans in Japan are all violations of the human  rights of the Koreans in Japan, which create a terror-ridden  atmosphere every day.    "We declare with indignation that the national  discrimination  and human rights violations against the Koreans in Japan are a  specially grave and serious problem in Japanese society," said  the appeal.</p>

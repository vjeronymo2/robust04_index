			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Letter: Extension of council tax bandings would be more in touch with reality Sir, I have recently written to my MP concerning the adoption of the council tax, which I see as a reversion to the old rating system, but under a redesigned label. In my view, this tax is flawed at the top of the scale, reflecting a government thoroughly out of touch with reality. Although my reaction is stimulated by complaint, it is accompanied by a proposal for the extension of the valuation banding in a form which I believe to be more rational and more 'sensitive' than is the present format. Why stop bands at 'more than Pounds 320,000' when, around the country, in every county, on the perimeter of every largish town there are pockets of properties in value, even now, up to about Pounds 500,000? The existing scaling reveals a percentage differential between Bands A-F inclusive of about 30 to 35 per cent, but after Pounds 160,000 the incremental percentage jumps to 100 per cent. I suggest that valuation bands are extended quite logically and realistically to establish a scale cut-off at 'more than Pounds 550,000'. Thus: Band G - more than Pounds 160,000 and up to Pounds 220,000; Band H - more than Pounds 220,000 and up to Pounds 300,000; Band I - more than Pounds 300,000 and up to Pounds 400,000; Band J - more than Pounds 400,000 and up to Pounds 550,000; Band K - more than Pounds 550,000. This probably brings with it potential for improvement in council revenues. When such a scaling is introduced, I for one would feel rather better disposed towards the new tax than I do at present, when my small bungalow finds itself in Band G. Obviously, I have applied for an appeal form, in line I must assume with thousands of others. Kenneth Hunt, The Spinney, Ivy Lane, Woking, Surrey, 6U22 7BY</p>

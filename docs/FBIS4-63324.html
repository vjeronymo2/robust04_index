			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [G. Kukevich video report; from the "Dalniy Vostok" program] </F>   [Text] This event is significant not only for the Amur  Oblast residents, but for all of the state. Up till now, there  was not a single border marker at the eastern Russian-Chinese  border, neither at a land nor a river zone. Today, we are  adopting a practice of organizing state borders that is  generally accepted in the world. [Video shows interview with A.  G. Laskov, chief of demarcation group No. 5]    [Begin Laskov recording] There are two demarcation groups  working in our oblast -- Nos. 4 and 5. I can also say that the  length of the border on the Amur Oblast territory is 1,281 km.  The demarcation working groups, which are part of the  commission, started field work in early May last year. We were  preparing foundations for border markers, and determined their  topographic coordinates. Now, the new stage is erecting the  border markers. Overall, our group will erect 48 border markers  in Amur Oblast, and group No. 4 will erect 50. In other words,  98 border markers are to be erected in 1994-95. The  hydrographers group will determine the location of the main  fairway. Appropriate documents are being drafted on all of  these points, and the end result of our work is a protocol  describing the location of the state border line. After this  work is concluded, the border with China will be as in the rest  of the civilized world. [end recording]</p>

			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Court puts stopper on Champagne perfume THE French champagne industry yesterday won the first round in an acrimonious legal battle against Yves Saint-Laurent, the Paris fashion house, when it won a court order preventing YSL using the name Champagne for its latest fragrance. YSL is appealing against the ban, which applies only in France, but which will force it to change the name of Champagne within a month. If the appeal fails it faces substantial losses, given that it has already spent large sums publicising the perfume, which was introduced in France and other European countries last month. The typical cost of launching such a fragrance worldwide is Dollars 50m, with Europe absorbing Dollars 15m of the total. Elf-Sanofi, the French pharmaceuticals company that last year took over YSL in a highly controversial FFr3.6bn (Pounds 410m) acquisition, saw its shares fall from FFr1,022 to FFr988 after the court's decision. The affair has erupted at a time when YSL and Elf-Sanofi already face the threat of a legal investigation over suspected insider trading in YSL shares. The champagne lobby has claimed that the existence of a perfume called Champagne could confuse consumers and imperil the prestige of their product. If YSL loses the appeal, it will also face an unenviable strategic dilemma. Such large fragrance companies operate on an international basis and co-ordinate the marketing of their products so they are positioned in exactly the same way in every country. If YSL were forced to change the name of Champagne in France, it would torpedo its hopes of creating a coherent international image for the brand. Alternatively it might decide to change the name everywhere - an expensive option.</p>

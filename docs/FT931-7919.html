			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: ICI's splitting headache Having christened its pharmaceuticals side and reformed its management structure, ICI is just one small step from the giant leap of demerger. The performance of its shares since the scheme was hatched last summer suggests some scepticism of the practical benefits of separation. Even allowing ICI the benefit of the doubt on that score, there is a danger its enthusiasm will cloud its judgment on timing. In the absence of a remarkable turn-around in the final quarter, ICI can scarcely afford to pay a maintained dividend for 1992. Cutting the Pounds 400m pay-out would be easier to present as part of a demerger package. But distributing a reduced dividend between the two sides of the business will not be easy. Chemicals barely nosed into profit in the third quarter. A cyclical chemicals business might be forgiven for paying an uncovered dividend at this stage in the cycle, but over-capacity and a looming European recession make it far from clear when this side of the business will be in a position to pay its way. One way of assuaging such fears would be for ICI to endow the chemicals balance sheet with cash, or ask the pharmaceuticals side to bear a greater share of the dividend. That can only be at the expense of Zeneca's rating. The plan to raise Pounds 1bn cash for the group as a whole on a fancy drugs-company multiple already looks dated. Glaxo now stands on a yield and price-earnings multiple close to the market average. Since Zeneca is suffering from the patent expiry of its biggest-selling drug - and has a less promising research pipeline - it might be expected to trade somewhat lower. By pricing its rights at a heavy discount, Zeneca could doubtless attract underwriters to the issue. But the arithmetic suggests that a cash call from a unified ICI would make more sense. By delaying demerger until the prospects for both sides of its business are clear, ICI would leave itself open to accusations of dithering. But fear of being seen as indecisive is never a good reason for action.</p>

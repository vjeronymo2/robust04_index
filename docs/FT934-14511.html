			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Diplomatic high-flyer may face backbench flak: The task facing Christopher Meyer, the man just appointed to be John Major's press secretary MR CHRISTOPHER MEYER, the diplomatic high-flyer who takes over in January as the prime minister's press secretary, is widely described as a clever man. He will need to be. The position of Mr John Major's government could be worse, but not much. The latest ICM opinion poll, in The Guardian newspaper, puts Conservative support at 31 per cent, compared with 46 per cent for the Labour party. Mr Major's personal rating is 23 per cent - just ahead of Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, but well behind Mr John Smith, Labour's leader. Mr Meyer, 49, will not be expected single-handedly to revive the government's popularity. That is the job of the prime minister, the cabinet and Conservative Central Office, the party headquarters. The press secretary's job is more subtle. He relays the prime minister's views to political journalists, usually by means of unattributable briefings. He rarely speaks on the record and never gives television interviews. But his contacts with journalists help set the tone of media coverage, and he influences the government's overall communications strategy through a weekly meeting of departmental press secretaries, which he chairs. The two roles make him a powerful, if shadowy, figure. They also make him a target for criticism if things go wrong. Mr Gus O'Donnell, the affable economist who has done the job since Mr Major moved into 10 Downing Street in 1990, shares with the prime minister a south London background and a love of sport. He is liked by political journalists, who respect his honesty and his refusal to cross the line which separates the assiduous civil servant from the party hack. Yet Mr O'Donnell, 41, has been the target of a whispering campaign among backbench Tory MPs, mostly disaffected rightwingers, who blame him for the government's apparent inability to get its message across. Even loyal backbenchers have called for changes to improve presentation of government policies. Mr O'Donnell has not been forced out. He is leaving voluntarily for a senior Treasury post advising on monetary policy. But the prime minister has taken the opportunity to beef up his media presentation. Mr Meyer, a Cambridge history graduate, is Britain's deputy ambassador in Washington, where he and Sir Robin Renwick, the ambassador, are regarded as the most influential British diplomatic team for years. Mr Meyer is thought to have been in line for promotion to ambassador before deciding to accept the job at Number 10. He made his name as head of the Foreign Office news department from 1984 to 1989, when he acquired a glowing reputation as a tough and intelligent aide to the then foreign secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe, now Lord Howe. He is best remembered for a coup at the 1987 Commonwealth summit in Vancouver, when Lord Howe and Mrs Margaret (now Baroness) Thatcher, then prime minister, were under pressure from Canada to reduce British trade with South Africa. Britain appeared likely to suffer a serious diplomatic defeat until Mr Meyer discovered some little known figures demonstrating that Canada was also trading with South Africa on a much greater scale than had been realised. Sir Bernard Ingham, then Lady Thatcher's press secretary, describes him as intelligent and clear-minded, with enough political nous to restrict himself to representing the prime minister, rather than falling into the trap of charting his own course. But the best political antennae in the world will not protect him from the wrath of Tory backbenchers if things continue to go badly for the government. 'My experience is that MPs panic every five minutes,' says Sir Bernard. 'When the government goes wrong they always blame the presentation. They tried to force me to quit regularly.'</p>

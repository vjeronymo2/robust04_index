			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Bursting branded bubbles Procter &amp; Gamble's price offensive in the US detergents market has blown more bubbles up the noses of investors worried about brand values. There may be specific reasons for P&amp;G's campaign: the need to counter Unilever's launch of super-concentrated detergents being one. But the move also reflects the general industry shift towards the latest fad of everyday low pricing. P&amp;G has been cutting the promotional spend on 70 per cent of its products, allowing it to reduce prices. The sums may only work, though, if P&amp;G is able to make similar cuts in costs. P&amp;G's press conference today may reveal how. The question worrying investors, though, is whether such moves are short term expedients designed to address flagging sales or longer term strategies which will re-write the rules of the branded game. Trading conditions have changed greatly since the 1980s. Companies are being forced to adapt. Whereas the 1974 and 1981 recessions were followed by bursts of medium economic growth and high inflation, the outlook for the 1990s is for low growth and low inflation. This is squeezing consumers' discretionary spending and emphasising value. That said, branded companies able to offer demonstrably superior products at modest premium prices should continue to thrive. The 5 per cent fall in Unilever's shares over the past two days is surely overdone. But such companies will have to overcome a wave of adverse sentiment before they can hope to reverse their recent share price weakness.</p>

The stress is put  on the importance of CFD as an aerodynamic design tool to  drastically reduce both cost and period of development.    Prior to the application of CFD to practical design problem,  the existing CFD codes must be verified with the reliable  experimental data. A demonstrative example of CFD validation is  presented to show the state of the arts of CFD by comparing the  Navier-Stokes simulation results with the transonic wind tunnel  test data for a NACA0012 airfoil at several angles of attack.    The importance of application of CFD to inverse design  problem is also discussed.  <H5>  1. Role of CFD in Aircraft Development </H5>   It is no exaggeration to say that the wind-tunnel test used  to be the only design tool available for aerodynamic design  work. We create an artificial air flow inside the wind tunnel at  the same velocity as during flight, we insert a small model of  analogous shape to the actual craft, and we measure the  pressures on the surface of the model and the other aerodynamic  forces which operate on the model as a whole, thus obtaining the  data necessary for the design. However, wind-tunnel tests have  to be repeated time and time again until an airfoil shape is  obtained which satisfies the desired performance figures. This  requires the expenditure of enormous amounts of time and money.  Furthermore, due to the interference caused by the wind-tunnel  walls and model supports, and to the Reynolds number effect, it  is very difficult to create the same conditions of air flow  inside a wind tunnel as occur in actual flight. As was pointed  out early on, the influence of the Reynolds number becomes  increasingly problematic in aerodynamic design as aircraft  become larger and faster.    But things have changed dramatically in the field of  aerodynamic design in recent years with the advent of the  supercomputer and the amazing developments in CFD (computational  fluid dynamics). By leaving to CFD many of the things that  previously had to be done in wind-tunnel tests in the  aerodynamic design process, the cost and time required for model  fabrication and wind-tunnel operations can now be drastically  reduced. CFD is particularly well suited to parametric studies  involving shape variation and the like. CFD is expected to play  an increasingly large role, as compared to wind-tunnel testing,  in the conceptual and preliminary design phases. At the current  time, however, due to the computing times involved, almost all  of the computer code used in design work that is  three-dimensional is potential flow analysis code.[.sup]1[/]  As a consequence, it is very difficult to evaluate aerodynamic  characteristics at off-design points where viscous effects are  prominent. So wind-tunnel tests are also required in the  preliminary design stage. In order for Navier-Stokes code to be  used freely as the design code in actual design work settings,  the entire operation -- beginning with airframe shape  definition, including grid generation and numerical computation  of flows, and ending with the derivation of the final  aerodynamic coefficients -- must be concluded within a single  dat,[.sup]2[/] plus the computation time for each case for  the same shape must be on the order of several minutes.  Essential to achieving this will be the development of a  numerical wind tunnel having functions for the automatic  generation of airframe surface grids and space grids, and a  computer with the power to process at 100 GFLOPS or faster.    At the stage of the main design or detailed design, after  the  preliminary design work has been done, CFD still has a large  role to play. Ordinary high-subsonic-speed transport aircraft,  such as the Boeing 747 Jumbojet, are different from fighter  aircraft or space planes in that the surrounding flow is in a  relatively simple condition, with either little or no  separation. It is in this field of aerodynamic design for  airliner airframes that CFD really shows its power.  <H5>  2. Wind-Tunnel Tests and CFD Reliability </H5>   In Figure 1 we have a single diagram that summarizes the  results of testing the NACA0012 wing shape in a typical  two-dimensional wind tunnel.[.sup]3,4[/] The shock wave  position (distance from leading edge taking wing chord length as  1) is plotted on the vertical axis, and the Reynolds numbers  based on chord length on the horizontal axis. Despite the fact  that this is a relatively simple flow under conditions of Mach  0.8, 0 angle of attack, and wing symmetry, the position of  the shock wave is greatly different from wind tunnel to wind  tunnel. A number of factors may cause these differences,  including interference between the top and bottom and left and  right wind tunnel walls, air flow bending, error in Mach number  setting, model fabrication errors, and measurement errors. By  looking only at this diagram there is no way in the world for us  to determine which data are more correct, but  McCrosky[.sup]3[/] analyzed these wind-tunnel test data and  predicted that the true shock wave position must be somewhere  between the two dotted lines that are parallel to the horizontal  axis (i.e. between 44% and 48% of the chord  length). The data  of Harris (NASA) -- which is considered the most reliable  wind-tunnel data and is widely cited to demonstrate CFD  precision -- comes in on the upper dotted line (48% line,  corrected [square] marks), while the data from the NAL  two-dimensional transonic wind tunnel ([bullet] marks, corrected  for wind-tunnel wall interference)[.sup]4[/] fall in between  the dotted lines, even though showing some variation. (Note that  when no corrections are made ([circle], [triangle] marks), the  shock wave is positioned considerably upstream.)     <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-26A>           Figure 1. Shock Wave Position vs. Reynolds Number </FIG>      As seen in the foregoing, it is possible to considerably  reduce the variation between different wind tunnels by  correcting for the wind tunnel walls, but it is utterly  impossible to make all the data agree. Each wind tunnel has its  own peculiarities, and it is next to impossible to eliminate  these. Not only this, but when the same model is retested on a  different day, there is usually some disparity between the two  sets of data. The problem is so-called reproducibility. What  then about CFD in this respect? The situation is absolutely the  same. There will be as many answers as there are people making  the computations, as there are schemes used, and as there are  grids. The designer does not know which data can be relied upon.  Well, at least this was the situation in the early days of CFD  development. But CFD has developed rapidly since those early  days, and its effectiveness is now as widely recognized as its  limitations. When there is either very little or no separation  in the flow, so long as we use schemes and turbulence models  that are reliable in the foregoing examples, for instance,  almost all of the solutions are nearly the same if the number of  grid points is large enough. And when it comes to  reproducibility, CFD is perfect.    We next turn our attention to a comparative study of CFD  generated numerical solutions and wind-tunnel data on the  NACA0012 airfoil. The basic equations used in the computations  were the thin-layer-approximation Reynolds-average Navier-Stokes  equations and, for the turbulence model, the Baldwin-Lomax  algebraic model.[.sup]5[/] The scheme employed was the TVD  difference method[.sup]6[/] with the Roe flux separation  method modified for high precision by the MUSCL method. The  computation grid adopted was the C-type grid that excels in wake  resolution. In order to eliminate the grid point number  dependence for the numerical solutions, when the number of grid  points in the flow direction and in the direction perpendicular  to the wing plane, respectively, were increased in multiples, as  soon as the drag coefficient ceased to vary that was determined  as the optimum grid (approximately 25,000 total grid points with  this solver), and this was used in all of the computations.  Moreover, unless otherwise noted, the entire flow region was  considered to be turbulent.    We begin with the comparison of shock wave positions. In  Figure 1 are noted both the computed shock wave positions for Re  = 2.1 x 10[.sup]7[/] and 1.2 x 10[.sup]6[/] ([diamond]  marks). The shock waves are positioned at 48.5% for high  Re  numbers and at 47% for low Re numbers. From these  results, we  think that the true position of the shock wave is somewhat  downstream of McCrosky's prediction. We next compare the NAL  two-dimensional wind-tunnel data, Harris data, and McDevitt data  with the computed pressure distribution at Mach = 0.8 and Alpha  = 0 (cf. Figure 2). The McDevitt results agree roughly with  the computations, the Harris results have the shock wave  position slightly shifted, and the NAL wind-tunnel data not only  have the shock wave pushed quite a bit to the fore but exhibit  disagreement in terms of the pressure distribution immediately  forward of the shock wave. We believe this is either due to the  wind-tunnel model being made incorrectly or a failure to  completely eliminate the side-wall effects. In actuality, as is  indicated in Figure 3, when the model fabrication precision was  enhanced, and the tests were run again with the model's aspect  ratio changed to 2.0, the results ([triangle] marks) agree well  indeed with the computation results. If this be so, it would  seem well to do all the tests with the 2.0 aspect ratio, but a  high volume of air becomes necessary when the Reynolds number  becomes high, and data productivity becomes extremely poor, so  this cannot always be done.     <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-27A>           Figure 2. Computed Pressure Distribution and Test Pressure </FIG>       <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-27B>           Figure 3. Computed Pressure Distribution and Test Pressure </FIG>      The comparisons so far have had to do with such localized  phenomena on the model surface as shock wave position and  pressure distribution. Next let us look at the drag values where  a higher order of precision is required. In Figure 4 we have  plotted both the NAL and the Harris test data with the Mach  number on the horizontal axis and the coefficient of drag on the  vertical axis. The Harris drag is large because the Reynolds  number is low, while the drag values from the NAL wind-tunnel  tests are lower than the values calculated with the assumption  that there is a transition at the leading edge, but agree well  with the values computed when the transition point is fixed at  5%. The NAL tests were conducted with natural transitions.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-27C>           Figure 4. Mach Number vs. Drag Coefficient </FIG>          Next we take up the issue of the reliability of the results  given by CFD when lift is involved. In Figure 5 we compare the  theory and the experiments for Mach = 0.777 and Alpha =  1.536. Both agree well overall, including agreement in  shock wave position and intensity. (In this test we used a model  having an aspect ratio of 1.5, and the computations were done  with the transition point fixed at 5% of the wing chord.)  However, upon closer examination, we see that there is a  discrepancy between the two at the root of the shock wave. (We  have already discussed the cause of the difference in pressure  immediately forward of the shock wave.) This is because the  shock wave and the boundary layer interfere, so that the  boundary layer separates at that point and forms a small bubble  above the wing surface. The Baldwin-Lomax is said to not  function well for separation flows such as this, and that turns  out to be the truth, but if the flow again adheres to the wing  surface, then the agreement between theory and experiment again  becomes good, as is evident from Figure 5. This indicates that,  even if there is separation, the Baldwin-Lomax model produces  good flow approximations so long as that separation is localized  at the root of the shock wave.     <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-28A>           Figure 5. Computed Pressure Distribution and Test Pressure </FIG>      Next let us return to the comparison of aerodynamic  coefficients. As can be seen from the drag polar curve in Figure  6, good agreement is indicated between experiment and theory. In  particular, the values calculated with the transition point  fixed 5% from the leading edge coincide perfectly with  the test  data. We do see some variation in the vicinity of where the lift  becomes zero, but this gives us a certain index of the  reproducibility of the experiment or test. Every time the test  is conducted symbol-sized differences appear, but this cannot be  helped. We also included the Harris data ([triangle] marks)  here, but these data are not all that pertinent because the  Reynolds number is different and the data have not been  corrected.     <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-28B>           Figure 6. Drag Coefficient vs. Lift Coefficient Curve </FIG>    The foregoing has been a comparison between CFD and  wind-tunnel tests with a two-dimensional airfoil. The next step  naturally would be to do the comparison for a three-dimensional  airfoil. Unfortunately, however, for the three-dimensional case,  we have no available precision data which can be trusted or  backed up by multiple wind-tunnel tests. Some of the data may  provide surface pressure distributions but no drag or lift  information, or if it does provide such information it is often  very difficult to predict correct drag values due to the  influence of model-support stings or side-wall effects. If we  look only at the pressure distributions, it has already been  demonstrated that the CFD results agree very well with the  wind-tunnel tests so long as separation is small, as in the  two-dimensional case. Next, Japan also needs to quickly play  special three-dimensional experiments and tests for obtaining  precision data not only on pressure distributions, but also of  course on force data, on parasitic drag distributions and  velocity distributions inside the boundary layer, and on wake  structures, etc., all with the objective of verifying the CFD  code. We would also like to see international wind-tunnel tests  conducted in the interest of enhancing data reliability if this  be possible.  <H5>  3. CFD Application to Inverse Solution Method </H5>   The discussion thus far has focused entirely on comparisons  of CFD and wind tunnel test data. It should be noted that there  is no difference whatever between these two methods insofar as  they both simulate flows around given objects. Using CFD in this  way is, of course, very important. But it should be even more  important to employ CFD in trying to solve problems that are  difficult or impossible with wind tunnel tests. One example of  this is the inverse problem solving method that plays such a  major role in wing design. An inverse problem would be to derive  the cross-sectional shape of a wing from a given pressure or  velocity distribution. Wind tunnels are not very amenable to  such problems. Inverse solution methods are used in a wide  variety of ways. They can be used, for example, 1) to pass  isobars over a three-dimensional wing, 2) to designate lift  distributions or moments, 3) to suppress undesirable leading  edge peaks, 4) to weaken shock waves, 5) to prevent  trailing-edge separation, 6) to achieve wide layer flow regions,  etc., etc. Many different procedures have been proposed to date  for resolving such inverse problems, but they can be roughly  divided into the following three categories: 1) Direct methods  in which, in principle, pressure distributions (or velocity  distributions) are designated on boundaries, and then solutions  that satisfy these are obtained from potential equations or from  the Eulerian equations so as to derive the desired airfoil  cross-sections. 2) Optimizing methods, which constitute one type  of indirect method, in which the flow analysis code and optimum  value problem solving code are combined, and these are used  alternately and repeatedly, sequentially correcting the  cross-sectional shape of the airfoil until the pressure  remainder (difference between desired and calculated pressure  distributions) is minimized. 3) Remainder correcting methods,  which also constitute a type of indirect method, but in which an  airfoil-surface correction code that is based on a shape  approximated by means of fluid dynamic equations is used instead  of the optimum value problem solving code. This author has  already developed one inverse solution method[.sup]7[/] that  belongs to this third category and which is being widely used in  many quarters.[.sup]8,9[/]  <H5>  4.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In funding the President's Environmental Technology Initiative, the House Committee on Appropriations directed EPA, ``*&blank;*&blank;* to develop a comprehensive environmental technology strategy characterized by innovation and a nonbureaucratic approach.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> House of Representatives, 103rd Congress, Committee on Appropriations report, June 22, 1993, Report 103&hyph;150, p.47.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA's draft  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Strategy <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  provides a plan to directly and indirectly support private sector innovation and diffusion activities sponsored by the public and private sector and close coordination among Federal agencies. It focuses on creating incentives for the development and use of innovative technologies in federal and state environmental regulations, reducing barriers to technology innovation and use, and improving the competitiveness of the environmental technology industry in domestic and international markets. EPA and other Federal, state and local agencies, universities, trade associations and consortia, and numerous private companies are already working in many of the areas identified in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Strategy <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . EPA is seeking public comment on the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Strategy <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to focus and target efforts to accelerate environmental technology development, commercialization and use. The Agency's Innovative Technology Council plans to revise and update the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Strategy <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  based on the comments received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of ``environmental technologies'' being addressed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Strategy <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  varies widely for a number of reasons. The ``environmental technology industry'' has only recently become a focal point for market analysts and policy-makers, and it is highly diversified in terms of the current demand for and supply of technologies, goods and services. Demand often varies based on local environmental conditions. ``Environmental technologies'' include technologies, goods, and services whose development is triggered primarily by environmental improvement objectives. Sometimes referred to as ``dark green'' technologies, these include: products and services to monitor and assess pollutant releases and exposure levels; innovative technologies which prevent pollution, control air and water pollution levels, safely manage waste and remediate contaminated soil and groundwater; and, manage environmental data. EPA's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Strategy <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  also addresses ``light green'' technologies that are developed primarily for non-environmental reasons; those technologies can have indirect, but important consequences for improving environmental quality. An example, would be local area computer networks designed to enhance office communication, but which also reduce paper use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is interested in promoting all phases of technological change such as: the research and development of new concepts; preliminary design testing and pilot applications of evolving technologies; performance demonstrations and testing; evaluations of early commercial applications; and diffusion into domestic and international markets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The draft `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Technology Innovation Strategy <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' outlines the general principles that guide EPA in its efforts to foster innovation in its existing programs and new projects being initiated under the President's Environmental Technology Initiative in FY1994 and FY1995 to foster the development and use of environmental technologies in solving the nation's environmental problems. It outlines four objectives:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Adapt EPA's policy, regulatory, and compliance framework to promote innovation;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Strengthen the capacity of technology developers and users to succeed in environmental technology innovation;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Strategically invest EPA funds in the development and commercialization of promising new technologies; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Accelerate diffusion of innovative technologies at home and abroad.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA invites comments on the draft  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Strategy <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and the following questions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Pensions The scale of the UK's personal pensions scandal continues to shock. It now looks as though about 850,000 people were persuaded to take out personal pensions instead of staying with or joining company pension schemes. Compensation for such 'opt-outs' could exceed that for those who stopped working for a company and then transferred a lump sum out of its scheme. Nobody knows how big the total compensation bill will be. But the figures of Pounds 1bn-Pounds 2bn being bandied around do not look ridiculous. Many life companies will be able to shield their shareholders from the worst of the damage. The bulk of the compensation may be paid from 'with-profit' funds, meaning policy-holders will bear the pain. Unit-linked groups could be more at risk, as it is harder to see how they could dip into some of their investors' funds to pay compensation to others. The cost of compensation will be only part of the industry's agony. It will face an administrative nightmare sorting out which policy-holders qualify for compensation. Each case will require detailed individual investigation. Disputes involving lawyers cannot be ruled out. There will also be long-term damage to the industry's reputation. Sales of pensions and other life policies have already fallen sharply. In future, sales people will need to put in much greater effort if they are not to fall foul of the regulator's 'best advice' rules. With full commission disclosure due next year, the industry may be unable to pass on the costs of good advice.</p>

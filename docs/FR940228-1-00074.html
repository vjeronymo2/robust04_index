			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of circumstances that could affect an institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA program do not, under the Secretary's current practice, require the institution automatically to apply for recertification under subpart B of these regulations. Instead, these circumstances require the institution to notify the Secretary, and, if necessary, provide specified information about the circumstances. These circumstances parallel many of those described in 34 CFR part 600 requiring the institution to notify the Secretary of changes that could affect the institution's eligibility. Based on that notification and information, the Secretary determines whether the institution must apply for recertification. If the institution need not apply, the Secretary notifies the institution under the provisions of 34 CFR 600.30 that the institution continues to be eligible and participating. If the Secretary needs further information to make that determination, the Secretary requests additional information from the institution or requires the institution to apply for recertification. These procedures apply to the following circumstances: (1) A change in name, address, or location of the institution or one of the institution's locations; and (2) the inclusion in an institution's participation of a location that offers less than 100 percent but at least 50 percent of an educational program. In making the determination that the institution must apply for approval, the Secretary takes into account the institution's ability to provide adequately education or training at the location, including such factors as the percentage of an educational program offered at the location and the financial and administrative capability of the institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under current practice and under these proposed regulations, a participating institution that wishes to include in its participation a location that offers less than 50 percent of an educational program need not provide any notification or application to the Secretary, unless the Secretary so requests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, a participating institution must apply for certification if the institution wishes to continue to participate in a Title IV, HEA program following a change in ownership that results in a change in control. The regulations governing institutional eligibility (34 CFR part 600) contain the requirements governing institutions that change ownership resulting in a change of control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New section 498(g) of the HEA requires the Secretary to establish a schedule for the expiration of the approval of institutions to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. Once this schedule is in place, each program participation agreement will have a specific expiration date. To continue participating in the Title IV, HEA programs beyond the expiration date of its program participation agreement, an institution will need to apply for and be granted approval for continued participation. The Secretary will notify an institution well in advance of the expiration date of the institution's program participation agreement that the institution must apply for and be granted continued participation. If an institution does not apply for or is not granted approval for continued participation by the expiration date of the institution's program participation agreement, the institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs would expire on that expiration date. In this case, the Secretary may choose to provisionally certify the institution. Provisional certification will be addressed in more detail later in this discussion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations would specify that an institution that applies for participation in any Title IV, HEA program must apply on the form prescribed by the Secretary and provide all information and documentation requested by the Secretary. The Secretary would like to clarify that an institution may be asked to supply additional information in support of its application after its initial submission. This does not represent a change from current procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.13&blank;Certification Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, the Secretary informally refers to the procedures by which the Secretary certifies that an institution meets the standards in subpart B of these regulations and accordingly may participate in a Title IV, HEA program as the ``certification procedures.'' The Secretary proposes to add a new &sect;668.13 to codify these procedures. This section also would include proposed procedures whereby the Secretary codifies new statutory provisions governing certification and provisional certification procedures for participation in a Title IV, HEA program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

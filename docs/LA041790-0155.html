			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DISNEYLAND MANHANDLED WOMAN, KIN SAY;  </P> <P> ASSAULT CLAIM: A PARK SPOKESMAN SAID SECURITY PERSONNEL WERE CONDUCTING A  SHOPLIFTING INQUIRY. HE DENIED THAT A PREGNANT WOMAN WAS ROUGHED UP.  </P> <P> A pregnant San Bernardino woman was hospitalized early Monday after she got  into a scuffle with Disneyland security officers during which, her relatives  claim, she was "body-slammed" to the ground.  </P> <P> Disneyland officials deny that the woman, Kimberly Richardson, 23, who was  about two days overdue to give birth, was manhandled and say they intend to  press shoplifting charges against her.  </P> <P> Anaheim police said the park has filed a complaint alleging that Richardson  shoplifted a telephone address book valued at $2.50 as she was about to leave  the compound around 12:05 a.m. Monday.  </P> <P> Disneyland spokesman Bob Roth acknowledged that security officers "stopped"  Richardson on a "shoplifting inquiry." However, he said, "We deny all  allegations that a woman was assaulted by Disneyland security personnel." Roth  declined further comment.  </P> <P> Richardson's cousin, Latonya Walker of Redlands, said she, Richardson and two  other cousins were about to leave Disneyland just after midnight when the  incident occurred. Walker said five plainclothes security officers pushed  Richardson through the turnstile and slammed her to the ground.  </P> <P> "They threw her to the ground . . . a second time and then they pinned her  down," Walker said.  </P> <P> Richardson began to scream "Help! Help! What's going on?" Walker said. "Then,  one of the plainclothes men said, 'That's not the one.' "  </P> <P> Walker and another cousin, Roxanne Moore, denied that Richardson or any member  of their party had stolen anything.  </P> <P> Moore said that after a crowd had gathered to watch the commotion, uniformed  security officers arrived and advised their plainclothes colleagues to leave.  </P> <P> Moore said, "I yelled out, 'Do you all see what they are doing to us?' But they  were telling the people who gathered around to leave. They were saying that  they had everything under control."  </P> <P> As the cousins were being interrogated by the uniformed security officers,  Richardson managed to slip away, Moore said. Walker said Richardson later told  her that she fled because she thought the plainclothes officers were the same  men who had hurled racial slurs at them earlier in the day. Richardson and her  cousins are black.  </P> <P> Anaheim Police Lt. Jack Parra said a patrol officer who responded to a call  from Disneyland officials later found Richardson walking in the vicinity of the  Disneyland Hotel.  </P> <P> Parra said the officer directed Richardson and her relatives to UCI Medical  Center in Orange, where Richardson was examined in the obstetrics emergency  room. UCI spokeswoman Fran Tardiff said Richardson suffered a bruised knee,  adding that both Richardson and her unborn baby "are in stable condition." She  was transferred to the St. Bernadine County Hospital in San Bernardino on  Monday afternoon.  </P> <P> Parra said Disneyland officials have filed a complaint alleging that Richardson  shoplifted a Chip N' Dale telephone address book from a souvenir stand.  </P> <P> Parra said Disneyland officials told police that Richardson "slipped and fell"  when she attempted to flee from the custody of the park's security officers. He  said the case is under investigation, the results of which will be turned over  to the city attorney's office.  </P> <P> Richardson was unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> Moore, who traveled from Fremont to visit her pregnant cousin, said they had  decided to visit Disneyland to try to induce labor in Richardson. "Her doctor  told her that she should do some walking since she was about two days overdue,"  Moore said. "So she walked there for about seven hours and rode It's a Small  World a little and we were about to leave when this happened.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY EARNINGS: AMERICAN PACIFIC MINT POSTS GAIN IN QUARTER  </P> <P> American Pacific Mint, a Woodland Hills-based wholesaler and retailer of  precious metals and jewelry, reported net income of $149,194 for the second  quarter ended June 30, compared to a loss of $141,704 a year earlier. Revenue  grew more than fourfold to $8.6 million from $2.1 million.  </P> <P> Robert L. Zuber, American Pacific Mint's chief financial officer, credited the  company's increasing diversification into the jewelry business for the improved  results. The firm intends to keep selling gold and silver bullion, its original  business, Zuber said. But it plans to further emphasize its jewelry lines to  offset its vulnerability to swings in the bullion market.  </P> <P> The company also cited its recent acquisition of a controlling interest in  Alaska Precious Metals Ltd. as contributing to the improved results.  </P> <P> In the first six months of 1989, American Pacific Mint earned $45,432, compared  to a $338,421 loss in the first half of 1988. Six-month revenues more than  doubled to $12.6 million from $5.5 million.  </P></p>

			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Management: An active 'no' to passive smoking - Health Check IN THE home, in hotels and in aircraft, busy executives are exposed to it: a human carcinogen so powerful it is classified along with such notorious substances as arsenic, asbestos and benzene. After several decades of intensive research the evidence is that environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), or passive smoking as it is known, is a potential killer. Studies show it causes heart disease, lung cancer and chronic respiratory illnesses. In the US alone, 53,000 deaths are attributed to passive smoking every year, making it the third highest cause of lifestyle-related deaths, after active smoking and alcohol disease. Most of the research on passive smoking since 1984 has demonst-rated the causal relationship with fatal diseases - not least the review in 1986 by the US Surgeon General and the National Academy of Sciences. Critics (including those from the scientific community) often cited investigator and other bias in attempts to discredit that work, but they have since been confronted by more meticulous findings. In 1991, an article published by the American Heart Association presented data which revealed passive smoking lowers exercise capacity in both healthy and coronary patients, a hallmark of impaired coronary circulation. Among other immediate effects of passive smoking is the increased clumpiness or stickiness, of clot-forming cells (platelets) in the blood. This plays an important role in plaque and clot formation in coronary circulation. Passive smoking also causes an oxygen supply/demand imbalance by increasing heart rate and blood pressure and interfering with oxygen uptake by the red cells, thereby reducing supply. One researcher exposed healthy young women to pure air contaminated with tobacco smoke while the subjects exercised on a treadmill. The results in heart rate, blood pressure, exhaustion, perceived exertion and oxygen uptake were similar to patients with heart disease. Of the 4,000 or more substances identified as carcinogenic, atherogenic (plaque forming), antigenic (allergy-forming) and mutagenic in tobacco smoke, all those implicated in causing heart disease and lung cancer in active smokers were found in ETS as well. In an earlier Danish study of pregnant women - a study of the ultimate passive smoker, the foetus - marked degenerative changes were noted in the umbilical arteries of newborns of smoking women. The weight of the 'smoking newborn' was, on average, nearly 500g less than their non-smoking counterparts. Children are better off with non-smoking parents: toddlers under the age of one have significantly more bronchitis and other respiratory illness when one or both parents smoke. As the child grows, exposure to passive smoking in the home will lower lung capacity, predisposing the child to lung illnesses later in life. At the office, ETS levels are higher than in the home, due to the higher density of smokers. Employers are getting the message and are justifiably concerned with maintaining productivity and containing health care costs and absenteeism. Insurance industry studies indicate smokers are more likely to have higher health costs and more sick days than non-smokers. A careful analysis of health claims and absentee data of passive smokers is the critical next step. The link between ETS and lung cancer was claimed in research from the Harvard School of Public Health published last autumn in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Those involved used clever innovations to overcome investigator bias: autopsy lung specimens of several hundred non-smokers aged over 35 who had died of non-cancerous and non-respiratory causes (heart attack was the most common cause of death) and independent interviews with survivors regarding occupational and smoking status. The researchers concluded that pathologic (possibly pre-cancerous) changes were higher in non-smoking women, married to a smoker. Possibly the most incriminating link in the connection between ETS and disease came via the tobacco industry. In a survey, published by the American Journal of Public Health, of researchers who had received funds from the tobacco industry's Council for Tobacco Research, 99 per cent of respondents agreed smoking was addictive and 94 per cent believed passive smoking was dangerous to health.

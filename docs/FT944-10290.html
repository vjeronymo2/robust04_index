			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / People: Lloyds; limbering up in Latin America Time was when the Bank of London and South America was one of the biggest names around in Latin American banking. No longer. And Latin America was one region of the world where its successor - Lloyds Bank - has retained a significant presence as it pulled in its horns elsewhere to concentrate on the British market. It and its subsidiaries and affiliates still employ 3,600 people in the region. For most of the debt-distressed 1980s, however, it was a case of slimming down and staying put. Now, with hopes growing about the region's economic prospects, the bank is thinking about moderate expansion. The two people charged with this are Freddy Gibbs (above left), a banker of 35 years' standing who is based in Sao Paulo, where he'll stay to be general manager of the bank's Latin America southern region. He will be responsible for the bank's operations in Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay and keep an eye of Chile, Peru and Bolivia. In Argentina, where the bank has been operating for 130 years, the bank employs about 800 people, the same number as work in Brazil - where Lloyds also has a 51 per cent stake in the wholesale bank, Multiplic. Alexander Ashton (near left), a Lloyds banker since 1972 with experience in Europe and the Middle East, takes over the northern region and will be based in London. He will be responsible for the bank's operations in Honduras, Guatemala, Panama, Ecuador and Colombia. 'One thing we hope to do is get more involved in the financing of trade within the region which is growing quickly but quietly at the moment,' he says.</p>

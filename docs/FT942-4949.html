			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / International Company News: Leading Finnish bank cuts losses Losses at Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Finland's leading commercial bank, narrowed sharply to FM275m (Dollars 50m) from FM626m in the first four months, as it benefited from reduced credit losses, new business and lower interest rates. However, it said it expected a full-year deficit of up to FM1bn before returning to the black next year. Last year, the bank made a FM2.66bn loss, in its third consecutive year in the red. The recent improvement was attributed mainly to the drop in credit losses, from FM933m to FM537m. This would have been much higher had the bank not anticipated continuing problems by establishing a FM900m general provision at the end of last year. It used all but FM300m of the facility in the first four months.</p>

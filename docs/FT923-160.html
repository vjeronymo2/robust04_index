			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Arms treaty clears last obstacle to ratification THE Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start) yesterday passed its last big hurdle before ratification, when the US Senate defeated an attempt by six right-wing Republicans to block passage, writes George Graham in Washington. While Start has already been superseded in many respects by the more radical bilateral nuclear arms cuts agreed by President George Bush and President Boris Yeltsin at their summit in Washington in June, the administration has argued that its ratification is still important, both because the June agreement builds on Start's warhead cuts and because of the verification procedures it sets up. But Senator Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming, with five other Republicans, had complained the treaty had too many loopholes - particularly the exclusion of mobile missile launchers. The Senate swept his objections aside with an 87-6 procedural vote, clearing the way for ratification before Congress adjourns next week. Under Start the US would have to cut its strategic nuclear warheads to about 8,550 by 1999, while Russia would cut back to about 6,450 strategic warheads. The subsequent reductions agreed in June will further lower the number of warheads to 3,800-4,250 apiece by 1999, and to 3,000-3,500 by 2003.</p>

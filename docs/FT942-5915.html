			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Arts: Acclaimed King Lear cuts the deepest - Theatre Trailing a wake of acclaim from last year at Stratford-upon-Avon, Adrian Noble's Royal Shakespeare Company production has reached London, still with Robert Stephens as the King. The acclaim was deserved. If a 'complete' representation of King Lear is a will-o'-the-wisp ideal, this one cuts deeper than most, and more consistently. No other that I have seen has laid the chill metaphysical bleakness of the play so bare, nor made so strong a case for recognising that as its central theme. What do you want from a King Lear? If it is tender, heart-rending moments, Noble is brusque with those. On his view of the play, they would be sentimental cheats. Instead, all the lusty intrigues are set in a coolly distant (but beady-eyed) focus. The human twitchings and cavortings serve only to confirm Lear's ultimate discovery: that scarcely anything in this indifferent world matters much, nor suggests anything else for our consolation. As a mere poetical message, that might ring dully; but Noble sees to it that all the dramatic action is superbly clear and vivid ' Lear has a complicated story ' and leads inexorably towards the cruel final vision. Anthony Ward's designs reduce the earthy details to bare symbols, but his churning astronomical backdrops stress the inhuman grandeur of a 'real', space-eye setting. The experience is worth it, despite some calculated losses along the way. Nothing becomes Stephens' Lear like going mad. From there he expands into profound, shattered insights ' hugely indulged by the production, and quite rightly. Earlier he has to play his King to daughterly stereotypes: Abigail McKern's Cordelia (dressed as a goody-two-shoes with pigtail and chaste tunic), Jenny Quayle's Regan (a sexy, overly bright-eyed hostess) and Janet Dale's anxious little Goneril, who looks like something between Goldie Hawn and the ex-Islington leader Margaret Hodge. At the start, their daughterly effusions ' pretty set-speeches, every one (even Cordelia's) ' are urged on by sympathetic chuckles from Lear's courtiers. It is shocking and irrational, then, that the King should reject Cordelia's plainer homage so violently, without warning; but such things do happen, and the play goes on to record much nastier twists among its personnel. Little by little the sharpest vicissitudes fade into temperate blurs, because the overwhelming pointlessness of life swallows them up without naming favourites. Along the way the RSC players supply vital flashes: David Bradley's Douglas Hurd-like Gloucester (prissy, decent and politic), David Calder's staunch old Kent, Ian Hughes' archly androgynous Fool, Mark Lockyer's repellently oily Oswald. Simon Russell Beale's saintly Edgar is perhaps elevated a touch too far. John Normington keeps his Albany down to a level of intense decency, and Owen Teale plays the bastard brother Edmund with expansive relish, while Simon Dormandy taps an authentic, even psychopathic vein for his horrifying Cornwall. One way and another, the icy, colossal scale of the play makes itself felt as I have never met it before. Barbican Theatre, in repertory until August 30.</p>

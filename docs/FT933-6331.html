			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Boost for spending on south Italy THE ITALIAN government is to accelerate about L10,000bn (Pounds 4.22bn) of spending on public works to create jobs and limit rising unemployment because of the recession. More than a third of the investments will go to the depressed south, where unemployment exceeds 21 per cent. Although the spending has been welcomed, it largely represents money which has already been allocated in existing budget plans. With fears of at least 200,000 more job losses by the end of the year, which would take average unemployment to more than 12 per cent, some economists fear that the latest steps may not be enough to fight the recession. Most of the money will go on transport infrastructure and new buildings. About L5,000bn a year will be invested in improving rail services in 1993 and 1994. Ministers hope work on the new high-speed train project can begin by December. Construction for the network, which will eventually link Italy's biggest cities, will begin with the Rome-Naples stretch to provide jobs in a region of high unemployment. In all, the six-year scheme, which will cost almost L24,000bn, is expected to create about 50,000 jobs. Meanwhile, L7,500bn has been allocated to improve and update the motorway network over the next five years. The bulk will go on a new highway to take pressure off the overcrowded stretch between Florence and Bologna. The projects should create about 14,000 jobs.</p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC beef exports surge but stocks still grow THE EUROPEAN Community overtook Australia as the world's largest beef exporter last year, as overseas deliveries surged by nearly a half. But in spite of the sharp rise in exports, EC beef intervention stocks ended the year at record levels, according to estimates by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In its latest annual report on international meat markets, Gatt says that only a sharp increase in import demand by the former Soviet Union averted a big drop in beef prices last year. As it was, prices were sluggish as global output continued to exceed consumption, a situation exacerbated by large supplies of poultry, pork and lamb at increasingly competitive prices. To achieve a sustained firming of beef prices major suppliers will need to align output to relatively slow growth or even declines in consumption in the medium term, the report says. Otherwise world beef markets may be faced with another oversupply crisis in the next few years. The 27 signatories (including the EC) to Gatt's Arrangement on Bovine Meat, a voluntary code to promote trade, account for about 90 per cent of world beef exports and close to 60 per cent of global beef production and consumption. Their exports of beef increased by nearly 5 per cent in 1991 to an estimated 4.36m tonnes, carcass weight equivalent. EC beef exports jumped by 48 per cent to 1.16m tonnes, while Australian shipments, reflecting lower sales to Japan, fell 15 per cent to 1m tonnes. Brazil and the US also increased beef exports by 44 per cent and 15 per cent respectively. The EC's export surge resulted mainly from a 100,000-tonne sale to Brazil and the sending of an estimated 250,000 tonnes to the Commonwealth of Independent States. In November 1991, the EC concluded a beef-for-oil barter deal with the CIS involving 100,000 tonnes of French beef, to be delivered in 1992. Soviet beef purchases, accounting for more than 10 per cent of the world beef trade last year, helped the EC to avoid a surplus crisis. Even so, in December 1991, EC beef intervention stocks had reached an estimated record 903,000 tonnes. Another saving factor noted by Gatt was the virtual disappearance last year of most central and eastern European countries from the beef export scene. Their beef production has fallen sharply because of the collapse of exports to the former Soviet market as well as domestic economic and political upheaval. Global beef imports rose by about 3.5 per cent in 1991, the report says, despite lower purchases by Japan and the US. Washington imposed 'voluntary' export restraint agreements on Australia and New Zealand in November 1991 after a surge of beef imports earlier in the year. In 1992 Gatt expects world beef exports to shrink by perhaps 1.6 per cent, as slow economic growth continues to dampen demand in industrialised countries. It also sees further reductions in meat output, consumption and trade in eastern Europe over the next two to three years, while the situation in the CIS 'is, at this stage, unpredictable'. Despite higher demand in the Middle East and some North African and Asian markets, 'it is doubtful whether other developing countries will be in a position to import increased quantities of beef', the report says. World beef output is expected to decline this year by 0.7 per cent after a 2.5 per cent rise in 1991. In the longer term Gatt notes a trend to slower growth of cattle herds in an increasing number of countries due to genetic developments and improved cattle feeding and finishing techniques. These are likely to result in shorter cattle herd cycles in coming years, the report says. International Markets for Meat 1991-92.

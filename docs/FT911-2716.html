			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Love and death in the city of lost hopes: It is two years since tanks crushed the Peking rebellion. In the heady days before the uprising Peter Ellingsen fell in love with a young student - but the thugs in China's security forces had other ideas YOU GET USED to the scrutiny after a while, though faces and lenses constantly watching never seem normal. 'The guards are for your protection,' an official explained shortly after I arrived. I am not sure what I, a journalist, expected of Peking in the early summer of 1988, but once past the ugly buildings, the huge motorways and the vast emptiness of Tiananmen Square, I found a spirit of remarkable buoyancy. With the reform process in full swing, there was a sense of expectation among the young. A week after arriving, I found myself sitting on the cluttered floor of a tiny dormitory in a co-ed art college, talking about Western music with students I had met at an exhibition. They were not afraid to speak out. There were predictions of China loosening up, becoming richer and freer and turning its back on the strictures of the past. As the autumn of 1988 turned into the winter of 1989, Peking was full of hope and fun. Rock and roll parties were staged in Ritan Park and many intellectuals, emboldened by the moderate policies of Zhao Ziyang, the Communist party boss, began to agitate for the release of political prisoners, in particular the freeing of Wei Jingsheng, who was going insane while serving 15 years in prison for his part in the 'Democracy Wall' movement in 1979. Writers and academics gathered in JJ's, a tiny bar favoured by Peking's in-crowd, to frame a petition calling for Wei's release. Their action was to set the scene for seven weeks of student demonstrations and the eventual storming of Peking by tanks and heavily-armed troops who slaughtered an estimated 1,000 people. But for me there was a personal sequel, as important in its own way as the Big Event. The woman I was to marry was one of the hundreds of thousands of students who gathered peacefully in Tiananmen Square in those heady days of spring 1989. Jin Yan, a musician, with no real knowledge of politics like so many other young people, joined in the festival atmosphere, innocent of the past and with no sense of the terrible denouement to come. She was not in the square when the tanks rolled in early on the morning of June 4 and because she played no active role in the demonstrations she was not on any hit list when the post-massacre purge began. But that hardly mattered. In the murderous days after June 4, as soldiers toting AK47s stalked around the city, firing at people on street corners and in their homes and shoving gun barrels in the faces of drinkers in bars, order was turned on its head. To 'liberate' the capital, they were going to crush it, and they did, at one stage murdering a handful of young men whose only crime was to be found standing beside the Peking Hotel. Some days after soldiers cleared Tiananmen Square I had to run for my life when troops of the Peoples' Liberation Army opened fire close to the Peking Hotel. One man had a revolver put to his head because he did not stop his truck quickly enough at a road block. Children were hit by stray shots and people everywhere were beaten by rifle butts and hauled from their homes into detention. Attempting to maintain contact with Jin Yan meant a series of nervous, late-night phone calls and anxious meetings in hotel lobbies. We were followed and our conversations, I believe, were monitored. Even two months later, when apparent order had been restored, our effort simply to marry was enough for her to be treated like a criminal. It was not a political persecution - unless that term is used to cover the humiliation that befalls anyone in China - and I suspect that it had little to do with party order. But under a repressive state apparatus there is no refuge. Everyone is a target. In this small episode, no one was beaten, jailed or tortured, but the security forces have many other less obvious means to destroy dignity and hope. In a nation without an independent system of law, just sharing a meal at my apartment was enough for Jin Yan to be taken by the compound security guards - they said for a one-hour 'interview' - and treated as a criminal. It was about 10pm when the two guards demanded that she accompany them to a staff building at one end of the compound, but despite their assurances, by midnight she had still not returned. Waiting in the August chill, I became increasingly worried and decided to enter the building - which was out of bounds to foreigners - and systematically search each room. Opening one upper floor door I glimpsed a wall of TV monitors, the outlet for the closed circuit cameras around the compound and in its lifts, and was rudely ordered to leave. When I demanded to know what had happened to Jin Yan, there were smirks from the security guards and a curt demand that I go home. 'Go to bed,' a sullen security guard said. 'She has been taken home, there's nothing to worry about.' 'Are you absolutely certain?' I asked. 'How did she get home, and what about her bicycle?' 'We have driven her home,' he answered, 'it is nothing to do with you.' When I protested that this was my fiancee they were talking about, they gave me a blank look. 'She is Chinese,' they said. 'You are a foreigner.' Shaking with anger, I scanned the faces of the small crowd that had gathered in the room to enjoy my distress. They were clearly relishing the reversal of roles. No longer the foreigner, envied for his passport and its benefits, I was just another body sinking under the dead weight of bureaucracy. I rushed out, found her bicycle still standing where she had left it, and raced across town to collect Jin Yan's parents, returning to the building shortly after 1am. With a deference ordinary Chinese are conditioned to show even in the face of the most banal authority, her parents politely asked after their daughter and were arrogantly told the same story. I did not believe it, and when her mother recognised Jin Yan's bag lying on a side table and we realised that she was still in the building, I felt a surge of anger and frustration that must be commonplace among the Chinese who are routinely lied to and deceived. The discovery bought denials and threats from the most vocal of the security guards, a corpulent man with a bloated, red face and eyes that showed he savoured the joys of petty power. We glared at each other as he stood, arms folded, at the top of the concrete stairs. Two diplomats from the Australian Embassy arrived at around 2 am, but still the charade went on. 'This concerns a Chinese, you have nothing to do with it,' the crimson-faced guard told Colin Heseltine, the Embassy Minister. 'This man is an Australian citizen, but he is engaged to the girl,' Heseltine argued. We had no alternative but to wait until Jin Yan was finally released around 3.30am, after more than five hours of interrogation. Despite a complaint being lodged there was no apology, nor any explanation. Jin Yan had told her inquisitors of our impending marriage and had been derided. 'He'll never marry you,' they sneered. 'Why are you seeing a foreigner. What do you do together. What does he say?' were among the more polite questions. In the post-Tiananmen atmosphere any local dealing with a foreigner, especially a 'spy', as all correspondents are alleged to be, was regarded as suspicious and presented a chance for humiliation, a favourite pastime of Chinese officials. Yet she had broken no law. Worse was to come. We were followed by plain-clothes security, our car tyres were slashed, people close to us were harassed. Finally, in order for us to to marry, Jin Yan had to leave her university shortly before she was to graduate. After a holiday in February 1990, when I thought it was all over, I had another altercation with three of the compound's guards, led by our red-faced friend. I had driven past the armed police sentry, along the discoloured snow leading into the compound's garage, when the three blocked our way, ignoring signals to move. They glared and shouted belligerently, saying I was a journalist, not an envoy, and enjoyed no diplomatic privilege. 'You want to leave China,' the red-faced one bellowed, adding that, married or not, Jin Yan was Chinese and might have problems departing. Their anger was driven partly by the loss of face suffered because we, contrary to their best efforts, were still together. Disregarding the threats we walked away. At least now we were married and had a way out. For most Chinese the bullying by all levels of authority cannot be avoided. As we sat in our apartment, I sensed a little of what it must be like for the Chinese to live under this state of siege, with no appeal against injustice and no dignity or status, save that conferred by proximity to power. I double-bolted the door that night, half expecting the security men to attempt a jackbooted entrance. As I looked out on to Chang An, Peking's Avenue of Eternal Peace, where eight months before I counted more than 60 tanks crawling along, guns blazing, China, the police state, seemed like a disease crawling across my skin. Despite the lies of Peking, 'stability' has not been restored in China. Just because people are not protesting does not mean that they are without grievances. Instead of leaving their critical faculties at the airport, visiting politicians would be well advised to forgo their five-star hotels and sense the frustration in the streets. In the southern city of Kunming, for example, I glimpsed a piece of theatre that says more about how resentful and alienated people are, and how few options they have, than could ever emerge from a VIP banquet. A young peasant boy and an office worker had collided on their bicycles and were haggling about who was at fault. There was no solution, just a release of tension and entertainment for the crowd. Remonstrations went on for more than an hour, but no one was inclined to compromise or to exchange personal details so as to settle differences later. It seemed a huge and draining waste of time, until I realised that this was a cathartic release and that the office worker's bike was a fancy model which would have cost more to fix than the young peasant could afford. No one wished to lose face, so they kept traffic waiting while they battled away. Many of the more than 100 onlookers were unemployed, or under-employed, something else the government does not like to talk about, although the total number of unemployed is now more than 100m and a force for widespread discontent. In the crowd, I noticed a young man locking his arm around his girlfriend. I had seen such grappling before and it had nothing to do with sex. The grip was too desperate and public to be play. As the dusty, difficult, no-prospects world he knew rolled by, he was clinging to what was probably was his only valuable 'possession', which is how many Chinese boys think of their girlfriends. In a rigidly controlled society, with its limited chances, she was one of the only icons of hope he could aspire to. If they are lucky, they will stay together and have some sort of shield against China's callousness, although as people stop believing in anything, including the party, divorce is increasing and families, the traditional mainstay, are being put under pressure. As I was about to leave Peking, a Foreign Ministry official handed me a plate as a memento, saying that, though the dish was light, the sentiment it carried was heavy. It was a thoughtful gesture, and while I am not sure what his words meant, if they were to do with the burden that the Chinese continue to carry under communism, then the gift is not only weighty but fired with more sadness that either or us could know.</p>

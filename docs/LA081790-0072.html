			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHILD SURVIVES AS SHOTS PIERCE HOME;  </P> <P> VIOLENCE: 8-YEAR-OLD IS WOUNDED AS SHE SLEEPS. POLICE SEE NO MOTIVE FOR GUNFIRE  IN SOUTH-CENTRAL NEIGHBORHOOD.  </P> <P> The blood has dried on the living room sofa where 8-year-old Jacqueline  Aguilera was nearly killed by shots that suddenly slammed through the walls and  door of her parents' South-Central Los Angeles apartment early Thursday.  </P> <P> "We heard shots and then her screams," the child's uncle, Franklin Vallecillo,  24, said, pointing out four large holes in the front door and walls, from  bullets shot by unseen assailants for no apparent reason.  </P> <P> "She was screaming, 'Daddy, what happened to me? What hit me?' " her father,  David Aguilera, 28, said. "She was covered in blood."  </P> <P> The long-haired child, whose dancing eyes and big grin shone from a large  photograph on a wall of the East 54th Street apartment, had been seated on a  red velvet sofa a few feet from the front door. She had fallen asleep watching  television, her uncle and father said, when she was wounded in the cheek, arm  and legs.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center said the child was  in stable condition Thursday.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Police Detective Dennis Scherr said the family, immigrants from  Nicaragua, had no known gang affiliations and the shooting seemed to have  occurred without motive.  </P> <P> "We have no witnesses," he added.  </P> <P> "We've been here four years, with no problems," Vallecillo said. "Nothing ever  happened. Never."  </P> <P> When the shooting started, Jacqueline's father, who is a construction worker,  and 7-year-old brother, Dennis, were asleep in one bedroom and Vallecillo was  asleep in another, he said. The child's 26-year-old mother, Savaluz, a postal  worker, was at work.  </P> <P> The shots rang out shortly after 12:30 a.m., Vallecillo said. When he ran to  the living room, the uncle said he saw that Jacqueline had fallen from the sofa  to the linoleum floor.  </P> <P> "We picked her up and put her on a bed and tried to calm her until the  paramedics came,." he said.  </P> <P> The small three-bedroom apartment had been converted from the garage of a  two-story apartment building. Thin wooden panels of garage doors make up most  of the outer wall of the $400-a-month unit, which faces a back alley.  </P> <P> Neighbors contacted Thursday said they did not know the Aguilera family.  </P> <P> Even though gangs are common to the area, "it's real quiet," Lupe Estrada, 58,  said.  </P> <P> However, another resident said a car "throwing bullets" drove through the block  about half an hour before the shooting of the child.  </P> <P> The building where the Aguileras live is a few doors from the location of the  1974 police shootout with members of the Symbionese Liberation Army, when  publishing heiress Patty Hearst was a fugitive.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A study by the Federation of Indian Chambers of  Commerce and Industry says the Indian pharmaceutical sector has  nothing to fear from the intellectual property rights regime.  It said already 85 to 95 percent of the essential drugs are out  of patent limits and the remaining drugs will also be off the  list by the time the law comes into force in the next 10 years.  The study was on the impact of GATT on Indian economy.    The study said prices of drugs will not rise before 2005 AD  and this would give the Indian industry sufficient time to build  its research and development activities. The study also says  India stands to gain by about $4.5 billion by the turn of the  century under the new trade setup with benefits of around $1.5  to 2 billion in the initial years. The increase in trade is  likely to occur from the tariff reduction on a number of  agricultural and industrial products.</p>

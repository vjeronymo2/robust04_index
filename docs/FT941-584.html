			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Survey of Rhone Alpes (3): EU flag flies highest - Lyon There are three flags fluttering on the flagpole at the arched entrance to the Hotel de Ville in Lyon: the tricolour is one, the city flag is another, but the flag that flies the highest, is the blue and yellow banner of the European Union. The Lyonnais, predictably, are fiercely proud of Lyon's position as France's second city after Paris. They are also acutely aware of the importance of its location: so close to the French borders with Switzerland, Italy and, even, Germany. The Lyonnais are now counting on the city's excellent logistics to repair the damage of the present recession and to secure its future. 'Historically Lyon has owed its success to its role as a crossroads not only between Paris and Marseille, but between France and its neighbours over the Alps,' says Jacques Moulinier, deputy mayor and head of economic development. 'Europe now needs crossroads cities more than ever and Lyon is perfectly placed to play that role.' Lyon, which has sprung up around the meeting point of the Rhone and Saone rivers, traces its trading post role back to the Bronze Age. It became the religious capital of the Gauls before being converted to Christianity and in the Renaissance era was, thanks to the skill of its silk weavers and bankers, one of Europe's busiest commercial centres. Yet Lyon has a second, rather more romantic side to its heritage: the legacy of centuries of political and intellectual dissent. In medieval times it was the heartland of Waldensian heresy - a renegade sect that rebelled against the established church - and became a centre for the resistance during the second world war. More recently Michel Noir, its conservative mayor, has perpetuated the dissident tradition by breaking away from the RPR, the Gaullist party led by Jacques Chirac, the powerful mayor of Paris. Michel Noir is still at loggerheads with the RPR and also faces the threat of imprisonment if he is found guilty of involvement in l'affaire Botton, a fraud case for which Pierre Botton, his son-in-law, has already been convicted. 'If he loses the case he'll lose everything,' says one Lyon businessman. 'But if he wins, Michel Noir will be mayor of Lyon for life.' While the mayor fights for his political future, Lyon itself is trying to get to grips with its economic problems. The local economy has traditionally been more robust than that of France as a whole and, indeed, than the rest of the Rhone-Alpes region. The recession started later in Lyon than in other French cities, notably Paris, Lille and Marseille, but it has since struck particularly sharply. Until two years ago the level of unemployment in the Rhone area around Lyon stood at 8.5 per cent, well below both the national average of 9.8 per cent and 8.7 per cent for the rest of the Rhone-Alpes region. It now stands at 11.7 per cent, only a fraction below the national figure of 11.7 per cent and above the Rhone-Alpes average of 11.4 per cent. The situation is even worse in les zups, deprived suburbs on the fringes of Lyon such as Vaulx-en-Velin and the Les Minguettes area of Velisseux. The level of unemployment in these areas hovers at about 25 per cent and is even higher - more than 30 per cent - among school leavers. There are signs that the worst of the recession is over and that the economic situation is stabilising. 'It's more a matter of sentiment than of firm figures,' says Guy Barriolade, chief adviser to the president of Communaute Urbaine de Lyon, the district council. 'But local companies do seem more confident and the trading climate is more positive.' Lyon's response to its recent economic problems has been to stick to its long term strategy of trying to upgrade its international image so that it can attract the large investment programmes it needs to generate new jobs and to stabilise its economy. The main aim of this strategy is to overcome the shortcomings of its 'second city' status by enhancing its role as a decision-making centre. The city has already benefited from the long term policy initiated by the old socialist government of decentralising the French public sector by moving a number of organisations from Paris into the provinces. It has also succeeded in attracting a number of international institutions, notably Interpol, the espionage network, and more recently, the Aspen Institute, which is setting up its French headquarters in the city. But Lyon lost an important battle last year when it was beaten by Frankfurt in the race to house the European Monetary Institute. Some locals still blame the French government for its defeat arguing that Edouard Balladur, the RPR prime minister, baulked at supporting the Lyonnais bid because of Michel Noir's break with his party. Undeterred, Lyon is pressing ahead with its image improvement strategy. It started in the 1980s by revitalising its university: investing in new facilities and bringing many of the 75,000 students back from the suburbs into the city centre. It has also embarked upon an ambitious arts programme. Its state-of-the-art opera house, designed by Jean Nouvel, opened last summer, and a contemporary art museum at the Cite Internationale complex designed by Renzo Piano, the Italian architect, is scheduled to open next year. These new buildings are not only intended to enhance the city's cultural facilities but also to focus attention on the picturesque aspects of Lyon - the quays along its two rivers, the lovely old buildings of the old town and its wealth of museums - rather than its commercial status. The city is also improving its infrastructure by continuing the road construction programme begun in the 1980s. This programme will be costly because of the difficulty of tunnelling through the hills that loom up behind the old town. But building work has begun on a peripherique ring road to encircle the city centre and on a new motorway by-pass for the Paris to Marseille route. The biggest and most expensive project of all is the ambitious plan to extend the TGV network across the Italian border to Turin. 'It's the catalyst we need to really establish Lyon as an international business centre,' says Mr Moulinier. He adds: 'We've done all the preparatory work. Now it's up to the politicians.'</p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Rival poll claims amid Albania's dire poverty ALBANIA'S former communists and their opponents both predicted victory yesterday in the last days of a bitter election campaign in a country so poor it can barely afford election posters, AP reports from Tirana. 'The opposition will win,' Mr Aleksander Meksi, deputy chairman of the anti-communist Democratic Party said flatly. 'The fear has gone and there are few possibilities to manipulate results.' But the leader of the Socialist Party, the former communists, predicted his party would win Sunday's vote, the second in the year since Europe's poorest country ended more than four decades of Stalinist rule. 'I am confident we will emerge as the largest single party in the country,' said socialist Mr Fatos Nano, 'because we are offering a radical transformation of society specifically adjusted to Albanian conditions.' Last March, the Democratic Party had been in existence for only three months, but provided a strong challenge, winning 75 of 250 seats. This year, 11 parties are running a total of 521 candidates under a new election law that will reduce the number of parliamentary seats by two fifths. Under a mixed system of direct and proportionally allotted seats, the new parliament will have between 140 and 155 seats depending on how many parties receive at least 4 per cent of the vote. Besides the Democrats and the Socialists, the two strongest parties are the Social Democrats and the conservative Republicans. Tirana is virtually without election posters because of a shortage of paper. Those few printed are often torn down by political rivals. Many Albanians lack even the basic necessities. Small children, dirty and in rags, approach foreigners begging for money in Tirana. More than half the workforce is jobless and is supported by the government printing money. Electricity and water are sporadic. Foreign food aid feeds most of the population, and several people have been killed in food riots at government warehouses. Much aid is not easily distributed because of a lack of transportation. Mr Meksi said his anti-communist party, which has had US diplomats and other westerners speaking at its rallies, stands the best chance to obtain enough foreign aid to end despair. 'I know for sure that the Socialist party will be unable to do anything,' should it win the elections. He said if the socialists win, strikes and other protests will deepen Albania's chaos. On the hustings, Democratic Party leaders have drawn surprisingly large audiences in rural areas, many of which voted communist a year ago. Mr Nano, while predicting victory for his socialists, warned that Albania is so polarised that one party cannot govern alone. He said he preferred a coalition government of experts. President Ramiz Alia, the former Communist party chief who permitted political reforms under intense public pressure in late 1990, wants political parties to co-operate.</p>

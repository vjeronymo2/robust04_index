			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Nader hits at accord MR Ralph Nader and officials of 11 consumer and environmental groups yesterday said Nafta was 'so detrimental' the US Congress might be forced to reject it. They expressed disappointment that Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, had decided not to send the pact back for renegotiation if elected. 'Clinton does offer an alternative plan that tries to solve environmental concerns,' said Mr Michael McCloskey, chairman of the Sierra Club. 'Unlike George Bush, he is willing to link Nafta's successful completion with environmental safeguards.' The groups challenged the administration's claim that Nafta was the 'greenest' trade pact. Criticisms included: Nafta rests on an assumption that trade will generate wealth, which will then be used to pay for clean-up; it fails to deem poor environmental rule enforcement an 'unfair trade practice'; sanitary and phytosanitary standards still leave legitimate consumer and environmental laws open to challenge as trade barriers.</p>

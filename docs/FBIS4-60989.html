			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS Correspondent Lyudmila Glazovskaya report </F> "exclusively for ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA" on interview with  Turkmenistan President Niyazov: "Saparmurad Niyazov, President  of Turkmenistan: My Program is Ten Years of Stability"]    [Text] At the end of April a large group of Moscow  newspaper chief editors went to Turkmenistan at the invitation  of President Saparmurad Niyazov.    To be fair to Saparmurad Turkmenbas, there wasn't a single  question which gave him cause for self-justification or  self-congratulation. The only quality which he did permit  himself was to be frank and to detailed. It is no coincidence  that he frequently talked about the Niyazov of old -- the  communist who sincerely believed in the party's ideals and then  believed in Gorbachev and perestroyka.    What has changed his attitude toward the things that he held  sacred? Where is that dividing line between his past and  present? How did this happen and how quickly was it achieved?  Why is Turkmenistan, which was the last to leave the USSR and  which, incidentally, made no efforts to rock it, now rejecting  the very idea of any superstructure -- be it political,  economic, or humanitarian? Furthermore, Turkmenistan has been  putting forward initiatives to which others have been  affiliating. Whereas the Ashgabat meeting of CIS heads of state  determined the consultative nature of the Commonwealth and its  voluntary strategy, the recent Moscow meeting was a reflection  of the practical approach, as observers could not fail to  notice. In any event the new consultative structure -- an  economic commission in place of the proposed suprastate  committee -- was proposed by Turkmenistan and all the other  members of the economic union voted for it.    So what kind of country is Turkmenistan -- visited by Le Pen  and Mitterrand, a magnet for where Western investors, where the  Constitution proclaims a secular democratic system, where there  are portraits of the president wherever you go, and where his  picture appears on the currency? There are questions to be  answered there.    There are answers, too. But how would you like us to  develop? Yesterday it was "with Lenin in mind," but today:  What? Nature abhors a vacuum. Way back, we drove out  religion; then we exalted communism; and now we want democracy.  And where do we want it -- in the East?    Yes, the president agrees. "The East is a subtle thing." He  recalled how in India he was presented with a figure of a  smiling man. Turn it round and you are holding a saber in your  hand...    But to return to the Politburo.... Gorbachev himself  admitted that there were people there who would embrace you and  at the same time, perhaps, wanted to strangle you....    Now try to guess which place is more enigmatic, the East or  the West? And in what way? People are people everywhere and,  as we know, there are no bad peoples. There are unfortunate  people. Take the Turkmens: They used to produce vast amounts of  oil and gas, but still could not "force" a school out of the  USSR State Planning Committee without being subjected to  insults. There is still no drinking water in the west of the  Republic, where they are presently holding the fourth  international tender to prospect for hydrocarbons (the country  is fourth in the world).    So what does this mean -- are we to go back under one roof  again, the president asked himself? We do not deny the merits  of the system, he said, which ensured us universal education and  gave us access to Russian culture and the cultures of other  peoples. We do not deny the obvious, he said, and that means  first and foremost the indissoluble spiritual link between our  peoples. But we are opposed to everything that is artificial  because we have seen from our experience that it cannot exist on  living soil where real people live.    How does the "life" of the portraits tally with that claim?  Do not bother to look for a hidden oriental meaning in this,  Niyazov said. If a colossus such as Lenin has been toppled, the  time will come when I, a mere mortal, will also be cast down.  What private property owner am I foisting my portrait on? What  factory owner am I forcing to name his factory after me? He  would laugh, and that would be that. Furthermore, Niyazov, in  his own words, is not foisting anything on anybody right now.  He tried to ban the celebration of his birthday, but the  Assembly unanimously turned down his request. Niyazov, who in  eight years has not arrested a single dissident and who has not  used the least force against anyone, reasonably reserves to  himself the right to not to ban anything, including his own  portrait. However, he does not hide the fact that he sees some  point in creating the image of a national leader, whoever it may  be. "Until they acquire peace and material sufficiency, the  people must believe in someone and something. Otherwise there  will be chaos." That is the Turkmen president's main creed,  which he used as the basis of his main program "Ten Years of  Stability."    A transitional period and a popular consciousness unprepared  for the market are the alpha and omega of his political  activity. If you bear in mind the kind of political cocktail  that this consciousness entails in the post-communist East, it  is not hard to understand Niyazov's logic: Like a pharmacist,  he is forced to weigh all the moods in society in his political  scales.    "Do you think that everything has gone smoothly here?" he  asked his guests. "Not at all. Ashgabat and Nebitdag have  experienced their first-ever interethnic pogroms. The  intelligentsia held rallies to defend the exclusive right of the  national language."    A transition from social to private ownership or vice versa  is, of course, very difficult. That is why the transitional  period is so important. In Turkmenistan this means a phased  transition to different forms of ownership, the privatization of  enterprises -- the small ones first, and then the large ones --  and the flotation of leading sectors of the economy.    But an outlet into the world market was needed for gas  products -- the main national product, and one has been found.  At the moment it is still at the planning stage, admittedly,  but these are very important plans. One gas pipeline will go  via Iran and Turkey to Europe, another via China to Japan. The  East and Asia will be linked by a transcontinental railroad  through Turkmenistan. It is already being built, and quite  quickly, too.    However, everything takes time. "We are not crowing about  our successes," the president said. "We are proud of our  stability and of the bridges that we have built with the people  through the provision of free gas, water, and electricity, and  of our consistent social policy. As for everything else,  matters are not going very well here -- which is true of  everyone. So that we are no better than anyone else."    As for the feature, which distinguishes him from the rest,  he  says that it is the fact that he has been working with his team  since day one of the proclamation of independence. Indeed,  Niyazov has replaced virtually no one in that time because he  believes that, first, you do not changes horses in midstream and  second, change for change's sake is absurd. Here, too, he is  frank, and asserts that when you cannot emerge from the womb of  socialism and become a marketeer overnight. For that you need  property, and that is true even of a high-ranking official.    "You want people to criticize me," he told the journalists.  "But you try to make them do that when everyone is still afraid  for his own job -- a fear dating back to the times of  `communism' -- and is thus afraid for the future of his family  and children too."    But why criticize without genuine cause? There are arguments  within Niyazov's cabinet, but no one has any intention of airing  them in the press. That would be ridiculous.    Judging by how attentively the journalists listened and the  way that their facial expressions changed, you could tell that  Saparmurad Niyazov's words had an effect on them.    In any event the Moscow visitors were convinced that  Turkmenistan is indeed going its own road, that peace reigns  here, and that this is the most valuable thing of all....</p>

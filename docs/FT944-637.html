			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Perspectives: Delusions about charity - Truth of the Matter / Max Wilkinson debunks one of the most enduring fables of the season It has been called the Wenceslas myth. Right-wing politicians give it ruder names. Modern socialists try to escape from it. Lady Thatcher battled against it. It is an obvious fallacy. Yet we are all, at one time or another, seduced by this powerful illusion. The myth, as my colleague, Samuel Brittan explained*, is to believe that the state has money to spend generously on the people's welfare. Politicians often exploit this idea, for example by giving pensioners supplements at Christmas. The truth is that, unlike Wenceslas, elected governments have not a penny of their own money to give to the poor. Governments spend other people's money, or money obtained by forcing taxpayers into debt. Politicians may claim to express the generous impulse of voters when they distribute cash and benefits to the less well-off. We may heartily approve of this; but we should never allow our rulers to assume moral superiority, nor delude ourselves that the government can give us anything that we have not given to it. Wenceslas's winter walk, Brittan says, was a different matter. Like the present Queen of England, he had money of his own to spend on castles, trumpeters, banquets, dogs (even, had he been less saintly, on loose women and song). So when he and his shivering page-boy took food and wine to the poor man underneath the mountain, Wenceslas put his hand in his own pocket. Brittan used the Wenceslas myth to explain the limits of government powers: that 'what comes out must go in'. The puzzle is that this economic truism has been so widely ignored and is even now considered by lecturers in some former polytechnics to be right-wing propaganda. But there is a greater puzzle: why does anyone admire Wenceslas for his charitable exploit? Let us not be diverted by the 'real' history of the 10th-century Bohemian chieftain (never a king) who inspired the carol. The question is, why should this songwriter's version of the story appeal so strongly to western imaginations? Consider: it was (as told) an obvious publicity stunt. A more thoughtful Wenceslas would have sent the food to all the neighbouring poor a day or two before the feast of Stephen. Or at least he might have taken a manservant rather than an ill-shod page-boy. And apart from this thoughtlessness, why did he not call the poor man into the palace kitchen when he first saw him, rather than waiting until he had carried his bundle a league or more back to his cottage by St Agnes' fountain? Suppose a modern version were told of Bill Clinton, Boris Yeltsin or even John Major. How ridiculous, the columnists would opine. The publicity people must be completely out to lunch. And a little boy in the snow, you say? Pass the Kleenex. It is 'obvious' that there are better ways to help the poor than by acting on a sudden sentimental impulse as Wenceslas did. So why do we so treasure this myth? And resent the attempt to debunk it? An intriguing answer is suggested by recent biological studies into the 'problem' of altruism. This old problem, simply stated, is: if we are descended by Darwinian selection only from those who succeeded in a ruthless struggle for survival, why does anyone give to the poor? The good king Wenceslas types would have been eliminated thousands of generations ago by the Joe Stalin and Adolf Hitler tendencies. A comparatively recent insight, explained by Richard Dawkins** nearly 20 years ago and superbly developed in a recent book by Matt Ridley***, is that Darwinian selection does not necessarily make people selfish - just the genes that they inherit and pass on. Even in the rawest Darwinian world, it is now clear that total wickedness does not pay. (Because, after the crooks have destroyed the naive altruists they rob each other.) Computer models show that the best survival strategy is 'do as you are done by': fight the crooks but be nice to the nice guys. Even so, as Christopher Badcock points out in a fascinating new book****, it will always 'pay' an individual (genetically speaking) to exploit his fellow man if he can get away with it. Naturally, the fellow man has reacted by evolving ways to avoid being exploited. One of these is the ability to see through con men. But con men retaliate by evolving ever more subtle ways of appearing plausible. The best exploiters, says Badcock, will have been programmed genetically to believe genuinely in their own goodness. Then they can pretend to be saintly without betraying themselves. But since human genes are all mixed, we are all now partly 'altruists' and partly 'exploiters' (genetically). So we all believe in good moral behaviour for all of us. This gives us the best chance to jump the queue. Unfortunately, this belief makes us vulnerable to really plausible rogues, fanatics, impenetrable con men and yes, just the kind of person who would take a small boy on a charity walk through deep snow on a stormy night. And if you think this is going too far, reflect that the real Vaclav Wenceslaus killed many of his neighbours in the conquest of other tribes. He was made a Christian saint after his murder in 929, but many whom he converted to the God of love had been made widows by his sword. *The Role and Limits of Government (Temple Smith, 1983) **The Selfish Gene (Oxford, 1976) ***The Red Queen (Penguin, 1994 Pounds 7.99). ****PsychoDarwinism (Harper Collins, 1994, Pounds 16.99).</p>

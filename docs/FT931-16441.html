			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Bundesbank monetary policy criticised GERMANY has lurched into recession partly because the Bundesbank has made wrong monetary policy decisions, the DIW institute in Berlin claimed yesterday. Unless the central bank cuts interest rates quickly, the economy will weaken further until well into this year and the Europe-wide slump will drag on into 1994, it warned. Continuing decline, underlined yesterday by news that west German industrial output in November was almost 6 per cent down on a year earlier, was unavoidable, said the institute, one of Germany's five leading economics centres. The causes lay in pay negotiators' reacting too late to early signs of a slowdown and wrong monetary policy decisions since mid-1992. Last year's wage deals led to a 5.4 per cent increase in west German unit labour costs, according to DIW. The Bundesbank, which controls German monetary policy, caused widespread dismay in July when it raised its discount rate from 8 per cent to 8.75 per cent. It responded to the European monetary crisis in September with a reduction to 8.25 per cent and a disappointing 0.25 percentage point cut to 9.5 per cent in the internationally sensitive Lombard rate. The institute's criticism came as Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the central bank, repeated that it would be wrong to change tack too soon to help resolve 'short-term' economic problems, either in Germany or elsewhere. Monetary policy had to continue its role as a brake on inflation, he said. 'That task has not yet ended,' he told a conference organised by the Norwegian Confederation of Business and Industry. He could not anticipate a decision to reduce interest rates but claimed that the central bank's 'ambitious' new money supply growth targets laid a foundation to allow Germany's economic weakness to be overcome. There has been growing domestic as well as international pressure on the Bundesbank to cut rates. German industry has been more openly critical of higher interest rates recently. Bonn has made no secret of its desire to see rates reduced although ministers and officials are anxious not to be seen to put any political pressure on the Bundesbank. Mr Schlesinger also told the Oslo meeting that early relaxation would not be good for European monetary integration. He said the D-Mark's role as an anchor of stability must be maintained. According to DIW, the Bundesbank must take the lead and allow other European central banks to cut rates. Even rapid and substantial reductions would not now produce benefits until the second half of this year. The institute said it expected gross domestic product in the west to fall 1 per cent this year. Average inflation would remain high at 4 per cent, double the Bundesbank's 'stability' target of 2 per cent. Meanwhile, new industrial production figures added to the gloom. Seasonally adjusted output from west German mining and manufacturing industries in November was 5.8 per cent down on the same month in 1991, the economics ministry reported. Total production was more than 1 per cent lower than in October. Bonds, Page 21 German stocks, Page 29</p>

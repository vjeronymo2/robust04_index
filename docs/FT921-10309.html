			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / International Company News: Berlitz acts to bolster its takeover defences BERLITZ, the language school subsidiary of Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC) that discovered a majority of its shares were pledged improperly to banks as collateral by the late Mr Robert Maxwell, yesterday adopted a 'poison pill' scheme designed to deter an unwanted change in the control of the company. The plan provides that for the next 18 months any acquisition of 20 per cent or more of Berlitz that is not approved by the board will trigger the ability of all other shareholders to buy additional stock at Dollars 1 a share. This would dilute the unwanted newcomer's share purchase. A subsidiary part of the plan would continue from 1993 to 1996. Mr Joe Rodgers, chairman of Berlitz, described the plan as meeting the 'special challenges currently facing this company'. At present, most of the 56.5 per cent Berlitz stake that is nominally owned by Macmillan is actually in the hands of five banks and companies that received the stock as collateral for loans to Mr Maxwell. Macmillan has brought injunctions to prevent the banks from selling the Berlitz stock. MCC itself is operating under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law, in a complex transatlantic arrangement that requires co-ordination between New York and UK court-appointed administrators. Mr Rodgers stressed that the poison pill was not directed toward any particular company that owned Berlitz stock or may wish to own it. 'Given our experience under Maxwell control, we are wary of the many risks that a change in control might impose,' he explained. Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE), the renamed Columbia Pictures studio in Hollywood, last night named Mr Mel Harris as the new president of its reorganised television division. The new arm will combine the studio's previously disparate television production and distribution businesses.</p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Sentry Farming interim losses grow Sentry Farming Group reported pre-tax losses up from Pounds 286,000 to Pounds 309,000 in its seasonally unfavourable first half to June 30. The company pointed out, however, that interim losses were not indicative of the full year result. Sentry said that indications from crops harvested were that yields were larger than anticipated and that average prices should be greater than expected, as a result of some forward sales earlier in the year, when prices were higher than at present. In addition, exchange gains relating to arable aid payments will result in payments being received in the second half, significantly in excess of those provided for in Sentry's 1993 business plans. Turnover of the USM-quoted company grew from Pounds 1.86m to Pounds 2.29m. Losses per share were 7.65p (7.14p).</p>

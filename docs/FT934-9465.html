			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Money Markets: German repo eyed GERMAN short-term interest rate futures firmed slightly as traders hoped for another small easing at the Bundesbank's allocation today of 14 and 28-day securities repurchase agreements at variable rates, writes Conner Middelmann. Most dealers expect the lowest accepted repo rate to edge down between two and four basis points. According to a survey of German money market dealers by MMS International, the market analysis service, the minimum rate on both tranches is expected to decline by two basis points, to 6.37 per cent on the two-week tranche and to 6.38 per cent on the four-week tranche. Two tranches of repos totalling DM81.5bn expire today and many dealers expect the Bundesbank to make a small net liquidity injection. The December three-month Euromark futures contract rose 0.02 point to 93.87 and the December contract was up 0.04 point to close at 94.58. Further slippage in German money market rates is expected to facilitate more near-term easing among some of the country's neighbours whose currencies have recently appreciated against the D-Mark, notably France, Belgium and the Netherlands. 'They are all waiting for the next German rate cut,' commented Ms Alison Cottrell, European economist at Midland Global Markets. With the Dutch guilder trading at 112.2020 against the D-Mark and after last week's better than expected October infla-tion numbers, 'the Dutch must go fairly soon', she said. The Bank of France may be a little more cautious given its continuing need to replenish its foreign currency reserves. The December PIBOR future on MATIF softened 0.01 point to 93.57. In the UK money market, the Bank of England announced an early shortage of some Pounds 1.7bn, later revised downwards to Pounds 1.65bn. It did not operate in the early round, but allocated some Pounds 1.294bn at the midday operation. In the afternoon the Bank purchased bills totalling Pounds 236m and provided late assistance of around Pounds 70m. The sterling overnight interbank rate was unchanged on the day at around 6 per cent. December short sterling futures finished unaltered on the day at 94.49, while the March contract edged forward 0.01 point to 94.69, both trading on moderate volume.</p>

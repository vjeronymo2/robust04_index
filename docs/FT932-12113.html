			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Baden-Wuerttemberg (7): Family factories are the economy's backbone - The central role of the 'Mittelstand' NESTLING in a wooded valley near Karlsruhe is the main production plant of Jung Gmbh, a family-owned manufacturer of metal components used primarily by the German car industry. The company, founded in 1880, is a classic example of the 'Mittelstand' business on which the economic success not just of Baden-Wurttemberg but also of western Germany as a whole is founded. Employing fewer than 300 people, the company has been through several revolutions in the 113 years of its existence, and is on the verge of yet another transformation amid a serious downturn in the car industry where its main customers are to be found. It started life as a manufacturer of champagne producing machines. In the 1920s it underwent its first major transformation and was turned into a manufacturer of thread-cutting calipers and wash presses. After the war it began producing parts - components used not only by the car industry but by the building machine, hydraulics, machine-tool, aircraft, power-plant and other industries. This - subject to technological modifications to bring the company up to 'world-class' standards in terms of computer-aided manufacturing and just-in-time deliveries - has been the mainstay of the business until the present day. Turnover last year was DM60m. Like much of German industry, Jung thrived on the boom induced by reunification of the country - and like many much larger companies it failed to see the signs of impending downturn. Confidently expecting turnover to climb to DM90m this year, Jung was planning to double its manufacturing capacity at its main site at Neuenbuburg. Sheer luck meant that the downturn last autumn arrived before it started to build the factory. The project was shelved and according to Ludwig Andra, head of information technology at the factory, turnover is likely to stay at DM60m again this year. The company stands on the verge of another major strategic change of direction. For some years 40 per cent of sales have gone to just one car manufacturer - and this manufacturer is pressing all its components suppliers for major cost reduction. In order to reduce its vulnerability to the cost squeeze, Jung has decided that in future it will specialise in the assembly of sophisticated products rather than the simple production of components. For example, it has moved beyond drilling and milling the case in which a gear box is housed to producing the entire gear box. At the same time, Jung has started to pay much more careful attention to its own costs - something that Andra concedes was never a priority during more prosperous times. Jung's experiences reflect a pattern repeated, in one way or another, at thousands of other companies across Baden-Wurttemberg. Although Baden-Wurttemberg is known as home to Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest industrial company, and many other large industrial groups, the backbone of the local economy is formed by small businesses. Nearly 60 per cent of all companies in the Land employ fewer than 200 people and 99.8 per cent employ fewer than 500. Small to medium-sized companies account for half the state's economic output. There are around 14,000 small manufacturing companies, and many of these, like Jung, are exposed to a double burden. They are suffering the brunt of a domestic and international recession at the same time as facing major structural change. Those industrial sectors which face the biggest problems - car component manufacturers, machine tools - are also those with the biggest concentration of Mittelstand companies. Economics suggest many smaller companies will be forced to abandon their cherished independence as the price of survival under present conditions. There have already been a large number of mergers and unprecedented cooperation agreements in, for example, the machine-tool sector suggesting that this process is already well underway. Dire prognostications of crisis in the Mittelstand ignore some of the advantages enjoyed by Germany's medium-sized businesses. While many of Germany's larger companies have lost touch with their entrepreneurial roots and acquired a bureaucratic culture, the Mittelstand is highly entrepreneurial and imaginative. Notwithstanding developments in the world economy over which managers have no control, the smaller companies have the flexibility to adapt to changed circumstances - as Jung is hoping to do with its move towards higher value-added components assembly. Another point is that many of Baden-Wurttemberg's smaller companies occupy unusual market niches which leave them relatively immune to the downturn in so many industrial sectors. The business owned by Hans-Peter Stihl and his family is a classic example of this. The Andreas Stihl group, based at Waiblingen near Stuttgart, is one of the world's leading manufacturers of chain- and other forms of motor-powered saws. The business, founded in 1926 and with nearly 5,500 employees worldwide, has a 30 per cent share of the world market in such saws. Turnover last year was DM1.2bn. Mr Stihl, who is head of the pan-German chamber of commerce (IHK), says that the biggest problem facing Mittelstand companies in Baden-Wurttemberg, as elsewhere in Germany, is the level of costs, particularly wage-costs. He voices the familiar complaint that wages climbed at a far higher rate than productivity in recent years. While Stihl's earnings are under pressure because of wage costs, the impact is mitigated because a considerable proportion of the group's manufacturing is done outside Germany. 'We had the foresight to set up manufacturing plant abroad as long ago as 1976,' says Stihl. Some 2,500 of the group's employees work outside Germany. Stihl's company has grown beyond the scope of the typical Schwabisch small family business. He is confident that the bulk of smaller Baden-Wurttemberg businesses 'are able to make the necessary adjustment' to present conditions, mainly by lopping costs. He believes that the Mittelstand will emerge on the other side of recession and structural change leaner and fitter than it was before.</p>

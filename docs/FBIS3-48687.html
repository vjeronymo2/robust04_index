			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Trade Frictions Intensify Despite </F> Negotiations; New Phase in Japanese-U.S. Relations"]    [Text] Just like the Japanese economy in 1994, where there  is no sign of a business recovery whatsoever, there are only  disheartening factors in Japanese-U.S. relations.    First, as for the trade imbalance, which is the basic cause  of the friction between Japan and the United States, it is  almost certain that Japan's 1993 trade surplus with the United  States will reach a high level. It also turned out that the  Japanese-U.S. comprehensive economic consultations [framework  talks] which are being held to correct this imbalance have so  far merely widened the gap between the two countries. For  example, while the most important point of these talks was  whether or not Japan will agree to set numerical targets as a  criterion in measuring the degree of the liberalization of its  market, it was finally agreed at the Japanese-U.S. summit held  in July that the vague expression "objective criterion" is to be  used.    Japanese industrial circles, however, are ready to totally  refuse to accept such targets. At the Japanese-U.S.  semiconductor talks, it was agreed, as an objective criterion,  that the "[U.S. semiconductors'] share of the Japanese market  should be 20 percent." However, this agreement was secretly  changed to be regarded as a formal agreement between Japan and  the United States. Because of this bitter past experience, the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] is also  expressing its intention of totally rejecting numerical targets.    In opposing this concept, [MITI] is even expressing its  rejection of the three major U.S. automobile makers' enumerating  their numerical targets as being to what extent they want to  participate in the Japanese market -- that is, how many dealers  they have in Japan, and how many cars with right-hand drive they  export to Japan, etc.    On the other hand, the United States, which insists that  Japan set numerical targets, is trying to appease Japan by  suggesting that a "failure to attain the numerical targets does  not mean that we will take retaliatory measures." However, the  Japanese side is not at all willing to accept this proposal.  The distrust between the two countries is creating the  deadlocked situation.    If the two countries continue to take an uncompromising  attitude, it is likely that the attitude of the Clinton  administration toward the Hosokawa government will also largely  change. Because of its expectations of the new government, the  Clinton administration has so far to a certain extent given the  Hosokawa government time to deal with the trade imbalance.  Therefore, the United States did not make particularly strong  requests to the Hosokawa government at the Japanese-U.S. summit  held at the end of September and at the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation conference held at the beginning of November.    However, if there is still no sign of compromise at the  Japanese- U.S. summit scheduled for 11 February, it is  inevitable that President Clinton's attitude will stiffen. In  the first place, the Congress will not put up with Japan's  attitude. Midterm elections are due to be held this year.  Because all 435 congressmen and one-third of the 100 senators  face elections, intense pressure will be put on the government  by congressmen and senators, who attach importance to the  interests of their respective constituencies. It is impossible  for President Clinton to disregard such pressure, for he earlier  received a big favor from the Congress in having NAFTA ratified.    The United States cannot expect economic growth unless it  increases its exports, and as for Japan, it is a "nation which  is dependent on exports." Under the circumstances, unless such  a structure is changed, it is inevitable that economic conflicts  will occur between the two countries. Although we do not hear  the "theory of the Japanese threat" mentioned anymore, possibly  because the United States is sympathetic to Japan because of its  prolonged recession, it is likely that Japanese-U.S. relations  will face a more serious phase henceforth.</p>

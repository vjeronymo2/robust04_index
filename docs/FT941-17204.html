			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / International Company News: Sharp rise at Swiss banking unit OZ Zurich Optionen und Futures, the quoted futures and options unit of the BZ banking group, has reported a sharp rise in 1993 profit, to some SFr80m (Dollars 54m) from SFr17.6m in 1992. However, it pointed out that SFr28m of the increase arose from the liquidation of provisions that would no longer be needed because it planned to establish a holding structure this year. OZ said shareholders' equity stood at SFr300 per share at the end of the year. The directors would propose repaying SFr30m or SFr50 per share of equity at the AGM on January 22. Banca del Gottardo, the Swiss bank in which Japan's Sumitomo Bank holds a 55 per cent controlling interest, has reported a 50 per cent jump in parent bank net income in 1993, to SFr63m. The directors said the downward movement of interest rates contributed to the 'very positive results,' as did opportunities in volatile financial markets. They have proposed raising the dividend from SFr20 per share and participation certificate to SFr25. Gottardo said its cash flow jumped 21 per cent to SFr151.9m.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Price rises muted despite signs of recovery RETAIL INFLATION excluding food fell to a 33-year low last month, government figures released yesterday show. The figures underline how upward pressures on prices have remained muted in spite of signs of recovery. The low inflation stemmed mainly from continued weakness in price pressures in a range of goods and services including fuel, estate agents' fees, alcoholic drink and televisions. Some items, such as clothing and shoes, second-hand cars and fares have registered relatively large price rises, however. In the year to last month the retail prices index excluding food rose by 1.1 per cent, after 1.3 per cent in the 12 months to April. It was the lowest figure since March 1960. The year-on-year increase in the RPI last month was 1.3 per cent, the same as in April which saw the lowest 12-month rate since February 1964. In May the index stood at 141.1, up 0.4 per cent on the 140.6 registered in April. Excluding mortgage payments, the RPI rose 2.8 per cent in the year to May, after a 2.9 per cent year-on-year rise in April. That was the lowest 12-month rise since the Central Statistical Office started records in 1975. The Treasury would like to keep the figure below 4 per cent. Upward pressure on the RPI remained low, in spite of an increase of 4.4 per cent in the price of seasonal food during the month. That jump - the biggest May increase since 1982 - was mainly because of large rises in the prices of items such as kiwi fruit, cauliflowers and apples. In the year to last month prices of personal goods and services, alcoholic beverages, and leisure services rose by 4.2 per cent, 4.7 per cent and 4.1 per cent respectively. In all cases the increases were the lowest 12-month changes since 1988. Housing costs fell 7 per cent in the 12 months to May, largely reflecting the 23 per cent fall in mortgage payments for the average homebuyer over the year. Charges for local taxation fell 9 per cent, mainly because of the replacement of the poll tax by the less costly council tax and the consequent increase in Treasury grants to local authorities. Prices of household goods rose in the year to last month by a low 1.6 per cent, reflecting weakness in demand for such items as furniture, furnishings, cookers and pet food. Inflation is thought likely to edge up in coming months, as the effects on housing costs of cuts in mortgage rates in the early part of last year drop out of the calculations.</p>

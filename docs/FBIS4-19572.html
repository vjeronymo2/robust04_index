			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis called upon the  European Union [EU] to set a date for the beginning of accession  negotiations with Cyprus. He said this decision is necessary  and may create new dynamics for a Cyprus solution.    Addressing the Cyprus-EU Association Council in Luxembourg  tonight, Mikhailidhis stressed the need for the balanced  expansion of the Twelve to the south with the accession of  selected Mediterranean countries such as Cyprus. The foreign  minister asked the EU to improve trade relations, particularly  regarding Cypriot agricultural products, by extending the  exports calendar and increasing the percentages. He also asked  for broad Cypriot participation in EU programs. Mikhailidhis  suggested tripartite cooperation programs between Cyprus, EU,  and the Middle East.    Referring to the issue of the EU providing financial support  for the occupied areas in an effort to balance development  throughout Cyprus, the foreign minister said this could only  happen after a Cyprus solution and with the consent of the  Cyprus Government and through it. He stressed that providing  financial aid before a solution is an act dangerously close to  being illegal and supportive of separation, and, therefore, it  is unacceptable.</p>

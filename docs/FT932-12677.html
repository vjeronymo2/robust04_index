			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Boeing underlines aviation downturn BOEING, the world's biggest aircraft manufacturer, yesterday underscored the recession in the global aerospace industry by reporting a 23 per cent drop in first-quarter returns. The company reported earnings of Dollars 325m, or 96 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 6.64bn, compared with earnings of Dollars 420m, or Dollars 1.23, on sales of Dollars 7.97bn in the same period of last year, excluding changes in accounting practice. The figures were broadly in line with analysts' expectations, which had centred on earnings of around Dollars 1 a share. The company said the drop was due mainly to lower sales of commercial aircraft and defence and space equipment. Boeing delivered 93 commercial aircraft during the first quarter, compared with 124 in the same period of 1992. Commercial aircraft sales dropped from Dollars 6.54bn to Dollars 5.50bn, while defence and space sales dipped from Dollars 1.29bn to Dollars 1.01bn. Mr Frank Shrontz, chairman, said second-quarter sales were expected to be somewhat higher than the first quarter, due mainly to the timing of commercial jet deliveries, but second-half sales would be lower than the first half, reflecting previously announced reductions in commercial production rates. For the full year, Boeing projected sales of some Dollars 26bn, down from Dollars 30.2bn last year. Boeing's annual meeting, also held yesterday, was told that the company was studying a third version of its 777 airliner, which is currently under development. The new version would allow a 20 per cent increase in capacity over the two versions announced so far. The company also confirmed it had invited aerospace groups Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas to participate in the possible development of a new super-jumbo jet, which it is studying with the four European partners in the Airbus Industrie consortium. Neither company had yet replied. Phillips Petroleum reported a first-quarter profit, compared with a loss a year ago, higher oil and natural gas prices, Reuter reports. Excluding special items, it had first-quarter earnings of Dollars 57m, compared with loss of Dollars 29m a year earlier.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 3 May (MENA)--Palestinian and Israeli  negotiators continue to meet for the third consecutive day in an  attempt to finalize an agreement on the implementation of  Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho.    The Legal Affairs Committee, the Security Committee, and the  Committee on Detainees are trying to work out some of the still  unsettled points ahead of the signing ceremony, which is  scheduled for tomorrow morning, Wednesday.    Lawyer Jamil al-Tarifi, who leads the Palestinian team to  the  Civilian Affairs Committee, said that the Israeli side  backtracked on several of the points previously agreed upon. He  added that the PLO and Israel will sign the agreement  nevertheless.    Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, who are both due in Cairo today, will  meet at 1800 at the Presidential Palace to discuss some  unresolved issues, particularly those concerning Jericho's area  and police presence on the Allenby Bridge.</p>

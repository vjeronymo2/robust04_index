			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (6): Lessons from the real Depression - Which assets for the nineties? / You could compare the ERM to the gold standard, though if we are forced out the inflationary consequences could be more severe than after 1931. However, investors today have an extra option: index-linked gilts ARE WE at a watershed for the investor? Every few decades the conventional wisdom about how personal portfolios should be disposed may need to be re-examined. The longer that the British economy remains obstinately sluggish, and inflation continues to subside, the more relevant could be the experience of savers long ago before the second world war. During the 1970s and the 1980s, it became the familiar pattern that sophisticated private investors put most of their money into houses and company shares (or more frequently, into equity-based institutional products, such as unit trusts, pension plans or endowment policies). This investment pattern was primarily a response to inflation, which averaged 13 per cent a year during the 1970s and remained a serious - although variable - threat during the 1980s. Almost throughout this period the pound sterling floated freely - whereas during the 1950s and 1960s it had been loosely linked to the dollar, and in 1990, of course, it became tied to the Deutsche Mark. The UK proved unable to maintain the value of sterling satisfactorily on its own, and investors came to understand this the hard way. Government fixed-interest securities (gilt-edged) turned out to be a swindle: if you invested Pounds 100 in gilts in 1965 in a supposedly safe investment, then, adjusting for the purchasing power of money, you would have lost nearly 90 per cent of your capital by 1980. Short-term deposits were not much better. Bank and building society rates were held down by cartels and restrictions. During the 1970s, building society depositors suffered negative returns every year, allowing for inflation. Even adding in interest, the annual real losses varied between 2 and 14 per cent. It was a much better idea to borrow than to save. Stock market investors also lost in real terms in the 1970s, but not so badly. Home owners did best at that time, especially if they had big, cheap mortgages. Further back in history, however, British investors needed to behave very differently. In 1925, the UK went on to the gold standard, in effect a kind of ultra-tough version of the European exchange rate mechanism. Although the government was forced off the gold standard in 1931 and it devalued by 25 per cent against the US dollar, that was the time of the slump and inflation remained quiescent. In fact, the cost of living fell by 2 per cent a year on average between the mid-1920s and the mid-1930s. Gilt-edged proved to be excellent investments over this period, and although the running yield gradually fell from 4 1/2 to about 3 per cent, the capital value rose correspondingly. Allowing for negative inflation, the total real return was about 10 per cent a year. Incidentally, I am relying for many of these figures on the excellent long-term Equity-Gilt Study from stockbrokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd, covering the period 1918-1991. What about shares? Going on to the gold standard had meant that UK equities failed to share in the late 1920s boom on Wall Street, but on the other hand there was no dramatic 1929 crash either. After the initial shock of the 1931 devaluation, which hit gilts but was worse for equities, the stock market staged a strong revival which lasted up to 1936. As for houses, this was a period of cheap houses and low-cost mortgages. People were more inclined to rent than to buy, and from the investment point of view houses were regarded as income-earning assets rather than as a source of capital appreciation. Do the 1920s and 1930s have any lessons for us today? You could draw parallels between the gold standard and the ERM. So long as we stay hitched to the Deutsche Mark, fixed-interest bonds may be attractive investments. But if we are forced out of the ERM, the inflationary consequences could be more severe than they were from 1931 onwards, because at that time many of our imports came from countries within the sterling area. Even within the ERM, negative inflation is scarcely likely. In the UK, since the war, there has been no year when retail prices have fallen, although in 1959 they were unchanged. But it is worth looking at the six-year period 1958-63. Inflation was only 2 per cent on average during those years, the kind of pattern we might expect within the ERM and, eventually, European monetary union. What happened to investments at that time? Well, gilts yielded 5 or 6 per cent, and gave modest real returns, while the stock market boomed, reflecting the strong economy of the 'you've never had it so good' era. But the strength of share prices may have reflected a once-and-for-all recovery from the distortions of wartime: from 1960 onwards, share prices stagnated for several years. Coming back up to date, we have recently been moving through a transition period. Essentially, the shares-and-houses boom had petered out by about 1988. Gilt-edged have begun to perform quite well. Even more remarkable has been the strong performance of building society savings accounts, which have given excellent returns since interest rates rose four years ago. The high short-term interest rates must be a transitional phenomenon, however. Since 1988, short-term rates have been higher than the long-term rates on gilts. In historical terms, this is an aberration. Savings accounts may not be an easy way out for investors for a great deal longer. Today's investors have one extra option: index-linked gilts. These are about 10 years old, and have performed rather badly so far, with their failings exaggerated by the very high returns available on other assets. But they could do well if there is a prolonged depression and real interest rates come down. They also give protection against high inflation, and could become more popular if sterling is taken out of the ERM. Whatever happens, it does not look as though the residential property market will provide good returns in the foreseeable future. Money will be kept relatively tight, and the tax breaks on mortgage borrowing are not nearly as attractive as they used to be. If the new government looks like sticking it out within the ERM, then fixed-interest gilts could be attractive, although not many British investors are comfortable about buying them. There is pre-war historical evidence to suggest that, in tough economic conditions, they can perform as well as company shares. But if sterling is floated again, investors will be wise to place their main reliance once again on the stock market. The way we were The FT 30-share index was not launched until 1935. However, the Institute of Actuaries index had been operating for seven years, and was the recognised yardstick of London equity prices. Here, it shows how the market fell after the crash of 1929, rose again soon after the UK government had come off the gold standard in 1931, and continued rise until the late 1930s brought the fear of war.</p>

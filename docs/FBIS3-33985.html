			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by the News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>   [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful.    The vigilant people know that the enemies of the Islamic  revolution have always been apprehensive about the Muslim  nation's presence on the scene, especially during the Ten Days  of Dawn, the symbol of the greatness and grandeur of Islam and  the people of Iran. At various times, they have sought to  neutralize or undermine this action.    The incident at the mausoleum of the imam, may God be  pleased  with him, proved that during the festivities to mark the victory  of the Islamic revolution, the powers of world arrogance and the  enemies of the Islamic revolution intend to stage incidents to  disrupt the popular activity.    What we witnessed yesterday affirms the vigilance and  alertness of the people, who, for the past 15 years, have  maintained an active presence on the scene of the defense of the  Islamic revolution and on the line of the late imam. The  people's slogans following the random shooting at the sacred  precincts of the [mausoleum of] the Islamic revolution's founder  indicate that the plots of the enemies of Islam and the Islamic  revolution are ineffective and constitute a declaration of  allegiance to the system of the Islamic Republic of Iran.    Everyone should know, at this critical time for the Islamic  revolution and the country's construction, when the enemies'  hopes are being turned into despondency, that only vigilance and  alertness and knowledgeable action can steer the Islamic  revolution toward its lofty goals.    Everyone should know that the powers of world arrogance fear  the Ten Days of Dawn and the celebration of the Day of God  [Yawm- Allah] on 11 February. The 11 February marches have  already perturbed the Islamic revolution's enemies. This year,  as in previous years, the people will again display their  unified presence at the 11 February marches and reaffirm their  unwavering determination to safeguard the revolution's gains--to  the chagrin of their enemies.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities recover from brief setback A SUCCESSFUL defensive session in the UK stock market yesterday saw share prices hold steady in the face of a substantial widening of the monthly trade deficit and another round of generally bearish trading announcements from leading British companies. Some encouragement was drawn from a maintained dividend payment from Midland Bank, but both ICI and Royal Insurance fell on their respective results and the market reacted negatively to the unexpected news that British Airways' hopes of a merger with KLM, of the Netherlands, have collapsed. The stock market was jolted at midsession by the announcement that the monthly current account deficit on UK trade had increased dramatically to Pounds 794m in January. But a steady performance by sterling and the UK bond market soothed any fears in equities that the widely expected base rate cut might be in jeopardy. The FT-SE Index closed 3.0 down at 2,562.0, having moved erratically between 2,572 and 2,555 during the session. Stock index futures played a less significant role in the underlying stock market than recently and market indices were often distorted by movements in the blue chip companies announcing results yesterday. Price movements in ICI, Royal Insurance and British Airways represented a fall of around 2.75 points on the Footsie index, but were partly balanced by the advance by Midland Bank, worth about 1.1. Seaq volume increased to 606.1m shares from the 548.6m of the previous session. The trading focus on ICI, Midland, BP, British Airways and other stocks favoured by the fund managers was believed to have inflated retail, or customer, business again yesterday; on Wednesday, retail business in equities totalled Pounds 972m, a relatively high level. The advance of 25 Dow points on Wall Street overnight had little effect on a London market now firmly geared to the prospect of a positive Budget speech by Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, a week on Tuesday, with a reduction of at least half a point off UK base rates closely linked to it. With the electoral prospects of the Conservative government still uncertain, share prices opened sluggishly before responding favourably to the news that Midland Bank had beaten market forecasts by reporting a small profit and a final dividend payment. However, a gain of seven points, taking the Footsie to the day's peak, was soon trimmed as investors reacted to a substantial loss at Royal Insurance and a discouraging trading statement from ICI as it disclosed the expected fall in annual profits. Although the retail and consumer-orientated sectors continued to display optimism for the expected reduction in UK base rates, the wider range of domestic equities lacked enthusiasm. Insurance stocks were depressed by Royal's trading figures, while among the pharmaceuticals, Glaxo lost further ground as Denmark brought the group's drug prices before the European Commission. However, with US buyers still sustaining the BP share price in late dealings, the blue chip international stocks held steady and the London market was left to await publication of the next poll of political opinion in the UK, which is expected at the weekend.</p>

These factors are derived by using the appropriate section 7520 interest rate and, if applicable, the mortality component for the valuation date of the interest that is being valued. See &sect;&sect;20.7520&hyph;1 through 20.7520&hyph;4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Specific Interests <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Charitable Remainder Trusts. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The fair market value of a remainder interest in a pooled income fund, as defined in &sect;1.642(c)&hyph;5 of this chapter, is its value determined under &sect;1.642(c)&hyph;6(e) of this chapter. The fair market value of a remainder interest in a charitable remainder annuity trust, as defined in &sect;1.664&hyph;2(a) of this chapter, is its present value determined under &sect;1.664&hyph;2(c) of this chapter. The fair market value of a remainder interest in a charitable remainder unitrust, as defined in &sect;1.664&hyph;3 of this chapter, is its present value determined under &sect;1.664&hyph;4(e) of this chapter. The fair market value of a life interest or term of years in a charitable remainder unitrust is the fair market value of the property as of the date of valuation less the fair market value of the remainder interest on that date determined under &sect;1.664&hyph;4(e) of this chapter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ordinary remainder and reversionary interests. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If the interest to be valued is to take effect after a definite number of years or after the death of one individual, the present value of the interest is computed by multiplying the value of the property by the appropriate remainder interest actuarial factor (that corresponds to the applicable section 7520 interest rate and remainder interest period) in Table B (for a term certain) or Table S (for one measuring life), as the case may be. Tables B and S are included in paragraph (d)(6) of this section and in Internal Revenue Service Publication 1457. For information about obtaining actuarial factors for other types of remainder interests, see paragraph (d)(4) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ordinary term-of-years and life interests. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If the interest to be valued is the right of a person to receive the income of certain property, or to use certain nonincome-producing property, for a term of years or for the life of one individual, the present value of the interest is computed by multiplying the value of the property by the appropriate term-of-years or life interest actuarial factor (that corresponds to the applicable section 7520 interest rate and term-of-years or life interest period). Internal Revenue Service Publication 1457 includes actuarial factors for an interest for a term of years in Table B and for the life of one individual in Table S. However, term-of-years and life interest actuarial factors are not included in Table B or Table S in &sect;20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6) of this chapter. If Internal Revenue Service Publication 1457 (or any other reliable source of term-of-years and life interest actuarial factors) is not conveniently available, an actuarial factor for the interest may be derived mathematically. This actuarial factor may be derived by subtracting the correlative remainder factor (that corresponds to the applicable section 7520 interest rate and the term of years or the life) in Table B (for a term of years) or in Table S (for the life of one individual) in &sect;20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6), as the case may be, from 1.000000. For information about obtaining actuarial factors for other types of term-of-years and life interests, see paragraph (d)(4) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Annuities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (A) If the interest to be valued is the right of a person to receive an annuity that is payable at the end of each year for a term of years or for the life of one individual, the present value of the interest is computed by multiplying the aggregate amount payable annually by the appropriate annuity actuarial factor (that corresponds to the applicable section 7520 interest rate and annuity period). Internal Revenue Publication 1457 includes actuarial factors in Table B (for an annuity payable for a term of years) and in Table S (for an annuity payable for the life of one individual). However, annuity actuarial factors are not included in Table B or Table S in paragraph (d)(6) of this section. If Internal Revenue Service Publication 1457 (or any other reliable source of annuity actuarial factors) is not conveniently available, a required annuity factor for a term of years or for one life may be mathematically derived. This annuity factor may be derived by subtracting the applicable remainder factor (that corresponds to the applicable section 7520 interest rate and annuity period) in Table B (in the case of a term-of-years annuity) or in Table S (in the case of a one-life annuity) in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, as the case may be, from 1.000000 and then dividing the result by the applicable section 7520 interest rate expressed as a decimal number.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) If the annuity is payable at the end of semiannual, quarterly, monthly, or weekly periods, the product obtained by multiplying the annuity factor by the aggregate amount payable annually is then multiplied by the applicable adjustment factor set forth in Table K for payments made at the end of the specified periods. The provisions of this paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(B) are illustrated by the following example: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  At the time of the decedent's death in January 1990, the annuitant, age 72, is entitled to receive an annuity of $15,000 a year for life payable in equal monthly installments at the end of each period. The section 7520 rate for January 1990 is 9.6 percent. Under Table S, the remainder factor at 9.6 percent for an individual aged 72 is .40138. By converting the remainder factor to an annuity factor, as described above, the annuity factor at 9.6 percent for an individual aged 72 is 6.2356 (1.00000 minus .40138, divided by .096). Under Table K, the adjustment factor under the column for payments made at the end of each monthly period at the rate of 9.6 percent is 1.0433. The aggregate annual amount, $15,000, is multiplied by the factor 6.2356 and the product multiplied by 1.0433. The present value of the annuity at the date of the decedent's death is, therefore, $97,584.02 ($15,000&times;6.2356&times;1.0433). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

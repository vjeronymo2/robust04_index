			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan ahead as hopes rise for new coalition Bourses featured a selection of stories yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN continued on its upward path as hopes rose for agreement on a new government and amid continued strong liquidity from Italian funds. The Comit index rose 10.25 to another 45 month high of 756.63, for a weekly rise of 2.9 per cent. Fiat, which gained market share and saw car sales rise in March, added another L198 to L6,235, for a two day rise of 7.7 per cent amid continued rumours it will sell its stake in Toro, the insurance subsidiary. Toro slipped L15 to L33,850. Assitalia, the insurance group, surged L3,729 or 22.3 per cent to L20,417 on speculation that Ina, the state owned parent company, will buy back shares ahead of its planned privatisation later in the year Ferruzzi slid L118 or 5.6 per cent to L1,961, in response to news that the board will will meet on Monday to decide on the amount for a fresh capital call. Cir, Mr Carlo de Benedetti's industrial holding company, fell L26 to L2,509 in response to results and news that the company is also launching a capital increase. Premafin, the main industrial holding of the industrialist Mr Salvatore Ligresti, rose L258 or 12 per cent to L2,400 after creditor banks reached a debt accord. The group, along with others in construction, has risen sharply in recent sessions on hopes a right-wing government will help the building sector. ZURICH finished ahead but off its best levels of the day amid divided opinions on the outlook. Some investors worry that the market is still vulnerable to a set back on Wall Street while others are concentrating on the prospects for lower domestic interest rates. The SMI index added 12.5 to 2,873, taking the advance over the week to 2.8 per cent. Banks and some cyclicals continued to propel the market higher. UBS bearers rose SFr20 to SFr1,258, while Alusuisse bearers added SFr22 to SFr658, taking their cumulative rise on the week to 6.3 per cent. Swissair overcame weakness seen earlier in the week after results, putting on SFr50 or 6.6 per cent to SFr800 on a round of profit-taking. PARIS dipped slightly in a generally quiet, pre-weekend session. The CAC-40 index lost 4.80 to 2,114.77, showing a week's gain of 1.6 per cent. Synthelabo, the pharmaceutical group, was one of the star performers, gaining FFr11.20 or 5.7 per cent to FFr207 in reaction to better than expected results, and a rash of analysts' buy notes. In contrast, Cap Gemini Sogeti fell 5 per cent, off FFr9.80 to FFr186.40, in reaction to Thursday's news that it planned a rights issue. AMSTERDAM continued to feature Royal Dutch, which rose for the third consecutive session helped by strong institutional support from the UK. The shares gained Fl 4.40 to Fl 200.80, bringing its rise on the week to 5.8 per cent. Analysts noted that both Shell and Royal Dutch have been helped by short covering following the bounce in the oil price over the Easter period, while there were reports yesterday that one broker had issued an upgrade. The AEX index added 2.67 to 415.59, to register a week's rise of 3 per cent.

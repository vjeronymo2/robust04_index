			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Commodities (Week in the markets): LME metals trim back early gains The base metals markets were yesterday approaching the Christmas holiday in a cautious mood, with most London Metal Exchange contracts surrendering some of their earlier gains. Among these was copper, which dropped Dollars 6 in the three months position to close at Dollars 1,797.25 a tonne. But that was still Dollars 50.50 up on balance, thanks the strong surge on Monday and Tuesday. Analysts were divided on whether the market's improved sentiment principally reflected short-term factors, such as a downturn in LME warehouse stocks, or a fundamental change in the perceived outlook. Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group thought that 'the overall fundamentals of this market still remain bearish' and forecast that the stocks decline would prove to be 'a temporary phenomenon', attributable to delayed shipments from the former Soviet Union and light Chinese offtake. But Mr Wiktor Bielski of Bain and Company, part of the Deutsche Bank group, insisted that 'the fundamentals in the copper market are getting better all the time', with US demand up 8 per cent so far in 1993 and stocks falling at both the New York Commodity Exchange and the LME. Stocks now represented only eight weeks' consumption, he noted, which was a low level coming out of a recession. Zinc was another market still showing gains on the week despite falling yesterday. The three months price climbed to Dollars 1,002.50 a tonne on Wednesday as it benefitted from the strength of copper, but fell Dollars 6 yesterday to close at Dollars 996.50 a tonne, still Dollars 9 to the good. Traders told the Reuter news agency yesterday that sentiment might have been dented by a forecast that Chinese zinc production could hit 900,000 tonnes next year as new smelters came into operation. Aluminium prices, which had surrendered some of their early gains in mid-week, moved higher again yesterday, a Dollars 4.25 rise taking the three months quotation to Dollars 1,121.50 a tonne. up Dollars Dollars 7 on the week. Among the precious metals, silver once again put in the steadiest performance, the cash price closing yesterday at Dollars 5.02 1/2 cents a troy ounce, up 4 cents on the week but 7 cents below Monday's peak. Monday had also seen the peaks for gold and platinum, Dollars 389.60 and Dollars 388.75 an ounce respectively. But both retreated and were showing net declines by yesterday's close. 'None of the precious metals look prepared to go higher now,' one trader told Reuter, 'but underlying support should hold while prices consolidate.' At the London Commodity Exchange the cocoa futures market resumed where it had left off last week, with the March position extending its Pounds 70 decline by another Pounds 62 to reach Pounds 904 a tonne at Monday's close. Mr Lawrence Eagles of London broker GNI blamed the fall on 'massive long liquidation of speculative positions' built up during the period of uncertainty about the health of Mr Felix Houphouet-Boigny, veteran president of the Ivory Coast, the world's buggest cocoa producer. The peaceful hand-over of power following the announcement of Mr Houphouet-Boigny's death two-and-a-half weeks ago left the market at the mercy of the bearish developments that had been ignored during that period - heavier-than-expected arrivals from West African harvests and signs that the Ivory Coast would not, after all, be delaying the marketing of its mid-crop cocoa. Support appeared, however, when the March price briefly dipped below Pounds 900 on Tuesday, and by yesterday's close it had recovered to Pounds 929 a tonne.</p>

The U.S. President's spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said on  Wednesday [23 February] that the former leader of the CIA  counterintelligence department targeting the Soviet Union,  Aldrich H. Ames and his wife evoked suspicions some ten months  ago and were closely watched by the Central Intelligence Agency  and the Federal Bureau of Investigations until the American  Administration took the case to court charging the two with  espionage.    The exact date of the arrival of the American delegation is  not yet known. It is likely that the CIA officials will wait  for Russian external intelligence service chief Yevgeniy  Primakov to return home from Prague.  It is not ruled out that in view of the ballyhoo in the United  States around the Ames affair, his former colleagues may ask for  a prompt assignment with the leaders of the Russian intelligence  service.    The press service of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow declined to  comment at ITAR-TASS request on the forthcoming visit of CIA  officials to Moscow.</p>

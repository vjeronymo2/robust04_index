			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOWELL RESIGNS AFTER 2 SEASONS AS FOOTHILL COACH  </P> <P> Jerry Howell has resigned as Foothill High School's football coach after 2  seasons.  </P> <P> Howell compiled a 9-12 record at Foothill, but led the Knights to the Division  III playoffs in 1988 with a third-place finish in the Century League. Foothill  lost in the first round, ending a 5-6 season.  </P> <P> Howell, 43, was hired in June of 1987 from Eastern Oregon State, where he had  failed to win a football game on the field in 3 years. Eastern Oregon State was  1-25-3 under Howell, the only victory a 2-0 forfeit by Southern Oregon in 1984.  </P> <P> Howell, who replaced highly successful Ted Mullen at Foothill, was 4-6 in his  first season, the Knights' first losing season since 1979.  </P> <P> "Jerry came from out of the area and arrived late, so from the start, hiring a  good staff was a problem," said Jim Ryan, Foothill principal. "He was under  some pressure, but any coach in Orange County is under pressure when his  program isn't successful."  </P> <P> Ryan said Howell also resigned his teaching position and the school will begin  taking applications for coaches with a teaching position available. Howell  could not be reached for comment. TOM HAMILTON  </P></p>

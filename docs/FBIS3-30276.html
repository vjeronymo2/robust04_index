On behalf of  the General Staff, the talks on the opening of the airport were  attended by Brigadier-General Enver Hadzihasanovic, deputy  commander and chief of the General Staff, and his associates,  Brigadier- General Mustafa Hajrulahovic-Talijan and Ramiz  Suvalic, deputy commander of the 2d Corps.    Mayor Selim Beslagic informed General Rose about the  difficult humanitarian situation in the Tuzla region, where some  800,000 people have been living under siege for 10 months. He  reiterated the demand that the international forces urgently  open Dubrave Airport, which would solve the problems connected  with the delivery of humanitarian aid not only to the free  territories, but also the territories under the aggressor's  temporary occupation. The examples of Bratunac, Bijeljina, and  Zvornik were given. The only thing to which we will not agree  is that the aggressor controls the airport, Mayor Beslagic said.    Brigadier-General Enver Hadzihasanovic reported on the  attempts by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army to enable the  international institutions to operate freely, and also stressed  the need for occasional meetings with the UNPROFOR chief of  staff for Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to solve possible disputed  issues at that level, too.    General Rose expressed his gratitude for the support he was  given, and informed his hosts about the orders he had issued to  his liaison officers. He said that he believed that their  successful work would be the grounds for the achievement of aims  ahead of the international forces.</p>

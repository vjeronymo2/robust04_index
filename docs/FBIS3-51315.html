			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Venezuelan President-elect Rafael Caldera by </F> an unidentified reporter at the Supreme Court of Justice in  Caracas; date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Caldera] I understand that the budget is something  that is quite important; nevertheless, it is not something that  has priority status. There are other issues that are above  financial considerations.    [Reporter] Do you then believe it is something related to  moral values?    [Caldera] Fundamentally, all of the problems we are  experiencing in the country originate from the moral crisis we  have been confronting.    [Reporter] With respect to the reforms needed within the  judicial branch, what are the initiatives you have proposed?    [Caldera] [words indistinct]    [Reporter] With respect to the reforms needed in the  judicial  branch, could you explain what your proposals will be?    [Caldera] Well, at this point in time it would be impossible  to explain all of the reforms that have been proposed. It would  be necessary to first start by reforming the Constitution. A  general constitutional reform entails several proposals which,  by the way, would include recommendations by Supreme Court Vice  President Alirio Abreu Burelli -- recommendations similar to  those made last year by Magistrate Josefina Calcano de Temeltas  in an address in which she proposed the creation of a  constitutional court.    In addition, there are numerous other opinions that include  reforming the Constitution, laws, and related administrative  orders. These proposals are currently being received favorably  because of something that is quite true, and that is this: All  Venezuelans are convinced that we are facing a very difficult  situation. The next administration and government will face a  very complicated situation, but it is necessary for us to begin  now, because the moment is fundamental if we expect to reach the  21st century under the best conditions for democracy.    [Reporter] In terms of the value-added tax [VAT], at this  time there are eight annulment appeals that...    [Caldera, interrupting] There you go, dragging me into the  VAT again!    [Reporter] Of course, this the issue the people are most  interested in.    [Caldera] That is alright; it really does not matter. My  position with respect to the VAT is quite clear. Now, I would  not like to venture and express a judicial opinion at this time  and place. Of course, out of respect for the Supreme Court of  Justice, I am forced as a private citizen to...    [Reporter, interrupting] Mr. President, right now there are  eight annulment appeals to repeal this bill. What can you say  about this?    [Caldera] I can only say that this issue must be decided as  quickly as the previous appeals were resolved.    [Reporter] What are your final proposals?    [Caldera] I am committed to struggling to eliminate the VAT  in a way that will also reform the tax system, establish a tax  on those groups that are living in better conditions and can  afford to pay, and not increase the tax burden on the less  privileged sectors.    [Reporter] Anyway, in your opinion, what actions should  be...    [Caldera, interrupting] That is enough for now.</p>

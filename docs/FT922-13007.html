			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / UK Company News: Frost at Pounds 2.5m after relisting Frost Group, which through its Save and Look service stations is one of Britain's largest independent petrol retailers, yesterday released its first results since relisting last October. The company announced 1991 pre-tax profits down from Pounds 4.75m to Pounds 2.5m on turnover of Pounds 82.8m (Pounds 101.5m). However, Frost said the two periods were not comparable because of the company's previous status as a subsidiary of Norfolk House, the property group which went into receivership in March last year after buying Frost in 1990. Earnings fell to 13.4p (24.2p) and the dividend is 2p (nil).</p>

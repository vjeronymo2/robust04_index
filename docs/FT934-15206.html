			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / People: NatWest bank appoints third deputy chairman National Westminster has restored to full strength its roster of three non-executive deputy chairmen following the retirement of Tom Frost. The bank has appointed Sir Sydney Lipworth QC, below, the former chairman of the monopolies and mergers commission, and one of the founders of Allied Dunbar in 1970. NatWest's board has been slimmed down from over 30 members by its chairman Lord Alexander since his own appointment in 1989. It now consists of 13 non-executives and seven executives. Lord Alexander said yesterday that Sir Sydney would bring 'an invaluable perspective' as a practitioner and regulator. Sir Sydney, 62, joins two other knights, Edwin Nixon, the chairman of Amersham International, and Michael Angus, president of the Confederation of British Industry, as deputy chairmen of NatWest. He is joining the board immediately following Tom Frost's retirement last month. Like Lord Alexander, Sir Sydney is a barrister, whose legal training and experience encouraged a no-nonsense approach at the Mergers and Monopolies Commission, which he chaired between 1988 and April this year. Besides being one of Allied Dunbar's founders, he was also its joint managing director from 1980 to 1984, having previously helped form Liberty Life in South Africa.</p>

			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Spain expects exports to lead recovery The Spanish government is increasingly confident that the economy will grow this year following last year's decline, according to Mr Pedro Solbes, economy and finance minister. The current account could break even for the first time since 1986, when Spain joined the European Community. Last year it showed a deficit of Pta632bn (Pounds 3.1bn). Mr Solbes expects the export-led recovery to be 'closer to 1.5 per cent than 1 per cent'. His forecast is higher than most private projections, although there is consensus among analysts that Spain will show positive growth. The 1993 recession was Spain's worst economic performance in 30 years. Sluggish private consumption and limited investment growth would be offset by a sharp rise in exports and tourist receipts, Mr Solbes said. Both exports and imports were increasing faster than the government expected. Unemployment, the highest in Europe at almost 24 per cent according to the last quarterly survey, should begin to fall in the second half of the year, with a sharp reduction in 1995 and 1996, he said. Inflation, now running at an annual rate of 5 per cent, should also fall in the second half. The government has a 3.5 per cent target for the year. Mr Solbes, a political independent in the Socialist government, emphasised the need to cut public spending, which, including regional government expenditure, accounted for more than 7 per cent of GDP last year. Spain was running out of leeway to increase tax revenues and needed to go further with budget control, he said. This had to include reducing subsidies to loss-making state companies. He admitted that privatisation in Spain had been 'slow and limited' but added that there were few companies that could easily be privatised. It would be unrealistic to expect state steel, coal or shipbuilding companies to be denationalised. It would be difficult for Spain to bring its public deficit down to 3 per cent of GDP by 1997, the EU convergence target for the third phase of economic and monetary union. Spain hoped to review its convergence programme with the EU in July. Reflecting growing government anxiety over the controversy surrounding Mr Mariano Rubio, the former Bank of Spain governor, Mr Solbes said it would be 'enormously negative from all points of view' if allegations of tax evasion by Mr Rubio were proved true.</p>

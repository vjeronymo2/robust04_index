			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Major drops visa requirement for Polish tourists to Britain MR JOHN MAJOR announced the abolition of UK visa requirements for Polish tourists yesterday and increased Britain's financial aid to Warsaw. The gesture was designed to underline his commitment to Poland's eventual membership of the European Community. After talks with Polish government leaders in Warsaw, Mr Major said he would use Britain's presidency of the EC in the second half of this year to commit the 12 to allowing Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary to join the Community. Mr Major said membership of the EC was not practical in the short term. Poland is locked in twin political and economic crises, heightened last night when President Lech Walesa declared that he had 'lost trust in the present government'. All three countries are still suffering from the painful transition to market-based economies. Mr Major, however, emphasised his determination that the Community should not remain a 'rich man's club', suggesting that the EC should set the turn of the century as a firm target for their inclusion. His announcement, after talks with Mr Walesa and Mr Jan Olszewski, the Polish prime minister, that Britain will abolish visa requirements for Polish visitors to the UK ended a long-running dispute between the two governments. In the past, Britain has argued that, because of the large Polish communities in the UK, many visitors have stayed on as illegal workers. Some 200,000 Poles are resident in the UK. Many have relatives in Poland who want to visit. Complaints have centred on long delays in granting visas, excessive bureaucracy, the number of people rejected and the charge for visas, which at about Pounds 20 can be more than a week's wage in Poland. Last year, 47,350 Poles applied for UK visas, and 5 per cent were turned down. The announcement was welcomed by Polish community organisations in the UK. Mr Mieczyslaw Hampel, administrator of the Polish Social and Cultural Association in London, said: 'In general we are very pleased'. Mr Antoni Zniderycz, secretary of a branch of the Polish Ex-Combatants Association, said: 'Our main argument was that we who stayed by the side of England for many years during the war were the first to deserve that kindness from the British government.' Mr Hampel expressed some worries that young people might exploit the relaxation to work illegally, but other leaders played this down. 'If anything it would be a short-term problem, not a long-term problem. Everybody knows there is unemployment in this country,' said Mr Alojzy Gajdzik, chairman of the Polish Parish in south-east London. Mr Major flew to Prague last night on the second leg of his four-day tour of central Europe. At a joint press conference earlier with Mr Olszewski, he indicated that he intended to press for a much stronger political dialogue between Poland, Hungary and Czechslovakia and the EC. Foreign ministers from the three countries will be invited to a meeting of the EC council and the three heads of government will attend joint talks in London during the British presidency. Mr Major said the UK would increase financial aid for Poland by Dollars 14m. The money will finance small business development.</p>

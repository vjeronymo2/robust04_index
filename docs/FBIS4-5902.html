			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 15 (YONHAP) -- A regular, direct sea  route between South and North Korea will open on April 18,  business sources said Friday.    Sunho shipping company, a joint venture between South  Korea's  Samsun Shipping Corp. and China's Xianhu business group, has  chartered a 4,200-ton containership from St. Vincent and the  Grenadines and will send it from Pusan to the North Korean port  of Chongjin on Monday.    The ship will carry 1,400 tons of construction equipment,  which is to be transported again by truck from Chongjin to China.    The Pusan-Chongjin-Yanji route will shorten the time needed  to transport goods to seven days, compared to the previous 40-45  days on the Pusan-Dalian-Yanji route.    Sunho plans to operate ships on the route once a month on a  regular basis, Samsun officials said.    The inter-Korean sea route became available after the Xianhu  group contracted with the North Korean Government to jointly  develop Chongjin port last June. Under the contract, the  Chinese group has the right to use the port for 50 years.    Samsun opened a sea route from Inchon through a Chinese port  to the North Korean port of Nampo early last year and is  operating freighters on the route twice a month.    A Samsun official said, "if inter-Korean relations improve,  goods transported through this direct inter-Korean sea route  will also increase."    Samsun carried 5,000 tons of rice from Mokpo to the North  Korean port of Najin in July 1991 -- a first for a Korean  shipping company.</p>

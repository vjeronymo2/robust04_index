			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Fall at Aga fails to mar full-year outlook Aga, the Swedish industrial gas group, is sticking to a forecast of higher profits this year, in spite of a slight weakening in its first-quarter performance. Income after financial items eased to SKr401m (Dollars 52.7m) from SKr415m. Operating income was also lower at SKr366m, compared with SKr392m, although sales rose 4 per cent to SKr3.87bn. The group recently announced plans to spin off Frigoscandia, the world's leading cold storage chain, and obtain a separate listing for the company. The move is in line with its long-term strategy of concentrating on industrial and medical gases. Pro-forma figures showed that gas operations achieved a SKr404m profit in the first three months, on sales of SKr2.96bn. In the same period of 1993, profit was SKr416m on sales of SKr2.73bn. Most of the group's gas operations recorded higher operating income. This was attributed to improving economic conditions in the US and Nordic region. The European continent remained weak, however. Frigoscandia had a slightly higher loss, of SKr3m compared with SKr1m, in what is always a weak period. The company's sales dropped 6 per cent to SKr924m.</p>

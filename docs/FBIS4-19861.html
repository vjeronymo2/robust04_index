			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Josef Joffe: "Death and Silence"] </F>   [Text] Cynical reason is asking: Why does Gorazde not  surrender? After all, the white flag might at least put an end  to the slaughtering and the further escalation of the  inconceivable. Sometimes capitulation really is the last resort.  But the wild attack on Gorazde by the Serbs cannot be compared  with a "normal" war, and this shows the barbarism to which  "civilized" Europe is in danger of falling victim.    In the 18th century, there was a well-contrived war code  that  said: After so many hits, the commander of the fortress or city  may honorably surrender, whereupon the conquerors march into the  city with proper respect. Even in World War II, the "most  total" of all wars, the right of capitulation was more or less  respected -- see Rome or Paris. But Gorazde? Not capitulation  that is followed by mercy, but destruction and expulsion are at  issue.    No other signal is given by the offensive, which will have  soon lasted for three weeks and which does not even refrain from  well-aimed shots at hospitals. The conquest of a strategic point  is not at issue; the city is to be emptied as much as possible  by murders and escape so it will become "Muslim-free." The  people know this and that is why they are fighting so  desperately for every meter. Capitulation does not promise mercy  to them, but terror and death.    What follows from it for the rest of the world? The  so-called world community must understand that civilians are not  murdered here by chance, but "purposefully." It must understand  that unrestrained meanness in the form of Serbian tanks has  driven the moral duty to the foreground of all considerations,  no matter how weighty the strategic and political arguments  against intervention are. For: He who does not prevent murder,  although he could do so at justifiable risks, becomes guilty.    And yet the "world community" seems to watch the horror as  if  in a trance. The latest Security Council resolution -- the  Serbian gentlemen should withdraw from Gorazde -- must have made  them laugh. For weeks NATO has been silent. And the Americans,  who are playing the key role now as ever, are indulging in hints  like in oracles, which everybody may interpret to his liking.  Of course, the Germans must be the last to mock at that. For  in 1991, they pursued the recognition of Croatia and Slovenia by  using their elbows, while being comfortably aware that they --  protected by the self-imposed constitutional tie -- would not  have to bear any responsibility.    Since yesterday, Clinton's zigzag course has been pointing  again to the preparedness to use force: NATO is to threaten  with bombs in order to force the Serbs to withdraw heavy  weaponry from the surroundings of the six protection zones. Can  this intimidate the Serbs once more after their unhindered march  to Gorazde? Sam Nunn, a powerful figure in the U.S. Senate, is  right: "Pinpricks will not work any longer. We have to be  prepared for escalation" -- if necessary, to Serbia.    That is the way it is; this is the price of the disgraceful  silence for three weeks. Those who shrink from the necessary in  time will finally only have the alternative between even more  violence and the white flag. The Serbs' call for subjugation is  also aimed at the West.</p>

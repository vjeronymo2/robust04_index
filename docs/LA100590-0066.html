			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HOLIDAY GIFT OF PARKING NEAR MALL TO CEASE  </P> <P> You'd better not cry, you'd better not pout and you'd better not park on the  residential streets around the South Bay Galleria during the Christmas shopping  season this year, or Santa will be putting a naughty surprise on your  windshield.  </P> <P> Hoping to head off a seasonal parking crunch in the neighborhoods around the  popular Redondo Beach shopping mall, the City Council this week created a  temporary permit-parking zone on Kingsdale, Firmona and Condon avenues that  would prohibit non-resident parking from Nov. 15 until Dec. 31.  </P> <P> Affected are the 1800 and 1900 blocks of Kingsdale and Firmona avenues and the  1900 block of Condon Avenue between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. Commercial areas of the  blocks would be exempt from the restriction and will be posted.  </P> <P> Doug Anderson, who owns a home in the area, told the council that temporary  restrictions were much-needed in his neighborhood.  </P> <P> "The parking there is already a problem," he said, and becomes much worse  during the shopping season.  </P> <P> "It's not only the shoppers," Councilman Terry Ward said. "The employees also  were coming into the area and parking on the residential streets."  </P> <P> Last year, the neighborhood petitioned the city for the district, complaining  that they could not get into their driveways because the streets were so  crammed with overflow Galleria parking.

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Stockholm - Other markets Equities face a volatile week, but whether they move up or down will depend on the outcome of yesterday's referendum on EU membership and nine-month figures from several big companies, writes Christopher Brown-Humes. Two of the industrial heavyweights, Volvo and Ericsson, present their figures tomorrow and on Thursday respectively. In Ericsson's case, expectations are running high due to the spectacular growth in sales of the group's cellular products and a strong set of eight-month figures from its Finnish rival, Nokia. Goldman Sachs in London is expecting nine-month profits of SKr3.5bn, up from SKr1.86bn a year ago, and full-year profits of SKr5.5bn. AssiDoman and SCA, two of the leading forestry groups, will also announce figures. With the pulp and paper sector in a clear uptrend, they are expected to be strong. SCA, which reports on Friday, is expected to disclose a profit of around SKr1.6bn. The main interest will be in how its Molnlycke hygiene unit is weathering increasing competition in the nappies (diapers) market. Analysts say that whatever the outcome of the referendum, concern about the state of Sweden's finances will continue to affect equities via the bond market. Another cloud on the horizon for the export-orientated multinationals is the strengthening krona, which could harm next year's earnings significantly if the trend continues.</p>

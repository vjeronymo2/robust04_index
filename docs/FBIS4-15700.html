			<p>BFN     [Text] An extended meeting of the Kyrgyz Government took  place in Bishkek yesterday. It was chaired by Prime Minister  Dzhumagulov, and was attended by leaders of ministries,  departments, and enterprises. The meeting discussed how to  raise industry out of crisis.    The situation is very serious. In March, 65 enterprises  ground to a halt. The production capacities of the remaining  ones are half used. Warehouses have a surplus of goods in  stock. Light industry alone is overstocked with goods to the  value of 63.6 million soms and the level of indebtedness exceeds  700 million soms.    A resolution was adopted on this issue and steps have been  specified aimed at lifting the country's industry out of crisis.</p>

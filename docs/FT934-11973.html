			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Survey of Locating in North America (1): Beat of the heartlands - For those European and Japanese companies which want to establish a global presence, North America still beckons. The lion's share of recent investment has gone to the south-eastern US and the Rocky Mountain region First: BMW. Now: Mercedes-Benz. Over the past 15 months each of these luxury car manufacturers has decided to locate its first manufacturing plant outside Germany in the US - underscoring the continued importance of North America as a centre for European and Japanese companies aspiring to a global presence. From April, when Mercedes announced its intention to come to North America, states across the US have become involved in a six-month tug of war to get the company to choose them as the site of its plant. In September, Alabama emerged as the surprise winner of the contest - a choice which says much about the factors that companies weigh up when deciding precisely where in North America they need to locate. Alabama is in the south-eastern US, as are five of the six states which appeared on Mercedes' shortlist. This region has attracted particularly strong European investment - especially from Germany. So strong is the German presence in North and South Carolina that parts of the main highway through the region, Interstate 85, have been dubbed the 'autobahn'. BMW, for its part, decided last year to site its US plant in South Carolina  -one of the states on the Mercedes shortlist. European and American companies like the region because it has low labour costs compared with the traditional manufacturing 'rustbelt' states of the north; a strong tradition of hostility to unions; a low cost of living; easy access to ports for the export market; a large labour pool and good universities; and state governments willing to lure companies with huge incentives for site purchase and worker training. Alabama's package for Mercedes is valued at over Dollars 250m. However, the south-east is far from being the only US region profiting from corporate location decisions. For example, the Rocky Mountain region has become the fastest-growing area of America, apparently attracting jobs and people from California, which is suffering from a severe recession, a deteriorating quality of life and heavy state regulation of industry. Mr David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services, points out that, in terms of growth, 'many states in the heartland of America are now performing significantly better than they did during the early 1980s, while states in the north-east as well as California are underperforming'. Foreign direct investment in the US grew remarkably in the 1980s. This was partly through the start-up of greenfield plants, notably from Japanese car manufacturers, but much more so through the takeover of existing US companies. Direct foreign investment grew from Dollars 83bn in 1980 to Dollars 403.7bn in 1990. Since then, however, foreign spending on acquiring or establishing US businesses has fallen sharply. In 1992 it totalled Dollars 13.5bn, down 47 per cent on the previous year and the fourth consecutive year of decline. It was the lowest total since the Dollars 8.09bn recorded in 1983. When disinvestment by foreign companies is added in, foreigners took out Dollars 3.9bn of direct investment more than they put into the US in 1992 - the first such outflow in decades. Several factors appear to lie behind this. First, global recession restrained investors' ability to pump capital into new foreign ventures around the world - not just in the US. The Commerce Department also speculates that investment funds may have been diverted from the US by increased economic integration in the European Community and the new business opportunities opening up in eastern Europe. Other factors may have been rapid economic growth in parts of south-east Asia and an improved investment climate in parts of Latin America. And while the US seems this year to be once more in the throes of a takeover boom, after four years of quiet, foreign companies are not yet particularly prominent in this wave. That is because many of the new bids involve industries which are either distinctly domestic in nature, such as health care or regional banking, or have limits on foreign participation. US regulations limit foreign companies to owning 20 per cent of most large companies in telecommunications - a sector at the start of a dramatic wave of consolidation. However, foreign investment may also have been discouraged by a feeling that the US has become less welcoming in recent years. For example, considerable anti-foreign sentiment was stirred up during the takeover wave of the 1980s, when jingoistic Americans complained that Japanese and European companies were acquiring some of the nation's 'crown jewels'. The edginess has been compounded by the ambiguous attitude towards foreign investment of the Clinton administration. Mr Ian Martin, a leading executive at the British food and drinks group Grand Metropolitan, called last summer for a 'official US assurance that all members of the business community, foreign and domestic, will have access to the so-called level playing field  -that they can count on even-handed enforcement of laws pertaining to basic business operation, investment and taxation'. The foreign community has been particularly concerned by Mr Clinton's approach to the long-running unitary taxation court case which pits Britain's Barclays Bank against the state of California. This involves California's policy of taxing subsidiaries of foreign-based multinationals on a proportion of the worldwide income of the parent company and affiliates. For years, the federal government said California's unusual approach was unconstitutional and inconsistent with federal tax policy, but during last year's presidential election campaign Mr Clinton pledged to take the state's side. Last month, California made it far easier for him to do that, without abandoning the government's long-held position, when it passed a law which addressed most of the foreign companies' complaints. Nevertheless, Mr Clinton has now raised hackles by urging the Supreme Court to deny an appeal from Barclays that challenges the original judgment made against it by a California court. The White House argues that the recent change in Californian law makes a hearing unnecessary. However, as much as Dollars 900m in back taxes and interest is at stake for California in this case and similar ones filed by other foreign companies. Mr Clinton also provoked foreign corporate concern during the election campaign with proposals to raise Dollars 45bn from multinationals in additional taxes. Still, tax experts reckon that the budget package finally approved by Congress in August means the total will be only Dollars 800m, about half of which will come from stricter enforcement of transfer pricing rules and half from tightening of rules covering so-called 'earnings stripping', limiting tax deductions for interest payments to a foreign party. Despite these niggles, the US market is likely to re-emerge as extremely attractive for foreign investment in the second half of this decade as the global economy recovers. Mercedes and BMW, for example, could have sited their plants anywhere in the world. They chose the US for its combination of reasonable labour costs (some 30 per cent below Germany), skilled labour force, and the largest and most competitive vehicle market in the globe. The potential will be even larger if the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement, setting up a free trade area between the US, Canada and Mexico, comes into being, creating a market of some 365m consumers. However, the Nafta accord is in serious difficulties in the US Congress, which will vote on the issue shortly, and is under fire from the influential Mr Ross Perot, the Texan who stood last year as an independent presidential candidate and warns of a 'giant sucking sound' of American jobs heading for Mexico.</p>

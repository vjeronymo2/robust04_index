He pointed out: Developing, on a large scale, circulation,  commerce and trade, and market is of extremely important  significance to Tianjin's development. Without a perfect market  system or the achievements in expanding and enlivening business,  it will be difficult for Tianjin to build itself into a  commercial, trade, and monetary center of north China.    The commercial department undertakes an important task for  cultivating and developing the market system. We earnestly hope  that in the course of setting up the market system, the  commercial department will firmly grasp its work, accelerate the  pace of development, make greater achievements, and make new  contributions. We should make a unified plan, use the existing  [words indistinct], and ceaselessly accelerate the [words  indistinct] of cultivating markets. In line with the realities  of Tianjin, which stands as a north China commercial, trade, and  monetary center and a municipality, we should form a major  climate for Tianjin's market. It is necessary to make a big  breakthrough in market's trade volume. To achieve this, we  should make a big breakthrough in working out measures for  promoting the market's trade volume.    Gao Dezhan stressed again: Accelerating the setup of market  is a major task. Therefore, all fronts should closely make  concerted efforts and actively and enthusiastically do their  jobs well. All departments in charge and all departments in  charge of the overall work should positively create conditions.  The construction departments should regard the setup of market  as a key construction project.</p>

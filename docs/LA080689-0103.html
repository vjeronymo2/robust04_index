			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD TRAVEL WATCH: VISITS TO PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA DISCOURAGED  </P> <P> World Travel Watch is a monthly report designed to help you make informed  judgments about travel throughout the world. Because conditions can change  overnight, always make your own inquiries before you leave home. In the United  States contact the nearest passport agency office; abroad, check in with the  nearest American embassy.  </P> <P> Asia  </P> <P>  -- China: Due to continuing unstable security conditions, travel here is not  advised.  </P> <P>  -- India: Kashmir's fabled Dal Lake, which for centuries has drawn Mogul  princes, British colonialists and vacationers, is showing bad signs of  environmental degradation. The lake has shrunk from 14 square miles to nine,  weeds grow thick on the bottom and millions of gallons of raw sewage flow into  the lake every day. New sewer systems need to be built, but state and national  governments have been unable to provide the money for the sewers.  </P> <P>  -- Nepal: New visa regulations have become stabilized. People entering Nepal  with a visa obtained before arrival can stay for one month, and can get two  one-month extensions. To obtain an extension, travelers must show proof that  they have spent at least $10 a day for every day requested in the extension.  </P> <P> After spending three months in Nepal, foreigners must leave the country for a  minimum of one month before returning. Upon returning they will be able to  remain in the country for only one more month, and then will be barred from  returning for a year. Fifteen-day visas are available upon entry at a cost of  $10. Travelers must prove they've spent at least $150.  </P> <P> Foreigners who wish to leave the country during their initial three-month stay  can make arrangements with the immigration office to allow re-entry even if the  trip is for less than a month.  </P> <P>  -- Sri Lanka: The government recently granted powers to the police and  military to detain suspected leftist rebels in an attempt to quell the  Sinhalese two-year-old drive to overthrow the government. Peace talks with the  Tamil Tigers in the north and east and negotiations to send the Indian  peacekeeping army home continue. Conditions remain unstable although most main  tourist sites are relatively safe. Exercise caution, however.  </P> <P>  -- Tibet: Although Tibet was recently reopened to foreigners, Western Tibet  and the sacred Mt. Kailash region remain off-limits. However, Eastern Tibet, a  rugged region of big rivers, forested mountains and log houses in a Swiss  chalet style, has been opened to tourism.  </P> <P> Africa  </P> <P>  -- Ghana: Ghana has strict laws governing currency exchange and the sale,  purchase or possession of gold, diamonds and other natural resources. Currency  transactions should take place at registered banks and foreign exchange  bureaus. All natural-resource transactions are handled through official  organizations; dealing in these commodities with individuals is illegal.  </P> <P> Wearing clothing that appears military in nature, such as camouflage jackets,  is strictly prohibited. Authorities are slow to notify foreign embassies when  detaining foreigners; jail conditions are harsh and the legal process can be  lengthy. There is no bond posting. If you get into trouble, make every effort  to contact the American Embassy. Assume your message has not been delivered if  a consular officer doesn't contact you within 36 hours.  </P> <P>  -- Mozambique: Travel remains dangerous due to continuing insurgency.  Guerrillas are active in all of the country's provinces, and have stepped up  their attacks even as the government makes efforts through the Mozambican  Christian Church to find a way to peace. Food shortages exist in rural areas  and many district capitals. Street crime and car thefts in urban areas have  increased dramatically in the last year. Avoid unnecessary travel, and exercise  caution. Register with the U.S. Embassy on arrival.  </P> <P>  -- Sao Tome and Principe: A serious cholera outbreak is occurring. Travelers  without valid vaccinations will be refused entry.  </P> <P>  -- Somalia: A dusk-to-dawn curfew was imposed recently in Mogadishu in  response to religious disturbances in which protesters and police were killed.  Defer non-essential travel at this time.  </P> <P> Mediterranean/Middle East  </P> <P>  -- Turkey: Exercise caution in Turkey's southeastern provinces, where sporadic  separatist attacks against Turkish military, police and civilians continue to  occur. Avoid travel off main highways in remote regions, and if possible, don't  drive at night. Be sure to obtain a receipt and an official museum export  certificate if buying antiquities or cultural artifacts. Unauthorized export is  strictly prohibited and punishable by imprisonment.  </P> <P> Europe/Soviet Union  </P> <P>  -- Soviet Union: Ethnic disturbances continue in many areas of this vast  country, most recently in the Abkhazi region of Georgia, causing officials to  declare a state of emergency and a dusk-to-dawn curfew. The troubles disrupted  transport and communications in and around the Black Sea resort of Sukhumi.  Unrest is likely to continue. Exercise caution.  </P> <P> Southeast Asia  </P> <P>  -- Union of Myanmar (Burma): The government has moved in recent weeks to  repress opposition rallies, pouring thousands of troops into the capital and  placing opposition leaders under house arrest, making the free elections  promised by the military government seem less likely than ever. Exercise  caution.  </P> <P>  -- Malaysia: The recent execution by hanging of an Englishman for drug  trafficking underscores the severity of Malaysia's drug laws. Death is  mandatory for anyone caught trafficking in even small amounts of heroin or  marijuana (more than half an ounce of heroin, seven ounces of marijuana). Avoid  all contact with illegal drugs.  </P> <P>  -- Thailand: Thai health officials recently reported a substantial increase in  acquired immune deficiency infections (AIDS) among female prostitutes,  particularly in the tourist areas of Chiang Mai and Pattaya.  </P> <P> There have been four serious train accidents in the last three months, a  discouraging safety record. However, the train is usually considered a safer  alternative than bus or truck for overland travel.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ma Xiaolin: "Kuwaitis Wander for an Unknown Future" -- </F> XINHUA headline]    [Text] Kuwait City, March 13 (XINHUA) -- When the new moon  of ending Ramadan was sighted Saturday [12 March] night, the  first day of Id al-Fitr (the festival of fast-breaking) began  and greeted by all Kuwaitis.    A mass prayer of 50,000 worshipers was held in a grant  mosque  today. Restaurants and cafes reopened normally, families began  visiting each other and men can return to diwaniyas during  daytimes to smoke the hubble-bubble, drink and chat. Kuwait was  permeated with an atmosphere of easiness, but not an overmuch  happiness.    Kuwaitis did not feel easy even when they celebrated the  33rd  National Day and the third anniversary of liberation from the  Iraqi occupation last month. At home and abroad, over a dozen  of problems were still bothering Kuwaitis. They don't know  whether they will have a bright tomorrow or a dark one.    The top question for Kuwait is that about 600 Kuwaiti POWs  and civilians are allegedly detained by Iraq and they are  unlikely to return in the near future. So, many families of the  missing have to spend the current festival with sadness.    New demarcation between Kuwait and Iraq was rejected by the  latter, even though it is risking serious international  pressure. Iraq has also refused the compensations paid by the  Kuwait Government for Iraqis who withdrew into Iraq to follow  the new border demarcation rules. Iraq's strong stance has  shocked Kuwaitis, and may ruin their confidence in a safe and  stable future of the ever-occupied country.    Relationships between Kuwait and its "opposition countries"  -- some Arab states which once supported or sympathized with  Iraq during the 1990-91 Gulf crisis -- remain suspended or have  limited progress in the direction of reconciliation. But the  Gulf anti-Iraq front has begun to break up when Kuwait got angry  at Qatar that tried to establish "balanced and clear relations"  with Iraq. Also a marine transportation line was reportedly to  be established between Iraq and the United Arab Emirates.    Meanwhile, the trial of attempted assassination of former  U.S. president George Bush was adjourned again and again. There  are signs that the lawsuit which could have created a more  intense tie between Iraq and its opponents may have an  advantageous end for Iraq. The international embargo against  Iraq could be softened if the alleged Iraq-backed plot was  turned down.    All these developments are really a bad news for Kuwaitis  who  are fearful of another invasion and occupation by a strong  neighbor.    At home, Kuwaitis are also confused by the economic  situation  which is not quite good. Foreign funds are badly needed by the  government for supporting the reconstruction, while domestic  funds are flowing abroad because the market is tiny and safety  prospect is still uncertain.    Suffering from a double financial impact, Kuwait lost  hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars last year when crude oil  prices slumped, while its overseas investment returns achieved a  lower level. Also, the hard debt plan is expected to cost the  government about 20 billion dollars. The government is forced  to cut public spending by 20 percent to cope with an increasing  deficit.    Kuwait is likely to carry out a package of privatization  steps and impose more charges on various public services. It  means that the Kuwaitis will get less money owed to them and  lose a lot of benefits from the welfare policies which they  lived on for a long time.    On the other hand, the legislature and the authorities are  likely at a cross road. There are reports that the current  cabinet and house will resign in order to form newer and  stronger government and parliament after the fast-breaking  festival. When asked about the reshuffle of the cabinet  earlier, Kuwaiti crown prince and Prime Minister Sa'd  al-'Abdullah al-Sabah neither denied nor confirmed. It made  Kuwaitis feel that everything is possible.    Another reason for Kuwaitis to consider the upcoming days as  uncertain is that the country is closer to be an Islamized one.  Of the 60 parliamentarians, 39 had signed a bill on amending  Article Two of the Constitution to allow the implementation of  the Islamic Sharia (law) in the country. If it is passed,  Kuwait will be turned into "a complete Islamic state." The  local citizens will find a series of limits and obstacles in  their social, cultural even family lives. Some entertainment  facilities such as satellite dishes will possibly be banned and  the life will become dull.    Those who oppose Islamization warned that the national  economy may collapse in case the Islamic Sharia is established  as the main source of legislation in the country.    Kuwaitis are waiting for the days following the festival, in  which they will experience some changes and reforms at home and  abroad.</p>

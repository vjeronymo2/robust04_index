			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Big savings spur Start 2 N-arms meltdown: The deal to cut 18,000 warheads THE Start 2 treaty is the latest and largest step in almost 30 years of arms talks between Washington and Moscow. The cuts it promises should bring the strength of the nuclear forces back to levels not seen in the US since the early 1960s, and in Russia since the mid-1970s. Under its terms, almost three- quarters of the strategic nuclear warheads the two countries possessed in 1990 will be removed by 2003. If the US helps Russia pay for their demolition the deadline will be three years earlier. Among them are the most destructive weapons ever devised: the land-based multiple warhead missiles. These are single missiles with many separate nuclear warheads that detach from the launcher to be guided on to different targets. There are also cuts in missiles launched from submarines, considered essential in the effort to counter the threat of a pre-emptive strike, and bombs carried by aircraft, still a main pillar of nuclear strategy in the US. The treaty means Russia should end up with about 3,000 strategic nuclear warheads and the US about 3,500 by early next century. Most will be carried by submarines. This compares with 1990 figures of 12,646 US warheads and 11,012 Russian. Most Russian warheads are currently in land-based missiles. These two stocks of strategic weapons will form virtually all the world's nuclear stockpile because tactical nuclear weapons, not part of Start, are set to be abandoned after a series of unilateral disarmament gestures made by Washington and Moscow in late 1991 and early 1992. The vast arsenals in the former Soviet states of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine, not part of Start 2, are supposed to be destroyed as part of the first Start treaty signed last year. Without these cuts, the three countries would have as many warheads as either Russia or the US in a post-Start 2 world. The other significant nuclear powers, France, China and the UK, have yet to signal their intentions. In the past the UK and France have scaled back nuclear procurement programmes in the wake of treaties between Washington and Moscow. Unlike the previous treaties, Start 2 was completed in record time, little more than six months from the initialling of a draft in Washington by Presidents George Bush and Boris Yeltsin. Strategic arms limitations talks (Salt 1 and Salt 2) and Start 1 each took nearer a decade to complete. Much of that six months was taken up with solving three main questions: could Russia keep some silos for its SS-18s, its largest missile, or how much should they be made smaller; to what extent could Russian SS-19 missiles be modified for single warhead use; and how easy should it be for US B1 bombers designed to carry conventional bombs to be modified to carry nuclear payloads. Driving the negotiators on was the prospect of massive cost savings. The cuts come at an opportune moment for governments struggling to contain spending when revenues are falling as a result of the world's economic slowdown. Some savings will be available to them quickly as procurement and modernisation programmes are cut. However, there will be costs incurred too as the task of disposing of almost 18,000 nuclear warheads and their launch systems gets underway. There are also likely to be job losses in some labour intensive parts of defence industry such as ship and submarine construction. In the UK, for example, pressure could be renewed to trim the Pounds 10bn Trident submarine programme. Defence contractors in conventional arms are unlikely to benefit from the cash liberated by the contraction in nuclear forces, according to Mr Jack Mendelsohn, a former member of US Salt and Start delegations, now deputy director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association. US spending on strategic nuclear weapons has in the past accounted for between 14 and 18 per cent of the Department of Defence budget. Cutting this in half would be a simple method for the incoming administration of president-elect Bill Clinton to cut costs. Editorial Comment, Page 8</p>

			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EASTERN EUROPE AND GERMANY  </P> <P> In view of the discussions currently taking place over the dollar amount to be  given to Poland, and the statement by Lech Walesa that Poland does not want the  entire sum in dollars, but would like to see foreign businesses invest in his  country, it occurs to me that there is an enormous untapped source of private  funds in this country. I refer to those people of Polish background who send  money to relatives in Poland.  </P> <P> I suggest that emergency legislation be passed enabling such donations to be  deducted from one's income tax as a legitimate expense. It is difficult enough  to support one's own family in this country but to support one's relatives in  Poland, as many do, is a double burden.  </P> <P> GILLIAN  </P> <P> OLECHNO-HUSZCZA  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

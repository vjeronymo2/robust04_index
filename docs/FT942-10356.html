			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Saatchi raps 'sloppy' advertising industry The advertising industry should end 'vague, sloppy thinking' and get back to 'simple and direct' messages, Mr Maurice Saatchi, chairman of global advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, said last night. A grim picture of an industry which has lost its sense of direction and is searching, like the character Hamlet, for a reason for existence was painted by Mr Saatchi in the speech to women advertising executives in London. 'The advertising industry now is more lacking in self-confidence, self-worth, than at any time I can remember,' he said. The recession could no longer be blamed for this bleak state of affairs. It is highly unusual for Mr Saatchi to speak out about the state of the industry. His comments come as Saatchi is battling to regain market share, particularly in the US, and follows a period of widely publicised conflict between Mr Saatchi and the group's chief executive, Mr Charlie Scott. Manufacturers which fail to invest in their brands came under particular attack from Mr Saatchi. He said: 'The old verities about advertising seem to have broken down. Advertising seems no longer to be part of that virtuous circle, in which the gift that advertising bestows - a premium price - is used to provide funds to reinvest in superior product quality, innovation, product development, which is the only true justification for a premium price.' Saatchi, together with WPP and the other large advertising groups, has stressed the benefit of global campaigns to clients and built worldwide networks accordingly. Yesterday, however, Mr Saatchi pointed to the difficulties of sustaining such campaigns. 'How do you communicate to lots of different people in all these different countries across the world without being so bland and jelly-like that you have nothing real to say?' he asked. He also said that network agency systems 'mean co-ordination, which often means committees - not the best environment for inspired creativity. In fact, global advertising quickly becomes trite and cliched - the lowest common denominator, not the highest form of expression of creative talent'. For advertising to meet the challenges of the future it needs to 'speak in simple, universally recognised truths', he said. This will mean that every brand has 'a consistent strategic focus'. 'It will mean the end of vague, sloppy thinking which leads to the vague, sloppy clothes in which so many brands go out in public. It will mean creative work so simple and direct that it strikes a chord in humans everywhere.'</p>

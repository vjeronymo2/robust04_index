			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Guillermo Rodriguez from Cartagena de Indias; </F> from the "Caracol's Quarter Hour" newscast -- live]    [Text] The Ibero-American countries, through their foreign  ministers, have already reached an agreement on the document for  investment, development, and social adjustments as a means of  moderating the summit's opening following the presentation of a  harsh document by the CLAT, the Latin American Central  Organization of Workers, which states that more than 200,000  workers in Latin America have lost their jobs.    Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin, at the conclusion of  the second round of sessions with her Ibero-American colleagues,  said the following:    [Begin recording] [Sanin] We have already reached an  agreement on the final document.    [Unidentified reporter] What does it consist of?    [Sanin] Integration, trade, investment, and the parallel  social-type processes that must be implemented.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct] what priority did it have?    [Sanin] It was not included on the agenda.    [Reporter] Did Spain and Portugal have a real commitment to  represent Latin America at the EU?    [Sanin] They are the natural bridge to represent us at the  EU.    [Reporter] Did they sign a written commitment?    [Sanin] Of course, since the first summit.    [Reporter] How would you describe the development of the  summit so far?    [Sanin] Totally satisfactory.    [Reporter] Would Colombia support military intervention in  Haiti? Would the Ibero-American countries support it as the  United States would like?    [Sanin] We have not talked about the topic of Haiti and Cuba  in this summit. We are going to see if the presidents, during  the informal meetings, bring it up, but up to now the foreign  ministers have not talked about it. [end recording]    These were the most relevant aspects of the meeting with the  media at the Americano Hotel a few minutes ago where the foreign  ministers have finished drafting the document that will be  reviewed by the presidents. There is no doubt that they will  discuss the topic of Haiti and Cuba, the two central topics that  are not officially on the agenda but will be brought up by some  of the countries that believe they are topics that Latin America  cannot avoid at this time.</p>

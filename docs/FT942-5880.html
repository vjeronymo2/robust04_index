			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Low prices hold back Ramco Oil Pre-tax profits of Ramco Oil Services, the USM-quoted energy services group, slipped from Pounds 349,000 to Pounds 323,000 in the year to end-December. Turnover fell from Pounds 5.43m to Pounds 4.78m. Earnings emerged at 0.6p (1.88p) and the dividend for the year is halved to 0.5p. The directors said the fall in turnover reflected lower levels of activity related to declining oil prices. In December last year Ramco commissioned its one-stop tubular service centre at Badentoy, near Aberdeen, and completed the sale of its former site at Altens. A placing of 800,000 new shares at 121 1/2 p took place in May 1993, and a further 485,000 were placed at 125p in August. The funds raised helped enable the completion of the first phase of the Badentoy facility.</p>

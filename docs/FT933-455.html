			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Pit roof-bolting cleared by HSE OLD WORKINGS and waste material were the principal causes of the roof cave-in at Bilsthorpe Colliery in which three people died, an interim report published yesterday by the Health and Safety Executive has found. It says the controversial roof-bolting system was the primary means of support in the area of the Nottinghamshire mine half a mile below the surface in which the fall occurred. But the size of the collapse was such that any free-standing support would have been unable to withstand the load. The inquiry team's main conclusion in a highly technical 40-page document is that the presence of an old roadway and associated waste were the principal factors contributing to last month's collapse. Mr Brian Langdon, deputy chief inspector of mines, said: 'Common features of the major falls, such as the one at Bilsthorpe, are their unpredictability and suddenness of collapse, giving little or no chance of escape to those in the immediate vicinity.' Mr Langdon said strata behaviour was not an exact science and more work had to be done to obtain greater understanding and to be able to measure more accurately the effects of coal pillars on mine workings. 'Until there is a clearer understanding, the practice of 'skin-to-skin' working - whereby a new road is driven immediately alongside an old road and adjacent waste with no intervening coal pillar - has been discontinued by British Coal in this and other mines.' Mr Langdon's interim report will be followed by a full report later. The HSE has drawn no final conclusions or made any recommendations on the findings to date. British Coal said the inquiry's conclusions were 'substantially in accord' with its own. 'The report acknowledges that the roof-bolting standards at Bilsthorpe were good,' said the corporation. Mr Langdon said he had found no evidence to suggest that safety standards were being marginalised in the privatisation of the coal industry.</p>

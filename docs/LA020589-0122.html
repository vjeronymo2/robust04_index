			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONSMOKERS SPEAK OUT  </P> <P> I was distressed and frustrated to read Dirlam's article. My husband and I are  nonsmokers and travel a fair amount of miles. Due to my husband's illness (post  open-heart surgery), we seek nonsmoking areas everywhere. It is not just a  matter of preference, but of life and death! Why wasn't the airline named? Why  should they be protected if the story was true? Please do not protect companies  that have no regard for their customers. And do not publish such articles again  unless companies are named.  </P> <P> PAT SAX  </P> <P> El Toro  </P></p>

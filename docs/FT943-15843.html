			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: No virtue in a protectionist bloc Sir, Joe Rogaly debases the whole discussion and damages his case by the wholly unfounded accusation that Euro-sceptics (not the word he uses) wish to erect 'a huge stone wall' between the UK and Europe ('The centre of attraction', July 5). This is untrue and I challenge him to justify this gross exaggeration. What many of us are desperately worried about is that the UK should be part of an increasingly protectionist bloc which resists change and which will increasingly create unnecessary conflict with the inhabitants of other parts of the world. The most fully developed policy of the EU is the Common Agricultural Policy. This has wasted resources on a scale that would pass belief if it had not occurred and its restrictive nature stultifies attempts to rebuild economic relationships with the countries of eastern Europe and with the states which until recently formed part of the Soviet Union. There is logic and virtue in arrangements which would allow the citizens and traders of the European Union to trade freely with their counterparts overseas. There is no logic, nor virtue, in rules which give preference to a few nations near one another in western Europe and which put the rest of the world on the other side of the trade barrier - along that road lies future conflict on a global scale.

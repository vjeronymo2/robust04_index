			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ahmad Quray', head of the PLO </F> Economic Department, by unidentified reporter, in the studio,  place and date not given; from the "With the Events" program --  recorded]    [Text] [Reporter] Good evening.    [Quray'] Good evening to you.    [Reporter] How true is the report that an economic agreement  between Israel and the PLO is likely next week?    [Quray'] I think both sides want to see these negotiations  wrapped up, after the two sides have probed each other's  position. I hope the next round of talks will see us reach an  agreement. There still are some fundamental issues pending...    [Reporter, interrupting] In which areas?    [Quray'] The question of imports is presenting difficulties.  For the Palestinian side this is of vital importance, since it  has an Arab dimension and affects Palestinian relations with the  Arab states. The imports issue also bears on the difficult  circumstances under which the Palestinians are living and coming  up against in Israeli rules and regulations. There are other  issues like the monetary system and what currencies will be  legal tender. Insurance and tourism also have yet to be  addressed.    [Reporter] Will the current water-sharing talks in Muscat  have a positive impact on economic talks that will open in Paris  tomorrow?    [Quray'] The two sets of talks are unconnected. The Muscat  talks are mulitlateral, the Paris talks are bilateral,  addressing economic concerns.    [Reporter] But cooperation on the wider front of the Middle  East may help along the bilateral ties between Israel and the  PLO.    [Quray'] We have an agreement that we are working to put in  place. Regarding Israel's relations with the Arab world, this  issue remains tied to a wider durable and comprehensive peace  with all the Arab parties and to Israel's withdrawal from the  occupied Arab territories in the Golan Heights, Jordan, and the  West Bank and Gaza. When this kind of peace comes, the climate  will recommend itself to rearranging the regional landscape so  as to ensure security, stability, and prosperity for this region  that has long suffered from wars.    [Reporter] You are in touch with Palestinian negotiators in  Cairo. Does it look that these talks will be completed soon?    [Quray'] I hope that agreement will be reached soon there,  now that the issues have been defined. There are not many  controversial issues left. Most of the issues have more or less  been settled. With questions of the Palestinian police and  security now virtually settled, I think it will be possible to  sort out the issues that remain if Israel is willing.    [Reporter] As long as there is a Palestinian willingness to  reach agreement, I think there is a possibility.    [Quray'] We have the will to reach an agreement and get to  the territories. An agreement cannot be viable and credible  before the withdrawal begins and the Palestinian delegation  arrives in the land.    [Reporter] When we were in Washington, you promised that you  would be here in the country no later than February. Is there a  set date for the PLO leadership to arrive in Gaza and Jericho?    [Quray'] If the Cairo talks and the economic agreement are  completed, I think it will be a matter of days before the  Palestinians enter Gaza and Jericho. We hope this will be in  early May. I am not setting a fixed date. However, further  postponement will help neither the agreement nor the peace  process.    [Reporter] Mr. Ahmad Quray', head of the PLO's Economic  Department, thank you.    [Quray'] Thank you.</p>

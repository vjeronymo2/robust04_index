Vittorio Alloco, EU ambassador to Central America, signed  the  agreements at a ceremony during which it was underscored the  Central American region is the "first partner" of the  development promotion policy being fostered from Brussels. The  European diplomat said with more than 500 projects underway,  worth more than $600 million, Central America is in first place,  on a per capita base, among the regions the European aid is  benefiting.    The Panamanian Electoral Tribunal will receive from the EU  more than $500,000 to conduct a nationwide campaign to inform  citizens about the new single-ballot voting system, which will  be used for the first time in the upcoming 8 May general  elections.    Electoral Tribunal President Eduardo Valdes has said the  highest Panamanian electoral authority is also expecting  complementary European aid to buy vehicles to be able to reach  the remotest communities in the country.    The EU representative signed another agreement with Kuna  "Indian Chief" Carlos Lopez to improve the traditional  production sectors of the Indian communities and to promote  sustainable development.    Another agreement was signed with the Justice and Peace  Commission, which Stanley Muschett, Santa Maria La Antigua  University president, heads. This agreement will enable the  commission to conduct a poll during the elections.    The tour of the EU ambassador, who is headquartered in the  Costa Rican capital, will end with the signing of another  agreement with the Panamanian Foreign Ministry.</p>

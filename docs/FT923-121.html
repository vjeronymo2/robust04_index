			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Arts: 'Il Pirata' and 'Fidelio' - Opera in Zurich and London Like two lovers who don't speak the same language, German-speaking Europe has long been fascinated by bel canto opera without being able to make much sense of it: you either get some disastrously way-out form of Regietheater, or a bland pictorial reproduction by an imported Italian director. It seems to be only non-partisan outsiders who can pull off the marriage between German logic on the one hand, and Latin warmth and spontaneity on the other. This is what distinguishes the new staging by the American producer Francesca Zambello of Bellini's Il Pirata at the Zurich Opera House. Il Pirata was Bellini's first commission for La Scala (1827), the first of his collaborations with the librettist Felice Romani and one of the first Italian operas to dispense with recitativo secco in favour of the continuous Romantic style of composition. As with any successful revival, one is left wondering why it has been left to languish so long (Callas in the 1950s and Caballe in the 1960s being its last great exponents). Il Pirata rewards the listener with some of the most sublime melodies Bellini ever wrote. At first sight, its dramatic ingredients are not far off the romantic stereotype: Imogene, married to Ernesto, loves the pirate-nobleman Gualtiero, Ernesto's political rival, and ends up with neither. But look beneath the surface, and you find what Edward Dent recognised more than 50 years ago as 'a stimulating exercise in emotional analysis'. In her emblematic, psychologically-perceptive staging, Zambello sees Imogene as a universal archetype - the woman whose dutiful marriage and Hausfrau existence preclude any sort of romantic fulfilment except in day-dreams. Imogene dreams of Gualtiero, symbolised by the miniature galleon which she cradles as the curtain opens on Act one, and which the designer Bruno Schwengl turns into a motif for the whole production. He bathes the stage in Mediterranean colours, adding little more than a gauze, a drop cloth and a few nautical props. In her direction of the principals, Zambello accepted the conventions of Italian opera, but encouraged the singers to substitute emotional poise for melodrama. Only in Ernesto's arrival-scene - dominated by a golden horse and a posse of pink-plumed guards - did the production dissolve into kitsch. But however well they fare as theatre, Bellini's operas stand or fall on the quality of the singing. The main audience draw in Zurich was Mara Zampieri, who met the technical challenges without disguising a breathy, effortful quality in her voice production. Imogene is no Minnie or Forza Leonora: for all her stage presence, Zampieri lacks the sparkling clarity and tonal delicacy for Bellini. The real vocal sparks came from Salvatore Fisichella, an underrated Sicilian tenor who regularly reserves his best for Switzerland. With his sweet and open tone, clear diction and clarion despatch, he glided over the numerous hurdles in Gualtiero's high-lying music. The American baritone Rodney Gilfrey, much admired in French opera and Mozart, made an unhappy Ernesto, Pythonesque in his ceremonial armour and vocally ill-at-ease. The mainstay of Zurich's Italian repertoire is Nello Santi, whose performances are scrupulously prepared and executed, if sometimes marred by a strictness more appropriate to a bandmaster. Il Pirata found him in sensitive form, shaping the music tenderly and drawing exquisite solo contributions from horn and cor anglais. The drab staging of Fidelio by Adolf Dresen has been brought back to Covent Garden two seasons after it was introduced. The revival has been directed by Astrid Vehstedt with a largely new set of principals; only Gabriela Benackova returns in the title role. Jeffrey Tate is the conductor. Dresen's reworking of the text, with significantly tightened dialogue, has been retained. It shortens the running time, but is otherwise not beneficial, and the question of why it was thought necessary in the first place is never answered. The whole effect, indeed, is of a production without purpose; one waits in vain for enlightenment to arrive, for a reason other than decorative reference in Margit Bardy's designs for the slight updating of the story, for a dramatic spark to set the moral fable ablaze rather than reduce it to an everyday narrative. Given thrilling performances the very neutrality of such a setting might have been a bonus, an unobtrusive backdrop to the musical drama. On Monday there were no thrills. Though much of the singing was more than competent, Tate's conducting was leaden and lacked any sense of scale or fervour; it is almost an achievement in itself to make the Prisoners' Chorus as matter-of-fact as it was here, or fail so completely to strike sparks from the Act 2 finale. Elsewhere ensemble was sometimes tenuous, but then few of the musical components cohered. Benackova produced some gleaming phrases, but not enough to create the combination of moral certainty and moving commitment at the core of Leonore; the heroic dimension was missing. There was a useful clean-toned Rocco, complete with limp, from Gunter Missenhardt, an underpowered (though reportedly under-the-weather) Pizzarro from Gregory Yurisch. Lynton Artkinson's fresh Jacquino and Judith Howarth's lively Marzelline provided the brightest playing; Thomas Sunnegardh's Florestan swamped a few well-turned mid-register phrases with some extraordinary squalls and wild pitching above the stave. An unsatisfactory evening almost all round. Royal Opera House, Covent Garden; further performances October 1, 7, 10, 13 and 17.</p>

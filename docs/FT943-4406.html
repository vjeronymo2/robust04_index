			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Seoul urged to ease curbs on currencies: State panel suggests dropping 'most' exchange controls A government-appointed panel yesterday recommended that South Korea abolish most foreign exchange controls by 1999. The ministry of finance will consider the committee's findings when it proposes reforms to ease restrictions on capital flows, which are expected to be announced in November. South Korea currently imposes strict regulations on capital transfers as part of the government's strong control over the financial system. Among the committee's main conclusions is that the government should permit an increase in the foreign ownership of Korean securities, which is limited to 10 per cent of a company's stock. It proposed that the foreign ownership limit should be raised in three stages in 1995, 1997 and 1999, with the possibility that the ceiling would be abolished by the end of the decade. Foreign investors have expressed frustration about the limits, which have prevented them from investing in one of the potentially buoyant stock markets in Asia. But the reforms also liberalise the outflow of capital, reflecting government concern that an extensive inflow of foreign capital would cause inflationary pressure. Companies would be freed to raise capital abroad, where interest rates are lower than in Korea, by 1997. The reforms are meant to ease financial conditions for Korean companies, as they increase spending on production capacity and research and development. But restrictions would remain on the opening of the bond and short-term money markets to foreign investors. The Korean currency is also unlikely to be fully liberalised, reflecting concerns about a rapid appreciation of the Korean won, which would harm the export-dependent economy. It is still uncertain whether the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development will accept the proposed schedule, since most of the reforms will be implemented only after Korea joins the organisation in 1996. A recent OECD report on the Korean economy criticised the government for maintaining one of the most regulated financial systems among the advanced industrial countries, even if its proposed financial liberalisation programme is fully implemented. Another report, by the Lausanne-based International Institute for Management Development and the Geneva-based World Economic Forum, ranked South Korea a poor 24th in world competitiveness among a list of 23 OECD members and 18 developing nations. The IMD/WEF report said South Korea was the most culturally closed and protectionist nation of the 41, and placed it third from bottom in its internationalisation league.</p>

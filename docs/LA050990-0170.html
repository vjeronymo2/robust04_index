			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RUTHERFORD INJURED IN INDY CRASH  </P> <P> Three-time winner Johnny Rutherford suffered a concussion today when he crashed  for the second time this week during practice for the Indianapolis 500.  </P> <P> Rutherford, 52, was taken by ambulance to Methodist Hospital and was reported  in stable condition.  </P> <P> Rutherford's 1989 Lola-Cosworth race car went out of control as he drove  through the third turn on the 2 1/2-mile oval. The car skidded sideways through  the turn, doing a half-spin as he slid 665 feet and slammed into the wall with  the left side. The car went slightly airborne and slid along the wall 75 feet,  digging a big gouge in the track surface. The car then spun 690 feet away from  the wall and came to rest on the inside track apron.  </P> <P> He was placed on a stretcher and taken to the speedway's infield hospital for  examination before being transferred to Methodist. His car received extensive  damage to the left side.  </P> <P> Rutherford had completed only two laps before the crash, with a top speed of  146.668. His best lap was on Monday, when he was timed at 212.039 before his  first crash. At that time, he came high out of the second turn and brushed the  wall with the right tires. He was not injured in that incident.  </P> <P> Rutherford, who won the 500 in 1974, 1976 and 1980, was seeking his 25th start  at Indianapolis. He qualified last year but was bumped from the lineup by the  final qualifier.  </P></p>

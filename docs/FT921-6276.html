			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Greencore's stormy AGM GREENCORE, the Irish sugar and foods group, held a stormy annual meeting in Dublin yesterday, the first since its privatisation last April. A heated debate took place over the re-election of three directors who had sat on the board of the company before privatisation and during 1988 and 1990,a period in which a series of controversial share deals resulted in a subsidiary being bought out. All were re-elected but some small shareholders have been upset by what many regarded as a cavalier attitude by Mr Bernie Cahill, the chairman. He caused an uproar yesterday on a motion on directors' fees, which was clearly defeated by a show of hands; a lengthy ballot had to be then held and the motion passed. Costs of the share deal controversy are expected to exceed IPounds 5m, and reduce pre-tax profits in 1991 by 17 per cent. A High Court investigation into the affair is imminent.</p>

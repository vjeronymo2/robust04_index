			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of Greece (13): The other brand names are dead - Profile, METAXA MR Dennis Malamatinas, chief executive of Metaxa, says that his company boasts one of only three successful Greek brand names: 'The others are Onassis and Maria Callas.' Tankers and arias are easier to identify than the contents of a bottle of Metaxa. In Greece it is 'koniak,' but to the rest of the European Community it is brandy. Ask a member of the Metaxas family which invented it a century ago and you are firmly told: 'Metaxa is a unique spirit.' It is also very varied. Three-star Metaxa is something you gulp down in the village cafeneion on a winter morning before setting out to prune the vines. The five-star version is found in Athenian bars at a fraction of the price of cognac, though few fashionable Greeks are seen drinking it. But seven-star Metaxa is the top-selling brandy in international duty free shops, with sales of 1.5m cases a year. Nevertheless, duty-free sales account for only 13 per cent of Metaxa turnover, though more than 50 per cent of production is exported. Most is drunk in Germany and Austria, 'by expatriate Greeks and people who like to keep up with things Greek between holidays,' Mr Malamatinas says. He joined Metaxa after the owners sold out in 1988 to Grand Metropolitan, the drinks, food and retailing group, with a brief to 'transform a flourishing traditional Greek family business into a dynamic part of a multinational group.' Mr Malamatinas has the kind of background to make the transition go smoothly: a Greek born in Zimbabwe, he worked for Procter and Gamble in the US and headed Pepsico's operations in Italy before moving to Metaxa. His management team was picked, he says, on the basis of 'being internationally oriented with an awareness of Greek business culture' and asked to carve out a niche for Metaxa in the international fashion and luxury goods sector. The Metaxa distillery outside Athens has been modernised and capacity doubled, at a cost of Dollars 4.6m. Last year packaging and advertising for seven-star Metaxa was redesigned. The amphora-shaped bottle was relaunched as 'the Greek spirit'. Sales in 1990 improved by 10 per cent. Unlike most Greek businessmen bought out by foreign companies in the past few years, the Metaxas family still keeps an interest in the spirits business. Mr Elias Metaxas, who used to be the company's chief taster, owns a distillery in central Greece where he experiments with liqueurs and produces a brandy to match any Metaxa. 'I am still fascinated,' he says, 'by anything to do with alcohol.'</p>

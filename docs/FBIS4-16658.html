			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report in the VEKHI section: "Boris Yeltsin's </F> New Book"]    [Text] Boris Yeltsin's new book "A President's Notes"  [Zapiski Prezidenta] will appear in the bookstores in Russia and  in more than 30 other countries in May.    "This is a large book," Lev Gushchin, the chief editor,  stressed, "with over 400 pages and 100 color photographs. It is  written in the form of the president's personal diary and covers  the events from the dramatic August of 1991 to the tragic  October of 1993. Descriptions of the events are interspersed in  the book with Boris Nikolayevich's reflections on the paths of  Russia's development and transformation, portraits of political  figures and those people with whose lives the country's destiny  became interlinked at that difficult period."    "It would be no mistake," Lev Gushchin noted, "to say that  the many facts and assessments contained in the book are really  sensational and that many of the riddles and mysteries of recent  years are logically answered here. But to be frank it is the  tone the `Notes' which is most impressive. This is perhaps the  first time that we have encountered a text which is so personal,  candid, and at times merciless toward the author and others, a  text penned by a member of the country's top leadership."</p>

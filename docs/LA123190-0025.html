			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JETS RUN PAST THE BUCCANEERS, 16-14  </P> <P> The New York Jets utilized a ground attack to stop a five-game losing streak,  so they stuck with it and ended the season with consecutive wins.  </P> <P> The Jets ran for 155 yards Sunday during a 16-14 victory over the Tampa Bay  Buccaneers.  </P> <P> The Jets' victory came a week after they rushed for 239 yards in a win over New  England.  </P> <P> "By the middle of the third quarter, we went back to last week's game plan,"  Jet Coach Bruce Coslet said. "We played them real tough. That was a pretty  decent team we just beat.  </P> <P> "This gives us something to build off for next year."  </P> <P> Blair Thomas, the second pick in last spring's draft, gained 43 yards in six  carries and scored his first rushing touchdown for the Jets, who finished with  a 6-10 record in Coslet's first season as coach.  </P> <P> Tampa Bay (6-10) lost eight of its last 10 games, including two of three under  interim Coach Richard Williamson, who probably saw the end of his bid to  replace Ray Perkins on a permanent basis.  </P> <P> Williamson, who has guided the club since Perkins was fired Dec. 3, said he  expects to meet soon with owner Hugh Culverhouse. He would not speculate on his  chances of getting the job.  </P> <P> "I told the players that whatever happens in the future, that you've got to  believe you're going to be good," Williamson said. "I believe they're going to  have a bright future -- they're right on the edge."  </P> <P> Pat Leahy kicked field goals of 21 and 32 yards and Thomas scored on a  five-yard run after Ron Stallworth recovered a fumble at Tampa Bay's 35 to give  the Jets a 13-7 halftime lead.  </P> <P> Leahy added a 25-yard field goal with less than a minute left in the third  quarter.  </P> <P> Tampa Bay sputtered offensively after Vinny Testaverde completed five of six  passes for 69 yards during a 72-yard touchdown drive in the second quarter.  </P> <P> Reggie Cobb scored on a one-yard run for a 7-3 lead, but the Buccaneers did not  reach the end zone again until just 3:32 remained.  </P> <P> "Today's game, I think, summed up the whole season," said Testaverde, who  completed 19 of 27 passes for 204 yards and rushed for 51 yards in five  carries. "We had our bright spots, we had our miscues. It sums up the whole  season in one game because you could see how it unraveled as it went along."  </P> <P> Tony Stargell and Erik McMillan intercepted passes for the Jets in the second  half, and the Jets sacked Testaverde three times.  </P> <P> Bruce Hill caught a seven-yard touchdown pass from Testaverde that drew the  Buccaneers to within 16-14 with 3:32 left.  </P> <P> But Johnny Hector gained 11 yards on first down on the Jets' ensuing  possession, then Tony Eason sustained the drive with a 31-yard, third-down  completion to Dale Dawkins that enabled the Jets to run out the clock.  </P> <P> Eason played the fourth quarter after Ken O'Brien, who completed 11 of 19  passes for 102 yards, left the game with a slight concussion sustained on a  quarterback sneak.  </P> <P> "I was on the ground and took a hit to the head. . . . I'm OK now," said  O'Brien, who was shaken up late in the third quarter.  </P> <P> "This is a great win. We really needed this. I wish the season went on for  another few weeks. We're getting better."  </P> <P> Freeman McNeil gained 43 yards in nine carries for the Jets.  </P></p>

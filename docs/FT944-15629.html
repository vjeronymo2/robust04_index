			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Finland's EU vote boosts Nordic hopes Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the Swedish prime minister, flew to Oslo yesterday for talks with Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, his Norwegian counterpart, as the two leaders sought to capitalise on Finland's approval of European Union membership in their own EU referendum campaigns. Both Mr Carlsson, making his first trip outside Sweden since his Social Democratic party won last month's general election, and Mrs Brundtland welcomed the result of Sunday's Finnish vote and said it should help persuade sceptical voters in Sweden and Norway to accept EU membership in referendums due in the two countries on November 13 and 28 respectively. Opposition in Sweden and Norway is more deeply entrenched than in Finland. Mr Carlsson's own cabinet includes two prominent anti-EU campaigners. But he said the Finnish vote undercut the argument from the no campaign that there was a Nordic alternative to the EU. 'It would be striking for Sweden to be outside the Union when Denmark and Finland are inside,' he said. However, leaders of the strong anti-EU campaigns in both countries said the Finnish result - a yes victory by 57 per cent to 43 per cent - was not as decisive as had been expected and they pledged to continue their fight against joining the Union. Despite the Finnish result, voters in Norway appear to be maintaining their opposition. A poll published in Aftenposten, Norway's leading newspaper, suggested that 51 per cent of the electorate was against EU membership, an increase of six percentage points since September. Those in favour accounted for 31 per cent, a decline of four percentage points. The Finnish vote meant two out of the four European Free Trade Association applicants have now won referendums. Austria voted in June by an even clearer margin than Finland. The last hurdle in Finland before taking up membership on January 1 will be a so-far unscheduled parliamentary vote. Under the Finnish constitution, membership must be approved by a two-thirds majority, leading to some concern that EU opponents might try to mount a last-ditch blocking effort.</p>

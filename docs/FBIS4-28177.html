			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Alfred Schwarz report] </F>   [Excerpts] [Moderator] Today North Korea's Embassy  Councilor Yun Ho-chin gave a press conference on the  international negotiations concerning the controversy over North  Korea's nuclear program. Alfred Schwarz attended the press  conference for us.    [Schwarz] North Korea keeps insisting on its position: It  has fulfilled all its duties toward the IAEA [International  Atomic Energy Agency]. What the IAEA wants from North Korea  exceeds the IAEA's powers. North Korea will not permit this.  This represents interference in North Korea's internal affairs,  it was said.    North Korea refers to a special status, which it allegedly  has because of the latest agreements with the IAEA. The IAEA  categorically rejects such a special status by North Korea.  [passage omitted]    In the afternoon the IAEA General Council will meet in  Vienna. It is not expected that the IAEA will resign itself to  North Korea's attitude. [passage omitted]</p>

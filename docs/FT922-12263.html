			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (5): Europe welcomes mellow sound - Kemble &amp; Co KEMBLE &amp; Company is no stranger to exporting. For the first two years after the second world war it was forbidden by the UK government from doing anything else. At the time, the UK was desperately short of foreign currency, and keen to establish export markets for UK companies by stealing a march on mainland European countries whose industries were all but destroyed during the war. Mr Brian Kemble, now joint managing director of the old family business, remembers his father, who had recently returned from the war, travelling across Europe by car to sell his pianos. On his first few trips, he still wore his army uniform. Times may have changed, and Kemble is now a joint venture with the mighty Japanese Yamaha Corporation, but the export culture remains strong. The company has gained a Queen's Award for more than doubling its export sales over three years to Pounds 5m in 1991. The Kemble family began manufacturing pianos in a small workshop in Stoke Newington, north-east London, in 1911. Then it was a small fish in a pool of more than 200 UK manufacturers. At their peak in the 1920s British companies produced more than 60,000 pianos a year. The industry has declined ever since, hit by a falling market and almost dealt a knock-out blow in the 1970s by an over-valued pound and strong competition from cheap imports from south-east Asia. But Kemble, once the minnow, has overtaken the bigger fishes, and absorbed some of its competitors, including such names as Chappell of Bond Street. It is now by far the largest UK producer, with 93 per cent of all UK piano exports. More than 6,300 pianos a year roll off the production lines of its purpose-built plant in Milton Keynes, where it moved in 1969. One year before that, Mr Denzil Jacobs, joint managing director, made the first contact with Yamaha, which had started to manufacture electric organs in competition with Hammond. Soon, the Yamaha-Kemble subsidiary formed as a result was the UK's main importer and wholesaler for the whole range of Yamaha organs and pianos. That relationship persisted until 1984, when Kemble signed an initial agreement to start manufacturing Yamaha pianos under licence in the UK. The first models were produced in 1986. Two years later, Yamaha, looking for a European partner to be able to take full advantage of the single European market, established a full joint venture with Kemble. Yamaha in turn invested in the Milton Keynes plant, introducing state-of-the art machinery and computer-controlled production. The factory was expanded and re-equipped and its capacity increased from 4,000 to 10,000 units a year. The development was unusual, given Japanese companies' preference for greenfield sites. Mr Brian Kemble ascribes the success of the partnership to the combination of the traditional high quality standards and craftsmanship of Kemble, and the technological know-how of the Japanese. Yamaha is now the biggest shareholder in the joint venture - although the exact size of its holding is undisclosed - but Mr Kemble says the company's family ethos has not been lost. If anything, it has been enhanced by the partnership. 'The first thing I did when I became managing director was to abolish the director's dining room and toilets. I didn't need the Japanese to tell me to do that,' Mr Kemble says. 'We have learnt a lot from Yamaha, but we have looked in many different areas for the best practices. And Yamaha has learnt from us. In Japan, its staff are no longer obliged to wear uniforms, which was the result of our influence.' Creating a successful partnership with quality products and a state-of-the-art plant was only part of the battle. The UK piano market continues to decline - last year only 10,000 models were sold - and so Kemble was forced to turn its attentions increasingly to export, which by last year absorbed three-quarters of the company's products. The link with Yamaha has undoubtedly proved advantageous. Around 75 per cent of Kemble's pianos are exported under the Yamaha name, and sold to Yamaha subsidiaries in France and Germany which market them in Europe. Kemble produces all the non-black upright Yamahas for the entire European market. 'The design is Japanese, but we use different components such as German sounding boards which have a more mellow sound popular in Europe,' Mr Kemble says. The remaining 25 per cent of pianos are exported under the name of Kemble or Chappell of Bond Street, and are sold through sales agents abroad, direct to retail stores. Over the past three years, Mr Kemble has had a policy of selecting 'young, dynamic agents' especially in Holland and Germany - which seems to have paid dividends. The largest export market remains western Germany, a fact of which Kemble is particularly proud given the strength of the indigenous competition - companies such as Steinway and Bechstein, as well as Bluthner of east Germany. The second-biggest market is France, followed by Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Holland, and a number of other European countries. Kemble is also having some success in taking on the local competition in south-east Asia, including Hong Kong and Singapore. Here, the company feels the Queen's Award will be a particular advantage. 'There are companies in the Far East manufacturing pianos with British names that are of poor quality. The Queen's award will further enhance our reputation over there. Now, if people see the logo, they will know they are getting the real thing.'</p>

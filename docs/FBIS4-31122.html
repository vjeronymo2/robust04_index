			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec by </F> Fernando de Sousa in Prague; date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [De Sousa] What is the main aim  of your visit to Portugal?    [Zieleniec] We feel that we are an integral part of the  European continent, so it is natural and logical for us to  communicate as if we were neighbors. Portugal belongs to the  European Union [EU] and the Atlantic alliance. For us it is  natural that the logic of our course tends toward those  institutions. It is necessary to talk, as well as to exchange  experiences and views on those realities, with a view to a  mutual understanding.    In addition, bilateral contacts are very important. The two  countries are of a similar size, trade must not be overlooked,  and it is natural for it to become necessary to create  conditions essential for trade. I will also be signing an  agreement preventing double taxation -- one of the essential  conditions for the sound development of economic relations. I  would also like to recall that President Soares visited the  country immediately after our revolution, in a very complex  situation, and we regard this as proof of deep friendship and  trust.    [De Sousa] Moreover, President Soares will be coming here  again this year....    [Zieleniec] Yes, this is planned, and he will have the  opportunity to see how this country has altered, how Prague has  changed its appearance. He will be able to see everything that  has been done by us. So we are very glad to have the  opportunity and the chance to welcome the Portuguese president  again.    [De Sousa] On this visit to Lisbon, you will also have the  opportunity to raise the Czech intention to join the EU and to  explain that plan to the Portuguese....    [Zieleniec] In our opinion, it is very natural that we  should some day belong to the EU, because it includes the  countries which are our family, with which we have had dealings  throughout our history. So I believe that it will not be  necessary to explain this aim. If the Czech Republic did not  wish to join, then it would be necessary to give explanations....    [De Sousa] In any event, one of the matters which will be  raised by the member states such as Portugal during the  membership negotiations when they are held will be the  competition of countries such as the Czech Republic for  Community funds, which at that time will have to be shared out  by more European regions. Will this aspect also be broached in  Lisbon?    [Zieleniec] I believe that it is possible to discuss every  kind of issue linked to the membership process, but it is  necessary to observe the changes in our country over the past  four or five years and the dynamism of our economic development.    I believe that our republic will soon be in a position to be  able contribute to the Community more than it receives.    [De Sousa] Do you believe so?    [Zieleniec] I do not think it is necessary to discuss the  matter at this time, but if we are going to broach this problem  in greater detail, what matters most is agriculture. We have  problems with agriculture different from those occurring today  in the EU. Our system of organization of agriculture is  relatively liberal, and we would like to liberalize it to a  level similar to that of industry -- that is, eliminate all  kinds of subsidies and grants -- and we hope that with our  joining the EU we will not have to change this. We hope that  agriculture, as it currently exists in the EU, will tend more  toward a market system.    [De Sousa] At what date do you hope formally to apply for  EU membership?    [Zieleniec] We deem it important to send no wrong signals.  What matters is that, above all, our country's citizens should  know that the most important thing is not the date of the  membership application but knowing how and how quickly we will  be able to transform this country.    [De Sousa] And when do you hope for actual membership?  There is talk of 2010....    [Zieleniec] I believe this is all linked to a whole general  view for central and eastern Europe. Those who visit our  country soon acknowledge that it will in no way be a further  burden for the EU.    [De Sousa] It has been stated that the reason for joining  has to do with the desire to move closer to a Europe with which  this country has historical ties, but is there not also a  security concern, in order to provide against any form of  instability in Russia?    [Zieleniec] I believe that if there is democracy and a  market economy system in Russia, we will have nothing to fear.  If there is none of that, you, too, will have to be be afraid.    [De Sousa] But in the event of a problem, the Czech Republic  will be geographically closer to Russia. The perception abroad  is that the countries of this region are seeking to move closer  to the West in order to feel more secure....    [Zieleniec] I do not believe that there is a particularly  acute danger right now. Of course, in the medium and long-term  perspective, it is important to know how this part of the  continent will be organized. That is natural, but it is not  good to analyze these matters from the viewpoint of the past.  Europe was divided by conventional weapons during World War II,  with the involvement of infantry and tanks -- not through  nuclear missiles. All the developments today have other  technical conditions. I do not believe that it is possible now  to introduce the simple geometry of the forties into this  problem. I can guarantee that an unstable and aggressive Russia  represents a danger both for us and for the rest of the  continent. That is why we are rooting so much for the Russian  democrats and hoping that they will succeed in achieving what  they want.    [De Sousa] Is there a Zhirinovskiy factor? Do you believe  he is a danger?    [Zieleniec] Zhirinovskiy as a man, no, but the 26 percent of  the votes which he won, yes. Where there is no political  stability, where there are economic problems, political forces  tend to adopt extreme stances. Hence the importance of  political and economic stability in Russia.    [De Sousa] In light of that observation, do you believe that  the Czech Republic will be more secure if it moves closer to the  West?    [Zieleniec] Yes, of course, but we are already very close.    [De Sousa] How do you interpret the Partnership for Peace  which you have now signed with NATO? Do you believe it is  sufficient for your aspirations?    [Zieleniec] I do not know what you mean by "sufficient." It  is natural that we would like to belong to the Atlantic  alliance, because we feel that it contains countries with the  same values that we uphold. The Partnership for Peace is not  the alliance, but it is an area created in order to cooperate  together. Of course we welcome this opportunity, and we will  very actively take advantage of all the possibilities that it  offers.    [De Sousa] But the final aim is to join NATO....    [Zieleniec] That is clear.    [De Sousa] Let us talk a little now about the Czech  Republic's evolution following the separation from Slovakia.  What has economic and political life in this country been like  in this new situation?    [Zieleniec] I do not think it is possible to make a  comparison in those terms. Some problems, such as the constant  arguments with Slovakia over the form of organization of the  state, have disappeared. We have succeeded in establishing a  stable parliament and government, and we have a well directed  economic reform which is accepted by the overwhelming majority  of our population. Political and economic stability is also  extremely important from the viewpoint of cooperation with other  countries.    We note considerable interest on the part of foreign  investors, who can find considerable potential here. We have a  large foreign trade surplus, and in the balance of payments we  have sufficient currency reserves.    Our unemployment rate is just 3 percent. Our currency's  exchange rate is stable, having hardly fluctuated in the past  four years. And these are all signs of an economic boom and  also a good basis for the favorable development of the whole of  society.    [De Sousa] What is the current relationship between the  Czech Republic and Slovakia? Are they friendly relations?    [Zieleniec] This whole process has been very painful for us,  because from the psychological viewpoint it is very difficult  for us to accustom ourselves to the idea that a state is  dividing. We therefore adopted a pragmatic attitude and did  what was necessary at the time. We sat down at the same table  and discussed dozens and dozens of agreements. We can now say  that there are reciprocal agreements between the two countries  governing all aspects of our lives. There are no problems for  the population. They can travel freely. They can live in  either country; the problems of hiring, insurance, and social  welfare have been resolved. A customs union has been set up. I  am convinced that resolving all these problems created the basis  for the whole process' success. When I look back, I can say  that it was almost a miracle to have succeeded in maintaining  the friendly relations which exist between us, despite this very  confused and painful situation. Of course there are still some  problems, which I hope will be resolved, but I am convinced that  we will resolve them as we have resolved all the others.  Relations, both between the two states and between the two  nations, remain friendly, and we are very pleased that this has  been achieved.</p>

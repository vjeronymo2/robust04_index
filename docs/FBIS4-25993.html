			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 16 KYODO -- A Chinese Foreign  Ministry spokesman said Thursday [16 June] a 1961 Chinese-North  Korean treaty guaranteeing mutual military aid in case of  invasion "remains in force."    Shen Guofang, speaking at a weekly ministry briefing,  refused  to go into details about the 1961 treaty, saying only there is  still room and the possibility for the participants involved in  the nuclear issue on North Korea to arrive at "a proper  settlement."    Article 3 of the 1961 Sino-North Korean Mutual Aid Treaty  stipulates that if either China or North Korea is invaded by a  third country, mutual aid will be offered to the country under  invasion. "When one of the signatory countries of the treaty  enters a state of war due to the military attack of another  country or its ally, then the other signatory country must  immediately, to the extent of its authority, offer military and  other aid," the treaty states in a Japanese translation.    Shen, reiterating that China does not want to see the  development of such a situation, said, "it is our hope that all  the parties concerned choose not to talk about war but talk  about ways for solving the nuclear issue."    He did not comment on North Korea's unilateral position that  any UN sanctions will be treated as "a declaration of war" but  said, "we hope that the interested parties will carry on their  dialogues and try to relax the tensions in order to find a  proper solution in the end."    The UN Security Council is considering implementing  sanctions  on North Korea in an effort to urge the Stalinist state to  accept international inspections of its suspected nuclear  weapons program.    The treaty could be seen as a good indication that China  will  use its power as a permanent member of the UN Security Council  to veto any sanctions resolution, analysts said. The treaty,  signed by the late Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai and North Korea  leader Kim Il-song, also stipulates that neither signatory will  join any kind of international bloc against the other signatory.</p>

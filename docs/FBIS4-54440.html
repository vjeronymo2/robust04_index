			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bratislava April 25 (CTK) -- [passage omitted]  The problems concerning recognition of the inviolability of the  current (Slovak-Hungarian) borders and the position of ethnic  minorities are "artificially inflated, while in both cases it is  possible to achieve agreements and guarantees which would bring  about a satisfactory solution," Gabor Kuncze, a candidate for  premiership of the Hungarian opposition Union of Free Democrats  (SZDSZ), tells the left-leaning PRAVDA.    It is not at all realistic to consider a possible change in  the borders. Therefore, there is no sense in hampering the  development of relations, Kuncze says, adding that Slovakia  should make a step forward regarding the ethnic minorities.    "We do not believe that it is correct to refer to  safeguarding the individual rights in this respect. In the  sphere of minorities the individual rights can be ensured only  by means of collective rights. For example, the use of the  minority language cannot be applied individually if it has not  been resolved on the collective basis of education in that  language, its use in culture and administration. I believe that  it is possible to discuss culture and language autonomy and a  measure of autonomy in self- administration," Kuncze states.    Kuncze rejects "frightening the voters" by arguing that it  will not be possible to form a government coalition and that the  elections will be repeated in September. "I consider the voters  wise enough to send the parties to the parliament so that it  could be possible to form a competent government coalition. I  do not think the elections will be repeated," he says.    Asked whether he can imagine becoming premier supported by  the Hungarian Socialist Party, Kuncze replies that he does not  deal with "occultism and prophecies."</p>

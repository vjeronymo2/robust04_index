			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / How Household supplies will be opened up to competition British Gas' monopoly of the domestic gas market will be ended in 1998, but new competitors can start entering the market in 1996. Safety: British Gas' transportation and storage division would retain 'a prominent role' in ensuring the safety of the gas system. Assurance of supply: any company with adequate resources would be eligible to supply homes with gas. But suppliers will have to subscribe to a network code to ensure orderly operation of the gas system. Pricing: 'Some continuing regulation' may be necessary to aid the transition to a competitive market, but prices could vary by plus or minus 2 to 4 per cent for consumers because of different transportation costs. Standards of service: new suppliers to observe same debt and disconnection procedures as British Gas, and to have same obligation to supply older and disabled customers for a time. Other measures: liberalisation of metering, and incentives for efficient use of gas.</p>

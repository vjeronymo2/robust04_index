			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / George Walker switches tack in bankruptcy fight MR GEORGE WALKER, the former chairman and chief executive of Brent Walker, the property and leisure group, is back fighting moves by his creditors to have him declared bankrupt. Only two weeks ago Mr Walker, who faces claims from his creditors for up to Pounds 180m, made his own application to be made bankrupt. The move was to enable him to qualify for legal aid in his defence against theft charges involving Pounds 12.5m brought by the Serious Fraud Office. Having overcome the problem which prevented him getting legal aid for his trial, he yesterday dropped his bankruptcy application - but found himself facing a fresh petition from his creditors. The creditors say Mr Walker has breached the individual voluntary arrangement (IVA) he reached with them last September to repay his debt without being declared bankrupt. The IVA had been agreed after a narrow vote in the face of opposition from the banks, who continued to argue for Mr Walker's bankruptcy. At a High Court hearing yesterday the supervisors of the IVA said the agreement had been breached because Mr Walker's wife, Jean, was not now intending to pay for civil litigation against Brent Walker. These actions might have increased the amount of money available to be repaid to creditors. Lawyers for the supervisors claimed that Mr Walker's solicitor had told them that Mrs Walker now intended to spend her money supporting her husband's defence for his criminal trial. Mr Walker's solicitor, Mr Michael Coleman, denies such a conversation took place. The bankruptcy petition was supported by two of Mr Walker's largest creditors - a group of banks led by the TSB, and the Inland Revenue, to whom Mr Walker owes Pounds 40m. Mr Martin Pascoe, for the banks, said Mr Walker was now seeking to escape from the conditions imposed by the IVA. Mr Robin Hollington, for Mr Walker, opposed the bankruptcy petition, saying it was a 'draconian' measure. The hearing was adjourned until April 2. Mr Walker had originally been refused legal aid for his trial because the Legal Aid Board ruled that his assets, although pledged to creditors through the IVA, were still technically his. A magistrate overruled this decision last week. If the bankruptcy order against Mr Walker was granted, he would become Britain's second-biggest bankrupt after Mr Kevin Maxwell, against whom claims exceeding Pounds 400m have been made.</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Le Creuset 8% lower at Pounds 1.1m Pre-tax profits at Le Creuset, the London-listed housewares manufacturer, fell by 8 per cent in the first half of 1994 as a result of 'weakness in the French barbeque market' and the strength of the French franc against the dollar and the pound. On turnover which grew by 10 per cent to Pounds 21.3m (Pounds 19.3m), pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.07m, against Pounds 1.16m. Mr Keith Divall, UK finance director, said that operating profits of Pounds 1.6m would have exceeded last time's Pounds 1.87m without the effect of the currency losses and the barbeque problems. With the French economy 'very quiet' in the first quarter - the barbeque buying season is from January to April - customers had been buying cheaper barbeques than the current Le Creuset models. Prices were sharply reduced, putting margins 'under severe pressure'. Mr Divall said Le Creuset wanted to gain market share, by having products at different price points, possibly in partnership with others. On the currency question, Mr Divall said the group's cost base was mostly in francs, as was 40 per cent of its income. Dollars and sterling accounted for 30 per cent each. He did not expect currency to have the same drastic effect over the full year, however. The story in the UK and the US was brighter with increased sales and 'very satisfactory' demand. Earnings advanced to 5p (4.8p) per share.</p>

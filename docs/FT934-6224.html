			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / EU eases terms for entrants: Prospects look brighter of meeting enlargement deadline The prospect of the European Union meeting its January 1995 deadline to bring in four new members brightened yesterday after the European Commission proposed significant concessions on regional policy and agriculture. The enlargement negotiations, begun last February, must be completed by March in time for Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway to put their proposed entry to referendum. All four countries' subsidy regimes for their remote or mountainous regions, and for Arctic and Alpine farming, are sensitive issues. On regional policy, the Commission agreed yesterday on a plan to offer each of the four applicants the highest level of structural aid - so-called Objective 1 status - for their remote and poorer regions. The strict definition of eligibility for Objective 1 aid, invented for backward regions like Andalusia in Spain or the poorest member states, Greece, Portugal and Ireland, is an average per capita income below 75 per cent of the EU average. Brussels wants to offer it to Burgenland, on Austria's Hungarian border; Finland's three eastern provinces, Lapland in northern Finland, and Kuusamo which is in between these two Finnish areas; the four northern counties of Norway; and Norrbotten, Sweden's northernmost province. All four applicants are richer than the 12 EU member states on average income, and all these regions are above - some well above - the Objective 1 income threshold. But when the 12 shared out the Ecu96bn (Dollars 109.4bn) Objective 1 pot in July, the intense horse-trading led to a relaxation of the rules. 'There were a lot of strands of new elastic to hold (regional policy) together for the 12,' a senior official said, and this flexibility is now being extended to the four. Similarly, rules for state aids in remote regions will probably be more flexible to take account of the huge distances in the Nordic applicant countries, and their concern to keep their inaccessible northern and border areas populated. On agriculture, the Commission yesterday moved towards a way of levelling out the big farm price support differences between the 12 and the Four. In previous enlargements, these differences were ironed out by border levies. Brussels yesterday decided, however, that there could be no retaining of borders because of the barrier-free Single Market. Instead, prices will be aligned from the moment of entry, and direct compensation will be paid to Nordic and Alpine farmers. The intention is that the applicants should pay for this compensation as their consumers and taxpayers do now. But officials acknowledge that in the end, the EU budget will have to bear part of this cost, especially as all four candidates will be net contributors.</p>

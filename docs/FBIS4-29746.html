			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- Five political forces in  the House of Councillors Monday [20 June] submitted a  suprapartisan bill that would add four seats to each of four  underrepresented constituencies while eliminating four seats  from three overrepresented electorates, officials said.    The five parties and parliamentary groups that tabled the  bill were the Liberal Democratic Party, the Social Democratic  Party [Social Democratic Party of Japan], Komeito [Clean  Government Party], the Shin Ryokufu Kai and the Niin Club. The  Shin Ryokufu Kai groups Shinseito, the Japan New Party, the  Democratic Socialist Party and the Democratic Reform Party.    The parties plan to push the bill through the upper  chamber's  ad hoc panel on political reform Tuesday and obtain approval  from the upper chamber's plenary session on Wednesday, the  officials said.    The bill, if legislated, would assuage the current imbalance  in voter representation in upper house constituencies by  obligating legislators to contest the next upper house election,  slated for the summer of 1995, under the revised appropriation  of seats, the officials said.    The bill envisages increasing by one the number of seats in  each of four underrepresented prefectures of Miyazaki, Saitama,  Kanagawa and Gifu, while taking away two seats from the  prefecture of Hokkaido and one seat each from the prefectures of  Hyogo and Fukuoka, they said.    The bill would also soften a legal requirement under which a  party or parliamentary group is empowered to field candidates in  the nationwide constituency of proportional representation.    Under the bill, all political parties or parliamentary  groups  that garnered more than 2 percent of total valid votes cast  nationwide in the most recent national election would be  eligible to field candidates under the proportional  representation formula, they said.    Currently, a political party or parliamentary group must  garner 4 percent of such votes to qualify.</p>

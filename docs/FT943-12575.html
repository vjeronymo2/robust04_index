			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Waigel says US economic conditions are right for dollar recovery Economic developments in the US had paved the way for the dollar to recover on foreign exchange markets after hitting postwar lows, Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Bonn. Mr Waigel also talked up the D-Mark, saying one of the key successes of the Bonn government in the past few years had been to been to guide the currency through unification without suffering excessively high inflation. Speaking on German radio, Mr Waigel dismissed fears that long-term interest rates in Europe were bound to follow rising long-term rates in the US. 'There is a certain decoupling and I could imagine that if developments in Germany continue - clear financial and anti-inflationary policies - then an even stronger decoupling from American interest rates is possible,' he said. Sending a clear signal to financial markets, Mr Waigel said the government was drafting tax reforms for the period after the October 16 elections. But he stressed that Bonn would not raise the federal deficit to finance tax cuts. 'Tax cuts which lead to higher federal and state budget deficits would have to be paid for with higher interest rates and negative consequences on capital markets,' he said. Changes in the tax structure would be aimed at lowering tax burdens for families, boosting exemptions for low wage earners and easing corporate taxes. Mr Waigel also said he favoured gradually phasing out the so-called solidarity tax - 7.5 per cent surcharge on income tax bills to help finance unification - once economic conditions permitted. Germany would also promote a European-wide withholding tax on interest earnings, but added that he did not expect EU ministers to reach agreement soon. 'It can hardly be expected that we will find a solution in the next half-year. But it is important to raise this issue,' he said.</p>

Next year we discover if they work. Our shares should act like those of a US biotechnology groups as the clinical trail results materialise. They'll either shoot up or plummet.' Research and development expenditure on new drugs was Pounds 8.7m compared with Pounds 7.7m last year. Income increased from Pounds 342,000 to Pounds 1.58m, mainly because an agreement with Glaxo worth Pounds 900,000 and an EC funded Aids programme worth Pounds 700,000.

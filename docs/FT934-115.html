			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Japanese feel the pinch with pleasure: The Book of Honest Poverty has sold over 600,000 copies Poverty has become a fashion industry in recession-hit Japan. The public's former fondness for electronic gadgets, garish clutter and designer clothes has switched to cheap practical goods and services, an end-of-year survey by Trendy, a consumer magazine, says. The hit products and ideas of the past 12 months include cheap men's suits - less than Y20,000 (Pounds 119.76) - and discount own-brands at Daiei, Japan's biggest cut-price supermarket chain. Others are direct clothes sales from factories, all-you-can-eat restaurants, and the book Seihin no Shiso (Concept of Honest Poverty), which sold more than 600,000 copies in its first 10 months. Import bargains from the yen's rise have done well, from cars to processed food. Trendy's listing is based on factors such as sales growth, novelty and consumer impact. Smaller recession successes, which failed to make it to the Trendy list, include a cut-price marriage service at Y300 (Pounds 1.79) per guest (booked up until next April) and sweet potato spirit, the cheapest non-lethal liquor available, and the only class of alcoholic drink to record extra sales this year. Pressure on wages and jobs is an obvious reason for the fad for cheapness. Yet Dentsu Institute for Human Studies, the research arm of Japan's largest advertising group, detects a deeper reaction against the materialism of recent years. 'As Japanese have satisfied most of their material needs, they will seek new spiritual tendencies, aesthetic values and philosophies,' the institute says. One such new tendency is the spectacular arrival early in the year of J-League, Japan's professional soccer league. The thrills of soccer have struck more than 4m ticket buyers to date, as an appealing contrast to the relative dignity of baseball and sumo wrestling. Since kick-off from zero early in the year, the J-League is estimated to have pulled in Y10bn of ticket revenues and generated at least Y30bn in sales of products bearing its logo. This marketing phenomenon extends to J-League pot noodles, chocolate and batteries. One balding league player has even agreed to advertise wigs on TV. Trendy quotes one estimate that the the multiplier effect of all this exceeds Y500bn. Materialism is still just about alive, perhaps helped by consumers' fondness for brand labels. But the J-League has also offered low-price entertainment at a time when budgets are tight. One formerly popular leisure industry, costly hostess bars, has fallen on hard times. Now, trend-conscious salarymen spend their evenings more cheaply, at the growing number of discos modelled on Juliana's in Tokyo, where scantily-clad 'bodycon' (body-conscious) girls used to wriggle on raised catwalks. Juliana's has sold more than 2m compact discs this year, according to Trendy, but has been so embarrassed by the publicity that it took down its catwalk. Too late. Bodycon girls' new style of dancing is catching on in regional towns.</p>

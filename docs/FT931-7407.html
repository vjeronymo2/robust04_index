			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: British farm land cheaper since devaluation UK AGRICULTURAL land prices are proving increasingly attractive to European buyers since the country left the ERM, according to Savills, the UK property consultants. Values have retreated by 15 per cent since September as far as foreign buyers are concerned. In sterling terms, prices are about a third below the peak of 1988-89. In its second annual European land report, Savills estimates that average high quality arable land in England and Wales is worth Pounds 2,000 an acre, compared with Pounds 2,700 an acre last year. This put them level pegging with France, where similar land last year was worth Pounds 1,400 an acre. French land has traditionally been cheaper than English, as there are 2.4 acres per head of population in France compared with 1 acre in the UK. Austrian land of similar quality is the most expensive in Savills' survey at Pounds 7,800 an acre, while Spanish is at the bottom of the scale at Pounds 1,000. Mr Justin Marking, director of Savills Europe, said yesterday that because of economic recession, European prices were no longer distorted by non-agricultural buyers. He estimated that European inquiries for UK farm land had risen this year by between 15 and 20 per cent.</p>

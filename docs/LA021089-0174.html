			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> QUAYLE LAUDS ISRAEL, BUT CHIDES IT FOR KILLING ARABS  </P> <P> Israel remains the most reliable U.S. ally in the world, but it must recognize  that the killing of Palestinian civilians in the strife-torn West Bank and Gaza  Strip is "clearly unacceptable," Vice President Dan Quayle told an American  Jewish group today.  </P> <P> The uprising by Palestinians in those regions "has resulted in nearly 400  Palestinians being killed and many more injured," Quayle told a conference of  the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith.  </P> <P> "Some may say that by the grisly standards of some of Israel's neighbors, a few  hundred people killed in the course of a yearlong uprising is not a very  staggering figure," he said.  </P> <P> But, he said, Israel should be judged not by those standards but "on the basis  of standards which prevail in the democratic West. And on the basis of these  standards the status quo on the West Bank and Gaza Strip is clearly  unacceptable."  </P> <P> On the other hand, Quayle said, the recent first-ever talks between  representatives of the United States and the Palestine Liberation Organization  do not indicate any fundamental change in attitude toward the PLO or its  leader, Yasser Arafat.  </P> <P> He reiterated the cautionary stance taken by officials in the Ronald Reagan  Administration who began the dialogue in the last days before President Bush  took office.  </P> <P> "Simple prudence obliges us to monitor Mr. Arafat and his organization very  carefully, and to probe his words very closely before arriving at a final  determination," Quayle said.  </P> <P> He added that while Arafat has recognized the state of Israel and renounced  terrorism, factions within the PLO hold opposing viewpoints.  </P></p>

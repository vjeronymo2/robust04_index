			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, March 4 (XINHUA) -- The Commission on Human  Rights of the United Nations today calls on the international  community to condemn those countries using unilateral mandatory  measures to put pressure on the developing countries.    A resolution, adopted by the commission at its 50th meeting,  said that all countries should refrain from taking any  unilateral mandatory measures that run counter to the  international laws and the U.N. Charter.    Such measures not only impede trade among countries, but  also  hinder the full realization of the rights specified in the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights, said the resolution  proposed by Cuba, China, Ghana and the Sudan.    The commission condemns some countries for using their  economic supremacy and continuing to take unilateral mandatory  measures, such as trade sanction, blockade, embargo and asset  freezing, to prevent the developing countries from exercising  their rights to establish their political, economic and social  systems and expand international trade.    The resolution, adopted by 23 votes in favor and 18 against,  was supported mostly by the developing countries and opposed by  the United States and other Western developed countries.</p>

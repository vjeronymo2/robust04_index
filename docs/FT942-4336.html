			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Tory bastion looking vulnerable: Roland Adburgham hears much anti-government sentiment in the Devon and East Plymouth seat 'I'm sick and tired of this government and so are a lot of people,' said Mr Paul Murray, leaving a polling station yesterday in the market town of Cullompton in Devon. 'It's no longer a caring government. I've voted Tory before but I'm determined to get them out.' Cullompton is in the European constituency of Devon and East Plymouth, which should be a Tory bastion. The Conservatives had a majority of 57,000 at the last election in 1989 with nearly 50 per cent of the vote. But it is now a seat which the party will be highly relieved to hold against the Liberal Democrat challenge. Polls show that while the seat is not the easiest for the Liberal Democrats to win, it is within their grasp. All the parties agreed yesterday, however, that the result was uncertain. Mr Tony Kirk, the said Labour agent, said: 'It is extremely open - anyone could win it.' The turnout was seen as crucial. In the 1989 election it was 40 per cent and at the polling stations yesterday, in spite of the sunshine, there was little indication it would be higher. One official said: 'It's only so-so.' Mr Julian Walden, the Conservative agent, said: 'Apathy will win the day. But we've never worked as hard to maximise our vote.' The Tory MEP was Lord O'Hagan, but he stood down and was replaced by Mr Giles Chichester, a map publisher and son of Sir Francis Chichester, the yachtsman. Mr Walden said: 'He is a character, and Devon likes characters.' But the rival parties say that, on the doorstep, the striking factor was the number of disaffected Tory voters. Mr Paul Edwards, the Green party candidate, said: 'The overwhelming impression is there are many Tories determined to send a message to the government by voting against it.' In 1989 his party came second to the Tories in the constituency, with almost a quarter of the vote. Mr Edwards was reconciled to a lower vote this time. Much of the green vote is assumed to have gone to the Liberal Democrats, who in 1989 won only 10 per cent of the vote, trailing Labour which had 18 per cent. The Liberal Democrats are riding high after winning effective control of Devon county council last year but the party accepts victory is by no means certain. One reason has been a local difficulty. Its candidate, Mr Adrian Sanders, faced opposition from a Liberal candidate and a Literal Democrat candidate. Mr Nick Rijke, the campaign manager, reported an 'enormous' number of calls to the campaign headquarters in Crediton from confused voters yesterday. By early evening he felt more confident: 'The indications are looking good.' The main issues raised on the doorstep, he said, had been high water charges in the south-west, health, and rising crime in the county. European issues had featured on specific matters such as the transport of live animals. 'People vote on a feel-good factor,' he said. 'But people have a feel-bad factor about the government.' Out in the lush Devon countryside his party won the poster battle. The Tories complained that some of their posters were torn down. This, and a failed legal attempt by the Liberal Democrats to block the Literal Democrat candidate, have been the main excitements in a campaign subdued, as elsewhere, by the death of John Smith, the Labour leader. Labour believes it has a genuine chance in the constituency, helped by boundary changes which have included east Plymouth and excluded north Devon. Mr Kirk said: 'We've had a tremendous response on the doorstep - it's surprised even us.' Ms Linda Gilroy, the party's candidate, said: 'I started by thinking that it was a seat where we had no chance, but after the last three weeks anything is possible.' At the Tory campaign headquarters in Exeter Mr Walden agreed Labour had fought an active campaign. While reconciled to losing some votes, he said: 'People have begun to focus more and more on European issues. Our supporters who drifted away from us have started to drift back. The longer the campaign has gone on, the better it has been for us.' Mr Walden was optimistic that people would vote for the candidate who would best represent their views in the European parliament, rather than using the election as a referendum on the government. He said: 'There is a general feeling that the Tories have been in power for 15 years and some people would like a change.' Yet, he believed, 'having been behind in the opinion polls, it now seems to be swinging back to us at the eleventh hour'. His confidence was perhaps misplaced. A woman chaining up her bicycle at an Exeter polling station, said when asked how would she vote: 'Certainly not for the Tories.'</p>

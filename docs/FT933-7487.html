			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Finland plans further spending cuts THE Finnish government yesterday proposed a further FM10bn in spending cuts next year as part of a continuing austerity drive to reduce the country's budget deficit, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. The cuts, which amount to 2 per cent of gross domestic product, reflect the continued recession in the Finnish economy, which is expected to shrink by 2.5 per cent this year, its third consecutive year of decline. Expenditure is to be held at FM188bn (Pounds 21bn) in 1994 in line with the government's commitment to keep spending in real terms at 1991 levels. To meet this target, it is proposing a sharp cut in government transfers to local authorities, a tightening of unemployment benefit rules, no increase in social security and pension payments, and a 6.5 per cent reduction in the government sector wage bill. The government says its main priorities are to tackle unemployment, which now exceeds 20 per cent of the workforce, and create conditions for sustained growth in the economy. Many of its problems stem from the increase in unemployment, which has reduced tax revenues.</p>

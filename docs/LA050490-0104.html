			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WHO REALLY PAYS INSURANCE CLAIMS?  </P> <P> In reading the article regarding the lawsuit filed by Linda Hodges against  Curtis Cooper, his mother, Crystal Cooper, and their landlady, Olga Kaczmar, in  connection with the death of Sara Nan Hodges, I was appalled at Hodges'  statement: "I wouldn't ever take a cent from Olga personally.  </P> <P> I was told it wouldn't hurt anybody but the insurance company." Who does she  think pays the premiums so the insurance company can pay claims? I resent that  my premiums will have to pay to defend such a lawsuit. I feel our society has  come to a poor pass when lawsuits such as this are filed with the expectation  that insurance will take care of it.  </P> <P> ROZANNE B.

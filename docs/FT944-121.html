			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Creditors condemn ring-fencing - Jim Kelly wonders whether Pentos' action will change the law The decision by Pentos, the specialist retail group, to force its UK subsidiary Athena Holdings into receivership with up to Pounds 15m owed to creditors has produced a widespread sense of anger. One creditor, claiming to be owed Pounds 60,000, said: 'To ring-fence a bit of a business like this is morally reprehensible.' The situation has not been helped by Pentos' own admission on the state of its subsidiary. 'We couldn't give it away,' said the chief executive. Pentos is forcing the subsidiary out of business because it believes that the estimated Pounds 9m to Pounds 12m needed to make it break even is better spent elsewhere in the group. Creditors, one of whom claimed he had been asked to provide supplies worth more than Pounds 25,000 days before Athena collapsed, have threatened legal action. However, whether or not they have a case is arguable. British law does not require a parent company to bail out a subsidiary. 'Each company stands alone,' says Mr Malcolm Fillmore, an insolvency practitioner with the Paul Peters Partnership: 'There is nothing in the law which says that a group has to stand behind you. There is no requirement to back it at all costs. Legally you would be fooling yourself - unless you get a guarantee or warranty from the holding company.' The lack of legal redress for creditors has prompted attempts at reform for more than 15 years. During the passage of the 1986 Insolvency Act, a prohibition on the practice was discussed. It was suggested that subsidiaries which trade as part of a group should have the guaranteed backing of the whole group. The idea never made the statute book. A European Directive on the issue also foundered. The broad issue has never been tested in court, according to Mr Fillmore, 'but the conventional wisdom is that it would not succeed'. Even so, the action taken by Pentos is not common in the UK. 'I have been involved in many major public companies which had unviable subsidiaries,' says Mr Fillmore. 'In almost every case they closed them down and paid off the third party creditors and wound up the wreckage - primarily for goodwill purposes.' But it does happen. In 1991 Courtney Pope (Holdings), the shop-fitting and engineering group, asked its banks to appoint receivers at six subsidiaries in an attempt to rescue the good companies in the group from those responsible for its losses and most of its debt. Trade creditors were not pleased. But they were better placed than the shareholders of British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings, the financial services group which tried to save itself after putting its Atlantic Computers leasing subsidiary into administration. After six weeks of frantic salvage efforts, it was the withdrawal of support from BC Merchant Bank that finally sent the parent down the same road as its subsidiary. The practice of ring-fencing is rare for four main reasons. Loss of goodwill: at the time of the Courtney Pope case one insolvency expert said that allowing a subsidiary to collapse should only occur 'under circumstances that are pretty dire and when the parent company is in a position where its reputation is no longer valuable. For instance, companies with a substantial credit rating would not let a subsidiary go because of the damage to that rating.' Goodwill is at the heart of most companies' reluctance to set an insolvent subsidiary adrift. Ring-fencing a subsidiary sends out distressing signals to investors and creditors. Creditors may seek broad financial guarantees from the group. 'It leaves a nasty taste in the mouths of creditors who think they are trading with a group of substance,' says Mr Fillmore. Legal risks: Pentos insists that it has followed strict legal advice throughout its problems with Athena. It is understood that the holding company was hopeful of finding a buyer as late as the beginning of December. However, if the directors of a subsidiary did not have financial guarantees from its holding company, and continued to trade despite being insolvent, they could be deemed to have been reckless and face court action from creditors. In contrast, a holding company could face action if a binding contract, which could be oral, was made with the directors of its subsidiary to provide financial assistance. In such a case the receivers could pursue the holding company on behalf of the creditors. Corporate structure: groups divided into divisions are not able to take the course followed by Pentos, which is divided into subsidiaries. Financial guarantees: many suppliers and investors in subsidiaries have their exposure to loss covered by agreements with the holding company. Such a network of guarantees means the course followed by Pentos would make little sense as these debts would still have to be met. In Pentos' case such guarantees are not thought to be large. The anger prompted by this latest example of ring-fencing an insolvent subsidiary is understandable and may well bring about a public debate on the issue. Only time will tell if the heat generated on this occasion is enough to change the law.</p>

			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHILD MOLESTER SENTENCED TO 24 YEARS IN STATE PRISON  </P> <P> After an unusual hearing in which both the prosecutor and defense attorney of a  man convicted of child molestation were sworn in as witnesses, a judge  sentenced the man to 24 years in state prison.  </P> <P> The lengthy term went to Robert (Oink) Wardell, 43, of Ramona. The 300-pound  Wardell, whose health problems confine him to a wheelchair, showed no reaction  to the sentence.  </P> <P> Wardell had sought to withdraw his July 14, 1987, guilty plea to 10 counts of  molesting five girls ranging in age from 9 to 13 while he baby-sat them. He had  claimed that the district attorney's office had promised his sentence would be  reduced by 12 years if he testified against the girls' parents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Put Under Oath  </P> <P> At least one of the fathers is a member of the Hell's Angels, and has put out a  contract on Wardell's life, Wardell's attorney, David Florance, said.  </P> <P> But Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Eichler, who has prosecuted the case since  Wardell's arrest in November, 1986, was put under oath and told San Diego  Superior Court Judge Terry O'Rourke that he never met with Wardell and knew of  no one who had from the district attorney's office.  </P> <P> Wardell testified that he met with two district attorney investigators, whose  names he did not know, and that they agreed his sentence would be reduced if he  testified against the parents.  </P> <P> The judge questioned Wardell about why he signed a form saying he had not  received any promises of any reduction or been induced to make the guilty plea.  </P> <P> Wardell replied that he didn't think it was necessary for him to describe in  court the investigators' alleged promises.  </P> <P> An angry O'Rourke suggested to Florance that he had a conflict of interest,  since he was a witness to what his client understood or knew when he entered  his plea.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Attorney From Audience  </P> <P> Florance agreed to step aside for the motion and the judge summoned another  defense attorney, Hodge Crabtree, who was sitting in the audience on another  case, to step forward and represent Wardell in the motion.  </P> <P> Crabtree initially protested, but later met privately with Wardell and Florance  and agreed to represent Wardell.  </P> <P> When they returned, Florance was sworn in as a witness and testified that  Wardell had not told him about the alleged promises from the investigators.  </P> <P> Eichler told the judge it would have been "highly improper" for the  investigators to talk to Wardell without his lawyer present. He also said there  was "never any consideration to prosecute the victims' parents. . . ."  </P> <P> "Mr. Wardell has committed perjury today," the judge said in denying the motion  to withdraw the plea.  </P> <P> Wardell was given the maximum 24-year sentence, and the judge ordered that his  10-year federal prison term on a kidnaping charge of one of the victims be made  to run consecutively.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOORPARK;  </P> <P> MAYOR PEREZ BACKS DAVIS FOR SUPERVISOR  </P> <P> Moorpark Mayor Bernardo Perez on Monday announced his support of Simi Valley  City Councilman Bill Davis for 4th District supervisor.  </P> <P> Perez said there were several factors considered in his decision to endorse  Davis over his opponent and council colleague, Vicky Howard, in the Nov. 6  election.  </P> <P> Perez said that because Davis at one time operated an electronics business in  Moorpark, he "knows firsthand about our community problems."  </P> <P> Perez said he was also impressed that Davis played an instrumental role in  getting a measure passed by Simi Valley voters in June that gives more priority  to developers who plan to build affordable housing for low-income seniors.  </P> <P> He said Davis' stated commitment to provide trained paramedics at Ventura  County fire stations in Moorpark and Simi Valley was another consideration in  his decision to endorse the candidate. Residents of both cities have repeatedly  complained of slow response time by Pruner Ambulance Service, the east county's  only private ambulance service.  </P> <P> "I am just extremely happy," Davis said of Perez's support.  </P> <P> Davis has also been endorsed by the Ventura County Professional Firefighters'  Assn. and the Public Employees Assn. of Ventura County.  </P> <P> Howard is backed by Ventura County Sheriff John Gillespie, Dist. Atty. Michael  D. Bradbury and the Deputy Sheriffs' Assn.  </P> <P> The 4th District includes Moorpark, Simi Valley, Somis and the Santa Clara  Valley. CARLOS V. LOZANO  </P></p>

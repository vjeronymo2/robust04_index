			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Italian leaders fail to agree on new PM PROSPECTS for quick agreement on the formation of Italy's 51st post-war government faded yesterday when it was announced that President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro would need more consultations with political leaders. Mr Scalfaro began consultations last Thursday, hoping to be in a position to ask someone to form a government by the end of this week. However, he has found the parties in an unprecedented state of disarray, with none of their leaders offering mutually acceptable guidelines. The president has to nominate a politician capable of mustering a majority in the fragmented legislature left by the April 5 elections. The field of potential candidates for the premiership remains wide open. The most controversial choice tested by the new president was that of Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader. Mr Craxi was prime minister from 1983-87 and is recognised as a skilful politician. With his image seriously damaged by his known friendship with key figures in the Milan corruption scandal, all the parties were cool about the idea of Mr Craxi leading the next government - including his supposed allies, the Christian Democrats. The two parties fought the April elections on the same platform, proposing a renewal of the outgoing coalition with their minor allies, the Liberals and Social Democrats. Mr Craxi still believes this coalition possible on the basis of a narrow parliamentary majority with 48 per cent of the vote. The Christian Democrats are less than enthusiastic and sufficient numbers of the party are willing to sabotage such a deal if attempted. As demonstrated in the recent parliamentary vote for the new president, broad alliances have to be sought looking beyond the outgoing four-party coalition. The next government to be credible requires broad-based support.</p>

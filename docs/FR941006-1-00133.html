			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA also tentatively concludes that the label must state:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``If a child accidentally swallows this product, call a doctor or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a poison control center immediately.'' FDA agrees with the NDMA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petition that treatment-oriented information should be included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the label because it informs attending persons in a poisoning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incident of the need to take immediate action that could save the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> child's life and about what that action should be. Thus, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relates directly to the consequences of use of the product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA does not believe that the warning statement should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based upon or contain information relating to the potency of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron product (i.e., different statements for products above and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below 30 mg per dosage unit as requested by the AG petition, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference to ``large doses'' of iron as a factor in determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether poisoning may occur). The agency tentatively finds that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such statements could cause members of the public to attempt to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine whether a large dose has been taken in a possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poisoning incident. Because most people are not capable of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining what dosage of iron may be nontoxic, toxic, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capable of causing serious harm or death, qualified medical or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poison control personnel should determine the significance of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dose a child has ingested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nor does there appear to be any reason to require that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement include reference to the specific types of consequences  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that may arise from acute overdosage, i.e., nausea, vomiting,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cardiovascular collapse, as requested by the AG petition. FDA does not believe that this information would materially add to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the label statement that overdose can cause harm or death, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fears that it may lead to the erroneous conclusion that, because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a child does not exhibit one of the listed symptoms, the child is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not in danger.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> How should the warning appear on the label?  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA agrees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the AGs' contention that the warning statement should appear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prominently on the label of iron-containing products to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectively convey its message. Further, the act specifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires, in sections 403(f) and 502(c), that information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to appear on the label of a food or a drug be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prominently placed and appear with such conspicuousness, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compared with other printed matter, as to render it likely to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> read by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the AG petition provided no evidence to support the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific presentation elements that it requested for the warning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement, i.e., that it be boxed, in boldface type, and in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> color that contrasts with the background and with other printed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material on the label or labeling. The agency is not aware of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any basis on which it can conclude that any of these specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elements are necessary to ensure that the statement appears on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the label in a prominent and conspicuous manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, in the agency's rulemaking that mandated warning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statements on certain protein products, the agency decided not to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mandate specific requirements for letter size and other format  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elements. However, the agency did require that the warning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement appear ``prominently and conspicuously on the principal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> display panel of the package label'' (21 CFR 101.17). FDA made a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination to give manufacturers flexibility to design their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> own label warning formats, while ensuring that the statement is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prominent and conspicuous, so that consumers are given adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice of the information contained in the warning (47 FR 25379  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at 25382, June 11, 1982). In addressing the placement of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> label warning, the agency noted that the seriousness and nature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the risk associated with the use of protein products in very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> low calorie diets was sufficient to require placement of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warning statement on the principal display panel (49 FR 13679 at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13689).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 201(k) of the act defines the term ``label'' as ``a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> display of written, printed, or graphic matter upon the immediate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> container of any article'' and further states that a requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``that any word, statement, or other information appear on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> label shall not be considered to be complied with unless such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> word, statement, or other information also appears on the outside  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> container or wrapper if any there be, of the retail package of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such article&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*.'' Thus, if FDA requires a label warning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement to appear on the immediate container of iron-containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products, it would also have to appear on the retail package of such a product if that package is not the immediate container.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated above, the fact that iron-containing products have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulted in reports of 2,000 poisonings in children over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 7 years provides evidence that many adults are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aware of the potential for serious harm posed by iron-containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products. Based on this fact, FDA tentatively finds that there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are sufficient grounds to require that the label warning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement be printed directly on the immediate container of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product, i.e., the container that holds the tablet or capsule,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and on the principal display panel of the retail package, i.e.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an outer box, if such package is not the immediate container  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (many iron-containing products are packaged in this manner). If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a product is sold in unit-dose packaging, this requirement will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mean that the product will have to bear the warning directly on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each unit-dose package or on a strip of unit-dose packages in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such a way that separating the unit dose packages would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destroy the warning labeling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

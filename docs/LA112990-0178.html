			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS' PURSUIT OF RIGHETTI DEPENDS ON LENGTH OF DEAL  </P> <P> Despite their preference to avoid the free-agent market, the Angels could  become a serious suitor for the services of left-handed reliever Dave Righetti,  who has spent all of his nine-plus major league seasons with the New York  Yankees.  </P> <P> Whether the Angels pursue the San Jose native apparently hinges on whether he  insists on a five-year contract.  </P> <P> The Angels have said they are reluctant to sign pitchers for more than three  years, a sentiment that also has been expressed by the Dodgers, and might keep  them from signing Righetti.  </P> <P> Righetti's agent, Bill Goodstein, said Wednesday he has had "continuing" talks  in recent weeks with Angel General Manager Mike Port and Senior Vice President  Dan O'Brien, who handles the club's contract negotiations. According to  Goodstein, the Angels' intentions are earnest.  </P> <P> "It's very hard to assess degrees of interest since you have lots of  conversations with lots of teams," Goodstein said from New York. "But I would  say the Angels clearly have reasonable interest. His wife, Kandice, is from  Orange County, and he's from California. We think the Angels have a very good  team and will be a contending team, and that's a factor I know interests  David."  </P> <P> However, the desire for a long-term contract is a complication. Goodstein said  he would prefer a five-year deal but would settle for a "solid" four-year  contract. Righetti made $1.55 million in 1990.  </P> <P> Asked whether Righetti was worth pursuing, O'Brien said, "At a very slow and  well-informed pace."  </P> <P> Righetti, who turned 32 Wednesday, had 36 saves in 39 opportunities last  season. His 224 career saves is the most by a left-hander and seventh on the  all-time list.  </P></p>

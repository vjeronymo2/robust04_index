			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Gilt complex The Bank of England must have its fingers crossed that today's gilts auction will go well. Not only is it the largest ever at Pounds 3bn; it is also the first of the more frequent auctions promised since the Budget. Having chosen to sell 20-year paper the Bank is reasonably certain of a respectable outcome. Since the auction was announced, prices of such paper have fallen by around 2 points. That will increase the auction's appeal to domestic institutions which show signs of wanting to switch into longer-dated holdings. But one successful auction will not solve the funding problem, especially since it is unclear how much new money it will attract. Ideally any shorter-dated paper sold by institutions to make room for the auction stock should quickly be bought by others: foreign investors are traditional buyers of 10-year paper, banks of short-dated gilts. An important test of demand will be the ease with which this mopping up is accomplished. There is room for doubt. Dwindling hopes of lower base rates have eroded the attraction of short-dated gilts. The relative strength of sterling leaves foreigners suspicious. Overseas investors have been heavy buyers of Euro-sterling issues recently, but these bonds habitually carry a substantial premium to gilts. At DM2.42 sterling has only limited room to appreciate, which makes gilts less attractive at current yields. With today's auction the government has avoided confronting this problem head on. It cannot do so indefinitely.</p>

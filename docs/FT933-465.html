			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Tory councils block tendering drive CONSERVATIVE-controlled local authorities have taken the lead in thwarting the government's compulsory competitive tendering programme, a survey revealed yesterday. They are doing so using the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations 1981. Where Tupe applies, a successful bidder must take over the workforce on the existing terms and conditions. Of councils which have tendered contracts stating that Tupe applies, 36 per cent were Conservative, while only 26 per cent were Labour-controlled and 5 per cent were held by the Liberal Democrats. The survey of 50 contractors by the Clause 26 lobby group showed deep disquiet with the government's response to the Tupe issue - 97 per cent labelled it unsatisfactory. Almost half (45 per cent) would not have entered the market in local authority services in 1988 had they known that Tupe would be an issue. Mr Cliff Davis-Coleman, director of Clause 26, said that Conservative authorities' reaction was due to the Department of the Environment's 'confused legal position'. He added that this had been worsened by Monday's consultative paper. Under the proposed guidelines, if a local authority has legal advice that Tupe applies but the bid assumes that it does not, the contractor should be invited to reconsider the bid. If the contractor refuses to revise a bid, the authority can reject it even if it is the cheapest. Mr Davis-Coleman said this means that 'only a lawyer employed by a local authority can determine whether Tupe applies'.</p>

The letter was passed over today by  presidential adviser Georgiy Satarov.    The letter says the deputies used the notion of "political  amnesty" instead of the "pardon" term. Referring to the  presidential message, Boris Yeltsin also reminded the speaker  that civil reconciliation does not mean all-forgiveness and  clemency should not run counter to the law and morals.    The president offered deputies of the lower parliament  chamber to improve the resolution and bring it in correspondence  with the constitutional norms. Yeltsin also considers it  necessary to elaborate a criterion of politicians'  responsibility for their decisions, says the letter.</p>

			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news Monday: Monthly mortgage lending figures, released by the British Bankers' Association, will be watched for signs of the strength of the UK housing market. Wednesday: The Bank of England will hold a Pounds 2.5bn auction of floating rate gilts, the first floating rate issue since the 1970s. Banks and building societies are expected to be the main buyers. The monthly monetary report, published to coincide with the meeting of the governor of the Bank and the chancellor of the exchequer, is largely a compendium of statistics. Nevertheless, it will be scrutinised for hints of future interest rate policy. Thursday: Italian inflation figures, which could be published today, are expected to show an annual rise in the year to March of 4.2 per cent, unchanged from the February rate. Friday: Although most markets will be closed, analysts will be watching for details of US non-farm payrolls in March. Improved weather is expected to have boosted the construction industry in March, helping payrolls to rise by 230,000. Some analysts feel, however, that February's 217,000 jump in payrolls could be revised down.</p>

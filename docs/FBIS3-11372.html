			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Havana, 15 Mar (PL) -- An unexpected summit of the  Anglo-Caribbean community Caricom [Caribbean Common Market] held  this weekend clearly established the Antillean countries' hope  of joining the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),  either as a bloc or separately.    The meeting, held on Saturday and Sunday in Kingston,  capital  of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and attended by 13 Caricom  heads of state, focused its attention on ways to join the  Canadian, U.S., and Mexican trade agreement.    For more than a year, Caricom has studied possible ways of  joining NAFTA and also ways to keep the old Caribbean Basin  Initiative (CBI) privileges sponsored by former President Ronald  Reagan's administration in the 1980's.    CBI accorded certain Caribbean and Central American products  tax free access to the U.S. market. The 12-year deadline  stipulated by the CBI for its implementation, however, is about  to end and the benefits are threatened by the competition of  similar products manufactured in Mexico, a NAFTA partner.    The Kingston summit reached two conclusions. First, to  officially ask U.S. Trade representative Mickey Kantor to report  on Caricom's ability to join NAFTA, and second, to give Trinidad  and Tobago and Jamaica the green light to negotiate their  independent admission to the NAFTA.    The latter conclusion, which seems to be the result of an  aggressive campaign by U.S. Ambassador in Trinidad Sally Cowall,  somehow contradicts the group spirit which has prevailed in  Caricom negotiations with the world since its creation in 1973.    The regional integration organization, although criticized  for the slow implementation of its financial and commercial  decisions, still maintains an unfailing unity among its members,  and it has been the strength behind the Association of Caribbean  States (CSA), whose constitution will begin to be drafted on  Wednesday in Jamaica by a group of experts from the 38 potential  members.    The special summit, just two days before the Kingston  meeting, seems to indicate there are still unexplored areas in  Caricom's plans for a mechanism that will tie their fragile  insular economies to those of other more developed Caribbean  countries, like Cuba, and the so-called medium Latin American  powers like Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia.    The Caribbean people are truly facing a situation akin to  panic given the danger of losing CBI benefits; Latin American  banana producers' questions concerning their advantages --  earned through their colonial heritage -- in the British market;  and the real threat of NAFTA, which will significantly undermine  access of their products to the United States.    Nevertheless, history has shown the spirit of integration  which prevails among the small Anglo-Antillean islands is deeply  rooted and their leaders' unyielding resistance to Washington's  pressure to exclude Cuba from the future CSA proves it.    The future organization, designed to coordinate  intergovernment cooperation in trade, culture, education, and  ecology, and to sponsor a future market among its members,  should include 38 countries from the Caribbean insular, basin,  and coastal areas with different degrees of development and  political tendencies.    Stages of the project include preparing the constitution,  which will be handled by experts gathered in Jamaica between 16  and 18 March; the foreign ministers approving it while in  Mexico; and the heads of state and government, who will formally  comprise the CSA, signing it at the Caricom summit in July in  Barbados.    Either way, NAFTA looms over any trade negotiation started  by  the CSA because it involves one of the member states -- Mexico  -- and it significantly affects the other members.    Whether Caricom manages to join NAFTA as a group or Jamaica  and Trinidad forge ahead on their own is still being studied,  and that decision will surely set the prevailing trend in future  trade negotiations between the CSA and the United States, which  always prefers to negotiate bilaterally with the Caribbean  people given the saying, "divide and conquer."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow May 5 TASS -- [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic  correspondents Boris Krivoshey and Aleksandr Krylovich]    [Text] Russia intends to continue the moratorium on nuclear  explosions with the aim of securing favorable conditions and  political support for conducting multilateral talks on working  out a treaty on the comprehensive nuclear test ban, Russian  Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigoriy Karasin told a briefing here  today.    Commenting on the second round of these talks due to begin  within the framework of the disarmament conference in Geneva on  May 16, Grigoriy Karasin stressed that the treaty to be worked  out was not only a means for the strengthening of the nuclear  non-proliferation regime but also the important step towards the  furtherance of strategic stability.    The Russian side regards work on this treaty as a "priority  direction in the activities of the disarmament conference in  1994", the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman told journalists.    According to Grigoriy Karasin, at the forthcoming meeting  Russia will seek to "intensify multilateral talks with the aim  of preparing a treaty, possibly by the spring of 1995 which  would considerably promote the success of the oncoming  conference devoted to the prolongation of the Nuclear  Non-proliferation Treaty scheduled for this period".</p>

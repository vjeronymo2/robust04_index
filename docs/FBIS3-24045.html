Saltenis, new chief editor of LIETUVOS </F> AIDAS, by Kestutis Simonavicius; place and date not given: "`I  Ended Up Here Very Unexpectedly', Says Seimas Member Who Has  Become the New Head of LIETUVOS AIDAS"]    [Text] LIETUVOS RYTAS has already written about the changes  on the LIETUVOS AIDAS editorial staff and has published an  interview with S. Stoma, who was recently released from his  duties as chief editor of that daily newspaper. Today we present  an interview with S. Saltenis, the new chief editor of LIETUVOS  AIDAS.    [Simonavicius] Will LIETUVOS AIDAS change now that there is  a  new chief editor?    [Saltenis] You'll be able to judge by reading LIETUVOS  AIDAS.  However, there is no doubt that when a director comes to a  theater, he imbues it with his own guidelines and his own  character.    Those who know me, my views, and my manner can easily  imagine  what the newspaper will be like. I view the newspaper as a  certain component part of culture and of our collective creative  work, and will without doubt try to ensure that the newspaper  comprises an aspect of culture. I dream about a newspaper which  contains information, information, and more information, and in  which commentary appears separately and only after the  information has been presented.    [Simonavicius] Will there be a turnover in the ranks of  journalists at LIETUVOS AIDAS now that you have become the chief  editor?    [Saltenis] I really am a vegetarian, not a cannibal. I have  always said and still say that I can work with anyone, because  each person has creativity. This is something I know back from  my days in the Young People's Theater.    There are times when it seems as if an actor is downtrodden,  doesn't accomplish anything or display anything for 10 years;  however, one has to have the ability to unlock him, to somehow  awaken him, to find a place, topic, part for him.    This is why I think that the composition of the editorial  staff might change only in the event that some people are simply  not working, or forbid the thought, undertake to harm the  newspaper on purpose. However, I do not believe that this will  be the case.    [Simonavicius] A few years ago, you and S. Stoma were the  founders of SIUARES ATENAI and worked together there. How did it  come about that you are now replacing S. Stoma?    [Saltenis] Perhaps it is fate. I never thought or knew that  S. Stoma was like that, just as I also was not acquainted with  A. Juozaitis, who was also among the founders of SIAURES ATENAI.    [Simonavicius] The former editor maintained that the  Conservative Party was involved in his dismissal. Can you  confirm or deny this?    [Saltenis] I cannot. I also have no intention of concealing  that I am a member and a founder of the Fatherland  Union-Conservative Party. However, it would be stupid of me--and  it would also harm the newspaper and Lithuania's press as a  whole--if I envisioned LIETUVOS AIDAS as a party newspaper.    [Simonavicius] S. Stoma has indicated that SIAURES ATENAI  was  an unprofitable newspaper, but he managed to buy $60,000 worth  of LIETUVOS AIDAS shares.    [Saltenis] It would be great if SIAURES ATENAI would have  that much money and could support other newspapers. However,  SIAURES ATENAI is an unprofitable newspaper and stays on its  feet thanks to donations and supporters. S. Stoma is apparently  a fine economist and businessman, but such things are of little  interest to me.    S. Saltenis will channel all the money received from various  existing and future funds supporting the democratic press into  LIETUVOS AIDAS, and will not take one cent of this amount. S.  Saltenis will truly not cost LIETUVOS AIDAS a cent, because he  will work without salary, as he has also worked up to now at  SIAURES ATENAI.    [Simonavicius] All this notwithstanding, where did you get  the money to buy LIETUVOS AIDAS shares?    [Saltenis] There is no money yet, there are only supporters.    [Simonavicius] Can you specifically name those supporters?    [Saltenis] I will be able to say more precisely later, when  these matters are settled. I am not taking care of this  personally. However, the money will not be deposited for the  purpose of making a profit on it; the money will stay in  LIETUVOS AIDAS.    [Simonavicius] How will you coordinate the responsibilities  you have as a member of Seimas, as a member of the board of a  private company, and as a newspaper editor? Doesn't this  conflict with the Constitution?    [Saltenis] There are, I believe, a number of Seimas members  who head companies, firms, and newspapers. This question had not  occurred to anyone up to now, because those members of Seimas  belonged to the governing majority. However, if the type of  problem to which you refer were to emerge, there would be a  variety of ways to go about solving it, about which I would  gladly inform you.    I ended up here very unexpectedly and these are very  difficult days for me now. A lot of psychological preparation  has to go into something like this, and that is a great  hardship, one which I wouldn't wish on anyone.</p>

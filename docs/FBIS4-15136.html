			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Apr 06, BNS -- The Russian delegation at  talks with Estonia today announced that Russia won't withdraw  troops by Aug. 31, 1994, the Estonian Foreign Ministry says in a  statement issued after the ending of the 18th round of  negotiations between the two countries in Moscow today.    Russia officially withdrew the article in the draft agenda  on  troop withdrawal that set Aug. 31 as deadline for the pullout.    The Estonian Foreign Ministry says that because of Russia's  position, the talks by now have fallen back to the situation  that existed before last August when Russia first said it will  pull out its forces by next Aug. 31.    Estonia's chief negotiator Vaino Reinart told reporters that  Russia at the latest round of talks had set ultimative demands.  Also the statement by the Estonian Foreign Ministry terms the  "manner and tone" of the Russian delegation at the past round  as ultimative.    "This gives proof of the positions of the Russian side  having  become more rigid," the statement reads.    The Aug. 31 deadline was first disputed by Russia's chief  negotiator Vasily Svirin at the 17th round of the talks in  March, when Svirin said the deadline was "no longer actual." In  the latest step, the Russian delegation at the Moscow round on  Tuesday [5 April] set a demand for Estonia to change its laws  and give all retired Russian military living in the country  permanent residence permits, regardless of whether their staying  in Estonia in legal or not. Russia also again took up its  earlier demand that Estonia must pay 23 million USD to build  houses for the repatriated military in Russia.    Russian representatives today said their country was ready  to  withdraw troops if Estonia, as they put it, will resolve the  issue of residence permits for the retired military and of  ensuring their social security.    Both heads of delegations at a press conference today said  the parties had failed to reach any "constructive cooperation"  at this round of the talks. Russia's Vasily Svirin reminded  that not a single draft document under discussion has been  initialed during the four latest rounds of the talks.    The Estonian Foreign Ministry in its Tuesday's statement  pointed out that a number of foreign countries and international  bodies, including NATO, the European Union, CSCE, the Nordic  prime ministers, and the United States, after the March round of  Estonian- Russian talks publicly expressed their support for  Estonia and suggested that Russia withdrew its troops by Aug.  31 this year.    Reinart said Russia's demands to grant permanent residence  permits to all its retired military in Estonia, a step that  needs changing Estonian legislation, was in contradiction with  resolutions by international organizations that press for a  speedy, orderly and unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops  from the Baltics.    The head of the Estonian delegation explained to BNS that a  big number of the retired Russian military in Estonia were quite  young and that many of them also had served in the Soviet  military intelligence, KGB, or special task force units.  Therefore, he said, some of the military pensioners are a  jeopardy for Estonia's security.    His Russian counterpart quoted data at the press conference  that only some 1,600 of the 10,000 retired Russian military in  Estonia were under 50 years of age.    "The overwhelming majority of them simply want to live their  lives to the end peacefully, and we are asking our Estonian  partners -- let's provide them the possibility to do this,"  Svirin said.    Both heads of delegations said the countries despite  everything had no plans to break off the talks.    Reinart told BNS Estonia had taken the issue of breaking off  the talks "off from the agenda". The country after the 17th  round considered suspending the negotiations or changing the  set-up of its delegation.    At the same time Reinart added that Estonia continued to  deliberate the possibility of calling in mediators. The head of  the Russian delegation in his comments said his country was not  opposed to the prospect of mediation by a third party, but added  that in such a case the talks would no longer be bilateral.    The Estonian delegation proposed to convene for the next  round of the talks in Tallinn in May, and expressed hope that  Russia then would agree to discuss issues that are not in  contradiction with Estonian legislation.</p>

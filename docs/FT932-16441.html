			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Technology: Matsushita and Sony join forces Matsushita, the world's largest consumer electronics company, is launching a high-definition laser disc player which it is procuring from rival Sony in its first Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) agreement. The deal, in which Sony will supply Matsushita with a high-definition laser disc player, will be the first time Matsushita has marketed a product purchased in its entirety from Sony. Under an OEM agreement a manufacturer buys a product from another manufacturer and markets that product under its own brand name. It represents a significant shift in the strategy of Matsushita, which has competed fiercely with Sony. The deal also highlights the growing trend among consumer electronics companies to procure products through OEM deals, so that they can focus their energies on areas where they have an edge over other manufacturers or which are more profitable. 'Given (our) limited resources, we decided it was better to buy this product from Sony,' Matsushita said. Electronics companies must invest in R&amp;D in a wide range of areas, the company explained. In order to bring products to the market swiftly, Matsushita concluded it would be better to co-operate with other manufacturers, rather than doing everything on its own. Supplying products to the market through OEM agreements enables manufacturers to continue supplying consumers with a wide product range without having to manufacture everything themselves, which can be a costly and unprofitable. Hitachi has also been considering buying low-cost PCs on an OEM basis with IBM. The high price of developing new technologies has brought more consumer electronics companies together in an attempt to avoid another costly standards war. The new laser disc player to be launched by Matsushita, for example, is based on a standard agreed by five of Japan's leading consumer electronics manufacturers - Matsushita, Pioneer, Sanyo, Sony and Toshiba. In addition to the high-definition laser disc player, Matsushita also announced the launch of a high-definition televison priced at Y980,000 (Pounds 5,700), one of the lowest in the market. However, the company acknowledges that it faces a dilemma. In order for the market to grow prices must fall significantly. But it would rather not see prices fall rapidly, as prices of consumer electronics products have tended to in the industry's recent history, as this would prevent it from being able to recoup investment costs in HDTV over 20 years.</p>

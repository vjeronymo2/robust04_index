The document mentions that citizenship is a necessary attribute  of the republic's sovereignty. Starting with February 15th  1994, posts of leaders of state bodies, enterprises,  institutions and organizations can only be granted to persons  having Dniester citizenship. These stipulations of the decree  also concern state functionaries. Leaders not pursuing to the  document will be fired, the document states. Minister and  departments are obliged to present until February 20th  information on the decree's fulfillment.

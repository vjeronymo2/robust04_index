			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the circumstances of a  near collision of a Continental Airlines jet and a small plane near Orange  County's John Wayne Airport. The jetliner, with 132 passengers aboard, swerved  to avoid the small aircraft, which apparently crossed into its flight path  moments after takeoff, said Jack Doyle, an FAA regional duty officer.  Continental Flight 176 came within 100 feet of the single-engine Bonanza, which  had just taken off from an adjacent runway. Doyle said the pilot of the small  plane was told by air traffic controllers to turn left after takeoff, but  instead turned right, crossing the Boeing 737 jetliner's flight path. The pilot  of the airliner had to turn to avoid hitting the smaller plane, Doyle said.  </P></p>

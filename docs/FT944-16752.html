			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Loyalty of readers to newspapers is questioned Newspaper readers are far less loyal to individual titles than previously thought, Taylor Nelson AGB, the market research group, said. Even before steep cuts in the prices of The Sun and The Times there was far more movement in newspaper readership than previously supposed, said the group. 'Far from newspapers being a stable market, it is highly turbulent,' Mr Stephan Buck, a director of Taylor Nelson AGB, said yesterday. The company surveyed loyal newspaper readers in June last year, before the price war started, and in March this year. The Daily Telegraph and Daily Mirror both gained 15 per cent of new loyal readers over the period, but lost 24 per cent. The cut-price Times lost 35 per cent of its previously loyal readers but gained 64 per cent, giving a net increase of 29 per cent in the period. Mr Buck believes that, even though official Audit Bureau of Circulation and National Readership Survey figures might show no significant net gains or losses, newspapers could still lose and gain about 20 per cent of their 'loyal' readership in a year. 'No wonder heavy price-cutting brought in significant numbers of new regular purchasers, just as it would in any other fast-moving consumer goods market,' Mr Buck said. The research was based on the Taylor Nelson AGB Mediaspan system which regularly monitors the purchases of a panel of 8,500 households. A different project by RSGB, part of Taylor Nelson AGB, found the highest level of readership commitment was to The Guardian and the lowest broadsheet commitment was to The Independent and The Times. Healds, the convenience-store chain in north-west England, is selling newspapers at half price until Christmas.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Greg Knowler: ``SADF Steps Up AIDS Education in </F> Natal'']    [Text] DURBAN--The South African Defence Force  [SADF] is stepping up its Aids awareness campaign among Zululand  troops amid fears that the disease is rapidly spreading south  from Mozambique.    In a recent screening of 600 applicants to the Kwazulu  Police  in Empangeni, A Durban laboratory tested 54 as HIV positive.    A doctor involved in the testing estimated that the number  of  people infected with the virus would increase the closer one  came to the Mozambique border.    A doctor working at a clinic in Zululand said one in three  of  the soldiers he treated for sexually transmitted diseases was  HIV positive.    ``It is horrific what is really happening and the government  is not prepared to discuss the problem,'' the doctor said.    He estimated that 8 percent of the population in the  Matubatuba area, mainly those in 18 to 28 age groups, was HIV  positive and this was developing into ``a massive problem''.    The SADF Medical Service has stepped up its Aids awareness  campaign, which began in 1988.    Medical staff director of the SADF Medical Service, Ken  Ingham, was reluctant to give exact figures of HIV positive  cases in affected units in Zululand, but said they were not as  high as those in the surrounding population.    Brigadier Ingham said soldiers had limited access to the  public, usually only on weekend passes, and this was why the  number of HIV soldiers was lower than in the surrounding  population.    ``That's because soldiers get AIDS from civilians, not from  other soldiers,''Brigadier Ingham said.    He said the campaign was working better in the army than in  the community because ``no-one can force members of the public  to listen''    Northern Zululand is recognised by Aids researchers as ``One  of the worst areas in the country'' and the HIV virus is  spreading rapidly. Doctors say there is a lot of cross-border  movement between South Africa and Mozambique and the virus is  being brought south.</p>

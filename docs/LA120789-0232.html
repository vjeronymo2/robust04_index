			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> ROCK SINGER CHARGED AFTER ACT  </P> <P> A heavy-metal rock singer was charged with killing a chicken on stage and  simulating a lewd act with the carcass during the song "Voodoo Chile."  </P> <P> Police said the incident was so disgusting that some members of the audience  helped them gather evidence against the singer, Charles (Chip) Owen, 25, of the  Popcycle Love Sponge band.  </P> <P> The rock singer's lawyer said the chicken was already dead and that the act was  only "suggestive" of a sex act but Owen was charged with felony animal cruelty  and three misdemeanor sex charges.  </P> <P> "I've seen a lot of bands but this is the sickest thing I've ever seen," said  Lance Brown, 21, a security guard at the Phoenix Theater.  </P> <P> The incident allegedly occurred early Saturday while Owen and his band were  performing a Jimi Hendrix song, "Voodoo Chile," at a theater before an audience  of about 60 people.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Regarding the APA, EPA continues to believe that even if EPA's findings of failure to submit and incompleteness were subject to rulemaking procedures under the APA, the good cause exception applies to such findings for the reasons discussed above. It would not be practicable to subject every completeness review to notice and comment because of the limited time afforded by the statute. It would also not be in the public's interest because it would impose a tremendous burden on the Agency and divert resources from more important substantive SIP reviews. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the consistency comment, EPA believes that it is adhering to the notice-and-comment provisions of the amended Act and the APA. Where it is appropriate, because the determination requires EPA judgment, EPA provides for notice and comment (i.e., for SIP disapprovals or findings of nonimplementation). Additionally, as EPA has done via this action, when EPA makes a sanction selection notice and comment are also provided. On the other hand, as discussed above, in other cases sufficient time does not exist to provide for notice and comment and the determinations themselves require little, if any, judgment. Finally, as discussed in section II.C.3., the final rule does not cover findings of substantial inadequacy under section 110(k)(5) for part D SIP's (so-called SIP calls), which were covered by the proposed rule, because of concerns about adequate notice and comment before sanctions are applied for State failure to respond to a SIP call. The EPA intends to develop an alternative approach for applying mandatory sanctions for State failure to respond to SIP calls that provides for notice and comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> PM&hyph;10 Waivers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The proposal did not address the PM&hyph;10 waiver provisions in section 188(f) of the Act. The commenter expresses a frustration with the definition of PM&hyph;10 ``significance'' and argues that in the West, PM&hyph;10 levels above the standard are caused predominately by fugitive dust and mobile sources. Therefore, the commenter believes, applying 2-to-1 offsets to industrial sources will have a negligible effect on PM&hyph;10 24-hour concentrations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A July 1992 draft addendum to the General Preamble (57 FR 31477, July 16, 1992) addresses several waiver policy issues, including significance levels. The EPA believes the comment period for that policy, rather than this action selecting sanctions, is the appropriate forum for comments on that issue. The EPA recognizes that in some nonattainment areas industrial sources may be less significant contributors. In those cases, EPA may decide to apply the highway sanction first, which this rule provides flexibility to do. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Summary of Changes in Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Section 52.31(a)_Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 52.31(a) sets forth the purpose of this rulemaking, which is to establish the sequence of sanctions required to apply under section 179(a). The substance of this provision was not changed from the proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Section 52.31(b)_Definitions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 52.31(b) sets forth the definitions applicable under 40 CFR 52.31. The definitions of ``Act'' and ``1990 Amendments'' are not substantively changed. However, the citations for these two definitions were inadvertently switched and they now correctly provide that the Act is located at 42 U.S.C. et seq. and the 1990 Amendments were set forth in Public Law 101&hyph;549. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, several definitions were added. Since the regulation provides that the offset sanction only applies to the pollutant(s) that the finding concerns and its precursors, EPA has added a definition of ``precursors.'' The EPA has also added a definition of ``ozone precursors'' which specifically identifies the two ozone precursors_VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA has added a new definition for ``affected area.'' This term, while used in the proposed rule (e.g., the tables), was not previously defined. Furthermore, its usage in the final rule has been expanded; in many places the word ``area'' has now been replaced by ``affected area.'' The definition provides that an ``affected area'' is the geographic area subject to or covered by the Act requirement that is the subject of the finding and either, for purposes of the offset and highway sanctions, is or is within an area designated nonattainment area pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 7407(d) or, for purposes of the offset sanction, is or is within an area otherwise subject to the emission offset requirements of 42 U.S.C. 7503. As used in this rule, in conjunction with &sect;52.31(e) (1) and (2), the affected area is the area potentially subject to a sanction based on a finding. The new definition clarifies that the sanction applies to the geographic area subject to or covered by the requirement at issue in the finding. This will usually be the entire designated area, but in some instances may be a portion of a designated area. This point is made through the first portion of the definition. Moreover, since the affected area is the area in which a sanction applies, it was necessary to limit the definition to those areas that could be subject to a sanction. Therefore, the second portion of the definition restricts the definition of ``affected area'' by incorporating the geographic limits of the highway and offset sanctions. First, the highway sanction, as applied under section 179(a), is limited to nonattainment areas, since section 179(b)(1) provides that the highway sanction may be ``applicable to a nonattainment area.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 34 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Second, by its terms, the offset sanction has effect only in those areas in which the offset requirements of section 173 are required to apply. (See 59 FR 1480 (January 11, 1994) for a further discussion of the geographic applicability of section 179(b) sanctions.) This includes all nonattainment areas. In addition, some attainment and unclassified areas (e.g., those located in the NOTR could be subject to the offset sanction, since those areas may be subject to the offset requirements of section 173, even though they are not designated nonattainment (see section 184, for example). Therefore, the second clause of the definition limits affected areas to nonattainment areas (which would be subject to both the highway and offset sanction) and areas otherwise subject to the emission offset requirements of section 173 (which would be subject to the offset sanctions). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 34 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 171(2) defines ``nonattainment area'' as ``an area which is designated `nonattainment' with respect to (an air) pollutant within the meaning of section 107(d).'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

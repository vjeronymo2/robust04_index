			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / International Company News: SME shares suspended as rumours spark rally SHARES in SME, the Italian foods, retailing and catering group controlled by the IRI state holding company, were suspended yesterday after sharp fluctuations in recent days on rumours it might be privatised. The movements in SME's stock, which surged 5.8 per cent to L4,738 on Monday, prompted Consob, Italy's companies and stock market watchdog, to demand a suspension pending clarification within the day. Yesterday evening, IRI, which owns 62 per cent of SME, denied the conclusion of any negotiations on the sale of all or part of its stake, or on the disposal of any SME subsidiaries. In a separate letter to Consob, SME confirmed that negotiations on disposals were limited to its sweets division. The activities concerned are already run as joint ventures with private-sector companies. Following the information, Consob said trading in SME's stock would resume today. However, the denials are unlikely to deflate speculation about the group's fate. SME, which made net profits of L42.8bn (Dollars 34m) on sales of L2,961bn in the first half of this year, is one of Italy's most attractive privatisation candidates. The group controls GS, a leading supermarket chain, while its food production division owns a number of familiar branded products, such as Bertolli vegetable oils and Cirio tinned vegetables. SME's Italgel frozen foods division has also been regularly courted by leading multinationals in the sector. Last weekend, Ferruzzi, the private sector agro-industrial group, entered the fray following comments by Mr Carlo Sama, a senior executive, that it would be interested in acquiring some of SME's brands. There have also been rumours of a takeover, possibly engineered by Mr Raul Gardini, the former Ferruzzi head.</p>

			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SANTA CLARITA ASKS RESIDENTS TO HELP DEFEAT LANDFILL PLAN;  </P> <P> ELSMERE CANYON: A NEWSPAPER AD URGES RESIDENTS TO LOBBY STATE LEGISLATORS  AGAINST THE DUMP, WHICH WOULD BE A MILE OUTSIDE THE CITY.  </P> <P> The Santa Clarita City Council, which had once cautiously refrained from  publicly opposing the proposed Elsmere Canyon landfill, has embarked on a  high-profile campaign to rally residents against the dump, which would be  located a mile outside the city limits.  </P> <P> Santa Clarita launched the campaign Sunday with a full-page newspaper  advertisement urging residents to lobby state legislators to support Senate  Bill 2139 by state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita), which would make it more  difficult for the city and county of Los Angeles to build a dump in Elsmere  Canyon.  </P> <P> The ad featured a letter, signed by Mayor Jo Anne Darcy, that was sent to more  than 500 civic groups, clubs and homeowner associations.  </P> <P> "The opposition is formidable and is led by a group of powerful landfill  proponents including the Elsmere Canyon Corp. (BKK Corp.), City and County of  Los Angeles and the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts," the letter said.  </P> <P> This powerful block of pro-dump interests, the letter said, has repeatedly  ignored the concerns of Santa Clarita residents, who say the landfill could  pollute air and ground water and generally destroy the quality of life in the  Santa Clarita Valley.  </P> <P> "Without SB 2139," the ad said, "the special interests led by the City Council  of Los Angeles and County Board of Supervisors will continue to move  aggressively to develop the Elsmere landfill. The Citizens of Santa Clarita  must unite to stop this landfill."  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council and County Board of Supervisors have approved an  agreement that would allow the two governments to operate a dump in Elsmere  Canyon, pending an environmental review of the project. The dump would be in  unincorporated territory a mile east of the Antelope Valley Freeway.  </P> <P> The issue has put Darcy, an aide to Supervisor Mike Antonovich, at odds with  her boss, who supports the landfill.  </P> <P> The Davis bill would give the state's Integrated Waste Management Board the  authority to prohibit the city and county of Los Angeles from opening a dump in  Elsmere Canyon if the two governments fail to comply with a new state law that  requires every county to create by 1992 a comprehensive plan to dispose of and  recycle garbage.  </P> <P> The bill would also ensure state review of plans for the Elsmere Canyon  landfill, according to Hunt Braly, a Davis aide. The city and county of Los  Angeles are "full bore against" the bill and have begun lobbying against it,  Braly said.  </P> <P> Even so, the bill was passed by the Senate on May 24 on a 21-13 vote, the  minimum amount needed to pass. The bill is in the Assembly Committee on Natural  Resources, and Santa Clarita's lobbying effort is geared toward influencing the  13 members of the committee. "If everyone would write letters, we would make  quite an impression," Darcy said.  </P> <P> The Assembly committee has scheduled a hearing on the bill June 25. The ad  includes a Capitol address and telephone numbers of all committee members.  </P> <P> The Santa Clarita council had refused to oppose the dump for more than a year,  saying it did not want to jeopardize its legal standing to fight the dump in  court by criticizing the project before the environmental impact report was  completed.  </P> <P> The council even rebuffed the pleas of the Elsmere Canyon Preservation  Committee, a citizens group that last fall collected more than 1,600 signatures  on petitions urging the council to drop its neutral stance and fight the dump.  </P> <P> But after the Board of Supervisors and the Los Angeles City Council tentatively  approved the dump agreement in the winter, the Santa Clarita City Council voted  Feb. 13 to oppose the plan. The city-county agreement was made before the  environmental impact report was completed, thus giving Santa Clarita grounds to  fight the dump immediately, Darcy said.  </P></p>

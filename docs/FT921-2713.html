			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: BP negotiating Azeri oil deal BRITISH Petroleum is negotiating with Azerineft, Azerbaijan's state oil company, to develop a major offshore oilfield in the Caspian Sea, Mr Ali-Zade Sanan, Azerineft's president said. Mr Ali-Zade said the two companies could reach an agreement on production-sharing by the end of the year. The field is believed to be the Capaz field close to the Turkmenian part of the Caspian Sea. BP said it was currently pursuing a number of opportunities in the region, but that it was too early to comment on any of them. The company is involved with a consortium headed by Amoco, the US oil major, which has been awarded a feasibility study for the Azeri field in the Caspian Sea. Mr Ali-Zade said the other field over which BP was in discussions had similar potential to the Azeri development which could cost between Dollars 3bn and Dollars 5bn. Mr Ali-Zade said that the Azeri field was still on course for development in spite of political disturbances. The Azeri project is a joint venture, but Mr Ali-Zade said BP's new discussions are centred on production-sharing arrangements. A month ago, Elf Aquitaine, the French oil company, became the first western oil firm to sign a production-sharing arrangement with the Russian government. The company followed it with a similar agreement with the government of Kazakhstan.</p>
